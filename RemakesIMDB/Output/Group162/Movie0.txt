		<shortDescription>An American Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There must be a million woman like Gloria. They never got educated but they're smart. They're good looking, but not enough to get that gangster boyfriend to leave his wife. They hostess or maybe they just are table dressing for as long as they can. They make enough to have a decent apartment, and they hock the gift jewelry and furs and stick the money in a safe deposit box for the day they just can't do it any more. Can't smile and nod and be sweet, and the goombas look to the younger girls for attention. They try to keep quiet and keep their nose clean and ignore the young punks that treat them a little worse every year.But life can mess up your plans, as it does for Gloria when it dumps an orphaned kid in her lap and some of her p***ed gangster pals at her door. And the decision she makes to save the kid's life means she can never go back."Gloria" isn't really about stuff like violence or mobsters or guns at all. It's about the hopes and wishes and loneliness of a life that represents the lives of many invisible woman. Gloria has always been a "broad" as she says. Never the Madonna, to be worshipped and respected. Always the Whore to be stepped on. And it sucks to be at the mercy and whim of men. Especially cruel, stupid thugs who don't have the brains or guts to do anything but lie, cheat, steal, and kill women and children.Gloria reluctantly gives up her old life. She gave years of her life to these slobs and she doesn't want to lose the little she got for her troubles. She just wants peace and quiet and to be left alone. Why give it up to help some annoying kid?But when she makes the decision to do just that, her rage and resentment explode.Gena Rowlands gives a flawless performance that burns bright and makes the viewer feel the rage of those who hide their intelligence and personality and try to "get by" in a world of lesser men. Gloria's got more balls and brains than any of the suits that run the racket. And now she's going to prove it."Gloria" is what happens when adults make movies for adults. No childish chatter, no idealized and airbrushed world, no moralizing and preaching. This movie has blood in its veins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this on TV once and was blown away by its energy and spontaneity. Gena Rowlands is as good in it as everyone says, with some real surprises. The point about the kid coming out with "grown up" mock-heroic phrases at some points is that he's picked all that stuff up from the movies and listening to his parents' gangster friends. It's supposed to be funny - he keeps shouting "I'm the Man" when he patently isn't.The movie takes action/gangster movie genre conventions by the scruff of the neck and shakes them till interesting stuff falls out. The editing and cinematography are great. New York looks gritty but beautiful.True the film is kind of rough round the edges, I guess down to Cassavetes' improvisatory style, however it's a lot more accessible than most of his work and you should see it if you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gena Rowlands would kick Sharon Stone's butt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the remake of GLORIA yet, and needless to say, I'm not looking forward to it. Not to say that Sharon Stone can't play a tough female, who's self-imposed as a bodyguard for a kid running from mobsters. It is just that Gena Rowlands is so much more versatile, and her range so much wider, and I just KNOW that Stone won't be able to cut it. So, I will stop speculating, and get to the facts.GLORIA is a film that Cassavete's made as an antidote to brainless, violent action films. All of the violence has dramatic purpose, and nothing is pointless here. This may be off-putting to fans of the action genre, but Cassavetes' contempt for the genre is what makes GLORIA more interesting. There are several unexpected twists.When the film begins, Gloria is a street-smart woman who is kind of "married" to the mob. Gloria has a tomboyish quality that lends credibility to the fact that she has lived this long. She looks out for herself, first and foremost.This changes when a weasel, and friend,of Gloria's (Buck Henry) is murdered by her mobster friends. Henry and his wife are killed, leaving behind a scared child. The little boy is a witness to the murder, and the mobsters make chase.Gloria feels her maternal instincts begin to take over, and begrudgingly protects the boy. As the film progresses, however, she becomes more sincere in her protection, and she draws the line further for the mobsters. She has survived in the harsh city for this long, so it is easy to assume that she knows how to stay alive.GLORIA is by no means Cassavete best film. There are long stretches that test your patience, that can sometimes seem static. But, as much as I dislike this quality, I am familiar with several Cassavetes' films, and understand what he is trying to achieve. Cassavetes is a very emotional director. He doesn't focus on tragedy; he is more interested in survival and the baggage that that brings. GLORIA is a thinking-person's thriller, and if you prefer big explosions and high body-counts, go and see DIE HARD 2 again. But, if you want to see something different, check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all times. Gena Rowlands is a powerhouse actor in this gutsy film about survival, courage and compassion set in the fast-paced, gritty New York City of the 70s. The acting all-around is exceptional. The film is riveting from beginning to end. You get swept up in Gloria's dilemma right away. The scene where she has to decide whether to save herself and turn the kid over to his assassins is very believable as you can see and feel how desperate one would be in such a dire situation. Another great scene is at a Penn Station coffee shop where she confronts the stalking mobsters at a nearby table. You can hear a pin drop in that restaurant as she stands there saying, "I'm Gloria. My hand is on my gun in my purse!" Yet another great scene is the crowded subway where she literally throws punches with one of the mobsters who has caught up with her. Everyone in that graffiti-laden subway car presses against the walls trying to get away when Gloria pulls her gun. She says as she gets off: "Ya punk! Ya Punk. Ya let a sissy beat you, huh? You punk! Go ahead, punk!." Then the subway car closes and she and the kid get away yet again. So, get lots of popcorn, turn off the phones and curl up in bed with the lights off for this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's cinematography and musical score captures the seedy underbelly of 1970's New York City in the same way "Taxi Driver" and "The French Connection" do. Gloria takes on the mob after they murder her friend's family and seek out the little boy who Gloria helped escape his families execution and who hold's a valuable item. The unlikely pair weave through the streets of NYC until they figure out what to do. Some great Stylistic suspense throughout. Directed and written by the late John Cassavetes. Don't waste your time on Sharon Stone's remake - this is the one to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the title character in 'Gloria' Gena Rowlands gives a subtle yet powerful performance which gives this John Cassavettes film its soul and its focal point.On the advent of Sharon Stone's re-characterization of 'Gloria' in the 1999 Sidney Lumet re-make it bares mentioning that while Ms. Stone is wonderfully talented the passionate yet understated performance that Gena Rowlands gives in the original can't &amp; won't be topped.As a woman confronted with a life or death decision, to save her own or that of a child orphaned by the mafia, Ms. Rowlands brings us a character that we can all relate to, a woman caught at the crossroads of her life.If you've ever had to make any sort of 'Should I stay or should I go' life changing desicion and you're thinking of seeing the current re-make I encourage you to rent the original as well, you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He Don't Even Speak English..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A genre-bending odyssey, full of dank, dark alleys, filthy side streets, buses, taxi cabs, trains and subways, John Cassavetes' film "Gloria" is perhaps the most impersonal of his personal work, which surely inspired Luc Besson's 1994 action-packed "Leon," the film explores the development of the mother-son bond under extreme circumstances.One of Gena Rowland's most underrated performances, Gloria stands shoulder to shoulder with other iconic heroines of American cinema; such as Dietrich's Shanghai Lily and Uma Thurman's Beatrix Kiddo.Cassavetes explores new narrative possibilities unlike any other of his contemporaries. Though there always seems to be a surplus of emotion, dialogue or trivialities in his work - and I'm not the first to make such an observation - Cassavetes maintains his focus, which is of course, to show us a slice of life, however extreme or crazy it may appear to an audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was favorably impressed; certainly outdoes -Leon-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tastes may vary on this one, but there's much about this film that's endearing to viewers. It strikes you that the story isn't exactly the only of its kind (I see it as a precursor to -Leon- and probably takes cues from the delightful -Paper Moon-, but others of its "kind" are hard to think of), but it's about as well-done as you might expect. Some may not care for the Cassavetes stylistic touches, but here they are not especially intrusive. Gloria's a tough and likeable "bitch" with a moral compass, rightfully the center of the story. It outdoes -Leon- by not investing too much script capital in "developing" the child character. (It was primarily that aspect of -Leon- that annoyed me most.) This is straightforward, without the frills and gimmicks, emotional or otherwise. I do plan on watching the recent version with Sharon Stone, but don't expect to be as satisfied as with this.I'd give it a minimum of 7/10 on my own, tough scale. I am surprised this is so little-known compared to -Leon-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent example of modern movie noir and easily director John Cassavetes' most accessible and cohesive film. Gena Rowlands is a tough as nails gangster's moll who "inherits" a young boy after her neighbors are executed in a mob hit. Rowlands gives one of her most ferocious performances and for once Cassavetes' direction is straightforward enough to keep the pace going. It's dynamite movie making! As the boy, John Adames is suitably appealing and, as expected in a Cassavetes film, he's extremely natural. GLORIA is a great movie. With the unlikely team of Julie Carmen and Buck Henry as the boy's parents.Avoid the 1999 Sidney Lumet/Sharon Stone remake at all costs! It's dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Realist Perspective on a Conventional Formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You start with flinty, streetsmart gangster types, cross their paths with a little kid, put them in urban peril, and then you squeeze how things stack up for sentimentality, suspense and humor. It's a charming idea, and perhaps that's why this could be considered John Cassavetes's most conventional film. It tells the story of a gangster's girlfriend who goes on the run with a young boy who is being pursued by the mob for information he doesn't even know he might have. But he wants to tell the story his own way, obstructing every convention we would normally expect, instilling a realist perspective in how we follow the movie, making the pay-off that much more worthwhile. Cassavetes didn't intend to direct his script. He just wanted to sell the story to Columbia Pictures. But once his wife Gena Rowlands was asked to play Gloria, she obliged Cassavetes to direct it.This underdog crime drama is particularly absorbing in its first hour, and ignites with a great beginning. We follow one character, it leads to another character, perspectives are interknit, the situation builds and Cassavetes has complete control over what we know and expect, all in spite of the all-too-familiar premise, which is then set for the rest of the movie, which is a cat-and-mouse hunt per the seedier locales of New York and New Jersey. He makes the threat so real that when the two key characters evade tangible danger, we still feel the tension whenever they round a corner, get in and out of cabs, and other such ordinary actions. He doesn't let on that unwanted company is present. It just happens. There is one scene that lasts for quite awhile before we realize, after Rowlands's title character does, that unwanted company has been there the entire time.In an Oscar-nominated performance, Rowlands is expectedly the beautiful lead actress, but she sports a kind of masculine quality, creating a much more dense dynamic when she, afraid of her maternal instincts, finds them overpowering her lifelong self-preservation, and begrudgingly protects the boy. As the film progresses, however, she becomes more sincere in her protection, and integrates her love with her seasoned familiarity with how to stay alive in this town. In one creative take on the Fine, I Don't Need You Anyway scene, she asks a bartender, "There's reasons I can't turn and just look, but is there a little kid headed in here or across the street or whatever?" She drives her role with such honest irritable liveliness. Yet the kid is also well cast. He was a conspicuous little boy named John Adames with dark hair, big eyes and a way of trucking his dialogue as if confronting you to adjust a single word. It all works because everything about his character, the way he dresses, talks, revolts and moves, serves the naive notion that he is older, smarter and cooler than he is.Cassavetes has a natural keenness for guilelessly unadorned location shooting in that he never plans, stages, waits on the weather or time of day, or hires extras or stunt drivers. Note how passers-by in the distance will often look on at the characters, whether Gloria has pulled a gun in a public place or not. Wherever the characters need to be, that place is in real time, as dirty, scuzzy and purely of the film's era as it would've normally been. There's a shabby flophouse where the clerk tells Gloria, "Just pick a room. They're all open." There are bus stations, back alleys, dimly lit hallways, and bars that open at dawn. And his occasional action scenes are so thrilling because of their surprise.For once, Cassavetes doesn't stage indefinitely extensive scenes of dialogue wherein the actors indulge in their own view of their characters' unraveling. But I miss that. As I've already said, I am very impressed with how tightly he mounts suspense from the very beginning, how Gloria and the kid zip from cab to bus to cab to street to hotel to cab and so on. But regardless of how doggedly realistic he is in his portrayal of a recycled movie plot, he still relies upon that plot rather than the impositions of his characters flexing their wings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect picture of NYC in 1980</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its buildings, to its busy streets. From the people in the city, to the culture that created it, John Cassavetes perfectly captures the true essence of NYC. The true grit of the city, the core of the apple. The setting of the film is real. Unlike the remake almost twenty years later, NYC does not look like a commercial Disney Land without Mickey. Watching the film, you can smell the dirty hallways in the lower middle class hotels. You can hear the crowded Hispanic neighborhoods. And you can see what NYC is really like in Gloria.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't relate the storyline - it's all over the place here. Just trust me on this: GLORIA is a wonderful modern noir, full of kicks and energy and schtick. It belongs to its time and its setting - the 'not nice', hot, sweaty NYC of the late 70's - as much as any great Warner Bros. classic. And Gena Rowlands...oh, my. As with many a classic, there are flaws all over the place, from the murdering of the family in the beginning - dad and mom know what's going to happen and everybody just hangs around, tense and fearful? - to the adorable boy's fairly wretched performance. Doesn't matter. Rowlands takes this flick, straps it on her back, and runs. She is nothing short of sensational, as she was as well a brilliant actress. Too bad she limited herself to (mostly) her husband's films. But, they gave us this. And, if you need to learn how to ride a subway with attitude, order a cold beer, or treat a cabbie, watch and learn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was six years old when I saw the preview of Gloria. I was living in New York at that time the movie came out. I've enjoyed Gena Rowlands role as the tough as nails gun moll Gloria. She had to learn three important factors of life: trust, responsibility, and promise. The real factor was promise, even though she was reluctant to care for the orphaned son. Gloria was sort of to me the "female punisher". Since I know my home state(N.Y.) very well, this movie was an all out no-brainer I would be a tour guide right now. I've seen the remake by Sharon Stone, and it was a dud. I waited a few years later to see the original, and it was worth my while, and I think the mob should know better than to mess with Gloria, Period. When you look at the barrel of a loaded gun, BANG! BANG! YOU'RE GOOD AS DEAD!!!!! GLORIA(1980) 6 BANGS! GLORIA(1999) POOF!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood ending or not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No American movie so ambivalent as Gloria. Is it a good movie or a bad? Frankly, I just don't know. I saw this film as part of a series of classic movies in a Dutch cinema. New copy! the ad said and I never saw the movie from beginning to end. Reason enough to go. Speaking about the end... It did disappoint me a lot. After watching Gena walking on high heals through New York for two hours, Cassavetes surprises me with this terrible Hollywood ending! But after reading some of the comments on IMDb I rather give it a second thought. So Cassavetes shot the end of Gloria in black and white? I didn't know that. It makes a difference. Why the hell would Gloria come to the cemetery in a mob car in stead of just a regular cab? And why dressed up as the boy's grandmother? It must be the imagination of the boy. That's why the boy runs in slow motion (and in black and white) to Gloria. Running towards a certain death that is! Cassavetes said in a interview that he didn't want the boy shot in pieces at the end of the movie, but that doesn't mean the boy will survive! So, maybe Cassavetes didn't make a Hollywood ending after all. Let's give Gloria the benefit of the doubt. It's a good movie, worth remembering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cassavetes scores a bullseye with this wonderfully gritty crime drama. Shot when New York City was still a seedy mess before the beginning of, at least in part, its renewal the film has a very noirish grungy feel that add immeasurably to the power of its impact. There are no lovely shots of Central Park or sweeping buildings, you can feel the grime and closeness of the city moving in on Gloria and her young charge. That's all fine and dandy but what makes this story go, and the film would be nothing without her, is the magnificent Gena Rowlands in a diamond hard characterization of a been around gun moll who has absolutely no problem doing whatever is necessary to maintain her safety and that of the young boy whose care she has unexpectedly become responsible for. Always a superior talent she is simply amazing in this. The film itself is entertaining but watch this to see one of the most talented actresses ever ply her trade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky Crime Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gena Rowlands is Gloria, a friend of the mob in New York City. She lives in a shabby Bronx apartment house and is entertaining the six-year-old son of a neighboring family, John Adames, when the rest of the family -- a miscast Buck Henry as an FBI informant, his succulent Puerto Rican wife, their daughter, and their wizened abuelita -- are blown away by the goon squad. They need to kill Adames too. Those are the rules.The uncertain and somewhat guilty Rowlands, who hates kids, takes off with him. They are pursued from hotel to hotel, from train station to subway, by hit men. Gloria is a tough babe, though, and is always quickest on the draw, though rarely more than one step ahead of her executioners.It's hardly an unfamiliar armature. An urban person who has no use for children is suddenly saddled with one and must take care of him or her. In the course of many tribulations, they bond. The now-humanized rogue rides into the sunset with his new companion. Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid" is one of the more entertaining examples.This film, though, was directed by John Cassavetes, famous for his mostly improvised and impeccably dull slices of life. Please, God -- no more Zorbas.This is Cassavetes' most structured and conventional movie and, like Orson Welles' "The Stranger," it mostly succeeds in its attempted mixture of poetry and commercialism.Let me get the weaknesses out of the way. First of all, the Mafia not only want to blow away Buck Henry and his family; they also want the black notebook he's been keeping, the one labeled "MacGuffin." And Henry gives the book to his little BOY and tells him to keep it? Why? Almost all of the dialog sounds written and rehearsed but some is clearly made up on the spot. The impromptu lines come from the kid, which is a shame. It's bad enough that little Adames can't act, but for Cassavetes to urge him to improvise dialog almost turns into child abuse, especially when it comes out like, "Good-bye, you sucker, you little insect." And Buck Henry as the terrified family man about to squeal on the Mafia. How did he get the role? And the climactic scene has Adames running -- in slow motion -- towards an open-armed Rowland while the score tells us this is a happy ending, just in case we missed it.So much for the bad stuff. The rest is quirky -- and I don't mean that negatively. I'll just give examples from two scenes.(1) The mob shows up at Buck Henry's apartment and the halls echo with shotgun blasts. (Cassavetes doesn't show us the killings, just the family sitting around waiting to be slaughtered.) Now, in an "ordinary" action movie, the echoes would no sooner have died down than we would hear police sirens in the background. Not here. The hoods take their time poking around Henry's apartment while looking for the little black book. No hurry, folks. The police response time here is geared to reality, not to movie conventions.(2) Gloria barely manages to sneak out of another apartment house with the kid and the MacGuffin and must make a quick escape before the hit men reach her. In most movies, the pursued runs into the street, yells "Taxi!", and a cab screeches to an immediate halt in front of him. Or maybe there's one already waiting at the curb. Here, she calls out furiously and waves her hand and the taxis whiz by as they do in real life.Adames is no actor, as I've said, but at least he's not cute in any stereotypical way. And he never cries. The sentimentality is kept within reasonable bounds. Gena Rowlands is aging but still beautiful, even when cheaply made up and wearing sleazy pleated skirts and jackets that look like some kind of polyester or fake silk. She's thoroughly deglamorized, as she should be -- not old, but worn and a little frayed around the edges like a library book that has been checked out often. In the bad old days, Barbara Stanwyck could have waltzed through this part.Rowlands is from Wisconsin, though, and it shows in her speech. ("Cooled" instead of "cold.") It doesn't sound right when she attempts a New York accent but it doesn't exactly sound wrong either. It's kind of like a comfortable Mid-western pasture that's been littered with garbage and flaps of raggedy paper and planted with graffiti-laden signs.Boy, did Cassavetes have an eye for locations. Who else would have shot a scene of Newark's Penn Station IN Newark's Penn Station? The place isn't appallingly seedy, nor is it as clean and rococo as Moscow. It has nothing like Grand Central's Oyster Bar. It's simply uninteresting.I wish -- come to think of it -- that Cassavetes' script had been a little more taut, more thought-out and convincing, where the central relationship between Rowlands and Adames is concerned. The exchanges alternate between spiteful barbs and little understated caresses and are at no point believable.Still, this is an original work and well worth catching.</fullReview>

The only difference between Gloria and Leon, is that Leon's protagonist was a man, whilst in Gloria it was a woman, and that in Leon, the main protagonist dies in the end, whereas in Gloria she lives.Gena Rowlands, the main actress in Gloria, has a face which reminds me of Jane Curtin (who acts in Third Rock From The Sun)! The boy whom she looks after comes across as a smart aleck who always has something to say about everything. He's not awfully natural in the way he talks though, because his lines may be rather adult-like, but he says them as if he had spent days memorising them and had to regurgitate all of it on the film set! The movie is rife with one-liners which sometimes really come across as cheesy, but some people like watching movies with this type of dialogue, and as I had nothing much to do one night, I had all the time in the world to try and appreciate this late-night movie on TV! I have to say though, that although I initially was quite put off by the cheesy dialogues, Gena Rowland's character began to grow on me and I eventually started to like every single cheesy line that spouted from her gob. She doesn't appear to me to be a terribly "tough-looking" moll though, and its telling because somewhere in the middle of the movie, the boy had to say to her "You're so tough..." - is that an attempt by the director to try and project to us the audience that Gloria really is a toughie, even though she fails to project to us by her own performance and appearance that she really is tough??? I don't know, yet I can see how this movie is destined to belong on those video racks classified as "Cult Classics". Its soundtrack, for one, is very very typical of the era in which the movie was shot. We never get movies which play music like that anymore. This is point one which makes it a possible cult classic. Another point that makes this show a cult classic is the cheesy one-liner Mafia scripts. Surely there's pleasure to be had in enjoying one of these movies every now and then! We can even learn a thing or two! Heh! Third point is the strong feminine gangster character which is the centre of the show. There are probably people out there who love watching movies which feature a strong streetwise heroine as a winner in the end. Other such movies that come to mind include Jackie Brown, Crazy in Alabama... need I say more?I'd recommend this movie for anyone who likes Mafia movies or for those who just love to see a tough gun-yielding woman win the day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waving it all off as dream but staying for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film Cassavetes did for Hollywood bossmen after the debacle of Opening Night. While it is far from his norm - it has music cues and a score, a gangster plot with a few shootouts - aren't we better off that he had the opportunity to go out with a camera that year and not sit around in dismay? Cherish it, he had only one more left.It is his most straightforward and probably written in a haste, crude in spots, about an ex-mafia moll and a little kid running from gangsters around New York. It wouldn't be out of place in a double bill with Don Siegel really, or not that much.It actually casts light on another side of Cassavetes, less talked about. One was of course the visionary swimmer into streams of soul, tossing and turning in search of a true face.. Another was the actor who took odd paying jobs, wearing a variety of faces to finance that vision when he got back, very much like Welles whom he admired. He had done all sorts, many that were crime stuff on and off TV. Adored Cagney.We have deliberate reference of all those gangster films of old here, gumshoes and broads stuff, Rowlands as female Bogart (she calls other women dames), in turns snarling at bad guys and coolly walking away, waving it all off as dream. But this isn't that cocksure type film; this is about dreams, hopes, frayed nerves.The little boy salvaged from a gangster plot is the center that keeps pulling her back, summoning more of her gangster past around her, including finally the lover she never made it with. You can see how in longer Cassavetes form we would have uncertain life as this woman floats around bars and odd rooms and contrasts with being pulled back to a role she left behind, pulled to get out of it. Chinese Bookie comes to mind. That would have been tremendous to see but we have something else. All of the cool stuff are anachronistic at this point, not really draped with a sense of cool, which is a fashion sense. Cassavetes wouldn't know cool from a bar of soap really, lovable dunce that he was, so it comes out on the other side of the familiar posturing in an unselfconscious way.It's all abit like Rowlands' clothing (foisted on her by Cassavetes). That red kimono would have been fabulous in Rita Hayworth times but looks a bit out of place now, odd. Ditto Rowlands' tough expressions, as if propped up with some effort. This is all far from where the likes of Tarantino and Besson, who grew up in movies, would take these things to iron them out. You can watch this and see how that would play out.There's a weariness without sentimentality here that seeps in through an open window somewhere in this room that you've found yourself in for the night. A sense of not having much more time for masks and that whole posturing where you have to be someone. This is tied in that sweet exchange about "beating the system" between her and boy. People usually don't, but maybe some do, who knows? Who really cares about a system?Underneath it all there's a marvelous sense of wandering that I find myself giving into always in movies; it seems we go everywhere in New York. Underneath the worn fabrics, this is one about the (existential) body that must wear them, about weight that doesn't manage to hold you down. The sublime point as ever with Cassavetes is not giving up.</fullReview>

One of Cassavetes more accessible films, with great New York City cinematography. Rowlands received an Oscar nomination for her deft, dead on performance, taking no prisoners with her on her mission to save her newly acquired charge from ending up like his kin folk. Wait until you see her use her gun, and she ain't too bad with her fists either. Gena, as always, makes every movie she's in seem fresh.

If you are a fan of GOODFELLAS, CASINO, THE SOPRANOS, SCARFACE, TRUE ROMANCE,orRESOVOIR DOGS, you'll love this flick. This film shows how even the most calloused, hardened Costa Nostra girl has some strong motherly instinct that kick in when need be. This is one of the few movies to make me tear up at the end. A must see. The remake with Sharon Stone sucks is an insult to the original, btw. Avoid the remake at all costs. Sharon Stone was much too young to play the part, not to mention the acting was horrible, the story too altered and the emotion almost non existent. Trust me. Stick to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appropriately named movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little heard of film should go down as one of the better action movies of the 20th century, due to Gena Rowlands as the title character. Gloria was already a bad ass mama in the very beginning of this film. However, when she has to guard a Puerto Rican boy from the mobsters who slaughtered his parents, she turns up the octane. The catch is that not only is she protecting him, but she is protecting him from her mobster friends, and those friends are now foes.Rowlands has some killer lines, and throughout the movie she is as strong and tough as that lousy acting kid says she is. This woman directly confronts mob guys and stomps on 'em or mows 'em down without blinking! She also has no problem of telling it like it is; very blunt and very strong willed. A standout scene that says it all is in a subway car as she narrowly escapes the mob.Like most movies with this kind of plot, there is an *annoying* little kid that has to be the freakin' focal point. This kid is so bad that he even looked directly into the camera, and it wasn't called for, in the final shot! But director John Cassavettes saw right through this kid's poor performance and let Gena take the show. Screw the remake, recognize this action original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dig this out once a year to watch it and it always gets me. I've been watching this film ever since it came out! The production, including the opening credits, has a foreign feel to it. The opening has watercolor artwork that appears to have been made by a child. The camera sweeps over this while displaying opening credits as jazz music plays.The film takes place in New York City and not the glamorous areas of New York. No, here we see the seedier, gritty, grimy side of New York where children run unsupervised and people are struggling to survive.The acting here is excellent by everyone. Some people say it seems unrealistic and there might be times when that becomes apparent but you can't deny the raw, nervous energy of the film. It's hard to escape the atmosphere here. Gene Rowlands plays her role perfectly and despite her tough as nails attitude you can't help but love her character.Give this a chance. It could become one of your favorite films as it is hard to forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young Phil is the only surviving member of his family after the mob kills his mob accountant father Jack and everybody else. Jack's been stealing from the mob and informing the FBI. The mob is after Jack's book on the mob. Jack sent the book and Phil to their neighbor friend Gloria Swenson (Gena Rowlands). Phil is a brat and Gloria hates kids. They go on the run from the mob as she tries to work out a way to save themselves.This is the classic collaboration between director John Cassavetes and his wife Gena Rowlands. It has his gritty documentary indie style and the rundown NYC setting. The formula is simple. John behind the camera and Gena in front of the camera. That's all anybody needs to know about this movie. Gena just has so much skills portraying this woman. I'm not as kind with the kid but he's just a kid from the neighborhood. He's just too big I AM THE MAN! He has limited skills to play with. The movie can be a bit uneven especially with the pacing but it's a must see for Cassavetes and Rowlands fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloria; 'He sees a dame like you, and a guy like me, he don't know'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of my all-time favourite films.I just read a splendid review,her, by 'noreaster13,' and I highly recommend it, as what they say, is exactly what I would.Hollywood (as an unspoken rule), rarely puts mature women (over 40) into lead roles, and thank goodness for Ms. Rowlands and her husband, the late director, John Cassavetes, for creating this tribute to Ms. Rowlands talent, and to and for those mature women, who are silenced in a culture that has, and still does - favour youth.Shameful to do do, because, I always felt, as the saying goes, 'youth is wasted on the young.'Ms. Rowland's Gloria Swenson - 'a nod to Gloria Swanson,' as a reporter says of Gloria, is a woman who lived her earlier days as arm-candy, to the men of the underworld, and, smartly realised that, as she 'd get older, she'd have no one, but, herself, to be there for her.She's over the 40-year mark, and has undoubtedly been replaced, but, still maintains a cordial relationship with those men, and their associates.Doing so, means fading - into the background, and - if lucky, they might, perhaps, throw her a bone, as it were, on the rare-occasion she needs a little help getting by, but, Gloria is, above all, a self-reliant woman, not school-smart, but very street-smart, and that and her wits has gotten he by.Thrown into this solitary existence - one she describes as 'having my friends, my apartment, and my cat,' is the 6-year old neighbour's boy, Phil Dawn, the son of a mob accountant, who, has crossed the code of silence, and is now a dead man - literally.In an early scene, after Gloria and Phil (the 'kid') escape down a staircase, Gloria - alone on a street corner, with Phil, realises the predicament she's now in, and says, 'the guys who killed your family, are friends of mine.''My feet are falling off, I can't run anymore, what am I doing here?'And, with these words, she realises her isolation, and as a car full of those men, who they just escaped from come careening to a halt, aside Gloria and Phil, who say, they; 'got no issue with you, we just want the book, and the boy,' to which Gloria realises the truth; if she turns him over, he's dead.For what? Just being the son of the mob accountant? A 6-year old, who 'can't even speak English (of course, he can), and doesn't know anything?'Yes - just, because.With this exchange, she realises she's to make a choice, which will alter her future - if she's going to survive.She didn't look for being Phil's saviour, and Phil didn't ask, either, but, through circumstance, and fate, it is meant to be, and in order for them both to live, they must stay together.I've never seen the remake, and I know no one could step into the (high heeled) shoes of Gloria, which Ms. Rowlands embodies so beautifully.As the 2 become enmeshed in saving each others lives, one of my favourite lines is spoken by Phil, as a snooty hotel clerk refuses them a room; ''He don't know the score, he sees a dame like you, and a guy like me, he don't know.'This film - to paraphrase 'noreaster13,' is the result of 'adult filmmakers making a film for adults,' a rarity, today. It's gritty, it's not a connect-the dots' story, which is easily predictable.I highly recommend this film for those who haven't yet seen it, and even for those who have, such as myself..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasing Work from the Minds of John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gloria Swenson's a gun moll all growed up. The mob ain't got time for her no more, and instead of getting' her kicks like she did in the good 'ole days, she lives alone with her cat in a crappy joint in the slums of New York. It ain't much, but it's something, and she's gotta live, ya know? Now get lost.Gloria may have a sordid past in her wake, but she is certainly not a floozy with a few wrinkles too many. She is a tough-as-nails presence that has been around the block plenty of times, unafraid of anything except maybe the cold eyes of death. Gloria is also portrayed by Gena Rowlands, and Gloria is directed by John Cassavetes, her husband.Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes are national treasures, but when your finest pieces of work are confined to ambitiously outlandish independent films, you're bound to only be remembered by the critics who don't have much fun watching Vin Diesel's newest vehicle. They teamed up seven times, but Gloria is the closest thing they ever got to the word "conventional." Despite a slightly over-the-top soundtrack, possibly a quirk added by the mercurial Cassavetes, gone are his usual touches of slapped around camera-work and obvious improvisations. With Gloria, he's an auteur taking a vacation, and it makes for one of his most entertaining, if not one of his deepest, projects.The movie begins in ruins; Jack Dawn (Buck Henry) has made the mistake of double-crossing the mob. Not only has he been skimming money from the profits of their various crimes, but he has also been acting as an informant for the FBI. He, along with his family, are barricaded in a crammed apartment, attempting to hold off hired guns for as long as possible. Then Gloria, a neighbor, comes knocking on their door. She wants to borrow sugar, but instead gets Jack's son, Phil (John Adames). Then the inevitable happens: Phil is orphaned, and Gloria, reluctantly, is forced to take him in. Problem is, the mob knows about it. After this set-up pulls through, the rest of the film acts as a punchy and darkly funny game of cat-and-mouse between Gloria, her newfound Puerto Rican child friend, and, well, the mob.Gloria's only downfall is that it becomes a little monotonous after a while ? you can only handle Phil running away and Gloria having to chase after him for so long ? but it's much too lovable to really get on your nerves. For once, Cassavetes backs off and lets Rowlands be the star of the show; in the past, it was as if Cassavetes and Rowlands were headlining together (not a bad thing), looking like the cool boho versions of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. But even Ginger Rogers had to have Kitty Foyle all to herself.Everything about Rowlands ? her light but steely Wisconsin accent, her big hair, her hastily put-on red lipstick, her cheap high heels ? is dynamite. In her other films with Cassavetes (1974's A Woman Under the Influence, 1977's Opening Night), she has had to pour out every emotion she's ever felt, as if she were stripping naked in front of a crowd. But in Gloria, it's clear that she's having fun. Rowlands carries a gun with imposing authority, like a street tough that surprises you with their scrappiness. Even better is her chemistry with the loud and unintentionally funny Adames, who spits out every line with bracing liberation. Gloria is engaging but intimidating, but Phil doesn't much care, and when she can't turn her usual tricks to get him to behave, the playfulness of the film climbs every mountain and fords every stream.Gloria runs a little long at two hours, but it isn't without its charms. Rowlands is a wonderful, wonderful actress, and there isn't a second of the film where we don't ask ourselves what we did to deserve a talent this great in the movie business. I adore Cassavetes with just as much fuss, but this time around, it isn't his show. It's hers, and that's not a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maverick Director Makes Mainstream Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have not seen a Cassavetes Film this is the one to start with. Some consider it his best and most accessible. It is most likely both. It is certain he would agree that it is made for a wider audience, but...This is a Mob Movie that is quite different and yet mostly the same. The standout is the middle-aged Hooker cleverly embodied by the worn-out looking Gena Rowlands. It is apparent that despite the physical sagging there once was quite an attractive and smart and feisty Female. What clearly remains is the smart and feisty.The New York locations are rugged and regaling and the pacing is swiftly somber. This feels real and despite some awkward dialog, some of the interplay between the two leads is precisely people. A trademark of the Director. There are some very tense scenes between the breath catching rest-stops.Overall, if you are looking for squibs, trash talking, and flash, go elsewhere. This is meant to be unattractive and poetic with dabs of cinematic non-conformity and is heavily heartfelt. Some Jazzy Music helps as does the unpretentiousness of it all. An anti-mainstream Movie that is not really a sellout from this Maverick Director but more like a reluctant paycheck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty, vivid allegory of dilapidated, defeated 1970's New York City.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An important entry in the list of gritty 1970s films (released 1980) that served as a counterpoint to anodyne plastic schlock available in the mainstream.Gloria herself is a metaphor for New Yorkers - complaisant in the crumbling of the city around them, existing in an uneasy complicity with the forces of corruption, and bolting herself into an apartment that vainly attempts to keep the decrepitude of the Bronx at bay.Ms. Rowlands does a workmanlike job. She shines at moments when depicting ferocity in confronting mobsters with a gun in her hand; but at other times, she is less convincing in showing that she is conflicted about continuing to protect the child whom she takes in at its father's behest, moments before he and the rest of the family are liquidated by the mob.Her work would have been easier if the script had been more coherent. At one point the two protagonists take refuge in an apartment, huge and luxe, without any apparent explanation of whose it is or how Gloria has the key. It would help if so much of the dialog were not inaudible. Full marks to Cassavetes for trying for authentic sound, but there are moments when we wish he could have looped a few lines that sound as if they were recorded in the next room by someone coughing through a cushion.Ultimately, the star of this movie is the Bronx itself, shown at the depths of the Dinkins administration. The flaking paint and dingy lighting of decaying hallways and stairwells; potholed streets and shuttered stores. New Yorkers will value this film for the hugely evocative portrayal of the city as she was, when she was on her knees. Thirty years later, recession or not, New York City is a different world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "kick-ass" and the "pain-in-the ass"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gloria" is probably the only Cassavetes' film that relies on a formulaic plot: the improbable pairing that turns into a friendship and I suspect it's the most likely to disorient the hardcore fans of Cassavetes' unique directorial style, in other words, to be the least appreciated of his films. Still, it's the one that earned Gena Rowlands, the most defining face of the director's filmography, her second nomination for an Oscar.It's hard to believe that Gena Rowlands only had two nominations in her career, and that she didn't even win for "A Woman Under the Influence" which belongs to the list of the greatest female performances ever. Never mind. Here, Gena portrays Gloria, the neighbor of a doomed Puerto-Rican family. She enters as casually as ever to ask for some coffee and finds herself in the middle of a panic-stricken family scene. And what seems to be more inexplicable that the casting of Buck Henry as the geeky waspish connected-to-the-mob father (I loved Roger Ebert's comment on that one) is the way he jeopardized his family's life by threatening to give some names to the FBI, names that were all conveniently collected in a little book. After a quick second thought, the casting of Buck Henry is top notch, he looks like the kind of men to commit such incredible mistakes, and as we see him argue with his wife, remarkably played by the beautiful Julie Carmen, the feeling of urgency is efficiently conveyed. Indeed, we know it's only a matter of minutes before the gangsters start shooting and Gloria's entrance is like providence knocking on the door.Gloria is a blonde woman in her late forties or early fifties (Gena Rowlands was 50), she's single but she probably seen a lot in her bed, she doesn't like kids and especially Carmen's kids, a touch of irony that makes her the perfect candidate to take care of little Phil, the eight-year old son who'd keep his father's book. Gloria has the perfect mix of sophistication and street-wise attitude, and I guess one of the reasons that earned her an Oscar nomination is that she literally created something new on screen. Gloria has some mimics that remind of Gena's earliest roles, and her accent is just a delight for ears, but then when she suddenly pulled a gun off her purse, it's a total metamorphosis, and a landmark in Cassavetes's canon. For the first time, an actor transfigures a character to make the role appealing on a true cinematic level, regardless of any realistic approach. Gloria becomes a true heroine in all the meanings of the word without the sexiness of usual exploitations' female protagonists."You're so tough" will repeat little Phil, with eyes that are either impressed or full of love. Is it realistic that a child would fall in love with a woman like Gloria? I don't think any child would but then not any child would have been casted for that role. Here, Cassavetes did one incredible choice, because either John Adames' performance is one of the best or the worst when it comes to child acting. I still haven't made up my mind yet but I do believe it was absolutely distasteful for the Razzies to give the award of Worst Supporting Actor to a child. Now, was he good or bad? I felt the way he was dressed very weird, sometimes the way he delivered his lines was whiny and irritating, and when he was playing adult and tough, I was like "gee, what's wrong with this kid?" but then you understand that as much as the film would have been different without Gena Rowlands, it would have been maybe worse with a 'normal' kid. I mean 'normal' by cinematic standards. Could have you dealt with the same story told by Spielberg?Kids have a strange ability to outsmart adults in movies or to act in the most insolent, eccentric and annoying way as if they were comforted by the tacit rule that 'kids don't die in films'. Think of all the ones you saw in Disaster films, little boys who were braver than their whiny sisters (another stereotype), who displayed an insolent courage in front of the villains when any normal child would have wept or cried for his mommy. In the name of dramatization, the portrayal of little boys and little girls has suffered from a severe distance from reality. Cassavetes never cared for clichs and you could see in his earlier films how children kind of behaved naturally, where adults were the most childish persons actually. In "Gloria", he creates here a kid so cinematically abnormal that we can believe a boy would act that way, the way he delivers his lines, the content of these lines can be debated but I'd rather take his attitude than one that would obey to a standard. At the end, he fitted the role, didn't ruin the film and the best measure of that aspect is his chemistry with Gloria.While the friendship is the emotional core, the film strikes by its abundances of cat-and- mouse scenes, the gangster looking for Gloria, Gloria herself looking for Phil. Thanks to the directing and the score from Bill Conti, sometimes a bit overdone, the dosage between thrills and sentiments is perfectly handled and allow us to grow some feelings toward these two characters. In a way, the film carries so much comedy beyond the drama that we couldn't have dealt with a sad ending. And Cassavetes, aware that he's not probably making the highlight of his career, let the events flow naturally until a climactic confrontation and a finale that concludes the film in a very satisfying way. "Gloria" could have been better, but it also could have been worse. Just ask yourself what if another director made "Gloria"?</fullReview>

She is as tough as they come but comes to have a heart for the young boy under her care.In some respects, when there is no shooting, the film often takes comic turns.

		<fullReview>Follow the tough-as-nails Gloria as she hopscotches all over NYC with a kid in tow, from subway to train to taxi to bus. This is the most non-linear film I've ever seen, it plays out as more of an experimental film than a mainstream piece. That the character of Gloria is the focus of the camera in almost every single scene implies that this is more of a character study than a mob movie, an idea confirmed by its title. I was startled to realize how similar this film is to the Pope of Greenwich Village, with the same kind of rambling, non-linear storytelling style.The most fascinating thing about this film is that Gloria is so guarded that you can never read her motives...any moment something startling could happen. When a car full of mobsters pulls up and demands that she hand over Phil, the boy, Gloria hauls out a piece and blows them back to the stone age; it's a scene that is completely unexpected, and you find yourself admiring her. In another scene, they journey to a diner and sit down for a meal, then she gets up and begins talking to a group of men at a table in the background, and you suddenly realize that she didn't just randomly choose this restaurant, she came to make a deal with the mobsters; it's so unexpected, nothing in this film is what you expect it to be, there is a surprise around every corner. Cassavetes apparently wanted to keep you guessing, and one can imagine him dismissing clich after clich from the screenplay until it was completely original.Gena Rowlands is marvelous; with her poker face, she calmly deals with one crisis after another, casually solving her problems with her gun or her intellect, which she honed on the streets after years of being involved with the mob. As the film progresses, her weary cynicism gradually erodes to affection for the little boy she initially disliked. This film is refreshingly original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched it 3 times in the past 10 days. But I have to admit that when I saw it years back I didn't care for it much. It's funny how your viewpoint changes over the years. I'm just about sure that some of the critics here may also do the same as the years pass. However, most so-called 'critics' are so full of themselves anyway in my opinion.But what's not to love about the film? Directed by John Cassavetes, the music by Bill Conti, the lovely opening credits and artwork by Romare Bearden, the great NYC locations, etc. I love the opening sequence where the watercolor painting of night buildings dissolves into a real night scene and those two opening minutes of the fly over of New York and Yankee Stadium and as we see the Statue Of Liberty you can see that dawn is approaching with the sky lighting up. As the fly over continues under the Brooklyn Bridge then the shot of the bridge with Manhattan in the background and George Washington bridge in the lower part of the frame. And finally the camera pans to a day game at Yankee Stadium to zoom up on the bus approaching. I did spot a continuity glitch where the 3 teens are running toward the El and there's a crowd of people on the corner and when they show them running from the bus the crowd is missing. Big deal. One more comment before I go when they show Gloria and Phil at the cemetery and the scene slowly dissolves with the gravestones and laps into the bridge shot of NYC skyline and I thought how the skyscrapers seemed to symbolize the gravestones too. Life and death in the Naked City.I Love This Movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassavetes makes a 'commercial' thriller... and it's no less unusual than his other pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gloria is riveting in its own weird way, but it's exactly because writer/director John Cassavetes doesn't want to play by the rules and make things very easy for the audience. His technique isn't as footloose and fancy free as in his other pictures like Faces and Killing of a Chinese Bookie (which maybe makes it slightly less gritty than those films), but considering that this is somewhat more of a higher-budgeted 'Hollywood' picture it certainly isn't entirely conventional. Which isn't to say that the formula doesn't sound as tried-before, because it does: a young kid possible see some bad things happening involving some gangsters and his family, and is protected by a neighbor, tough-talking, smoking', trigger-happy dame Gloria Swanson (yeah yeah, like the actress), and the two go on the run from the mobsters all over New York City.As with a film like Leon: The Professional, which had gender roles reversed and minus the assassin-tutoring, there's something to be said for the shattering of innocence through the act of murder. In the case of Gloria it's never really clear exactly that Phil's family is dead- he just knows, more or less, he can't get back home to them and has to stick with this lady he (more or less) loves kind of by default. It's a disturbing situation made more-so by how the behavior and conversations go between the uneasy and hard-boiled Gloria and this precocious but bright young Puerto Rican kid who has his father's 'book' the mob wants. Now, some of the plotting isn't always air-tight, and the whole significance of wanting to go to Pittsburgh remains fuzzy throughout.But there's an energy to the picture, something that keeps us wanting to see where these two will go, or how they'll get back together again if they're only momentarily separated by getting off the wrong subway train. It's slightly spiky mixing of melodrama and film-noir, and it has a lot more than I would ever think Cassavetes would be capable of as a genre director. But what makes the film more than just decent fare, or rather a fine but less-than-great diversion for the director, is his wife Rowlands as he title part. She's so good here, so bad-ass, so terribly mis-matched with this kid played by John Adames for all the right reasons for the story (who I can't decide yet was either very good or very bad in the part, or both), that any big story or character gaps can be forgiven. This is a story of paranoia as much as a chase for Cassavetes, and he pulls off this thrilling sensation of 'will they get away with this' than expected.Nowhere near a great film at all, but it's enjoyable and rollicking fun with a crazily impressive lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gena is as wonderful as my former wife was, perhaps still is. The difference between Gloria and my ex. is that Gloria has at heart, some decency. She never wanted the kid, nor as a viewer did I. A stupid kid with no charm, nor brain, just a pile of unlucky junk. Junk, is Gloria junk too? She knows she is not. Treated like junk, yes, but she tries to get out of it, the low down gangsters that make life wretched, a swamp of lazy violence, that if I had my way, the military could get rid of, but need, indeed they do. This movie is about power. Gloria has no power, she is a victim of circumstance, like most of us, but instead of putting up with it, she wants out. She can and she will. But all her plans go airy because of some kid! This is where morality kicks in. Should she look after herself, or risk everything for this dumb little kid? Would you, would I? Gena Rowlands is excellent. I have a picture on my kitchen wall of Gloria. Standing spread with gun in hand. My ex, is a whore, she has no guts. She stood behind a man who had a razor to my throat and did nothing. Gloria is a fiction, a Cassavites fantasy. Tough? Gena tough? Sure, to make a fictitious woman real, you must understand her, the woman, Gena does. She is tough. She is durable. I love her. Who? Gloria of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can such an epithet be attributed to such a director?You can say that "Woman under the influence" "A child is waiting " and "husbands"are accessible movies.But "Gloria " does not belong to this group.The question of accessibility has not to be mooted here.It's a real thriller,and it's very hard to discern Cassavetes 's touch here.Only the long dialogue between the hero?ne and one of her old maffia acquaintance recalls the former works. The movie overture is dazzling,visually astounding,recalling by its violence Sam Peckinpah.Gena Rowlands portrays Gloria,a grumpy woman who wants to be left alone,and whose quietness will be disturbed by a young boy whose entire family has been slain by gangsters.Gloria has certainly a shady,even racy past,but bow,she's retired,so to speak.Then a long escape begins ,with sometimes a dj? vu feeling as far as Gloria/child relationship is concerned.But Rowlands's sensational skills easily makes up for that.Has anybody noticed that Luc Besson,in "Lon" has plundered Gloria's beginning?Almost everything ,but the sex of the two leads (a man and a little girl in this case),seems to come from Cassavetes's screenplay.But,mind you,Jean Reno is not as expressive as Gena Rowlands,by a long shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gena Rowlands made this movie at a time that strong women were still being considered 'feminists', a dirty word of the time. The concept that a woman can be truly feminine, and yet tough and strong, had not yet permeated the public's mind.Congratulations Gena, for breaking through the barriers of perjudical thinking and proving that women can be warm, caring, emotionally driven, yet powerful.Years later, Susan Sarandon, re-made this movie. She's also wonderful in the heroine's role. However, Gena made the movie in a time when "Gloria's" actions, coupled with her persona of a 'real woman' had more impact on the populace."I'm the man!" cried the little boy who finally realized who truly worn the pants in their relationship.Don't look for too much action in this movie, but look forward to the relationship between a child and the 'motherly instinct' of a stranger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Unbelievable Plot Points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning, this movie strains credulity. First, if Jack Dawn was keeping a record of certain transactions so that he could inform on the mob to the FBI, it is unbelievable that he would tell the mob he had stuff written down, but then say that he was kidding. But once the mob finds out, he should have called the police and then the FBI to get in the witness protection program. Instead, he gives the book to his son, Phil, as if he is doing him a favor.All right, Jack is stupid, and we will let it go at that. But then we do not understand why Gloria does not just hand over the book to the mob right away. She is not even willing to go to the police for help, so what does she think she and Phil will do with the book? She says she cannot go to the police for protection because the mobsters are her friends, but then she shoots five of them in their car. I guess it is all right to kill your friends, but not to get the police to protect you from them.When the mob gets the book, they say they still need to kill the kid, to make an example. The problem with that is that it is a clich that the Mafia leaves the women and children alone, primarily because killing family members invites retribution. So, this determination to kill a young child is not believable.Then Gloria decides to go to Pittsburg. Eventually, it occurs to her that the Mafia is probably in Pittsburg too. No kidding. The thing to do is go to some small town no one has ever heard of in another part of the country, like Kerrville, Texas, population just over 20,000.Finally, the dialogue between Gloria and Phil is unnatural. I could feel the heavy hand of John Cassavetes making it up with little regard for realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK film but no more than that due to it being unconvincing in too many regards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Dawn has let slip to his mob employers that he has kept a book of all transactions. Jeri Dawn has just seen some men lingering in the lobby downstairs. Together they realise that the hit has come and they start to try to leave. They give their youngest son, Phil, to neighbour Gloria to offer some hope for him ? although before leaving, Jack gives him his account ledger as protection. The mob slaughter the Dawn family but Phil and Gloria get away; however, with the information in their possession, Gloria soon finds that the mob still want the book back and the kid dead ? will Gloria's former relationship with members of the mob help or hinder her? With so many good things generally said about this film, I thought I'd better give it a go despite already having seen the remake. The good things about it are generally true ? it is quite engaging, Rowlands is pretty good and it is a bit tense. However I couldn't help but feel that the strengths were more than cancelled out by the weaknesses, not making it a bad film but making it only an OK one. The plot is gripping enough and has been redone several times since this film but somehow it doesn't always ring true ? and this criticism can be carried across to the lead character. Would she really greet each mobster with spits of "punk" etc and always be pulling a gun, perhaps in fear she would but here she looks like she is in control. In terms of her character, she is harsh to the kid but yet never shows the growing affection that we assume must be the reason she cannot bring herself to do the wrong thing and hand over the kid. She shows it right at the end but it is too late to be convincing by then.This is not to take away from her performance, because it is strong, but it is not convincing as a person. Cassavetes has crafted a tough female but has done so to the point where she seems a few steps off being the Terminator. Adames may well be trying his best but he is annoying and his character was totally absent ? again not helped by the fact his material doesn't sound anything like a real person; contrast him with Portman in Leon and you'll see what a negative impact he had on the film. The mobsters are all Italian goons of the classic stereotype and they add nothing to the film in the way of actual menace. Cassavetes has done the job as director though and the film is quite tense while also capturing the city of New York of the time very well in regards atmosphere and grit.Overall this is an OK film with an OK plot that is OK if you can get passed how unconvincing it all is. However it is no classic and the weaknesses and problems are difficult to ignore. Worth watching and perhaps better if you have low expectations but it is certainly anything like as good as its awards, names and reputation suggests that it will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two powerful performances help the film rise above its clichs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gena Rowlands is Gloria, a tough gangster's moll who gets in over her head when she agrees (reluctantly) to take care of 6 year old Phil Dawn(John Adames), the half Puerto Rican neighbor whose parents (Buck Henry and Julie Carmen) realize that they are about to be murdered by the mob. Henry, a mob bookkeeper, has turned over states evidence, and this means a death sentence for him and his family (which includes a daughter and mother-in-law). Gloria makes it clear from the beginning that she doesn't like kids, much less this one, but unconsciously takes him anyway, leading to a show-off between her and old mob associates, which includes her former lover. Gloria isn't afraid of using her gun to keep the mobsters away from the boy, and instantly, this brings sympathy towards her seemingly cold character. Like gangster's molls of the great crime dramas, she is hiding a heart of gold underneath all that toughness, and that makes the film extremely engrossing in watching out how it all unfolds.Rowlands and Adames are powerful in their performances, and they share an amazing chemistry together. Adames doesn't act like any movie kid; he is real. Why he won a "Razzie" (Worst) Supporting Actor award makes no sense to me. Rowlands plays the role as if she were Gloria Grahame, Ida Lupino and Ann Savage all rolled up into one. This lady will take no nonsense, even telling a tough waitress at a Grand Central restaurant to take a hike. In fact, the film makes great use of New York locales not usually seen in mainstream films. The film is filled with many clichs, and the ending is very forumalatic (in a "The Lady Vanishes" way), but it left me feeling totally satisfied. Sometimes formula works, especially when the heart is present, and this film is filled with heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Music !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What really made me pity this movie is its idea and what it got of elements. The Beauty and the Beast in the action genre.. Great, and that was before movies like (Lon - 1994) came out, but it seemed that a tornado of naivety hit the whole thing ruthlessly. It needed a lot and a lot and a lot to be a great movie. The dealing with the possible good material was highly provocative where some scenes deserved the laugh, because the writing (Gloria threatens the whole gang in a restaurant!), or the directing (the boy says : "I love you to death" while the camera is almost shooting only his forehead !!?), or the acting (The mafia men couldn't act, John Adames as the kid was unbearably awful = John Cassavetes's responsibility).Elaborately, It forces me to believe that its script had been written (read : fabricated) in 2 days, especially when it relies on the dialog to develop everything, and the dialog was too far-fetched to be logically possible. Also with matters like killing the family at the beginning which's my definition for horrible hastiness, or the end where it turns out that Gloria is Supergirl or the woman of steel, which's quite nothing in familiar flicks, but on the top of OTHER catastrophes here, it is pain barrier. I become so sick whenever I watch artistic movies that lack everything except the laziness, and proudly it brags with that in the name of novelty, realism, whatever. Here, the anguish is double because it's not a movie like that, it's an American thriller with different idea and a dull everything I suppose ! It looked as low as some Blaxploitation movies while it isn't one, it just took the worst of them.Some would say "It's a classic", and other would say "it's the worst ever" ! Actually it's a movie you can summarize its status by the irony between (Rowlands) who got an Oscar nomination for it, and (Adames) who got a Razzie nomination for It (and fairly won !), so IT WAS the Beauty and the Beast indeed ! And I ranked it as one of the worst Buddy-movies, if not the worst ever. Though, when I first watched it I was a kid (a freak kid who loves movies more than life!) so I loved it so much. In fact I think (Gena Rowlands)'s acting was impressive, she owned the role and the screen, if only that was through another script! The cinematography tried to be as non-Hollywood as it could be, I recall clever sequence with a running steadicam (in 1980) in which Gloria escapes with the kid from the restaurant, as a whole it managed to be somewhat harshly real yet through bad-made unreal story ! Plus it didn't add anything profound.. Unlike the music.(Gloria) as a movie, fails on the romantic level and sucks on the thrill level, but the music helps out to redeem both. Bill Conti handled it seriously more than anybody got involved in it. OH MY GOD, his music was like a diamond in the rough. No doubt it's bigger than the movie. It managed to give it a sublime soul, a touch of greatness, and wide shadows to the flat characters and fabricated events. Maybe Conti believed in the story and the movie to the utmost, or he didn't watch the movie but how he loves his work and uses to do it rightly ! Or maybe he did watch it so he was forced to lift it up and cover its faults. It created such a personality for the weak movie, that embodied the Latino background, the chase's feel, the rebellion sense of the title's character, and the passion between her and the kid; nearly all what the movie flopped at !. I think Conti was inspired by Yoakhen Rodrego's Concerto D'aranjuez, its spirit seems clear somewhat in the tunes. Anyhow, It's some catchy soundtrack that marked a movie with high quietly lacked it badly on so many levels. Sometimes, rare times, the music makes the glory of some movies, but Bill Conti just revived it, and donated it with some sensitive case or dramatic deepness, but it needed more and more to be as larger than life as its music.So take the soundtrack and remake (Gloria), I'm not kidding, (Gus Van Sant) sort of did it with (Bernard Herrmann)'s music through his (Psycho - 1999) but not to be like it, as a deformation for its original, because it can't stand more inferiority.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gena Rowlands is forthright, appropriately gritty, and generally quite marvelous playing Gloria Swenson, a former mobster's girl in present day New York City who is suddenly saddled with a little Puerto Rican boy, orphaned after his parents were killed by the mob before they could inform to the FBI. Rowlands (who deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her work) trades salty quips with the kid, busts chops, and handles a gun like a pro--and she wakes the audience up every time she gets a showy scene. Unfortunately, this script by director John Cassavetes has absolutely nowhere to go after its second act, dragging on for an extra 30 minutes. Though "Gloria" was certainly one of the filmmaker's more commercial projects, a pretentious air hangs about the film, giving it an overall feeling of stilted artificiality. Remade by Sidney Lumet in 1999 with Sharon Stone in the lead. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film certainly has the gritty look and feel of an urban thriller of the 70s, and it's highlights are the street scenes, many shot from a distance to avoid real New Yorkers staring at the actors or the cameras. Real people walk past the actors completely oblivious to who they are or what's going on and it adds immeasurably to the realism of the film.Sadly, that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this film. I'm frankly surprised that this film comes from a director with as distinguished a reputation as John Cassavetes. Having said that, I'm not too familiar with Cassavetes' work with a director so can't form an opinion on whether that reputation is deserved.Anyway, what's wrong with this film? Firstly, the acting between the two leads is pretty poor. Gena Rowlands was a journeyman actress at best and really doesn't possess the acting skills or presence to carry a film. John Adames as the kid she spirits away from the mob is just plain bad, there's no disguising the fact. He's not helped, either, by the lines he's given to speak as, more often than not, they're words that no kid would speak in such a situation. On top of that, he seems remarkably unmoved by the fact that his entire family has been wiped out.The other main faults for my money are that the musical score is intrusive and overwrought, rising to dramatic crescendos at wholly inappropriate moments, and the plot as a whole really doesn't hang together. And that ending is just horrible and overly sentimental. Cassavetes has failed to arouse any real concern for the characters throughout the preceding two hours, so seeing them reunited in the way he has written just doesn't work at any level other than making it look like the ending of some hokey TV movie</fullReview>

In the first 30 minutes, you will see two glaring continuity errors, one spectacularly bad special effect, and a lifetime supply of bad writing and acting.I have not knowingly ever seen any of Cassavetes' directorial work, and I am in no rush to correct that. It will take a lot of convincing to make me consider giving him another chance to impress me.Grade: 1 out of 10. Abysmal.

By the end of the film, I didn't care whether Gloria and Phil got away safely, I didn't feel any compassion toward the annoying little Phil or or ex-gangster's moll Gloria, probably because nobody in the film had any good lines to say.I haven't seen the Sharon Stone remake, but Lon, which many say to be a Gloria rip off, was a much better film, with better dialogue, exciting action sequences and a child that could actually act and wasn't so damn annoying.

		<fullReview>OK, people, feel free to vote me down for admitting right off that I didn't finish this mess of a film. I couldn't stand it from the get go. The acting isn't acting at even a semi-pro level but instead somewhere between the expertise you'd find halfway between high school and church pageant acting. The music soundtrack isn't. It's some guy making loud squawks on a saxophone which is about as amusing as fingernails on a chalkboard and equally relaxing. The sound recording is about what I'd expect from an 8 year old in 1955 who got his hands on a first generation tape recorder. The film, if one can grace it with such a label, starts out with some muddled malarkey about a 45 year old guy who is apparently married to a 15 year old girl, but somehow this couple has produced several children including a boy of about 6 and a girl of maybe 11. The husband has offended some bad guys by having in his possession something which they want and which he stupidly keeps in his apartment with his family instead of turning it over to the FBI and then seeking shelter from the bad guys. This leads the family to place the 6 year old boy in the hands of a neighbor which she immediately agrees to even though she says she hates all kids and especially this one. So she gets the kid she hates and the item the bad guys seek - a laughable setup. Yeah, this movie is supposed to be full of symbolism of how liberalism killed NY City or some such, but I"m not going for it. It's just a slapdash poorly constructed excuse for cinema barely above Ed Wood in quality. And Ed Wood put more heart into it and left the pretense out. Mandatory viewing for the art house crowd. All others - avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALL OF MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM.I was told that this movie was a classic, so I decided to give it a shot. What I wasn't told was that it is probably one of the stupidest movies ever made. Yes, I am aware that "stupidest" is not a word, but after sitting through this garbage, I cannot be blamed for my newfound idiocy. No, Gloria is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it sure holds the current title in the Bad Dialogue Contest. Gloria runs through the city Charles Bronson style, and whenever confronted by mobsters she says such gems as, "You punks! You sissies! You bunch of nothings! You Bananas!!"This also marks the first time I have ever watched a movie and prayed for NO nudity. And believe me, there are plenty of close calls here, as when Gloria prances around in scantily clad lingerie showcasing her glorious middle aged body. And when people are lacking in the Attractive Department, they sure as hell better have a good personality. But Gloria sucks. Are we supposed to like this lady? I sure as hell don't. Actually, I hate her. She makes bad decisions. She treats the kid like sh**. Why won't she just drop him off at the police station and walk away? Why won't she buy the kid some clothes? Her selfish ass changes clothes every scene, but won't let Phil get out of his Chico and the Man attire.The movie begins with a Hispanic woman having a very bad day. Thank God they kill her off early, because I don't think I could take that horrible Rosie Perez accent for 2 hours. Her good friend Gloria takes her son named Phil away from the mob who kill the rest of the family. The story soon is all over the street, and Phil's face is in the papers. Instead of being inconspicuous, Gloria goes all over town like a NYC tour guide in broad daylight. So, why can't anybody find this pair? True, I don't expect the cops to give a sh** about locating a poor Puerto Rican kid, but how about street witnesses? How about the mob? And speaking of the mob, this is the softest mob I have ever seen. They repeatedly let Gloria have their way with them, with no question. In her home, in restaurants, on the train, etc. In one scene, Gloria even rescues Phil from a mobster's house, leaves pointing a gun, and then her taxi driver actually lets her in his cab with a gun and mobsters behind her.Personally, I believe the kid playing Phil was probably a 12 year old (or so) midget and not a little kid. His body seems shrunken, and not far from puberty. But whether he's a real kid or a midget, one thing's for sure...he is one horrendous actor. The writers of this movie also forgot that the kid is supposed to be 6, not 16. He is depressed and angry at the world, as if life has stressed him with burdens since birth. Yes, the kid is from a tough background and was forced to grow up fast, but don't make him an adult for the convenience of the plot. He is a young, frightened child in some scenes, and an experienced, mature man in others. But he doesn't mature with the movie, his character shifts back and forth during the course of the film, wherever convenient. Phil has some really oddball lines for a child to say. Some of Phil's greatest hits include:1.) A dame like you and a guy like me, they don't understand.2.) You're a cute girl Gloria, but you're not for me.3.) You're my mother, my father...you're even my friend.4.) If you don't know what the system is, how do you know you can't beat it?5.) We gotta keep trying, even if we get shot. You can't just continue shooting everybody who comes knocking on your door.He's got the world down pat better than Gloria. And my personal favorite:6.) I love you Gloria. I love you to death.God in heaven.He's even smart enough to REALIZE he is growing up fast: "Gloria, I am growing up so fast. When I first met you, I was ashamed to speak!" By the time the movie was over, I actually WANTED the mob to come and kill this duo. I couldn't decide which character I wanted dead first. Gloria is a travesty of a movie with pedophile undertones that go unmentioned simply because the adult is female. If the sexes were reversed, we'd have an NC-17 film with R. Kelly as the protagonist.Zero stars out of 5.</fullReview>
