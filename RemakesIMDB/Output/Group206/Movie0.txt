		<shortDescription>Who are you, really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like It's A Wonderful Life. Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be. Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst. Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.What can I say? This movie is a life changing experience. Makes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atop my Top Ten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include "Fantasia," "To Kill A Mockingbird," "Casablanca," "Singin' in the Rain," "North by Northwest," and "The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is "It's a Wonderful Life."I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as "...the richest man in town." The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Influence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film and Timeless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family. We watch it every year and never tire of it. Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values. This is probably his greatest film in that regard. Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town. The second message is that each life important. No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant. His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters. He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition. He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow. For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero. Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational. The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming. Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town. Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century. It was nominated for five academy awards and won none. It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film. History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation. Of course, I rated it a 10/10. I can't wait to see it again this Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer brilliance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After strong performances in films such as "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" and "The Philadelphia Story", James Stewart confirmed his status as one of the greats with his performance as George Bailey in "It's a Wonderful Life". This movie is, without a doubt, the best of all time."It's a Wonderful Life" is a movie that you can watch over and over again. It's movie that makes you think, about life in general and how each person makes a difference, and about how great life can be (hence the title "It's a Wonderful Life). Whilst making you think, it also entertains with many light hearted moments, particularly towards the end of the film.The direction, sound and casting in "It's a Wonderful Life" are second to none. Yet it is the fact that almost any person can watch this movie and come away feeling inspired that makes it easily the best movie of all time!A 10/10 without a doubt!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY CHRISTMAS SEASON UNTIL I WATCH THIS MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so glad Frank Capra had a vision to make "It's A Wonderful Life". I'm glad he chose Jimmy Stewart to play George Bailey. There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of "It's A Wonderful Life" still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film that should be watched again and again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films of all time, without a doubt. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best feel good movie ever? Quite possibly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a new definition of cold-hearted: a man or woman who remains completely untouched by the 1946 Capra classic "It's a Wonderful Life". You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clichéd manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"To My Big Brother George, The Richest Man In Town"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the "richest and meanest man in town", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So is the movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review edited and therefore quite choppy due to maximum word limit. Has there ever been a truer and more heartfelt character than George Bailey? This is a man whose life is one of great significance, but he, like all of us, does not always realize that this is so. He does not recognize his impact on the world until an angel erases his existence like chalk on a board. It is then that he is hit by the fact that one man's failing life isn't always as inconsequential as it may seem. We all remember when Clarence (Henry Travers) first appears on that snowy bridge and saves George Bailey (James Stewart) from committing suicide. He explains nonchalantly that he is an angel and George is incredulous--until Clarence wipes away his entire past. His mother doesn't recognize him. George tells her about his uncle as a source of belief. She states that his uncle has been dead for some time, now. The best scene in the entire film is that following when George is thrown out by his mother. He runs towards the camera in an intense wide shot, his face registering emotions of fear, horror, and ultimately the horrid understanding of what has happened. This role is the highlight of James Stewart's career--he never came anywhere close to the superb performance he gives in this movie. There is a reason it was his favorite film he ever starred in. Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is the grown image of all of us: As a child he dreamed of nothing but exotic locations and adventurous travels to foreign lands. But now he is a family man, a father and a husband. He has left behind his silly bachelor notions, but they still come back to haunt him. Bailey owns the town savings and loan, left to him by his father. The cranky Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) wants complete monopoly over the town, and all that stands in his way is Bailey and his little bank. But Bailey, an inner disgust and hatred towards Potter brewing since his childhood days, refuses to cave in and give it all away. Then one day, George's absentminded and quite eccentric uncle (Thomas Mitchell), misplaces a large sum of money, leaving George hopeless and Potter with a serious advantage. After blowing up at his wife (Donna Reed) and kids at home, George gets drunk at a local bar, is scorned at by a schoolteacher's wife, and left dazed and confused, walking through the snowy town at night during the happy Christmas season without a hope in the world. Battered and delirious, thinking back over his apparently pointless and wasted life, he contemplates suicide. He prays to God and wishes that he had never existed. Which is why Clarence comes down from heaven to sort things out and answer his prayer. Essentially bombing at the box office when it was first released, and then proceeding to fall into copyright problems for years, "It's a Wonderful Life" resurfaced only years later when it was brought back into the public domain circa 1970. When other channels were airing expensive Hollywood movies during the Christmas season, PBS picked up the film and played it as a counter attack, a weak hope prevailing in them that the classic film buffs out there would tune in. They did. And so did families across the nation. Every year the ratings got stronger and stronger and now, almost sixty years following the movie's initial release, it is considered a holiday tradition. George considers suicide as a way of escaping his problems without really thinking over the possible outcomes given his final choice. He looks back upon his life as wasted potential; he wanted to become an adventurer, break his family's small-town tradition and become something huge. Mentally scanning his life to the point in time when he stands on that bridge, George Bailey believes that he has simply and truly created a waste of space. He's ready to end his (assumed) pointless life when his entire point of view is wholly altered by the power of God. George suddenly realizes that though he never lived out his boyhood fantasies, he did so much more than he ever dreamed of. He saved his brother's life, which resulted in a huge impact in later years; he made an influence in the lives of others and brought peace and harmony to an otherwise small town by prevailing at the requests of Mr. Potter; he married a beautiful wife and had children, all of whom will no doubt have some measure of significance later in the world. And his wish on that bridge was that he had never been born. Often I am asked to name my favorite movie, and though I ignore requests and state that I have not seen every existing movie and therefore my judgment carries no significance, I have the lightest whimsy that "It's a Wonderful Life" may be my favorite motion picture to date. I cherish few other films just as close, but to me, "It's a Wonderful Life" is more moving than "Casablanca," a better study of one man's life than "Citizen Kane," and a movie that will live on in the hearts and memory of viewers long after we are gone. I believe that this is the definitive Americana motion picture, regardless of how I compare it to my other favorites, which may carry the same weight but not the same true significance. Few films come as close to the heart as "It's a Wonderful Life." And few films come as close to "It's a Wonderful Life" at all, for that matter. 5/5.</fullReview>

I saw this movie last Christmas and I did not find it funny, but I loved it, though! Everything is so great in this movie. The story is amazing. The characters are great, and the character's development is fantastic! the cinematography is grea, and the acting is fantastic. James Stewart was mind blowing. The whole movie is amazing,touching and encouraging. You cannot describe how good this movie is. Nor can you describe how good the message is.This is the best feel-good movie ever. It's a life changing movie, actually. It makes you feel good to be alive. Do me a favor and watch this movie as soon as possible!

		<shortDescription>The fable still holds up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just re-watched this film with my family as an annual Christmas tradition (first time on DVD though). I have to say, despite the 10-11 times i've seen this, it still holds up with magnificent strength and emotion. The scenes where Bailey has "never been born" with Clarence the angle and the triumphant concluding scene in Stewart's house where all his friends come to his aid are famous beyond comparison, but still are mesmerizing and emotional. What often is overlooked is the mountain of great dialogue in this film. Barrymore and Stewart have so many great lines-"I'm and old man and most people hate me, but I don't like them either"; "Oh, why don't you stop annoying people!"; "Is it too much to ask that people can live their lives with a few nice rooms and a bath and not have to live in your slums? We need this run-down old building just so there can be somewhere people can go and not crawl to Potter." Jimmy Stewart gives one of THE performances of all time as the ultimate put-upon good guy George Bailey. All he wants to do is get out of Bedford Falls, travel the world and go to college. But, because of a string of coincidences and occurences where George puts others above himself, he ends up never leaving the town. Donna Reed is his loving wife Mary, who waits around for George to realize that he loves her. This situation leads to one of the most touching and romantic scenes on film, where as the plastic magnate Sam Wainwright talks to George and Mary on the same phone, they look into each other's eyes and you see the what they truly feel for eachother. George grabs Mary, saying "I don't wanna get married to anyone anywhere at anytime", but he is cut off in the middle of his speech by the emotion, and they embrace. Rob Reiner claims he can't watch or discuss this scene without tearing up. How Stewart and Reed didn't win Oscars for this scene alone is unthinkable. Also, Lionel Barrymore is great as the evil Mr. Potter (with his wheelchair pilot/crony, Potter is the predecessor to everyone from the Beatles "Mean Mr. Mustard" to Mr. Burns on "The Simpsons")-who you believe is just a mean old man at the beginning, but then when he gives his final major speech to Stewart you realize what a twisted and cruel monster he truly is. The director, Frank Capra, must also be given credit when praising this film. He directs the actors and frames them in such a way that the true relationships and actions between them are so much more meaningful. He really knew what he was doing when making this film. The make-up and lighting department also successfully show the wear of 18 years on the principle actors-this movie takes place with the same actors from the period of 1928-1946, and Reed's and Stewart's make-up jobs are extremely convincing. Some great moments: The close-ups of Stewarts face when 1.) He lears if he doesn't take over the Bailey Building and Loan, the board of trustees will vote with Potter and drive the institution out of business, and 2.) In the fantasy scenes, where he runs away from "Ma Bailey's Boarding House" and realizes that not even his own mother regognizes him. The speech Bailey gives condemning Mr. Potter after Pa Bailey's death and Potter's appeal to liquidate the Building and Loan. A young George Bailey reveals to the pharmacist Mr. Gower that because he was so grief-stricken over the death of his son that he put the wrong medicine in the wrong tablet, and the look from Gower when he realizes that if not for Bailey, he would have done a terrible, terrible thing (this moment always gives me goosebumps). The look of disgust and horror on Stewart's face after shaking Potter's hand after being offered a job, then wiping his hand on his jacket-symbolising his realization that if he had agreed to work for Potter, he would have been selling his soul to the devil. This scene is followed by the wonderfully tender moment between Stewart and Reed where he stares at her in the dark as she tells him she is pregnant. Capra's greatest gift to the common man, "It's a Wonderful Life" still holds up beautifully. It is a morality tale with a timeless message that no man is poor who has friends. It's the ultimate happy ending, and the ultimate Christmas story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Bailey is a man with goals, ambitions - a man of courage, integrity and pride. But all he has ever done his whole life is assist those in need, never for a second thinking about himself. Wanting to see the world before he sets off to college for an architect degree, he finds that he can't let his town crumble against the miserable, hateful, greedy and powerful 'Potter' and so he decides to stay. His father passes away, and so he must find a way to run the 'Loans' business that his father has kept from the mad man 'Potter'. All goes well for Bailey - a beautiful wife, a few children and a lot of friends. Although still handing out loans like his father before him, he pursues his dream of building and constructs a home village with affordable houses despite Potter's mass influence on the township. Unfortunately for Bailey, things begin to point downhill following the Depression and later bankruptcy where Bailey just can't handle the weight of burden of all the people's money he cannot repay. He comes to the harrowing conclusion that he should never have been born and decides to leave his family and friends and take his own life off a bridge. But the world cannot dispose of itself such a man, so god sends an Angel on a mission to get its wings, or better yet to save George Bailey's life. The Angel shows George what life would have been like had he not been born at all and of what became of the people he took dearly. Miserable under Potter's absolute influence, the town looks like an over indulgent, over spent, money making machine. George gets a glimpse of his own powerful influence on his friends and family and realises just what a wonderful life he really had.Few films have portrayed the value (not the meaning) of life like 'It's a Wonderful Life' has. In contemporary times, we have been fed with recycled stories such as "The Family Man" and "It can happen to you", but none have captured the raw beauty of life like the original, "It's a wonderful Life"- its success partly due to its simplicity. And it sustains your attention from start to finish due to its simple and riveting storytelling. Sets aren't big, the story is quite small and the film is in black and white. What makes this film stand taller than others is the great dialog between the characters which consistently remains on the story throughout the film and not on irrelevant topics - this is what keeps us glued to the screen (unlike with modern films, most of the dialog is blabber about nothing). The acting is superb from the whole cast, but you have got to hand it to James Stewart for one of the best performances of his career portraying the discouraged George Bailey - arguably his best performance - and one of the best performances you will see in any film. What I really love about this film is the lack of music, which gives a sense of realism to the story, like we are there with the characters in George Bailey's world.Frank Capra creates an unforgettable atmospheric experience that remains tattooed in your memory years after viewing. The outdated effects aside, this film has stood the test of time as a timeless classic. The direction was subtle and superb - rarely equaled and I think this film is best in Black and White, even though they already had color in 1939, seven years before this masterpiece was released.I recommend this film to anybody who feels down and depressed, sad and lonely. It really makes you think about the importance and beauty of this life in which you are living. All I can say is that I will be watching this film yearly until the day that I die due to its poignancy. A real classic in cinema history. It really is a wonderful Life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The enduring classic for all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once read that It's A Wonderful Life is the holiday gift for all time. Never a truer statement has been made about one of the most popular films to have ever been made.The Plot is a simple one that has since been regurgitated and trundled out almost yearly it feels like. James Stewart plays George Bailey, an all round swell fella, who because of a number of life's circumstances finds himself forever a resident of Bedford Falls. Here he is the principal guy in the running of the family Building &amp; Loan business. When a substantial amount of money goes missing during the run up to Christmas, Bailey finds himself at the mercy of family nemesis, and nefarious town banker, Mr. Potter {Lionel Barrymore}. But George, tipped over the edge by an incident involving the bank funds, has an idea that taking his own life would greatly improve the fortunes of his family and the family business. But as he stands at the precipice of death by suicide, George is saved by his guardian angel Clarence {Henry Travers} and given the chance to see what Bedford Falls would be like having not had George Bailey's influence.Few, if any, directors have rivalled Frank Capra when it comes to successfully portraying the human heart on screen. It's A Wonderful Life is Capra's masterpiece. Rightly so, it is unashamedly sentimental, but also it's rich with the directors faith in community spirit and a belief in the strong bond of family love. The story is loosely worked from "The Greatest Gift," a Phillip Van Doren Stern story that he had sent to his friends as a Christmas card. Aided on screen writing duties by Frances Goodrich &amp; Albert Hackett {Dalton Trumbo is in there sometimes too}, Capra fashioned an ultimate feel good movie that is flecked by sheer darkness and disconcerting "life is tough" undertones. It's most likely that the more dark side of the film, and the wait for Christmas cheer, is what made It's A Wonderful Life a flop on its release. The film made a huge loss, tho not quite as gargantuan as many today believe, and was quickly consigned to the forgotten bin. But annual yuletide repeats on television over the following decades garnered it a cult following. A cult following that eventually swelled to a near universal one, to the point that now Christmas just wouldn't be the same without it. It is by definition, the ultimate comeback movie.Tho all the cast are superb {special mention to Donna Reed as George's wife, Mary} it's Stewart who leads the way in the class stakes. As he drifts from homely, lovable dreamer, a man sacrificing those dreams for others to benefit. To his descent into despair and the undertaking of a nightmarish odyssey, Stewart captivates in every frame, and more telling is that he is believable with each transformation of George's state of mind. However, when all is said and done, it's with the ending that basically the film rewards those who have trusted in Capra and Jimmy. It's an ending warm enough to melt the coldest of hearts. So see it with someone you love {always nice to have someone else to cry with} or introduce it to the poor souls who haven't seen it yet. Either way, it's here to stay forever the timeless classic that it so most certainly is. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra's most cynical movie, and why he's right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Criticizing It's A Wonderful Life is almost an act of treason in this country, but if ever a movie deserved a closer look, it's this one.Far from being a celebration of the importance of the individual, or of small-town life, "It's a Wonderful Life" depicts most citizens of Bedford Falls as timorous weaklings. Moviegoers identify with the hero, George, of course, but he's the exception in this movie, not the rule. If any general lesson is to be learned from the story, it's that a willful leader is the only thing preventing ordinary small-town folk from losing not only prosperity, but morality.The evidence is plain: Without George Bailey to hold the town together, it becomes Pottersville, which is a Hays Code version of Gomorrah. The townsfolk haven't got the courage or sense to manage their own affairs without a leader. In Bedford Falls, that's either corrupt Potter or long-suffering George. The only other characters with any backbone are Harry Bailey and Sam Wainwright, and they both left town. What remains are virtual ciphers like Mr. Gower, Uncle Billy, Ernie, and Bert. America doesn't exactly burst at the seams with self-reliant citizens, according to Frank Capra. So why does this movie merit a healthy 7 rating? Two reasons:1. Because it has undeniable power. Capra was a good director-- but a great propagandist. He made patriotic short films for the U.S. Army from 1942 until 1948-- and "It's a Wonderful Life" was made in 1946, smack in the middle of that period. The film is a masterpiece of manipulation. People love it, watch it over and over again every year, never noticing that its real message is deeply cynical, presenting little hope for mankind, and almost no faith in it. Indeed, it is almost fascistic in the way it champions the idea of a single leader (or worse, divine intervention) taking charge over ineffectual ordinary middle class people.2. Because Capra proves himself right with his own movie. As an influential leader/filmmaker, he is skilled enough to make generations of sheep-like Americans cry and cheer at his movies, no matter how much he insults us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It makes you stop to think about your own wonderful life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On one crisp December evening, two decades ago, my husband and I celebrated our very first Christmas together as a married couple. One of our yearly traditions, which we established that very Christmas season, has been to settle in front of the TV with a large bowl of popcorn and sodas for a quiet evening enjoying the holiday classics.That evening, my husband flipped the channels and excitedly noted the film "It's a Wonderful Life" had just started playing. After learning that I'd never seen it, my hubby enthusiastically said, "You have to watch this movie - it's one of the best films EVER." I guess my prejudice toward black-and-white TV was rearing its ugly head. I was in no mood to watch a dated film that I thought was of no relevance to us. I encouraged my hubby to see if he could find one of the many holiday classics that we enjoyed as kids growing up in the late 1960s, early 1970s timeframe.My husband chuckled and said, "Trust me, you'll love this story. It's about this guy, George Bailey, who..." After relating a brief synopsis of the film, he warned me that I might find the first 45 minutes or so to be slow-moving. Still, he encouraged me to pay attention closely. "Remember everything happening now to this guy, George," he advised, "It'll pay off in the second part of the film." As I watched George struggle with his devoted wife to raise their kids and pay the bills, report to a job that he never really wanted, battle his devious nemesis Mr. Potter, and yearn for a life that might have been, I thought - okay, there are some universal themes here. But this was a Christmas film? I couldn't make the connection, and really wasn't in the mood to continue watching anything that wasn't about Christmas.I was getting ready to go into the other room to finish my Christmas wrapping when, suddenly, finally, it was Christmas Eve in George Bailey's little world. I remembered looking at that serene little town, decorated for Christmas and bathed in fluffy white snow, and wishing that I lived in such a place. And just as my husband had promised, over the course of the next several minutes, everything started to come together. By the end of the film, as I watched George Bailey come to the realization, with his cherished family and lifelong friends gathered around him under his Christmas tree that George Bailey, representing every man and woman, ultimately realized that he surely had had a wonderful life. I wiped away a happy tear from my eye, knowing I'd viewed something very special.Then two and then four Christmases later, as I sat in a rocking chair, at first with our newborn baby girl and then her baby brother, I watched It's a Wonderful Life with my babies. I have subsequently repeated this tradition with friends and relatives of all ages. Many of them, like me at first thought they were dealing with an out-of-touch film from the mid-1940s, only to come to realize the timeless, wonderful gift we've all been given by Frank Capra.Since Christmas 1985, I have watched "It's a Wonderful Life" countless times. I agree with many other viewers - it is not only hands-down, the best Christmas movie, but perhaps my most favorite movie of all. I love and cherish it for so many reasons, perhaps most of all because it really makes you stop to think about what's important in your own life.And the most special moments of all are those times when I get to share "It's a Wonderful Life," as my husband did that one Christmas so long ago, with someone who is watching the film for the very first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-Sacrificing Going Too Far?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of the story is, of course, how a man named George Bailey keeps sacrificing his money and his desires all his life to help others in various ways over the years, and when later in life he is finally overwhelmed by his latest problems which he cannot solve himself and is ready to commit suicide, an angel from Heaven whose eyes are upon promotion is sent down to tell George about how all his self-sacrificing had saved so many people from disaster.One can nitpick about various things in the movie: reading a Bible, there are references to cherubs and seraphs, angels whose status in Heaven is indicated by the number of wings they have; the fact that George, despite his frustrated ambitions, didn't do too badly-he has a nice wife and children and is not living in poverty, and not being eligible to serve in the military would not necessarily be considered by some people (including people who had) to be a bad thing.My problem, though, is this-it turns out that Bailey has lots of friends because of all the good he had done, and they're willing to pay him back to get him out of his financial hole and save him from jail. Unfortunately, in real life self-sacrifice, especially excessive self- sacrifice, does not necessarily result in gratitude from those one had sacrificed for. They might necessarily take your actions for granted and in fact might regard you as a slave, which all too often happens in real life. Once your purpose is served, the sacrificer is discarded and forgotten, or even despised. And that, alas, would have been the far more credible ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all time favourite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before writing my comment, I skimmed through the existing 196 user comments and found that much has been said about the way this film reaches out and touches people (some of whom are fully paid-up members of the cynics party!) There have also been some very negative views registered, and I think I can see why some find it hard to relate to this film, with it's post-war values and strong religious tones.Personally I love 'It's a Wonderful Life' on all levels; it is heart-warming and moving, it has a message that is lacking in so many films today and it is a superb piece of cinematic art. But if the religious frame of the film does not appeal to you, I say look beyond it and appreciate some of the most skillful moments of cinematography and finest acting you will ever see.****POSSIBLE SPOILER*****In my mind the finest scene is that when George meets his brother from the train and discovers that he is planning to marry. Watch the way the rest of the action becomes incidental as the camera focuses on George, a man seeing his hopes slipping away from him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings you back into the true meaning of Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this is going to sound ridicules, but seriously, I have not seen this movie since I was a child. Even though they play it every year for Christmas, I never really had an interest to see it again. I was complaining to my mom the other day how sad it is that people just look at Christmas as present time and just getting what you want, I almost cried over it because I miss how my family would get me presents, but we'd go the homeless shelter to help out people who couldn't have a better one than us, I always thanked my parents for those wonderful experiences. It taught me that there is always worse and we must help those not just on Christmas, but all year around. Well, we did it again this year, but I'm now in the retail business and when I complained about this to my mom, she lent me the movie and said to watch it.Watching this movie truly touched my heart and brought me back to the true meaning of Christmas. I mean, your heart just goes out to George and his wonderful little town of Bedford Falls. He and his wonderful wife Mary together do whatever they can to make it in life and support their 4 darling children. But when a horrible mishap goes on at the bank that George works at, loosing $8,000, he starts to wonder if his life is worth living. But there is one angel who will not give up on him and shows him what life would be like if George had never been born. In Bedford Falls without George, turned into Pottersville because of the very greedy business man Mr. Potter, no one is happy and Mary is all alone. George realizes that maybe life is worth living and comes home to this loving town that is willing to do anything to help him and his family out."What goes around, comes around", I couldn't stop tearing at the end because it's just so loving. I hope future Christmas's will go back like this movie's examples, where people are just happy to have what they have and realize some are not so lucky, but we must all do our part. Cheesy, I know, but if one person can raise their hand, we all will do our parts in the end. Merry Christmas, everyone! :) 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterclass in Movie-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I am aware of seeing IAWL I managed to catch the last 5 Min's of the movie. It seemed to feature a character running around shouting 'Merry Christmas' at everybody, followed by a party where everyone handed over money To be frank, I wasn't in a hurry to see the rest of the movie. Then several years later, I started to watch IAWL from the beginning, unaware that it was the same movie. I was struck by how comprehensive the character study of George Bailey was. He was a good man, but his ambitions were frustrated at every turn. He wanted an Education, that was just outside his grasp. He wanted to travel, life conspired against him. At every step of the way, one person saw George 'rolling with the blows', that was Mary Hatch. This woman loved George and wanted to stand at his side, so they can face the slings and arrows of misfortune together. This is love of the purest kind.But even Mary's love cannot prevent George contemplating suicide. A single bad day that sees George on the top of the World at the beginning and thinking that taking his own life is the only way out by 10.45 pm.I was stunned when the ending turned into the movie I had seen some time before. But this time I understood, this wasn't just sentiment for it's own sake. To understand the ending you need to have gone on the same dark journey that George Bailey had been on.Many others have commented on the feel good aspects of the movie, so I won't. What I would like to say is that there are a number of scenes which live in the memory long after the end credits.Young George trying to persuade Mr Gower that he had prescribed poison (with young Mary Hatch Looking on).George hurrying home when he heard his father had had a stroke (with Mary Hatch looking on).George waiting at the station with Uncle Billy for Harry to come back from college (only to find Harry is already married and has a job that will keep him away from Bedford Falls).That kiss (I have to check that I am earthed, there is so much electricity in the air).Mary giving up their honeymoon money, to keep the Building and Loan out of Potters grasp.The Bridal Suit (with Ernie &amp; Bert).Trying to talk to Mary in the alternate reality, but managing frighten her. The Ending.I don't think I have seen a better character study, or for that matter a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life's Not Always So Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My apologies to all of you "It's a Wonderful Life"-ers out there. Please believe me when I say that I've tried multiple times to develop warm feelings for this movie. But it's just not meant to be. I've seen this film a couple of times, and I never want to see it again.I want to beat James Stewart's George Bailey about the head and shoulders every time I watch the movie. Perhaps the most passive-aggressive hero in motion picture history, George Bailey spends half of his time sacrificing his own happiness for the sake of others, and the other half whining about his hard luck. No, George, it's not hard luck...it's the result of your own decision making skills. Either be selfless and stop complaining, or be a bastard and screw everyone else. But make up your mind, and don't take two hours to do it.Ahhh, perhaps I now live in too cynical and jaded a world to tolerate George's namby-pamby indecision. But maybe that's a reason better than any other to keep this film around. Character aside, however, the one thing I can unequivocally praise about this film is the performance of Stewart. He provides a welcome bitter edge to combat Capra's sugary-sweet corn. His breakdown scene in a bar, where he desperately prays to God to help him keep himself together, is a tour-de-force.Drag it out every Christmas and enjoy...I won't begrudge you that small pleasure. Just don't expect me to join along.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ageing Beautifully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had fond memories of "It's A Wonderful Life" but, somehow, it never made my top ten. The other night I felt the urge to see it again, from beginning to end, after that fun compilation from the AFI, 100 movies, 100 Cheers. The most surprising thing about this perennial classic is that it's not just a good movie but a sort of miracle. Age has made it more relevant, more powerful. Frank Capra is, without question, its miracle worker. His narration style was a first and in a way unsurpassed. As you may very well know, the film wasn't an instant success. A peculiarity it shares with most of the great works of art. The truth is something that needs time to be confirmed even recognized. James Stewart's performance lived from a 2006 stand point is, quite simply, extraordinary. Capra's films were known as "capracorn" in their day. Strange to think about it now because its sentimentality wasn't really sentimental but a need to find goodness in the darkest places. The great Capra not only found it, it unmasked it with the same relish that he unmasked evil and greed. My only regret is that on this times of technical prowess we'll never see again the likes of "It's Wonderful Life" But, trying to look on the bright side in the most Capraesque kind of way. "It's A Wonderful Life" will be around for ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It WAS a wonderful life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that we like so much we will watch them to the point of redundancy and never get tired of them. It's A Wonderful Life used to be one of mine, but not anymore. In fact, I can't remember the last time I actually watched it in its entirety. I realize the reason why now...it's Frank Capra's populist message. It had finally gotten under my craw.The message, that having money is EVIL but being altruistic and broke is GOOD, served Capra well during the depression when everyone was broke (ironically, Capra got rich off this message). By 1946, Americans had money again and populism had worn out its welcome, which might explain the movie's dismal box office take.George Bailey is altruism squared. He willingly becomes a doormat to townfolks who can't spoonfeed themselves, forgoing his goals and dreams of making his own life better. Sorry George, but I eventually lost sympathy for you. Your desires are equally important.Other characters I got even more fed up with: Uncle Billy...what a drunken bonehead! Cmon, George, I don't care if he is family. Either fire this rumdum or make him into a harmless janitor or something so he won't go losing $8000 at a clip. Harry Bailey, you're next! You have no intention of ever paying back George for your college education, am I right? And finally, Clarence Oddbody,AS2. No wonder you haven't gotten your wings, you doofus. You knew about the $8000, so tell George that Potter stole the money so he, Mary, and the rest of the family could storm the bank and clean his clock like in the Saturday Night Live skit from 1986. Yes, I know that last part was played for laughs, but wouldn't that be your gut response, though? Maybe my criticism is a bit harsh, but it's towards the populist message and story line. I still like the acting in it, and the special effects were very good for the time...Capra's fake snow all over Bedford Falls still looks realistic to this day. And as goofy and manipulative as it seems, I'm glad George's deadbeat customers finally paid him back in the end. (P.S.: George, this would be a good time to remind your brother, Harry The War Hero, that he owes you four years of college tuition and the cost of a long distance phone call!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No folks, I promise not to do the same thing to the Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind, but this has got to be the most overrated movie of all time.It took me a number of tries to watch it all the way through, because it is so incredibly boring. All the scenarios are exaggerated without a hint of the whimsy or joy that should mark a Christmas movie. NOBODY in it is likeable, including the hapless and almost hopeless hero. They even give Donna Reed an improbable scene in the alternate reality where she is a total... well, if I want this posted, I can't use the word.But the worst flaw? THEY NEVER GET BACK THE MONEY THAT WAS STOLEN. It is morally unacceptable that this guy doesn't get punished and the townspeople have to rush in with a bailout.I've heard this movie praised to the highest heavens as one of the ten best ever made for most of my life. I'll give them credit for the body language between Donna Reed and James Stewart in the scene where he is on the phone, but not for much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am definitely in the minority regarding "Wonderful Life". I have avoided seeing this movie for years ... and I finally gave in just before Christmas 2009. It was Christmas Eve and I discovered why I was so depressed on the holiday. I really can't stand this movie. The original problem I had with it was when I first saw it many many years ago. I didn't like the idea that "Mary" needed glasses and was "ugly", and a lonely prim librarian without Jimmy Stewart in her life. No, I am not a librarian, but I love spending time in libraries with all the knowledge books have to offer. I felt this was gratuitous and insulting. In addition, couldn't "Mary" have found another husband? I resented those old movies where all the those poor, struggling people live in large, comfortable old houses, even if the hero's mother ran a boarding house. I think Frank Capra's films are phony and the products of an immature mind. Another Christmasy movie is my favorite one: "The Bishop's Wife". It's sophisticated, witty and beautiful, and has much stronger actors than any of Capra's films, with the exception of Henry Travers who, as far as I am concerned, is the real star of "Wonderful Life". Even Lionel Barrymore is wasted in "Life".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this a "classic"? Basic premise poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, at the age of 38, I saw "It's A Wonderful Life" in its entirety (after catching a few minutes here and there over the years on TV). When it was over, I found myself puzzled over why this movie is considered such a classic.I am not talking about the acting, or the film's technical proficiency. All of that seemed fine, even well-done at times. I am talking about its reason for being: Its story.I'll assume you have seen it, so prepare for spoilers. The basic message of this movie seems to be that a man who never left his home town to pursue his personal dreams nevertheless led a wonderful life due to his kindness and caring for the town and its residents. In fact, when he finally reaches a low point, the town's residents come to bail HIM out, thereby proving what a wonderful person he has been.A nice story, but the movie misses two logical points. First, was the man who never pursued his personal dreams (George Bailey) HAPPY with the life he DID lead? If he was happy with staying home, helping people afford houses and bailing out his family's business, then the point of the movie is MOOT. He evidently gave up very little for a happy life. Other than a few wistful asides, we never see that George is bothered much that he didn't travel the world. He seems perfectly content where he is. So if he is happy, then the central message of kindness and helping others while sacrificing your own dreams is weak or lost entirely.Second, if a man spends DECADES helping out residents of his little town (most of whom remain residents over the years), I don't see it as any great act of charity that when the man needs monetary help, all those people he assisted over the years are willing to give him a few dollars to fix his problem. The climactic ending, when people line up to give George 20 bucks here and 75 bucks there, is made to look like some kind of incredible holiday miracle. But think about it: If a man made it possible for YOU to buy your first home (in an era when buying a home was truly a dream), and a few years later he needs some money for his business (which is the entity that helps so many local people) to survive, wouldn't you go donate whatever you could afford to help him? It wouldn't even have to be that painful, really, in a town with several thousand residents.No, I think the town's true colors are shown earlier, when George's business almost goes under due to a run on the banks and his customers are more than happy to run to his competitor's bank to get 50 cents on a dollar. Some people end up staying ONLY after George uses his own WEDDING MONEY to pay them a fraction of what they sought to withdraw (which, when you think about it, is no real risk ... they can always go to the competitor later if things get worse). THAT seemed to me to also be normal behavior by the local residents, and it was not celebrated like the ending is.Maybe some people were impressed with the plot device of an angel showing George what life might have been like without him. Maybe that was the first time that had been done in a movie, for all I know. But I found that device not unlike the ghosts who visit Scrooge, and that tale was written long before It's A Wonderful Life was made. So I don't get that, either.There were some fun moments, and who doesn't like Jimmy Stewart. But a revered classic? I guess I don't get it. I gave it a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film is a Life Changer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has heard of this film, and if you haven't seen it, it's probably because you live in Antarctica or you have purposely avoided watching an old corny rerun in black and white. I command you to watch it, and if you have a heart, you will cry with joy. This film has endured as a timeless classic for 70 years for good reason. This film is pure art because it taps into the human experience in such an effective way. The message that we are all important is simply and beautifully brought to life. Jimmy Stewart's performance is human, funny, poignant and brilliant. Do not look for subtlety, clever meanings, high drama, modern art, political correctness, special effects, sex scenes, or car chases. You won't even see any color (avoid the colorized version at all costs), but what you will find is a perfect little film that will stay with you forever. This film represents the very best of what America wants to be at its core. I appreciate high brow multi-million dollar productions as much as any other film geek/ movie buff, but this film always brings me home because it reminds me of what really matters in life. Watch it and savor every wholesome corny second of it. If you don't feel something, you are not human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film several times now, and the first time it really had me suckered. George Bailey really did have a wonderful life, after all. His wonderful friends and family got together to do a wonderful thing for him in his time of trouble. And Clarence got his wings... pass the Kleenex, quick!Then I started to think: George Bailey never got to travel the world and fulfil his potential to be a great architect. All his dreams faded and died as he struggled to run a business and raise a family. And what thanks did he get? His father dropped dead and landed him with the family business. His brother sold him out by getting married to the boss's daughter and landing himself in Easy Street. His uncle makes him liable for a larceny rap by losing thousands of dollars. OK, friends make up the shortfall and even the bank examiner joins in the goodwill, but - back in the cold, real world, maybe in January - George would still have to explain where the money had gone. If he couldn't do that he would still be seen as an embezzler of company funds. And meanwhile that nasty, villainous Mr Potter has got a nice little Christmas present - no sign of him making nice and handing it back.And then there's Pottersville - wow! Bars, music and women. A dance with Gloria Grahame - preferably a horizontal Mambo - would be worth any red-blooded man's hard earned cash, surely? (Ms Grahame played at my local UK theatre in 1980. She was still as sexy as hell and, apparently, a lovely person to work with.) Of course, you could always listen to the snow fall and watch 'The Bells of St Mary's' instead.So, from snuffling into my sleeve at first viewing, I am now horrified at the crabbed, stifled, thwarted, frustrated, cramped 'life' it tells us we should consider 'Wonderful'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lone dissenting vote on It's A Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to be the lone dissenter here, but I think It's a Wonderful Life stands right up there as one of the most overrated movies of all time. Not that it is a particularly bad movie, but I cannot see how it rates on everyones top ten list. True, the story is interesting and a bit intriguing, and it has a couple of good scenes. But you take out the scene where Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed are dancing and they fall in the pool, and you take away the last five minutes of the movie, then there is not much left. And speaking of the last five minutes of the movie, that is the only reference in the whole movie to Christmas, yet this movie has been branded a Christmas movie. To me, in terms of Christmas movies, it does not belong in the same category (or class) as Miracle on 34th Street, White Christmas, A Christmas Story, and yes, Even Home Alone, Parts I and II. I will give it one thing, the ending to this movie is truly one of the best of any movie ever made. But to me, a movie has to have more than a good ending with a Christmas setting to be called either a classic movie or a Christmas movie. Oh well, the minority has spoken.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this film in the wake of the banking crisis, it is apt to have a different effect on the viewer than that intended. The actions of George Bailey and his father amount to a long justification for "sub-prime" mortgages,"sub prime" being a euphemism for "lending to people who have no chance of paying you back" which has lead to the present day bank bailouts which means that responsible people now must pay for the actions of the irresponsible. Why does doing this make George and his dad the good guys? Why, for that matter, are we told that George's father only made enough money to send one of his kids to college? Is that meant to be good? Surely, in the real world, that would make him a poor father? He has clearly never heard the truism "charity begins at home" although he did have enough money to hire a black servant..perhaps he should have saved the money he spent on her to put his kids through college? Just a thought.Obviously Hollywood will never get to grips with the real life implications of the Bailey's irresponsible lending policies, ie people being lumbered with unpayable mortgages and losing their homes. No, this is the land of magic pixie dust where good intentions always lead to good outcomes. The reality is transformed into a one dimensional baddie, an evil capitalist who could come straight out of the Stalinist propaganda of the period (in fact this film could have easily be shown in the USSR without a single cut whereas it was -rightly- a box office flop in the US). Oh, if only there weren't these greedy evil people, if only banks could lend money to good people without worrying whether they could pay it back, then how much nicer the world would be! Around this childish morality, a sanctimonious and saccharine story is built. Even by Hollywood's golden age standards it is extremely sentimental. I must say in passing, I've attempted to watch this film many times, but this this is the first time I've managed to make it all the way through and only through gritted teeth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Frank Capra's bittersweet, heartwarming Christmas movie is a wonderful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings'. That is the quest for the guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers) when he was assign to take care of a suicidal man named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart). Clarence must try to show George, the tremendous impact he has had on his community before it's too late. Can Clarence, change George's mind or will this Christmas, be the last for George Baily? To find out, watch the movie! Made just after World War 2, this movie was a favorite for both leading man Jimmy Stewart and director Frank Capra. It's easy to see why. There's so much things to like, about this film. The film is full of delightful moments, from music and a dance sequence, funny comedy, and heart-warming romantic scenes. While, some critics might see this film as too sentimental and syrupy. In fact, in my view, most of the movie's vision is something out of a more modern complex, dark-edged sophisticated film. Yes, there are some really dated dialogue, sayings and behavior, but for the most part, I think modern audiences can still, watch this movie and find something about it, that they can related to. No matter how often, you get to see this Christmas favorite, there is always something timeless with this film, when you do. Important message about the value of an individual life and how one person's actions affect all those around him/her is a great life moral for people to take. Themes about family and friendship are also very important. Another great message is having faith, and belief in yourself and the future. After all, director Frank Capra himself said he made the film in large part to "combat a modern trend towards atheism and Nihilism". While, a lot of people say, that this movie isn't really a Christmas movie, due to the fact, that 90% of the movie is a story about George's life and takes place at some point in time other than Christmas; in my view, the whole Clarence arch, wouldn't had work as good as it did, on any other day of the year. There is something about Christmas, that makes the whole magically redemption story with Clarence somewhat believable. Based on the short story "The Greatest Gift," by author Philip Van Doren Stern, It's a Wonderful Life was never intended to be the Christmastime staple that it is now. In fact, when the film was first released back in 1946, it was generally considered a box-office flop. This film had a resurgence for a while in the U.S. during the 1980s when it was discovered that the copyright on the film was never renewed, which meant the film was in the Public Domain and any television station could legally show it as often as they wanted without paying for a license. Many stations across the country would run it, around Christmas time, to the point, that people label it as a Christmas movie. No matter, if it's a holiday movie, or not. A lot of critics, has point out, that the film protagonist's action are very similar to a Christ figure in all. I have to say, they're somewhat right, but there were some moments that George Bailey got really problematic to sympathize with. Some people feel that brought all his problems on himself by choosing to run an over-leveraged, illiquid bank business even though he's given many opportunities to do something else. However, I didn't find it, too abrasive to watch. What I didn't like, is how he treat Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) for most of the film. He was a little too mean-spirited to her; mostly in the beginning of the film He nearly ruin his first date with her. I really didn't like that. Thank heavens, he got more likable, as the film goes on. Still, the drunk driving scene was a bit hard to watch. Anyways, Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as George. I'm glad, he didn't quit, acting after the war. He gives the performance of a lifetime, here. Alternately affable and bitter, he is the movie's little-man hero. All of his emotional were, mostly play as for real. Seeing this, Capra had to reframe the shot in order to get it closer than was actually filmed because he wanted to catch the expression on Stewart's face. At the time, this shot was an extremely time-consuming project, each frame had to be done individually, making it only one step away from stop-motion animation. Capra spent the whole night doing it. Thank Goodness, he did! Most of the supporting cast are just as good as Stewart, but one-person stands out. Donna Reed is wonderful, despite her character being a one-dimensional manic pixie dream girl. She was really able to show the character's beautiful, supporting and caring nature. Just say the word, Mary, and I'll lasso you, the moon, indeed! I just don't buy the idea that George and Mary are somehow supposed to be soulmates. It's a bit unrealistic to think that Mary can only love George. Nor, do I believe, without spoiling it, that the ending of this film seen can be seem as "happy". After all, George is still in the same position he was before Clarence show up. An investigation is still looming. There are tons of others puzzling questions, still worth debating. So a rewatch, is needed. One thing, when watching it, is not to watch the color version. The black and white works well, to show the symbolic snow of the peaceful Bedford Falls, when compare to the cold and dark sleet of Potterville. It's better to watch that, since Paramount had all the grain removed in 2006. Overall: This well-known sentimental film is a masterpiece. Capra's Magnum Opus. A must-watch. So check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of an handful of movies I can watch time and time again, it never shows its age. Its always Christmas once I have watched this or should say feels like the holidays once I have watched it Frank Capras film shows us why is one of the most popular and enduring festive films of all time,with its gloriously sentimental testament to homely small-town moral values and how we all influence each others life's along the way and what would happen if fate was given a nudge in a different direction.James Stewart gives one of his finest, most affecting performances, though he was always great at portraying the everyman character that most people can relate to, even us outside the US. This film and Scrooge and Christmas Carol (the George Minter one from the 1950's) are my all time favourite feel good Christmas movies, though I have Elf on here as well. Overall its a great film and I am amazed to know it bombed at the box office, even though its now a well loved classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably James Stewart best performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest before I watch It's a Wonderful Life, I really don't like James Stewart. I watched him in Vertigo, Rear Window, and other Hitchcock's movie, and I don't like him at all, I think he was so typical and 1 dimensional. After I watched him in this movie, I start to like him, especially when he acted in the last part. Well I guest I just hate Hitchcock as a director, not Stewart as an actor. Back to the movie, at first I don't like it because Stewart looks so older when he was playing as teenager Bailey -.-". After half of the movie I don't really care, I guess I am such a sucker for Christmas family movie, the golden part of this movie is the last part after Bailey met the angel, Stewart showed that he is good actor in this part. In the end this is good family movie if you like Christmas film.</fullReview>

In addition, consideration. If people have consideration and kindness, and act of kindness, people will be rewarded someday. I think that god doesn't betray great person. God looks people. Also, people look great person, too. After experiencing pain, happiness is waiting absolutely. If we do everything whole- heartedly, result follows us.

		<fullReview>I had heard of It's a Wonderful Life for years, however had never watched it. This Christmas I sat down to watch it and was taken aback by the phenomenal film. The acting was spot on and the filming was perfect despite how old the movie is. This film made me sad, mad, and happy all at the same time. The actors show emotion well enough to make the viewers feel the same way. Throughout the movie you question why you would want to see such a story, however the end scene brings it all full circle. It's a great movie to watch during Christmas to give you that warm fuzzy feeling inside. This movie fortifies faith in human generosity and is the best feel good movie I have ever seen.

		<fullReview>Despite the age of this movie, the story of the movie is an incredibly marvelous one. The story of how one often underestimates his/her own life especially under sickening burdens.The flow is quite a slow on the start, up to three-quarter parts of the movie. But it picks up at about the last half-hour and builds up a fast paced yet long and detailed finale.There are also things to compensate, regarding the age of the production, such as the color, the spoken accent which sounds quite stupid for the current times. But besides those, I think the story is a strong one that it helps the movie overcome those obstacles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God forbid if they ever attempt to remake this movie in any way. I know they probably already have in different versions and ways of telling the story, but this is a movie that will never die. Like everyone else, I and my family watch this movie every Christmas eve. It's like a tradition in a lot of families who celebrate Christmas. The best thing about it, is that this movie never gets old. You know the story, you know what is going to happen every Christmas you watch this. But this movie has a very deep meaning to it that a lot of movies in the history of film DON'T have. Every Christmas eve I watch this it gets me in the perfect Christmas mood, and makes me forget about all the worries, problems, and struggles I have to put up with in life. This movie teaches me that everyone in the world can make a difference, and that everyone, no matter who you are has a purpose of existing. Even when its not the holiday season, I'll just watch a couple scenes of this movie just to put me in a good mood anyway. They just can't make movies like this anymore that teach you a very meaningful lesson. Even to people who don't celebrate Christmas can still enjoy this film. I can't wait for Christmas this year, for it is my favorite time of the year, and the time to be very happy in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has what I love most about films, "Inspiration". The story really is built up in such a way that you'll eventually get inspired by it. Acting by James Stewart is superb. The story is about a man who wanted to do a lot of things, but circumstances changed his fate. He never lost hope, but one day things get really out of controlled and he loses faith in everything. It is very interesting to see how the story reaches to its ending.PROS:One of the best acting performances I had seen recently. The whole film rests on its beautiful story. The film is a very fine example of what we expect from life and what we actually get. The life of our hero seems to be frustrating a lot of times but than in the end, you are finally going to get convinced that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.CONSI admit that the whole angel thing did not impress me much and I was hoping for more realistic kind of thing. Also the editing at some later part of the film looked bad. It was nominated for the best editing Oscars, but just my opinion. But when you have a very fine story, you have to overlook these small glitches.MESSAGE: "It's a wonderful life."VERDICT: "A must watch for all."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So often the movies that claim the top spot on people's "Best Movies" lists are iconic films that are suitable to watch any time of year. "Gone With the Wind", "Casablanca", "The Godfather", and many more would easily fit into that category, and certainly those movies along with your favorite that I'm leaving out all should be in the discussion whenever we talk about the best movie ever made.But whenever I'm asked that question, be it now (five days before Christmas in 2014) or in mid June or July, the movie that I always come back to time and again is the iconic Christmas movie, "It's a Wonderful Life." This movie is the greatest film ever made.The film features James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who dreams of seeing the world only to be a victim of fate that finds him staying in his hometown and running the family business, the Bailey Savings &amp; Loan Company in the fictional town of Bedford Falls. James Stewart turns out the performance of his career (barring no other role, including "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). The tale sees him fall in love with Mary (Donna Reed, who offers a similarly strong performance as supporting actress). The two are wed and life goes well for a while, until a fateful day when George's world comes crashing down on him, prompting him to wish he had never been born...only to eventually realize what a wonderful life he has.The story is of course much more complex than that brief summary, but it's the story itself that is the most prevalent star in this movie. The script is a masterpiece in the art of conveying an entertaining and emotional narrative, taking the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Over the course of two hours you grow to love George Bailey for his character and his perseverance in standing up for the little guy against the tyrannical Mr. Potter, the film's antagonist. When George is elated, you feel it with him. When the frustration of life overwhelms him, you sympathize with him. When he finds himself in the midst of great despair, your heart breaks. And when his grief turns to joy, your heart swells....along with your eyes. I cannot watch this film without crying time and again in its final minutes.Along with the acting and the script, the other major contributing factor to this movie being such a wonderful film is its cinematography. I have seen this movie pop up on "film noir" lists from time to time, and I'm not sure that I would agree with that categorization at all, given that film noir movies tend to be more tragic in nature. That said, though, there are a few scenes in which the film uses strong shadow effect in a similar way that noir films are known to do. In at least two scenes, Stewart is shown staring prominently into the camera as he realizes the gravity of certain situations he finds himself in. Those scenes become impressed in your memory after you've seen the film a time or two, and overall the film is well produced with good scenes and settings, and good camera work.All of this makes "It's a Wonderful Life" my pick for the Greatest Film Ever Made. We may not always think of it immediately when we're sitting around the picnic table in the summertime thinking about great movies, but it's nevertheless a top notch movie that stands out for its artistic and cinematic value in a way that makes it much more than just a "Christmas movie". The wonderful story and well constructed script, the tremendous acting, and the excellent camera-work and film production all make this movie the cream of the crop.10 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is an epic story of the life of a man named George Bailey. George spends this life living in a small town, with his nose deep in the lives and problems of its other citizens. He dreams of seeing the world, of conquering it, but somehow always postpones that in order to battle his arch-nemesis - the ruthless local businessman Mr. Potter. Potter perpetually has his sights set on utterly dominating the town's cash flows and, effectively, its life. The idealistic and charitable Bailey family, especially George, are the one thing that persistently prevents Potter from succeeding.However, George has his share of troubles, and they eventually begin to take their toll on his good nature and optimistic outlook. It's now up to his guardian angel, Clarence Goodbody, to open George's eyes to how wonderful his life really is.IAWL promotes friendship, empathy, optimism, and love of life. You can't but admire the excellent way in which it does this. The story, the sets, the actors, the dialogue, the music are all top-notch. Highly recommended! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Really A Most Wonderful Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's A Wonderful Life" is the most wonderful film I have ever seen. It's most inspirational movie I have ever watched and it's very perfectly made movie in my opinion. Performances, script and dialogs are so perfectly done that you don't have enough words to appreciate them. This film by Frank Capra is a gift to the world. Strange enough it was a box office flop when it was released and it failed to win an academy award.The performance by James Stewart who plays George Bailey is one of the greatest on big screen by anyone anytime in the history. George Bailey makes you so engrossed with his emotions that it naturally calls for your empathy and you start living moments with him and start thinking for him. Even if you don't believe in the angels and God, the part where that comely angel starts alleviating suffering of George Bailey makes a profound impression on you and instills feelings of goodness in you. The second half just emphasizes the importance of life whereas the first one underscores the great character of George Bailey right from his childhood.You witness some instant karmic clean up in the second half and you see how the good deeds George Bailey had done come back to him saving him and making him realize the importance of life he had. Prior to that he lives with the impression of having sacrificed a lot for everyone else and that had some inner lack of satisfaction in his life and the accident which renders bankruptcy to him and his organization just evokes this karmic burden to the fore and then it seems that all the wrong things start happening with him, but then his good deeds come to his rescue. There are so many well-wishers who pray for him and then he realizes importance of life and accepts it the way it's and with this acceptance miracles start happening and money for which was about to end his life; comes rolling on its own and his brother says "To George, the richest man in the town". The colored restored version made it look even more exquisite than it would have been when it was made. It's indeed a most wonderful film with a most inspiring climax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I would be able of ever cast an objective statement regarding the quality of this movie. It's not one of this movies I can objectively say which rating does it deserve in a 1 to 10 scale, because it reached something in me way beyond objectifiable maths and numbers. Yes, it may sound super cheesy, but it did reach my heart. I don't even know how it happened, but it was definitely a slow, progressive proccess. The more you get to know George's life, the more difficult it is to wish the best for that man even if he doesn't exist beyond the flat screen. Art is very much about creating an illusion of reality, and some say that if an art piece doesn't cast a spell on you that makes you believe you're appreciating the real world, then it is bad art. When you're reading a novel and you're able to abstract from it and make sense of the fact that all the characters are just plane words on a blank page, is because the spell was not correctly cast and the book you're reading is a bad one. Well, at some point during the movie I stopped to think why on earth was I so touched by just a bunch of pixels in my computer's screen, because I couldn't understand how could I care so much for a person that doesn't even exist. I guess that the answer to that is that people like George do exist, and we're surrounded everywhere by those people who make our lives better, and that sometimes life doesn't give back to them what they deserve. I guess that's the reason why, in the last scene, I just started to cry like a baby, not just a timid tear, but lots of them, up until the movie finished. I don't remember having cried this way for a movie before. I still need to digest this movie, it'll take me a while.</fullReview>

Storytelling in cinemas changed and that is not always a bad thing. The setup took to long and the struggle of the hero was not believable for me. The acting was good (more or less). The moral of the story was lame. "Your life makes a difference!" It is a calendar motto, the message of a cheap self-improvement book. Maybe I am not romantic enough to enjoy this movie. To me it was OK, but it was not a "revelation". Not a movie, that I want to watch "over and over".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't get it. I just watched it for the first time and did not like it...And I wanted, really. I like old movies, I get a nice feeling watching old classics and I enjoy some over sentimental holiday movie at the right season, but this one just didn't do it for me.I do like the main idea. That no matter how disappointed you are about your life and yourself, just take a step back and see how you may have affected other people's lives. How many good things would not have happened if you weren't there. This is all nice, but I didn't like how it was made and presented.It is sooooo loooong and boring until the last 20 minutes or so when the angel finally shows him the world without him. And you know what, it seems it would have been better if he wasn't born. Seriously, what is so bad about Potterville? It has entertainment and people having fun? Oh how evil, so immoral! Apparently life is only good if you don't have fun and never pursue your dreams!.Don't like George's character either. He is the one who never went for what he wanted. And while James Stewart might be a good actor, he wasn't one in this movie. I thought he was awful.I also don't like how they made the girl who enjoyed to have fun the bad one. Well once again, people who enjoy life, especially females, are just horrible aren't they? This is still a common sentiment. Although the idea that Mary would be an "old maid" librarian without George is a bit outdated by now. Now she would have a cat as well. Poor her, she didn't get the joy of being a housewife but had to be a working woman without a man.So yes, I don't get the love for it. Is it just sentimentality of having watched it back in childhood for Christmas or is it the redneck hype of the "good old days" and "family values"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Second Most Overrated Movie Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1946 audience quite correctly stayed away in droves, making IAWL a box office flop. Generations later, after its initial failure, after public domain, after the not even born when it came out pseudo critics have somehow brainwashed almost everyone under 40 into believing IAWL is a Christmas classic, we must face the fact that IAWL is not only not a great movie, it's not even a good movie.Treacly, sappy, overlong, exasperatingly predictable fairy tale with just two good scenes and a main character devoid of interest, empathy or sympathy, IAWL is an exercise in futility at every turn. To begin, this is closer to James Stewart's worst performance than his best; George Bailey is a dreamer with his thoughts in the stars, rather than focused on the very big problem at hand. He's a naive, crybaby whiner with just the right mix of stupid to make him truly annoying to one and all. And he takes forever to realize Clarence is an Angel; I mean, how many miracles does it take?This turkey comes to life only twice - the scene between young George and the druggist, played by the always great H.B. Warner, in which George (brilliantly portrayed throughout by the underrated child actor Bobby Anderson) stops the grieving Warner - who has learned of his son's death - from dispensing a fatal dose of the wrong medication to an elderly customer; and the ending, which, while just as sugar-sweet as the rest of the movie, is so well crafted, it works wonderfully well, giving the film a 2 on the scale of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Either extremely dated or doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered to be an extremely uplifting movie by most and hailed as the greatest Christmas movie ever made (and even the director hailed it as his favourite movie until he died... that doesn't make him sound egotistical at all!) I was intrigued and decided to watch it and... It suffers from being both too dated and (for me personally) not being that realistic, I mean - yeah, I could tell by the concept that it wouldn't be realistic but I'll elaborate more on it below.So the movie opens with everyone in town praying really hard for George Bailey, a man who seems to be going through problems. So God decides to send down a novice angel to convince him out of suicide by looking at his life and subsequently showing him what life would be like if he never existed.Okay, the story is really really good. No, really - I love concepts like this and I'll say to this movie's credit I can see why it had the impact it had in the 1940's. I probably will continue to praise the idea and say that I usually love it when premises like this show up. What doesn't work for me however is the execution.I don't know, throughout this movie George Bailey frequently has to be a doormat for the people around him. Stuff like him taking his father's job and ensuring the greedy rich guy (whom God himself introduces to the audience as "The richest and meanest man in the county"... SUBTLE!) get richer, okay I can see him trying to stop the town living in slums which is basically what he does but giving all his honeymoon money away to the clients at the bank for loaning just makes me think that might be a bit too much. But the thing that really pushes my buttons is when the poor guy has to take the fall for a mistake made that wasn't even his fault! Oh and the ending where despite losing $8000 1940's money the townspeople manage to chip in and pay it all off? I don't know if that's a product of this movie ageing but I can't see this happening. I'd say if the bank I had lost the equivalent of $8000 to the 1940's I'd be very scared about my finances first.Okay, now onto the part that makes me dislike the "What life would be like if you were never born" well... It's too short for one thing. It's extremely out of proportion with introducing this character and we have what feels like 20 minutes spent in bizarro-world. Either way, I have problems with it. What happens to the wife is extremely dated and sexist, if you want to watch a movie where it's portrayed as the ultimate crime for a woman to never marry and learn at the library then this won't bother you so much. Oh and one last thing plot related, everyone - EVERYONE is portrayed as either the paragon of all niceness or a cold-hearted, thieving maniac, this really is the source of most of my problems with this movie, nobody seems to be a shade of grey at all when it comes to the character's morality and that to me is unrealistic.Okay, what else? I'll say this movie is quite well shot though and the acting for the most part is pretty good (I say for the most part because the child actors are terrible) and I will re-iterate that I really love the story. I'll say that the execution either doesn't work or doesn't age well. I will also re-iterate that I know my opinion isn't the popular consensus and if your opinion differs from mine then I'm not asking you to dislike the movie with me, I just feel as though I should share my own opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely, It's A Wonderful Life is in my top 5 movies of all time. Frank Capra also in my top 5 directors of all generation. Yet, James Stewart is one of my favorite actor. This was the best formation ever. Indisputably, Capra, without any serious contemplation, exalted as one of the most talented drama-director ever borne in this world. He was a master of film-maker. Any movies he touch, will always persist as classic for the next generation. It's A Wonderful Life, Casablanca, and Mr. Smith Goes To Washington was the prove. They were all masterpiece.The performance by two leads was Hollywood's's classic. Yet the plot was magnificent, i know this movie will be something since i watch the prologue (the bell ringing and narration). This plot style is one of the best, wide and depth but simple in complexity. Then it is bonded with strong drama-background. A man regret his life because of the problems within him. This film has very high moral impact to the audience. Maybe this is one of the most influential movie ever. This movie is about thanking your life to god. To be honest, this film was one of the most inspirational for me. This was one of movies that shaped my character. One of my good character and habits comes from this film. It shaped my moral. It taught me so many lessons in my life. How to struggle in the hard times, how to enjoy and share the happiness with others, how to become a good ones, how to diminish my bad feelings to others, and the most important thing is, how to always thanking my life, because without it, i wouldn't meet the person i truly love now, i don't know what is it to love and to be loved by someone you truly care, i wouldn't know of these feelings. Of course in our life, we will face the hard times sometimes, maybe for some people most of their live is hard times. But always remember, if you ever regret your life and choose not to live, you wouldn't feel the joy anymore. And don't forget, a small happiness can erase the whole pain you got before. Life is wonderfully beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1945 short story "The Greatest Gift" by Philip Van Doren Stern, this is a quintessential Christmas classic that I never saw before today. It is not only a wonderful life but a wonderful film. Its excellent script by Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett and Frank Capra chronicles the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. The film serves as a reminder that the most important thing in life is other people and that no one is truly a failure so long as they have friends, which is the perfect Christmas message. I had never previously seen one of Capra's films but I was very much impressed by his direction and his superb handling of the material. I was expecting to love the film as I'm a big softie who loves old, sentimental films but I loved it even more than I thought I would.The film stars Jimmy Stewart in perhaps his best performance as George Bailey, a much loved institution in the small town of Bedford Falls who is contemplating suicide on Christmas Eve 1945. We are introduced to George as a 12-year-old boy in 1919 when he saves his younger brother Harry from drowning after he falls through the ice. In the process, he loses the hearing in his left ear, something which becomes symbolic of the sacrifices that he makes for others. For many years, he entertains the dream of exploring Europe and South America in order to escape the monotony of Bedford Falls where everyone knows everyone else. Over the years, he displays his propensity for selflessness time and time again. His dream dies a death and he never leaves home. On that fateful Christmas Eve, he comes to believe that he has accomplished nothing in his life. Thankfully, however, he is proved wrong after he wishes that he had never been born. Without knowing it, he has single-handedly prevented the town and many of its inhabitants from falling into darkness and despair. George is a great character who, in spite of being a thoroughly decent man, is not perfect as he falls victim to the same depression that anyone else in his position on Christmas Eve 1945 would. He thinks of himself before others but these scenes serve to humanise him. Except for Henry Fonda and Gregory Peck if he were a few years older, I don't think that anyone other than Stewart could have played this role so well.Donna Reed is excellent as George's incredibly loyal, supportive and understanding wife Mary Hatch Bailey, who has harboured a crush on him from the time that they were children. Although George initially does not seem to be interested in her and tells her that he never wants to get married, he realises that he is in love with her. Mary is a kind, somewhat shy woman who is a perfect partner for George. They are like two peas in a pod. She tells George that she would have ended up an old maid without him and this is proved to be the case in the reality where George was never born. I think that Mary could have easily married someone else in the other reality as I am sure that she would had her fair share of suitors but George was the only man for her and she was the only woman for him. Crucially, Stewart and Reed have great chemistry. The scene in which George and Mary are listening to the phone while standing very close together is one of the best romantic scenes that I have ever seen in a film. It is so simple but it works so well. Lionel Barrymore is suitably vile as Bedford Falls' wealthiest and most immoral citizen Henry F. Potter, a "warped, frustrated old man" who sees the Baileys as a thorn in his side. Consistent with the film's thematic links to "A Christmas Carol", Mr. Potter is similar to Scrooge prior to his redemption but I found him to be even more despicable. He is a great film villain who almost succeeds in crushing George's spirit, telling him that he is worth more dead than alive. He is not seen in the other reality but he has gained control of the town and has renamed it Pottersville, turning it into a den of iniquity. Henry Travers has very little screen time but he is fantastic as George's eccentric, whimsical guardian angel Clarence Odbody. His manner serves as a very effective contrast to George's depression before he realises that he has a great deal to live for. The film also features great performances from Thomas Mitchell as the sweet but scatterbrained Uncle Billy Bailey, H.B. Warner as Mr. Gower, Frank Faylen as Ernie Bishop, Gloria Grahame as Violet Bick and Todd Karns as Harry Bailey. It also features small appearances from Charles Lane, Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer and the future television producer Sheldon Leonard.Overall, this is a sublime film which shows that one man can make more of a difference to the lives of others than he ever through possible. I have to admit that I cried at the end. I honestly cannot remember the last time that I cried because of a film and I have watched over 500 in less than two years. I plan to watch this every Christmas season from now on. There is talk of a sequel in which Karolyn Grimes will reprise her role as George's daughter Zasu (now a guardian angel herself) but, since it is unlicensed, it is unlikely to materialise. In any event, I would not be terribly interested. Without Jimmy Stewart, what's the point?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a wonderful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is indeed a wonderful Christmas movie, where James Stewart plays George Bailey, who has dreams of moving out of his town (Bedford Walls) going to college, having an established career and seeing the world. However, after his father's demise, he reluctantly takes on the family business (a loan company), indefinitely putting his dreams on hold.This is a classic story that definitely reminds you of the more innocent times in America and reminds you things will always turn out all right at the end if you have enough hope and faith. The plot keeps you engaged from start to finish as you follow George Bailey's life, from his times as a preteen to him taking on the family business, and finally to him getting married and raising a family of his own - all the while seeing his dreams fade away. However, when things get too down in the dumps for him, an angel tries to help him out of despair and lets him see what would life be like in George's town without him being born. This reminds you to never take anything for granted and to always appreciate what you have.It's a great movie with heartwarming moments and great acting. James Stewart and leading lady Donna Reed had great chemistry together. And, the rest of the cast, from Lionel Barrymore as the villainous Mr. Potter to Henry Travers as the angel Clarence, all did a wonderful job.Even as a movie made in the 1940s, it holds up very well through the test of time and is surely one of the greatest to watch during Christmas time. Highly recommend! Grade A</fullReview>

I guess audience and critics back then could not support another inspirational film vs Best years of Our Lives which deserved much acclaim after WW 2. Stewart did deserve the Oscar though and that would have made 2 if they got it right, since he should have won for MR Smith goes to washington.director Frank Capra does a tremendous job and its a shame he wasn't given more time and money for creative jobs. BTW its fascinating that the snow scenes were filmed on days of heat waves and you see Stewart sweating in the scenes.

		<fullReview>The concrete lessons from this film: 1) the world is a thankless place, and 2) 99.9% of the time, you will not receive help if you don't ask for it. The final act of the film, I am immediately concerned with George Bailey's apparent closet-alcoholism. I know he has finally hit, what he believes, anyway, the rock-bottom of hopelessness in his business, and the only way to go through with his final plan is to get very drunk. I suppose it is also fitting that he has to become incredibly drunk in order to meet Clarence, and "enter" Pottersville, modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah. Like nearly every repeat watcher of this film, George's return home is overwhelmingly emotional. That the financial downfall of the building and loan can bring an entire community together like that is amazing, and hopeful for humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a classic. There is very little negative that I can say about it. The acting is incredible and the plot is great and iconic. The film hit with me a lot of different emotional levels and is definitely can be a tear-jerker at times but is uplifting at the end when George wishes he was born again and goes back to his family. The film plays out as a life story for our main character George Bailey and follows the different events in his life such as the people he meets and the things he does. It is powerful and touching and a iconic masterpiece. It is not only a great movie but a great Christmas movie as well. It is something that everyone should see at least once in their life because it teaches great lessons about life. It is not always happy as it does get a little sad at moments but when you sit down and watch it you can have fun with it because it really is just that great of a film. Definitely something worth watching every Christmas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films. I heard that it's still nominated as films which people want to watch in Christmas seasons in the US. Although this film was published in 1946, it's still popular among the people. The lesson of this film, I suppose, is that we mustn't give up until the end. We cannot guess what will happen in our future. Even if we had serious problems, an angel might help us. We cannot prove what is impossible in our world.I've watched some films in which Jim Stewart, who is the star of this film, appears. In these films, I like 'It's a Wonderful Life' the best.His way to act is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider this movie as one of my inspirational movies. I think there are many lessons that we can take from the story. In life, sometimes we feel down, nobody cares with us, no choices in life, and many others desperate things. We might feel like why we should be born in this condition, or why is God gives this problem to us, or anything else. But, we should reconsider how wonderful life is.! From the movie we can learn that life is like a cobweb. We don't know that thing which happened to us, might be connected and give the influence to other's life. We don't know that the thing we do is might be a history. We don't know how is precious our life for others, for our family, our friends, and for people around us. We can think that the thing is disaster, but we never knew how great that thing and what is God's planned for us. From the movie we can see that George might feel very desperate and thought that better not to be born. But, God has his own plan! And no matter how hard the problem is, God can always helps his slaves. We should not be regretful to everything happened in our life. Even how hard our life is, we should consider that God is exist, and we have many friends that still willing to help us and give us their support. We are human being, we don't know the future, we don't know that every problems has its solution behind. That we need just belief that LIFE IS WONDERFUL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawless movie that never grows old.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's A Wonderful Life" is a 1946 movie directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time: the three-time Oscar-winning director, Frank Capra.The film is set in a fictional North American village, and tells the story of an ordinary guy, George Bailey (James Stewart in the role of his life) from his childhood to his adult age.The first hour of the film is like a summary where we witness some events of George's life: his first love (the astonishing Donna Reed playing the role of the woman everybody would like to marry), the death of his father, his wedding... But the real aim of this introduction is making us feel utterly identified with Stewart's character: a good man who has been constantly sacrificing his dreams to help his family (renouncing to go to University to stay in charge of the family business), his friends (lending them money through his company whenever they need it) and many other members of his community.Capra then focuses on an unfortunate incident of George's current life that leaves him totally broken and makes him believe his whole existence so far has no sense, what finally will lead him to attempt suicide.Then, an angel from heaven appears to help George by letting him see how different (and worse) the life of all the people he knows would have been if he hadn't been born. In other words: in the middle of an incredibly intense family drama, Capra did something that nobody had done before (and nobody would dare to do again) in movie history: he changed completely the gender of the story... after almost 2 hours of movie!!! Therefore, a drama film suddenly became a fantasy film... but, surprisingly, it worked perfectly well because those last 30 minutes still remain as one of the most touching endings in movie history.Curiously, the movie was not only a flop, but it was also defeated in the Oscars by "The Best Years of Our Lives", incidentally, my favorite movie of all time. But what is harder to believe is that Stewart wasn't awarded for one of the most outstanding performances ever given by an actor.Fortunately, as years went by, this masterpiece eventually reached the critical recognition it always deserved and nowadays it's constantly included in the lists of greatest motion pictures ever made... including mine. It became even more legendary when TV channels all over the world started to show it on TV every Christmas since the 1970s decade.But "It's A Wonderful Life" is much more than a Christmas movie: it's a gripping and moving work of art, a masterpiece that never grows old, but mostly, a film you never get tired of watching over and over again. I think that's the best compliment for any movie.</fullReview>

The whole scene where they are walking home is good.* I like when Sam is explaining about plastic and getting them to invest. It is kind of upsetting because George has longed to get out of the little town, but he is falling in love with Mary. It is very conflicting, does he love Mary and stay in the small town and have a family or leave the small town.* Some parts are frustrating or upsetting, George's father dies, Potter is trying to take over George's late father's business, George will never get his dream of leaving the small town, Potter tries to have George arrested.*The end is wonderful when his friends come to his rescue. It makes me cry. And George's family house servant says the money she is giving to help George is the money she was saving for a divorce if she ever got married. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Life Makes A Difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many this is a Christmas classic, watched every year and much beloved. For me, I've never seen it before. Heard of it; seen short clips of it; but never have I sat down and watched it straight through from beginning to end. Having now done that I can understand why it's such a beloved movie to so many people. It isn't necessarily a Christmas/holiday movie. The basic message would work at any time of the year; it just happens to be set (in its climax anyway) on Christmas Eve. And the message it presents is an important one that everyone needs to hear from time to time, in a world where it's so easy to feel discouraged: every person's life counts. Everyone makes a difference. That's the point here, and it's well made. The movie revolves around George Bailey (James Stewart.) George starts out as a kid with big dreams of escaping his hum-drum (to him) home town of Bedfork Park and seeing the world. But it never works out. He ends up running the small savings &amp; loan operation his father started, while his brother and his friends all seem to go on to bigger and better things - becoming heroes; becoming famous; becoming rich. George has a good life. He's married to a woman he loves (Donna Reed) and he has great kids and a lot of friends, but it just isn't what he always wanted. It's not completely satisfying for him. Eventually it all falls apart when the local ruthless banker (Lionel Barrymore) comes up with a way of bringing him down. With everything apparently out of control, George decides to kill himself, only to be rescued by the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) who shows him what Bedford Park would be like if he had never existed - and it's not pretty.The story isn't complicated. It's simple and straightforward. Everybody does a good job in it. Personally, I thought there was perhaps a little too much emphasis on George's life and what brought him to the brink of suicide, and maybe not quite enough emphasis on George being confronted by the consequences of his non-existence. (And, in the alternative timeline, Bert the cop opening fire on George in the street seemed a bit - shall we say - excessive; not to mention dangerous!) Perhaps the opening, with God and the angels talking to each other as stars and other heavenly bodies was a bit too cute, but it's all within the expected standards of 1946. It is a nice movie, and it does have a nice message. Your life does make a difference to a lot of people - probably more than you know, so be satisfied with it and rejoice in what you have. I can easily understand why so many consider it a classic. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw IAWL for the first time last night. While it's not the best movie I have ever seen, it is very good and worth watching at least once. It is allegorical and thus shouldn't be held to exacting standards, as some reviews have done, in my opinion. The movie gets you to think about how your life impacts others and how we should treat one another better. For that I think it succeeds quite nicely. I think Jimmy Stewart did an excellent job of portraying George Bailey. He is fundamentally a good person, but like all of us, is given to bouts of anger and emotion, and lashes out against the people he loves. He quickly realizes his errors and apologizes for them. He is frustrated by his responsibilities and obligations intruding on his dreams, but he does the right thing in the end. We can all related to this and learn a few things by his example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life is like a photo negative (or positive) of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The Ebenezer Scrooge character in Capra's film, Mr. Potter (played perfectly by Lionel Barrymore), rather than occupying the position of the main character, is the antagonist. The protagonist in the film is the Bob Cratchit character from Dickens' story, a man named George Bailey (played perfectly by Jimmy Stewart). The supernatural (or imaginary) visions and visitations in A Christmas Carol comprise the bulk of the story, whereas the same in It's a Wonderful Life take up less than fifteen percent of the movie's screen time, although it seems like much more. In A Christmas Carol, we have an extremely unlikable central character, who is shown what the world would be like if he doesn't change; in It's a Wonderful Life, we have an immensely likable central character, who is shown what the world would be like if he had never existed. This second part of the film?in which George's guardian angel Clarence (a delightful Henry Travers) shows George how "each man's life touches so many other lives"?is a fun-house-mirror look back at the first part?a fantasy that resembles a rough night of drinking: fun and frivolous at first?then serious, painful, and dire in the end. The first part of the film, which inhabits more than eighty percent of its screen time, tells George's life story: his abundant acts of altruism, which enable the continual thwarting of his repeatedly voiced ambitions; his continuation of his father's fiscal and ideological battle with Potter, in the name of the Bailey Building and Loan, an institution that represents the "community" side of the film's diatribe against the form of unbridled, unrelenting, anti-humanistic "capitalism" represented by Potter's monopolistic business interests; and George's union with Mary, his lifelong sweetheart, and their settling down in that quaint, provincially idyllic American town named Bedford Falls, which George had seemed so insistently focused on shedding like a cheap suit. The sad, decadent, cold, flashy, Vegas-like imagining of Bedford Falls sans George Bailey convinces him (and us) that his heart is much bigger than his ambition, and it belongs to the members of his hometown. The final sequence jerks buckets of tears, not through manipulation, but through the genuine redemption of a man whose life of selfless acts repays him in a way that only a town like Bedford Falls can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed are terrific as the main leads in this Frank Capra movie. Set very close to his own working class roots ( supporting cast and characters bear this out) and some nasty people thrown in to boot, this film holds the viewer's attention without getting overly sentimental.. Ever said to yourself " I wish I had never been born?" This film will clearly answer that question.It just goes to show that movies do not have to have all the special effects bells and whistles, deafening sound track and Dolby digital to capture viewer interest. Movies like this were made in a time when violence was often only suggested, not played in grizzly detail. There are certainly some dark themes. However you can't help being uplifted by the ending..</fullReview>

Being a high schooler I tried extremely hard not t let my tears show, but it was no use, and I could see similar failures around the classroom. I haven't seen a movie that could reach such an emotional level with me since, probably the only one that ever came close was Lion King, when I was 5. This movie will always be on my top 5 list, and so far no contender has got even close to removing it from the #1, and 64 years after this movie has been made there still isn't, that is really saying something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a movie It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey (James Stewart) goes through out his life trying to help people in his home town living with his wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house. Even though he understood that his father's business does not bring much income, people were his main focus. He lived with a dream that one day he will travel across the globe and will come back to build new buildings. Despite of his dream, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) prevents him from leaving his home town and is forced to take over his father's loan company. On the Christmas Eve, George's uncle Bill (Thomas Mitchell) loses $8,000 while he is attempting to deposit them into the bank account. Mr. Potter is the one who discovers the money but hides them from Mr. Bailey. As George realizes that after bank examiner finds out about missing money, he might go to jail and will loose his company, therefore he decides to ask Mr. Potter for help and give up his company. As he thought about his family, he was told that he is worth more dead when he is alive, and decided to commit suicide. Because of his family prayers, an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) was sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people he cares about by taking him to the time as if he was never born. I loved this movie because of its positive attitude. Some of the main characters are just perfect for their character in the movie. Even though James Stewart won an Oscar for his George Bailey character, my favorite character is the Mr. Potter. His bold head and cricket eyes are perfectly underline his grouchy character. Bailey's wife Mary is a perfect character as well. Her facial expressions are very clearly expressing her feelings. Her face did show an expression that she is deeply in love with George. Also you can see when she figured that George is in money trouble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very much aware of this film consistently being listed as one of the best movies EVER made. James Stewart has been one of my favorites for a longtime. This DVD had been lying with me for quite some time so I decided to give it a try. By God, I was stupefied, I did not write a review immediately just to see if this was not a flash in the pan, just an overdone, emotional blackmailer of a movie but this movie is simply brilliant. As an after thought maybe, its so hard to describe what one feels after watching this gem, this masterpiece. I am told it was a resounding flop when it was released, aah thats so unfortunate.Everyone goes through the vicissitudes of life, and many a times it is so tempting to end it all, to blame each and everyone around for one's misery that we miss out on the differences one's life makes to others. This is Hollywood at its very best, this is what everyone needs to realize...............Its a WONDERFUL LIFE... indeed...... ! See it and praise the Lord !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The drama fantasy It's a Wonderful Life is directed by Frank Capra and stars James Stewart, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore and it takes place in a modern day small town.The film starts off with angels talking about how a man, George Bailey (Stewart), needs help to make his life better. The angels decide to send a second class angel, Clarence, to go and help him. But before sending him they give him all the important details of his life. The first one that is shown was when George Bailey was a child and saved his brother's life and stopped the shopkeeper he worked for from selling poison tablets. Then it showed when George Bailey was older and how he dreamed of traveling the world but at any chance he got he had to do some sort of work for the loan shop he was in charge of. He fell in love with a young woman named Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) but struggled to gain her as his wife. This film is excellent and has a morale that everyone needs to hear, a timeless classic.Frank Capra directed this film brilliantly. It was truly sentimental and he made it so you could feel the emotions of George Bailey. There were quite a few classic moments that he created in this film such as when George asks Mary is she wants for him to lasso the moon for her. Capra truly created an excellent film.The writing of this film was pure bliss. There are not that many films out there that have a sense of purity such as this one and that is intended for all audiences. There were many ups and downs on this ride and it left you completely satisfied.The acting by the whole cast was remarkable. James Stewart gave a great performance as George Bailey never being able to get what he really wants and being extremely stressed by all the tasks that he has to do. Donna Reed was great as the love interest, providing much support for Stewart's character to grow off of. Lionel Barrymore was great as the big business man in town trying to buy up everything and keeping Bailey down. Excellent performances for an excellent film.Overall I give this film a strong 9/10, it is truly a timeless classic from the legendary Frank Capra. I recommend this to absolutely everyone young and old, it is a truly heartwarming story that has already gone down in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."It's a Wonderful Life" (1946) truly deserves all the praises and kudos it got true the decades. Seeing it first time this evening in 2015, all i can say that this is an amazing movie in every term. I won't going to into plot details as you all probably know it better than me. Try not to smile after this movie - it's impossible. This is a movie making at highest level. Acting is outstanding (it was made in 1946!), especially by a lead James Stewart - he glues the whole picture. Supporting cast is also great. Script is so simple yet so rich and combined with pitch perfect directing - near every scene (litteraly) in this movie clicks and it is just marvelous to watch this story unfolding. Before watching this movie i really didn't expect it to be THIS good, thought it could be a bit overrated, but boy was i wrong - this is a must see picture for every age, for every person.Overall, "It's a Wonderful Life" has to be one of the finest pictures. At running time 2 h 10 min this movie never drags, and is superbly involving from start till the last frame. Every scene works here so well, because of great acting, superb direction, great script (simple, yet very involving). The ending is superbly inspiring. I do wonder however about age of some more old characters in this movie, as it seems like they never get old (and some of them should be at around 120 years old by the end of the movie), but it's not even a complain. Watch this movie if you haven't seen it yet - it is an amazing motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Literally perfection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not much to say about the movie, except that it is utter perfection in film.A lovely story about strife in life, and overcoming it with love and family. Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, as he overcomes every challenge that life can throw at him, with an added magical spin from his angel, Clarence, which turns the movie into a pseudo-remaking of A Christmas Carol. It's tough to review it though, in today's terms at least - but that doesn't make it any less of a fantastic movie. Fantastic movies should stay as fantastic movies, and this certainly has.A perfect Christmas classic, and one that you should watch at least once in your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless Narration of Family Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drama, personally is my favorite genre of movies. It is usually less action, and uses solid dialog. Seems boring, but when the filmmaker knows to execute it well, there is no single scene that's useless. Drama is about the power of story, the strength of characterization, and the deep moral value. Don't say just about blazing editing or unique cinematography, drama doesn't need those so much. Maybe just the soundtrack that counts to the synergy of movie construction. I know there are so many non-drama movie that have amazing idea, but only drama that has businesslike idea. No compromise about all of the social critic, capture it beautifully, and give the enormous view of daily live in human's life each times.Let's jump to this movie. "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946), very classic piece, crafted by doubtless director such as Capra. Before watch it, I have known this notable quote by Frank Capra, "I made mistakes in drama. I thought drama was when actors cried. But drama is when the audience cries". So, I expect so high from this movie. I know it's from 1946, how old is that. But I also know that every year this movie aired again and again on American television. So what do I say, it must be very great cultural node in the cinema history. Don't worry about the release date, art lasts forever, especially the superb one.Yes, my high expectation is paid off. Usually when you expect high, you are disappointed. But, no, it's really wonderful one, very wonderful. In fact, I watch it near before Christmas. It's so Christmas movie though. I feel so grateful after watch this movie, honestly. So humble movie with original comical act. Even after more than six decades, it still drives me to the joyful of Christmas. The fantasy-aspects is just enough, I mean it's not too imaginary. Just a touch of fantasy and you can smell the scent of life.The moral value, indeed, a very thoughtful one. So, let's say, even a very compassionate man can get stress and crazy. And, maybe a kind man, is actually depressed inside. That's the little twist fact in our life. I don't want to say too much about this problem, because clearly this movie give the fictive solution, the angel. Or you can translate it to the real one. Such as, let's think all over, don't get mad, be calm, and you know that you just think it too much. But, what's actually in my mind is the intrinsic message, maybe not all of the audiences will notice this. So, let's say, that we, and our people measure the success of a human from his/her wealth, properties, and sometimes his/her travel. It's wrong success judgment remains until now, especially in my nation, Indonesia. Yes, because all those things is measurable, no wonder why people think of that. But, we keep forgetting the essential value of life is laid on every human conscience. What is the meaning of a bunch full of money when you lack of true compassion itself. The problem is actually we know those things about compassion etc, but our society drives us to the what they think success is. We learn that, we do that, and we teach that to other people directly or not directly. Even in this modern era, those stigmas still exist, eventually more exist. Those fundamental value of life is eroded by this acceptable idea. Yes, it's acceptable, but you know it's not fully true. This movie lead us to this opinion. I mean look at George Bailey, he doesn't go anywhere, isn't rich, although he can. He keep refusing all those interesting offer, because he knows it's true. And the moment when he want to commit suicide, he just suddenly forget all that truth. Angel comes, and that's the solution. Even without angel, we human can figure it out what we must do in life. Again, it's conscience that this movie tried to lift up.At last, from the flash impression until the deepest value, I enjoy this movie. In addition, it's also a family movie. Even children can get those visionary message. I give ten out of ten, because all that reasons, added by the acting, cinematography, and its timeless period. A wonderful artworks, from the initial cinema era. Just watch it, and you will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't we all at some point on the way home ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... arrived at our exit on the freeway and wondered, "What if I just kept driving?". That very modern - and yet timeless - feeling is at the heart of this film, before life was so complex, when the U.S. was dotted with small towns in which it was possible to be born, make a good living, and die, without ever leaving, save for military service.George Bailey is both an extraordinarily lucky and unlucky guy. He's unlucky because none of the plans he made for himself as a young man ever worked out - his loyalties to family and to his hometown always kept him pinned there. He's extraordinarily lucky because he has a wife and children that adore him. But one Christmas Eve when he is in his late 30's a crisis brought about by his uncle's stupidity is the last straw that causes him to wish that he was never born, and he gets that wish granted to him - to see the world as if he had never been born, and he does not like the view.It turns out over his life, George did a series of good deeds - some large some small - that changed the course of just about every life in his hometown. Basically, without the Bailey Savings and Loan, which without George would have collapsed in the 1920's at the death of his father, the only source of financing is Mr. Potter's bank, which makes Citibank look like a charitable institution. The town has thus been thrown into chaos, a place where alcoholism, prostitution, and broken homes abound. Now I could sympathize with George's horror at seeing the bad fate of just about everybody he knew save Mary, his wife. When George inquires about her fate he is told - "You won't like it. She's an OLD MAID"! Oh the horror! She in fact is the town librarian. To quote someone else on this subject - "in a town thrown into chaos she's an educated woman with a job - what's the problem?". Mary, before she even married George, is full of life and has a sense of style, but just subtract George from her existence and she becomes someone who dresses like a woman twenty years her senior and is deathly frightened of men? Pleeeease! Oh well, if I am going to watch the films of 1946 I'd better be prepared to deal with the values of 1946, but I digress.The fact is George probably WOULD have been better off without these ties that bind. He could have seen the world and done big things and slept like a baby without a worry. But the fact is he realized he cared about these people whose lives would be ruined without him, and that is probably why so many of us don't just keep driving when we hit our exit on the highway. We go home to the people we love and the problems that come with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Short of Superb!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer &amp; director Frank Capra's crowning glory "It's A Wonderful Life" (1946) with James Stewart and Donna Reed ranks as one of the greatest Hollywood movies. This warm-hearted epic about life in the small town of Bedford Falls and protagonist George Bailey (James Stewart) and his eternal battle with the corrupt and evil Potter (Lionel Barrymore) captures the spirit of America after the end of World War II. A box office flop, "It's A Wonderful Life" acquired a new lease on life when copyright holders National Telefilm Associates neglected to renew it in 1973. Consequently, television stations ran it ad nauseam until Republic Pictures renewed the copyright in the 1990s. Everybody considers Capra's film an example of the classic Christmas movie, but Christmas doesn't play a part in the plot until more than half way through it. George Bailey epitomizes optimism and plans to break out of the confinement of rural America to globe trot around the world until events larger than he compels him to remain in Bedford Falls.After his long-suffering father dies, George steps into the breach and continues his age-old struggle against the greedy Potter and he triumphs in the end. Winning, however, isn't a picnic for our hometown hero. George Bailey comes mighty close to losing. At one point, he contemplates suicide when the bank examiner arrives at his savings and loan office and poor Uncle Billy (Oscar winner Thomas Mitchell) has lost $8-thousand dollars. Capra and scenarists Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Jo Swerling, working from an original story by Philip Van Doren Stern, paint our hero into a corner when Uncle Billy lost $8-thousand dollars when he encounter the despicable Potter in the bank. Of course, Potter kept the money that poor Uncle Billy inadvertently handed to him in a folded up newspaper. At this point, fearing scandal, prison, and humiliation, George got drunk, slammed his ancient automobile into a tree, and wandered onto a bridge where he contemplated suicide. Mind you, Potter put the idea into George's head when George turned in desperation to Potter for a loan to cover his shortfall of cash. At this point, an angel second class without wings, Clarence (Henry Travers of "Shadow of a Doubt"), is dispatched from Heaven to save George. When George mentions that he wished that he had never been born, Clarence comes up with the imaginative idea of showing George what Bedford Falls would be like if George had never been born! George is shocked not only when he notes that the town is now called Pottersville but also that his brother died in an ice-skating accident. Earlier, George had saved his younger brother's life when the latter fell through thin ice and nearly drowned. George is so horrified by everything that he sees that he decides that he'd rather be born so he can face the music. As Capra has said himself in interviews about "It's A Wonderful Life," he describes it as a celebration of the individual. Basically, one man can make a difference in this world.Naturally, for George's sake, he receives a second chance. Meaning, "It's A Wonderful Life" is a life-affirming movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmas film everyone will enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was James Stewart's third (and final) collaboration with Capra, following on from pre-war films You cant take it with you and Mr Smith goes to Washington. Later in life he claimed it was his favourite work.James Stewart, born in 1908, often portrayed the everyday middle class American, usually a character struggling with adverse circumstances to win through, in many ways the reality of his own early life. After studying at Princeton, Stewart tried to establish a career on the stage. Coinciding with the height of the Depression there was little work, and he later claimed only to have had employment for 3 months between 1932 and 1934. Signed by a talent scout to MGM in 1935, he moved to Los Angeles and stated his film career, working with a series of stars including Jean Arthur, Marlene Deitrich and Katherine Hepburn. World War II brought an interruption: Stewart, a skilled pilot, was eventually enlisted in the air corps. Resisting official attempts to use him merely as a recruiting prop, Stewart was ultimately transferred to an operations squadron, becoming commanding officer and flying bombing missions over Germany. He was awarded the DFC and the Croix de Guerre. His return to Hollywood saw a further 4 decades of films, including noted collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950s.It's a Wonderful Life was his first film in five years: in it he plays the part of George Bailey, a man living in Bedford Falls, a small town in America, but yearning to get away and fulfil big ambitions. Using a plot device, the audience sees George's past life up to the point, on Christmas Eve, when he tries to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. Using a similar device, George then sees what the world would look like if his attempt were to succeed.The film was not a huge commercial success at the time, but has since come to be regarded as a masterpiece of storytelling. Traditionally associated with Christmas, which forms its backdrop, the film has a wider scope. George makes constant choices of self sacrifice which enable those around him to prosper. This prosperity is more emotional than financial, and a key message is perhaps the value of relationships above money. This self sacrifice is not without cost, but George uniquely gets to see what would have happened if he hadn't existed at all.The film also examines differing approaches to business and looks at their results. On the one side is the Building and Loan Company, a financial institution run not on a financial basis, but on the idea of mutual support. On the other Mr Potter, who owns most of the rest of Bedford Falls and who wants to end the Building and Loan so he can complete his financial exploitation.Whilst the film clearly includes many elements which can be regarded as fantasy (changing the past and future, angels descending to earth) it keeps one foot firmly on the ground, offering an ultimately happy ending which only the most jaded viewer will be able to resist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about this film that hasn't already been said? Modern audiences are in the main averse to watching black and white films. The fact it is still an incredibly popular film decades after it's release tells you all you need to know. It's a clever idea and it's great story that actually makes you think. The acting is superb and James Stewart is at his brilliant best. There are sad and uplifting moments in equal measure and an ending that leaves you thinking whether you should laugh or cry. If you are feeling a bit down then just put this film on and I guarantee it will make you feel better. Quite simply this is one of the best films ever made and only the most cynical misery will fail to be touched by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"No man is a failure who has friends."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After suggestions from many of my friends, I decided to finally watch this movie classic. Firstly, I was really delighted by the quality of the picture, sound and everything else. I expected it to be a low quality black and white film, but my mind was blown away by the fact that in 1946 the movie industry was so well developed. Frank Capra directed this movie so well, I might say this is the best movie I have ever watched. If not the best, then definitely one of my top 3 movies.Secondly, the actors were just perfect. Stewart really did a wonderful job and became one of the few actors that I really admire. Also Donna Reed did her part just as good as Stewart. Currently, there are no actresses that I can imagine playing that part.Lasty, everything I already mentioned would have no meaning without the story and message this movie sends to the viewers. This movie brings all the emotions deep down from you to the surface. I am not ashamed to say that the end made me shed a few tears. There are not many movies that could touch a persons's life so deep. If the movie does so, it is safe to say that it is a perfect movie. Because a movie should communicate directly to every viewer. Just like poetry, every person should be able to find what they look for. One movie, but many meanings. One character, but many lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" is simply a masterpiece. A perfect film. There's no need to take it apart scene by scene or examine its plot, its themes or do a character study of George Bailey. No need to attach more meaning than was intended, to imagine symbols where they don't exist, or to ignore the ones that do. No need at all. For if you are one of the many, the growing many who cannot watch this film without tasting tears, tears of joy, tears of sadness, then you know exactly what I am talking about - that further discussion would only serve to diminish the film's beauty. There are few films that are in this category, that hit notes as true as this. "Casablanca" is one, "It's a Wonderful Life" is another, where everything comes together, where magic is not only seen in one scene, but in every scene, every line, every look and moment in the film. Pure magic. That's what this is, folks. Pure magic. It's the stuff dreams are made of. And the less talk about it the better. We talk too much nowadays, anyway. Just watch it and let it move you to joy, to tears, and tears of joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film. One of best i've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time and a Christmas tradition in my household. This film is about sacrifice for the greater good. George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) having big ideas of the world around him and continually puts his desires behind the good of the town. Another thing this movie shows perfectly that no matter how insignificant we feel, we are all linked to each other and play a important part in each others lives. After George looses his way and a angel shows what the world would be like without him he soon realizes how important he was to the people and town around him. This will always be considered a classic in cinema and a great movie to watch every year during Christmas. So we can all remember the good and bad of the present year and when new years comes around we try to make the next year better for others and ourselves. This is a must see for any family or fan of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As undeniable classic in every imaginable way. It's A Wonderful Life is the feel good Christmas movie above all others, despite the fact it paints a fairly depressing picture. It tells us not to take life for granted, and that we shouldn't be so selfish as to assume our life is for our own benefit. It clearly highlights how Jimmy Stewart's life has influenced all those around him. As his life takes a nosedive and his dreams go unfulfilled he begins to lose all hope. Other than the necessary schmaltzy ending, the film is well grounded in reality and avoids insincere sentiments. Capra's wonderful handling of the material make this a surprisingly gripping film, one that may climax at Christmas, but can be watched anytime of year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw it recent;y for the first time ever.And I'm very amazed on how well done this movie was made.It takes place from 1910s-1946.Jimmy Stewart portrays a man who wanted to follow his dreams but always ended up being a failure. He feels as if his life is falling apart. On X-Mas eve he thinks the world would be better off without him.When all seemed hopeless. A man named Clarence who is said to be a guardian Angel will help him change his way of thinking.Unlike other holiday movies, this one is one of those feel good movies and has a great moral to it. That every person who fails deserves a second chance.I think every person should know what this movie is. If you haven't seen it yet, do so, cause this is a must see classic. And it be a perfect movie for the whole family to watch.There's nothing too offending in the movie. No swearing, some drinking scenes, non-brutal fights, and I think it's perfectly fine for the kids to watch. Just to let you know that this movie is long and has some long scenes too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life... Yea RIGHT! SPOILERS It's Christmas season and I just sat thru my 10000th viewing (or so it seems) of 'It's a Wonderful Life.' I movie that everyone but me seems to find a happy and uplifiting story that centers around the holiday season. I see it as something different, and I cannot find one small glimmer of hope in the life of the poor pathetic main character of George Bailey.Poor George was born with but one ambition for his life, to get the hell out of Bedford Falls and to see the world. This movie is but one long look at his miserable failure. In the movie we are taken thru the life of George Bailey, introduced to his family and his freinds as we are shown what looks at first glance to be an unfortunate chain of events that keep poor George trapped in the prison of a town called Beford Falls.He meets the love of his life, Mary, and despite his explaining his intentions of getting the dust of that small town off of his shoes; she traps him into marriage. This is due in no small part to his rivalry with childhood friend Sam Wainwright. None the less, he and Mary save and plan for their eventual departure from Bedford Falls, and once again George is crushed. His dream nearly within his grasp, a failure of the family buisness (The Building and Loan,) caused by the incompetence of his familt to run the buisness and the economy (manipulated by his arch nemmissis Mr. Potter,) force him to give away all that he has hoped and dreamed for to "save the family buisness."Later, as world war two is raging, George's possibilties of getting out of Bedford Falls are again dashed by the evil Mr. Potter, who through is political influence has managed to ensconse himself as the head of the draft board, thereby using a slight hearing deficiency to keep George from joining the armed forces. That way the evil robber barron Potter can keep our George under his control, at home, in dismal old Beford Falls.After that crushing blow to his dream, George becomes complaicent and allows Mary to saddle him with FOUR children. Ultimately dashing all hope of ever leaving Beford Falls. When an IDIOT relative misplaces a large sum of money that belongs to the Building and Loan, the money is stolen by the evil Mr. Potter and a crisis ensues. Poor George is driven into drpression and contemplates suicied.Up to this point we can only feel sorry for poor George, we are shown his troubled life from his perspective; but, here is where this movie takes a turn. Just as George is about to end it all, an angel in the form of a dumpy old man named Clarence shows up and saves George from his untimely demise. What happens next is most enlightening.Our George tells Clarence that he wishes that he had never been born. His wish is grated and we get to see what life in Bedford Falls (now Potterville) would be like if George Bailey had never been born. We are shown in great detail how each and every person in the town was better off because of George Bailey. Everyone that is EXCEPT George.George's dear wife Mary ends up as a spinster. It would seem that her only prospect for landing a husbandl was George. Even though she had been persued in the first half of the movie by George's close friend Sam Wainwright. We can now plainly see that Sam's interest in Mary was only a rivailry with his friend George. With George out of the picture, Sam had no interest in Mary at all. No wonder then that she did everything in her power to trap poor George into marriage, and keep him by producing multible offspring.At a blinding pace, the movie shows us how each and every person in the town of Bedford Falls has USED George Bailey. Taken his kindness and generosity for all it is worth and given nothing back. And, in the process, assuring that George's one dream of getting the hell out of Bedford Falls will never become a reality. Each and every person in that hell of a town had used George in their own way: the cab driver, the police man, the bartender, the list goes on and on. All had TAKEN from George and given nothing back.In the end though, Clarence scares George so badly that he pleads for his old life back, and predictably his wish is again granted. The movie then tries to make us feel better by showing that this town of ungrateful takers has begun to realize that they NEED George Bayley. In a stirring closing scene, we see these "users" come to George and Mary's house to give money to help save George from prison. The movie closes with George having been saved from prosececution, only to be stuck in the same HELL that has been his whole life.What is not shown at the end of the film is that the evil Mr. Potter, who stole the money that caused all the trouble in the first place, gets off scott free. Once again the evil robber barron Potter comes out on top, while poor old George is left to live out his misserable life serving the leitches of Beford Falls.The moral lesson to all who watch the film is that no matter what your dreams, no matter how good a life you live; the evil in this world (be it low life leitches that take, take take; or corporate robber barrons like Potter) will ultimately triumph over you and crush your dreams.Merry Christmas everybody!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic? Of its time and out of place, now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is on a huge number of people's best films of all time. Sadly, I think that says more about the people than the film. This was a feel-good film made in the aftermath of World War II and is supposed to reference the great depression. We shouldn't expect subtlety from such a morality tale, and truth is the characters are more like those from a Christmas Pantomime than from some carefully crafted, nuanced film plot. So Jimmy Stewart plays the Aladdin/Dick Whittington character, "George" who wants to go off and see the world but instead always does the "right thing" standing by the potentially downtrodden people of Bedford Falls. These, who would otherwise be at the mercy of archetypal villain, "capitalist/banker" Potter. ("Boo"! "Hiss"!) It takes nearly half of the film's two hours plus for George to be pushed into the arms of the pantomime's leading Girl, the saccharine sweet "Mary", by his mother!? The telephone scene in which he finally kisses her is utterly implausible, even risible. No wonder its original audiences and its writers didn't care for it. Then we have the major story arc of "Clarence" the Guardian Angel (= Fairy Godmother), who is trying to earn his wings by saving George from committing suicide (which would have disqualified paying out on his insurance policy). This is why the film is described as re-working of Dicken's Christmas Carol, and they are indeed, fairy-tale morality tales. Scrooge is redeemed, and George is saved from pointlessly topping himself and abandoning his wife and children. Of course there a whole load of holes in the plot line. Just one example; a call to his highly successful younger brother, whose life he saved, would surely have secured a loan to bridge the gap? And the film is misogynistic, sexist and racist: The "world without George" version of the bar in which he originally gets sozzled is just there for "men to get drunk, quick", associate with loose women and has a black guy playing the piano! OK, so Pantomimes are popular at Christmas...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an enduring classic that has only gotten better with age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Maitland Stewart was one of the most inspirational and admirable actors who ever lived. Although his range of talents allowed him to effectively play whatever kind of role he wanted, he is remembered most for the roles where he stole the audiences hearts. He was nominated several times for an Academy Award, but won it only once and at that time felt that his friend Henry Fonda deserved it more. In my opinion, James Stewart should have won the Oscar at the very least three times. He deserved the one who received for "The Philadelphia Story" (1940). And he should have won it for his performances in "Vertigo" (1958) and his most beloved classic, "It's a Wonderful Life." This improving-with-age classic is generally marketed as a Christmas classic, but that's very one-dimensional. Yes, the perfect season to view it is during the said holiday season, but it's about much more than that. It's about life itself and the ups and downs of life and no matter how heavy the latter may be at times, it's well, it's a wonderful life.In the film, James Stewart plays an ambitious young businessman who would rather do nothing but travel the world and build cities (perhaps a reference to Stewart's early ambitions to be an architect?) but his generous heart and the constant shortcomings of his friends continually puts him behind in his own life. When his troubles become so heavy and so depressing to the point where he ponders over suicide, he is visited by a strange man (Henry Travers) who turns out to be an angel wanting to show him how the world would have been if he'd never been born.I guarantee you that most if not all storytellers of the past sixty-some years wanting to generate a character that would win over the hearts of the audience have used this masterpiece for reference. Jimmy Stewart was just warming up at winning over your heart with another collaboration with Frank Capra, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," here he just steals your sympathy with every scene he's in.As for Stewart's supporting cast, well, let's just say he had a great collaboration to work with. The enchanting actress Donna Reid is fantastic as his love interest, Lionel Barrymore is superb as the conniving greedy businessman Mr. Potter, the great Thomas Mitchell gives another fantastic performance as Stewart's bumbling uncle, Ward Bond is terrific in his supporting role as the kindly town sheriff, and of course, I cannot leave out Henry Travers who is absolutely lovable as the guardian angel who comes to teach Stewart about the gift of life."It's a Wonderful Life" is one of those rare films. Like "Casablanca", it does not wear down even as decades go by. It's only gotten better with age. James Stewart said it was his personal favorite out of all of the movies that he made in his illustrious career in Hollywood. Is it my favorite Jimmy Stewart movie? No. But I will tell you this. It is so sweet and moving and enchanting and wonderful that I held back a lot of what I wanted to say in this review because I don't want to give any more away than what is necessary. There's only a handful of movies that I will do that for. Because there is so much to be seen here and every minute is absorbing and beautiful.And one more thing. You know that feeling you get?that really, really good feeling in your soul?whenever you see a really, really good movie? If you want to revisit that sensation, see "It's a Wonderful Life" as soon as you can. And the beauty of it is, you don't even necessarily have to wait for the Christmas season to do that.Rating: 4/4</fullReview>

I'd seen it before, of course, but didn't expect to cry so much. The scene at the end, when the whole town shows up to pitch in to save the Building and Loan, was almost too much for me to bear. I just sat in the theater and bawled. It was a bit embarrassing.Impossible to think of anyone else but Jimmy Stewart as George. If Stewart had never been born, quite likely this movie would never have been made! One can't help but wonder how the world would be different...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perspective!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This will be my 100th comment on this website, and, it stands to reason that I should pick an all time classic movie such as "It's A Wonderful Life"!! This film is Frank Capra's best film ever... A statement of this nature tells you how remarkable this movie truly is!! Jimmy Stewart was voted by one magazine as the second best performer ever in the history of Hollywood!! Only second behind Katherine Hepburn, making him rated the best actor in the history of movie making!! While some people may question this assessment of Jimmy Stewart, due to Jimmy Stewart's innocuous Huckelberry Finn disposition, I can empathize with this verdict of Stewart's acting on account of his precisely executed latent tendencies which ultimately resonated into an articulated anger!! Jimmy Stewart's acting is very itemized, and thus, it establishes emotions which are genuine, these emotions relegate Stewart to a vulnerability which was pertinent to the fact that his feelings which could no longer be bottled up inside of him, would make him obtusely erupt!! Donna Reed is in this movie, and her performance is very believable as well!! Lionel Barrymore is extremely adept at playing the role of the ogre (Mr Potter) who is metaphorically writhing in his acquisition of the Baily Building and Loan!! This movie is the classic Christmas movie of all time!!, "Miracle on 34th Street" and "Fantasia" as well as any other Christmas movie, do not capture the spiritual camaraderie related to the yuletide association with caring and benevolence that "It's A Wonderful Life" exemplifies so flawlessly!!What the film "It's A Wonderful Life" accomplishes is the ideology behind the true meaning of what Christmas signifies... This phrase in of itself sounds very rhetorical, however, with a movie like "It's A Wonderful Life" such an accolade is the genuine article!! "It's A Wonderful Life" resembles the movie "Best Years of Our Lives" in the manner by which a happy ending is attained the hard way!! Often times, we look at our lives and become demoralized at the uneventful banalities which perpetually plague us!! We are depressed at how money dictates virtually everything, and, as was the case with George Bailey, we become trounced by failure and despondence!! Adversities are what make us cohesive, considering that this film was made right after World War II concluded, we as Americans were thoroughly aware of such a fate!! The fatal predicament which besieges George Bailey in this movie arouses occasion for all of the good citizens of Bedford Falls to bond together and realize the importance of caring for each other!! Such a homespun philosophy was anything but an artificial panacea, and with it, Americans immersed themselves into a nationally guarded perspective of good will and compassion!! This film is outstanding!! The talent and the ideological premise to this film, has out-shined virtually every other movie made!! A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned!!! Films which make people feel fortunate are not breaking any rules which compromise the quality of a film!! All of these carefully devised components to this film make "It's A Wonderful Life" an absolutely magnificent movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is to cinema what The Fox and the Crow is to literature.Don't get me wrong: This is a gem of a film, definitely worth watching at least once, but it really is more of a parable or short story than anything else. Its biggest drawback (aside from its length, which could use a trimming of about 30 minutes) is its cheap sentiment, done in typical Capra style. Beyond that, though, is a very simple yet potent film that serves as a reminder that the stories that work on a simple, allegorical level are often the ones that work best. I believe that due to it being a Christmas movie, people are willing to overlook its multitude of flaws, from the hokey acting to the weak script. It's interesting to see the rather bluntly portrayed themes here still work well today, though thankfully with more subtlety and complexity, such as the childlike wonder in Amelie, alternate realities in everything from the Groundhog Day to the Matrix and of course the very obvious character arc no good story should be without (although Capra is hardly the inventor of this basic centuries-old device, as one reviewer stated).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, if Jimmy Stuart had really lived I wouldn't sip a Martini now - but I would know and maybe even befriend a valuable citizen called MISTER Martini who lives because Lionel Barrymore died at the right moment? Or is it the other way round? I liked to speculate along those lines, when I was a child.Watching It's a Wonderful Life made me quite mad. The message is pretty cruel. It goes like: you are needed here and don't you dare planning to go on a world trip or anything like that. It's for other folks only. This strongly smells of Calvin's doctrine of predestination which, some say, is one of the foundations of the spirit of the USA. The main character is practically denied a free will, due to the circumstances a non too benevolent god arranged for him. I must admit, Stewart's hysterical shrieks on the bridge, as it dawns on him how valuable he is for the community, sounded to me like the first signs of full fledged madness.Ironically, the Potterville Stewart's character prevents through his sacrifice seems to be a much more thrilling place than the Bedford Falls he preserves, at least to a modern day audience. I am not against modesty, a good community spirit and loyalty, but inertia and values that are declared absolute and unchangeable will not help to solve the world's problems. I don't know how Frank Capra weathered the HUAC hearings, but the rigid categorizations of the citizenship this movie makes in order to propagate American values could well have pointed at him as a ?Commie sympathizer".James Stewart's George Bailey is the exact opposite of Gary Cooper's Howard Roark in The Fountainhead, made three years after this movie. The both represent American extremes in movies that I find overbearing and simplistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember crying first time I saw It's a Wonderful Life. I remember crying n-th time when I saw It's a Wonderful Life. The only movie that made me and makes me cry, not because it's sad but because it's wonderful, is this movie. Every now and than when I'm feeling anxious or depressed I turn to the final scene of this wonderful movie only to remind myself of what in this short life really matters. People around us, friends and community, give value to our life. Every life matters because everyone has something unique to share with this world. If I were never born, world would be ripped off something unique. We have to learn how to appreciate everything that has been granted to us, even the most little things.Those were lessons It's a Wonderful Life thought me and reminds me every time I see it. Every movie which is somehow able to make you a better person deserves a ten. That's the whole point of art. Art is not a purpose in itself, but is an instrument which aims to help us better understand ourselves and the world around us. Real art can't be separated from goodness and truth. No matter how technically brilliant a piece of art may be, it still serves no purpose if it drags us away from truth. And if it has capacity to make us better as man, then it's rightfully called a piece of art. I think It's a Wonderful Life does exactly that: in a subtle and heartwarming way makes you a better man by telling you something about this world and that is that this world needs you and that in long term makes sense to fight for it.Given that, I'm not going to write anything about acting, directing or similar. Those technical skills from my standpoint are now not worth analyzing even though all of those are really good (five Oscar nominations, including best movie and best director). What matters are values and heartwarming atmosphere. I'm going to conclude with the following remark: ordinary people are very often very extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No man is an island unto themselves!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IT's A WONDERFUL LIFE is definitely one of the most beloved and most watched films of all time. Simply enter human warmth and kindness in the festive atmosphere. Great script and a story that follows the life of one man, his family and his fellow citizens will not leave anyone indifferent. The magical atmosphere and timeless magic simply forces us to become part of the film. Given the time period and the retrospective of life, it is hard not to find yourself in one of the situations.Director Capra went on a series of films about the little people with real human virtues. Again, one protagonist dominant. In this case, dissatisfied with their lives. Capra wants to show something that is long lost. Family, friends and hard work are actually a wonderful life.James Stewart as George Bailey hit the famous director. Not only because of its irresistible charm and manners that had a chance to hone working with the most beautiful and famous women in Hollywood, but for the link in the mode of dealing in the character George Bailey and the actor. Furthermore, his character, although at first glance may be too mean, really has a great depth, and excellent Stewart interpretation gives it weight. Stewart's acting phenomenon I personally never liked her, but his fantastic performance I will never challenged.Donna Reed as Mary Hatch Bailey is quiet and modest woman who truly loves and appreciates his wife. The character is so simple and quiet to the stunning strength has exactly the moments when it is most needed. Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Henry F. Potter essentially it is a greedy materialist, passion for money in his being destroyed any shred of humanity, but he is not satisfied and with all his strength his personal dissatisfaction wants to convey the awareness of other people. I have to be skeptical and say that today these people are incredibly much.No man is an island unto themselves! Globally, the story in this film does not have a universal character. However, we can hardly resist the impression that we are all part of a whole, and unbreakable bond. I am not a supporter of the belief that there is "someone up there" who maintains the world's balance. Simply have eyes and see what happens. However, I think it's Capra lukewarm fiction and mild levity created because of those feelings.This movie is full of optimism, the story is touching. The man is an unusual way realized, despite all the problems, how is life actually delightful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why yes, I do cry like a baby over It's a Wonderful Life, every time. That ending is such a huge release after such as a dark and depressing alternative reality. I'm always left shaken up by it and need a break before I can watch another movie, as well as making me want to make amends with loved ones. I'm sure everyone who watched It's a Wonderful Life thinks to themselves what the world would be like if they were never born. The struggle of George Bailey is relatable to a wide spectrum, and I know for myself it really hits home. Being stuck in a dead end town and feeling you will bust if you don't get away from it; having your life not going the way you intended it to while your siblings appear to be doing so much better than you. But in at the end George Bailey realises what he's got when it's all gone, above it all, God's greatest gift. It's a Wonderful Life takes placed in a world in which God exists (and can focus his time on this one person over the rest of the world, but I digress). I've never felt however for It's a Wonderful Life to have a religious agenda, it's merely just a plot device for the film's fantasy elements.Lionel Barrymore's performance as Henry F. Potter I feel is a tie between his brother John's role in Twentieth Century as the best performance from the Barrymore clan. Potter is one of the biggest douche bags in movie history; the archetype evil business mogul and ripe for comparisons with real life figures. In 2012 it was Mitt Romney, in 2016 it's Donald Trump. Not only has he no charitable side, he directly steals money in order to destroy his competition. Unlike other screen villains, Potter does not get any comeuppance as the end of the film, although you could say he's destiny as a sick, frustrated and lonely man who hates anyone that has anything he can't have is punishment enough. Potter isn't a total caricature though, he is more three dimensional than that. He's a man who knows how to conduct and run a business and understands that high ideals without common sense could ruin a town. But George Bailey is no fool, he is a natural born leader, even if he doesn't realise it. He stands up to Potter without giving it a second thought, runs a building and loan which is a real estate empire itself; even his father states to him that he was born older than his brother.Moments like the make shift honeymoon suite in the broken down house which they later make their own or the recurring gag with the mantle at the end of the stairway represents the kind of writing which elevates It's a Wonderful Life above the majority of other movies. Like the greatest of films you notice something new on every viewing. Likewise nobody can do moments of intimacy like Frank Capra, the movie is full of scenes in which it is simply two actors talking with no background music, yet creates raw human emotional like no other. Take a scene such as George and Mary walking through a neighbourhood at night while George talks about his ambitions for the future, the rest of the world ceases to exist. Many will be quick to put down Capra's work as so called "Capracorn" or as Potter puts it, sentimental hogwash. Get off your high horse and stop thinking you're above such emotion; cinema is about the manipulation of emotions.It's hard not to feel sentimental for the representation of small town America on display. Bedford Falls itself is a town full of interesting and unique characters. It actually reminds me of The Simpsons; Potter himself is essentially the town's own Mr Burns in The Simpsons the people of Springfield hate Burns but are dependent on him for their energy needs. Likewise the people of Bedford Falls hate Potter and would be dependent on him for their housing, if it wasn't for the competition of the Bailey Building &amp; Loan.Due to its public domain status the film was shown on some TV networks in 24 hour marathons. I'd happily watch one of those network as I can't stop watching It's a Wonderful Life no matter what point in the movie I begin. Could you get a more perfect marriage between actor and director than James Stewart and Frank Capra? Collaborating on a perfect trilogy of films, with each one better than the last. It's a Wonderful Life? It sure is.</fullReview>

Clarence shows George all the lives he has touched and how different life in his community of Bedford Falls would be had he never been born.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's A Wonderful Life (1946): Dir: Frank Capra / Cast: James Stewart, Donna Reed, Henry Travers, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell: One of the all time great films that celebrates life to the very core of presenting one's meaning through interactions with others. James Stewart plays George Bailey whose desire is to leave town and explore the world. His dreams are hindered when his father has a stroke thus leaving him in charge of the bank. His brother becomes a war hero, and he marries his high school sweetheart, played by Donna Reed. This is all observed by God and an angel named Clarence who is given Bailey's background through flashback observation before embarking on the moment where discouragement reeks him leaving him saying, "I wish I'd never been born!" Director Frank Capra is famous for films such as It Happened One Night and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. This is his masterwork. Stewart brings out the innocence of an individual driven by good, while Reed plays off the dreamy romantic who believes that Bailey can lasso the moon with his determined nature. Henry Travers brings wholesome goodness as Clarence who is out to earn his wings. Lionel Barrymore plays the villain Mr. Potter whose greed knows no end. Thomas Mitchell plays the forgetful Uncle Bailey who misplaces a large sum of cash. It shows what life would be like without our existence. It would not be wonderful. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to say that I had low expectations going into this movie, but I was preparing myself for the possibility of a clichéd story with no real conflict, or a really lame one at that, which would leave me wondering how the heck it was a classic. Thankfully, pretty much none of that was true. I wasn't huge on the hallmark happy ending, but I don't think it was a bad idea. It fits with the theme of the story and gives a good sense of completion and is perfectly plausible considering how many connections George has. I just prefer movies to end differently than that, but I could easily tolerate it in this context.George Bailey is, as most of us already know, one of the most likable protagonists that's ever been written. He's got some amazing and selfless qualities, but still has times when he struggles with doing the right thing, just as any of us do. I totally sympathized with his plight of wanting to go out and see the world and make a huge difference but constantly having to put that dream on hold for the immediate problems that he faced at home. It's true that some of the timing was overly convenient, namely the Wall Street Crash happening on his wedding day, but it works out nicely in terms of the theme. I'm sure that there are lots of people out there that go through similar conflicts between their work and their families and their dreams, but I'd be willing to bet that the majority of them are more influenced by selfishness than George's. Not that seeing the world is exactly altruistic, but it's a heck of a lot less greedy than some people's dreams.Most of the people George impacts seem to be genuinely well-meaning as well, but there is something that sets George apart from them. This might just be that George's particular skills are always in demand throughout the depression, making him a little more prevalent than someone with a different occupation but equally good intentions. Of course, this is contrasted by Mr. Potter, whose actions speak louder than his mannerisms in making him a villain. Now that I think about it, I can't recall that we ever actually see him swindle anybody outside of his constant efforts to buy out Building and Loan. But somehow, these attempts at fraud are more striking than seeing him actually rip somebody off might be.I felt like the whole sequence when George lives in the world where he doesn't exist could have been shortened a bit. It was definitely a vital part of the story as we see George fall into a state of depression that he has never experienced before, but they could have cut out a couple minutes of him seeing the alternate reality. Then again, I suppose the length is helpful in emphasizing how much difference one life can make even in a concentrated setting. I know that I would be interested to see what a world without me would look like, though I might not be quite so proud of it.It's difficult to accurately critique the technical execution 70 years later, but it feels pretty well done. The camera-work wasn't static or boring enough that it felt "old" so that's a plus. I can't judge if the acting was realistic to the 40's, but it didn't feel unrealistic for today. We do see some '40's ideals come into play a bit with the suggestion of being an "old maid" and George's apparent disappointment at not being able to join the war effort. I can safely call this a family film, and not just because you can show it to your kids. This is something that most, if not all, dad's should see and take to heart in some fashion. I'm sure most people have seen it before, some to the point of being sickened by even a reference to it. But if you haven't yet, please give it a try. It won't be the greatest source of entertainment and might not sound riveting, but it will likely inspire you and be more entertaining than you might expect. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, this is definitely the movie that has affected me the most for my whole life. As a big fan of Stewart, I was really looking forward to discovering its performance in one of the most well-ranked movie on IMDb. And it was not a disappointment! I love his performance in a difficult role. Indeed, he is playing a person who will discover what life would have been like if he never existed, the impacts he has made and find his own place. Sometimes, I could even identify myself as the main character, looking for my own pathway. I am 22 years old, and it makes me feel good to be alive and opens my mind about our environment and the actions everyone may take. This movie is appropriate for young viewers as well as older ones. It's a wonderful life 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Life!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Juggling with your emotions union first viewing, you really do not know what kind of film you are in for her. "It's a Wonderful Life" follows George Bailey as he starts up a banking company, get's married, and becomes one of the wealthiest men in town. What is hidden in the background is that his status is all about to change when the company loses all of it's money, right before Christmas. Debating suicide, George is then shown by his guardian angel, what life would have been like for the town if he hadn't been born. The payoff to this film is one of the most emotionally satisfying endings to any film I think I have ever seen. It really makes you appreciate life no matter how harsh, easy, brutal, or depressing it can be. Life can be happy as long as you make it that way. Terrific screenplay, amazing direction, great camera-work, and a cast that brought me to tears by the end, "It's a Wonderful Life" is one of the definitive Christmas movies. Halfway through this film, you may question if it seems worth watching all the way through, because it almost feels like a different film, but it is all worth it in the end. Brilliant film all around.George Bailey is a man with many hopes and dreams. However, his sacrifices, economic woes, and the achievements of his brother, Harrry, get in the way. On Christmas Eve, a frustrated Geroge Bailey is visited by a guardian angel named Clarence who gives him a new, and not so pleasant, look on his life. It's A Wonderful Life is a film that should not be missed. I found it to be a perfect movie with fantastic performances, an original plot, and awesome build up. If you haven't sat down to watch it this Christmas season, you're making a big mistake, my friend. The film features an array of top notch performances. The highlight of the film is James Stewart in his Oscar nominated role as George Bailey. Despite his behavior in the film's third act, he is a very likable character and we learn to feel for him during his tribulations. His performance is excellent. He will have you at the edge of your seat in some moments. That is a sign of a great actor. Donna Reed, who plays George's gorgeous wife, Mary, is great as well. My favorite of the entertaining supporting cast was Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter. One of the greatest jerks to ever grace the silver screen. You're going to fall in love with Henry Travers by the end of the film. Believe me when I say that. The cast is marvelous. Where do I begin with the script? It's practically flawless because the film features a simple story and the entire film builds up to the final act. Frank Capra's script features classic dialogue that is both heartfelt and funny. One of ym favorite dialogue sequences involves George telling Mary that he'll lasso the moon for her. How romantic. I'm probably gonna use that line when I hit on girls. Frank Capra's direction is perfect as well. I want to explore this guy's filmography. When I finished watching this, I came to realize why this has becomes a staple of Christmas. The film shows how wonderful your life can be and I think Christmas is probably the most perfect time of year to reflect on it. We learn from George Bailey and how he values his life. When the powerful moral hits us, we learn how we can imporve upon our lives. I like to reflect on what I did over the year around Chrsitmas time and this is the movie that accommodates that. Plus, it's at the very end of the year so it works perfectly. It's A Wonderful Life is a perfect movie with fantastic performacnes, build up, a nice score, and an amazing moral. Inspirational and enjoyable. Watching this movie is something I plan to make a Christmas tradition. A truly wonderful and beautiful movie. Go watch it now! And have a box of Kleenex in hand when you do. Merry Christmas, RT Community! "That's why all children should be girls."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderfully Boring Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this is an old movie and one cannot expect much from these things. I get that, and I did not expect much. Well what I got was an emotional and touching tale of good prevailing over bad. The adage that, 'they just don't make movies like they used' applies to this flick. Granted there were moments that seemed exhausting, but they were skillfully written into a script and plot that were easy to follow and intended to make you feel good at the end. I like that. Now today's Christmas Movies are so disrespectful. They either have drunk Santa's or peddling sex by notable Hollyweirdo Perves. Why even waste your money on a movie now-a-days? The production costs go towards one or two way-overpaid stars, and nothing is left for quality scripts; decent directors or is an understatement for this clap-trap. The only thing memorable about 'Life' is the stupid tinkling bell on top of the Christmas Tree. An angel gets his (or her) wings...and we will here a slight tinkle? Really? That's all. No freaking gong or a company of trumpets...just a measly little tiny bell...sheesh. What an indication of mediocrity. Ha! Donna Reed was such a beautiful woman, and she did a marvelous job along with the stellar performance of her co-star - Jimmy Stewart. Lionel Barrymore did a fantastic job and so did the rest of the crew. This is probably one of Frank Capra's greatest works. What a lifetime this fellow had. His life ushered years before the Wright Brothers' first flight; he was on the sidelines witnessing the ends of two World Wars, Korean and Vietnam Conflicts; old enough to remember the Titanic, Britannic and their sister, and yet lived into the 1990's Spectacular life. This movie is not for everyone. If you do not have a young family or if you are overly sensitive about Christmas...don't bother...you were insulted before you sat to watch. If, on the other hand, you happen to be normal, you will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I said before, this great title sure beats the heck out of modern movies. Why? Just because it was produced.I never smiled from ear to ear at another movie like I smiled at this one. For those who are not yet decided whether to see this picture or not, I recommend it.But first things first. The movie in question, It's a Wonderful Life, is an exceptional piece of 1940's way of thinking on a person who, mainly in this picture, saves his hometown from complete ruin. I guess that is the wish, the hidden wish, of the main character, George Bailey, who, at first doesn't want to be a part of this community after his college graduation. After all the trouble of Mr. Bailey, the end of the movie can bring some tears to the viewer by showing how a close and united community can help each other out with troubles.In the end, as I said at the beginning of this small review, this picture bring a lot of joy and smiles to the common viewer and is worth watching, rather than today's movies.</fullReview>

"It's a Wonderful Life" shows a very close match between story and visual world. And, it is an excellent social fantasy on high level. The main thing I understand from the movie is "A man's riches come not from the money he makes but from the friends and family he serves." I want to feel the same thing what world would be like if I had never lived. I am intrigued by the argument about the future of the Building and Loan. Movie clearly expressed the power of the individual by showing what a town, and a nation, would be like if one man had never lived. Kudos to Frank and James......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched the movie twice. The first time i was not prepared for anything. I realized that it was not just a Christmas movie, but also a study on human relationships. It describes how the choices we make in life have an impact to ourselves and to other people, regardless if the choice is what we really want. The true value in life is having people that you love. All the other things, simply do not count, and that's why the choices we make in life, forced or not, false or not, are not so important, given that they do not concern the people we love. Only the choices regarding the people we love must be right and not forced. The second time i watched the movie i cried not only because of it's quality, but also because i had forgotten the above message, and the movie reminded it to me for second time. I decided to write this review in order to never forget it again and say to everyone "do yourself a favor and watch this movie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Bailey lives in a small town, Bedford Falls, with his wife and children. He has spent most of his life preserving Bedford Falls' almost idyllic existence and preventing it from effectively being taken over by Mr Potter, the local bigshot. Then one Christmas Eve, George makes a massive blunder, one that has dire financial consequences. He contemplates killing himself, thinking the town and his family would be better off without him...The Christmas classic. Yes, it's overtly and unashamedly idealistic, sentimental, schmaltzy, emotionally manipulative and a bit cheesy, but it's impossible to dislike. The movie's sheer sweetness, innocence and joyful purpose ensure it hits the spot. Very emotional.Jimmy Stewart's signature role and the role he was born to perform. I couldn't think of anyone else who could have played George Bailey.Good supporting cast, especially Donna Reed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's a Wonderful Life" ? A Wonderful Timeless Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turning the channels on Christmas Eve and/or Christmas day can be an unrewarding endeavor. The channels are dedicated to a great deal of silliness, infomercials and repeats of news stories seen over and over again.As luck would have it, though, I tuned onto a film that, yes, I have seen many times before but this time I looked upon it with different, perhaps, more mature eyes. To be honest, there are times when I have not been happy with my life, not happy with the difficulties of aging, losing so many I love and surely not happy I contracted a malady at 5 years of age which no one in this nation, thankfully, need suffer from again. I am glad for them, of course, but honesty must be spoken as I admit I wish I were born a mere six months after a vaccine for my malady was produced. When I kvetch (Yiddish for complain) about it I was told by one wise person in my life that I really should view James Stewart over again as George Bailey in "It's a Wonderful Life" and that it might teach me the essence of what is so valuable about my own life. On Christmas Eve "It's a Wonderful Life" was shown again.The film speaks to people ? really most people ? whether one is a believer in a supreme being or not. George Bailey, ready for suicide as his life's events spin out of his control and is ready to jump off a bridge into icy waters below. Ultimately, he is shown by Clarence, his guardian angel, why he should not cease to exist and what life would have been like had he never existed at all; had he not even been born.George Bailey's life, despite its overwhelmingly disastrous turn of events, counts. Yes, disbelief must be suspended but if one does suspend it the film teaches us that lesson. Most all lives count because in each life a person touches others in good ways one might never have imagined. The metaphor of a pebble thrown into a lake creating ripples far off from its point of origin is apropos. It says you mean something and you change lives ? hopefully for the better ? simply by your existence."It's a Wonderful Life" is a wonderful timeless film that has a message, I think, for many of us whether we get the things in life we wanted, and most especially, if we do not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing brings a hazy tear to the eye like the dulcet black and white tones of Its A Wonderful Life, starring endearing adult cherub Jimmy Stewart as the ultimate Everyman, a guy so personally beaten down that he sees no way out of the snowdrift of holiday blues that he's left stranded in. I haven't seen the film since I was a wee youngin', but here's what I remember, in images and impressions: Stewart plays George Bailey, a kindly man who's spent his life looking out for others and putting his livelihood on the line to,help those who are less fortunate. The man is a walking ode to the meaning of Christmas, but when a financial disaster ruins his outlook on life, he contemplates suicide. A compassionate angel named Clarence won't have any of it though, coming to his rescue in a sequence that's now immortalized in cinematic Valhalla. This is one I need to rematch to give you all a more comprehensive, 'Nate-ified' review, but I've been busier than Mr. C the past few days, so that'll have to wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Revisit the classic Christmas tale: It's a Wonderful Life. This film earns a rating by offering all the traits and qualities of a great movie: humor is scattered throughout, love and affection are central to the theme of service and generosity, and the fulfillment of adventure is pleasantly summarized in the clever ending. George Bailey, from the beginning, is one of the unsung heroes that makes America great. His life seems to be solely dedicated to the service of others. George has a passion for travel and has big plans for the future. Early on, Mary Hatch develops an infatuation for George, and they soon fall in love and get married. George assumes control of the family business, Bailey Building and Loan. The business brings financial turmoil that puts George in a very tricky situation.It's a Wonderful Life incorporates clever humor at even intervals to keep the audience engaged throughout the film. George's honeymoon demonstrates wit interwoven into the story line. Slapstick comedy fits only a select group of films, but Director Frank Capra manages to seamlessly utilize this humor strategy along with several others. Scattered throughout the movie are iconic scenes. Perhaps the most popular, George offers to lasso the moon as a romantic gesture. The Prom Pool Party also builds catches our attention by showing George's spontaneous and contagious personality. After the gym floor divides and reveals a pool, George and Mary fall in and continue dancing. James Stewart's performance shines as he portrays local business man, George Bailey. Mr. Bailey's arguments with Mr. Potter highlight Stewart's command of the screen. Other stars, like Donna Reed, also demonstrate a mastery of acting. George's visit to Mary's home accentuates Reed's performance.The magic of Frank Capra's film is its ability to corral the better nature of mankind and instill a desire to be a better person. James Stewart's character demonstrates selflessness and community centered focus. All audiences can draw inspiration to become a better person from watching the feel-good ending. Although the theme and acting excel in this film, the time line is a little confusing. The first half hour explains George's life from childhood to adulthood, but the last hour covers a little less than a week. Watching It's a Wonderful Life in preparation of the Christmas season is a tradition for families across the nation. Its vast popularity is largely due to its ability to inspire kindness, service, and generosity in the name of Christmas. The only Christmas story more cherished is the story of Christmas itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What more can be said...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a certain way in which some movies can have a very good but not perfect first half but then they are brought up a level by its masterful ending, It's a Wonderful Life is for me exactly that. This film of course that now is a staple of some peoples Christmas viewing is a favourite for some and it is not hard to see why, a sweet story but with an emotional and pretty thought provoking in hindsight back-story. The movie is legend in senses and to be fair probably doesn't need another review praising it but I will give it a go anyway, although as I said before the start for me is not flawless. I did feel the first maybe full half of it was although great, not at a level I expect from masterpieces but this movie showed me oh it did. The film suddenly jumps up in the second half and becomes a classic through that it's hard to find anything wrong with the finish to this film, high class stuff.The man behind this all is of course Frank Capra who directs but also co-writes this and I feel because he got to the writing of this too he creates a world that then fly's to life in his direction. Of course it's not hard to see the Judeo-Christian influences from Capra, after all he had a Roman Catholic upbringing and all the story people are praying to god and asking for help, there's even going's on that have the evident hand of god in the story but it is not a movie I would say is not for atheists. I actually think that this movie is fairly humanistic in its elements of just living on, don't think about death until it greets you, it also promotes ideas of bettering one's self and helping others in your community, not just asking god constantly, but in any case film should be able to be enjoyed by anyone of any belief.I'll try to move away now from that religious background of the movie because to say this is only for believers or even those who only celebrate Christmas is not right; this is just an excellent story all round. Its fantasy element is what truly makes this a classic and Capra and his co-writers get a story that is as sweet as it can even be dark too. James Stewart is one of the best in classic Hollywood and here he is no different, in fact I even think his performance is much like the film as it gets better as it goes on. Donna Reed as Mary is also good like Stewart and does do a fine job of not letting Stewart steal the scenes he is in, then cast like Lionel Barrymore and Henry Travers are finely cast and really the movie creates beautiful characters.I nearly didn't label this a masterpiece, oh so close I was to saying this was although fantastic, not quite as astounding as many claim, but the more I thought back on this the better it became. Its enduring popularity I feel comes mostly from the fact that the story is simple, its very end is extremely simple and yet the movie is easily re-watchable, the kind I think you can find more things with every watch. Capra knew exactly how to get us the audience to feel for those involved and from the moment George Bailey (Stewart) gets home from a certain little chat with his Uncle Billy to his home, the whole emotional drag of the film starts to kick in and come into full throttle all the way until the final scenes.Overall It's a Wonderful Life is one of the finest Christmas movies and is not just a top top Christmas movie, but is a top top movie period. The way in which Capra, the cast, the sets and even just the music is so well done, well it makes this movie special among many out there and it is incredibly easy to see why so many revisit this every Christmas to curse the name of Uncle Billy (or just to feel some joy)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Years Later, It's A Wonderful Life Continues to be a Reassuring Holiday Spectacle!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Christmas needs is schmaltz and snow and Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life has both by the hamper full. Set in Bedford Falls, New York, the movie follows common man George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who after getting married to his childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed) takes over the management of the building and loan association in his hometown that acts as a charity organization. He tries hard to buck a local Scrooge ? evil rival banker Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore), who never misses a chance to jockey him into a position where he could be dealt misery. However, all his troubles come to a head as his mortgage company is plunged into financial crisis, after being broken on the wheel of capitalism. Prodded by failure, incompetence and deceit, our hero is soon brought to despair by fate and the machinations of Mr Potter and teeters on the edge of sanity one snowy Christmas Eve. It is then that George, in a moment of weakness, wishes he was never born. A genial, bumbling 292-year-old wingless angel from heaven, named Clarence (Henry Travers), who is assigned to watch out for him, grants that wish. In the fantastic events that follow, George is brought to a realization of how much his apparently aimless existence has meant to others and shows him the futility of feeling futile.What is remarkable about 'It's a Wonderful Life' is how well it holds up over the years. It has a simple message told elegantly, intelligently and with a whole lot of heart that never gets old. A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned! And this film so earns it! Capra's trick rests in the fulsome manner in which he allows a motion picture audience to share in the glory, investing the story with the tremendous heart that always stamps his offerings. This couldn't be other than a Capra picture, the humanness of its story the prevailing factor at every turn of situation. And essential to its extraordinary enduring power is the towering presence of James Stewart who with the supporting cast puts up an amazingly controlled performance, to give a simple but poignant script an unbending strength of character. All these carefully devised components make it an absolutely enduring classic which does not wear down even as decades go by. The movie that defined the term 'Capra-esque' - and cemented Stewart's position as Hollywood's favorite everyman - is the ultimate winter warmer.</fullReview>

But good enough for a classic. I'd say the same thing for all the technical stuffs, but I don't know much history about how these things were back in the 1940's. From a cultural point of view It's a Wonderful Life is an very good film, but only a very good film.Final verdict: 8.4 out of 10. Do I recommend it: Yes. Do I wanna see it again: No.</fullReview>

There is a consequence for every action. when he figures out that if he wasn't born, all the things he achieved were non existent. This movie is worth watching over a million times. His guardian angel tries to help him, but he refuses to get help. That changes in the end because even though you hate your self at one time doesn't mean you should wish things you will regret. You have accomplished so much and you might not even know one of one accomplishment, but its there. Other people can see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a man isn't around he leaves an awful hole, isn't he?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Voted as the "Most Powerful Movie of All Time" by the American Film Institute in 2006, Capra's masterpiece now seems redeemed once and for all after it had been considered a major disappointment at the box office back when it was released. Due to a clerical error (or should we better choose to say, divine intervention?) the film even went into public domain, and well, now that it can be shown by every station on the planet it has turned into the ultimate Christmas classic, all ages aboard. The picture might look a tad dated in parts, but on the other hand this is exactly what embeds this fantastic journey even better between fairy-tale and harsh reality. And thus it hits home when it is holiday season again, the Christmas tree is being decorated and the smell of ginger bread hangs in the air."It's a Wonderful Life" is about standing up for the community, for principles, for family and friends, for those things that are important in life. Now that all might sound commonplace, but every now and then we need a serious reminder, so it might as well be in the Christmas season. The movie builds up magnificently to its final third, when everything goes downhill at the same time, and America's most favorite son-in-law James Stewart as George Bailey finally loses it. At this moment an already great character-driven movie turns magical when all threads come together and lead up to a breathtaking finale one isn't likely to get tired of. The climax is engaging, uplifting, heart-warming, and the all around great photography further enhances the effect. I can't say if Jimmy Stewart got his wings with this one, and he's probably already immortal anyway for many a reason. For sure he got his place in the audience's hearts with the film, and someone up there gave us the chance to revisit his struggle every year and teach us that after all one's better off being alive. Just remember: When a man isn't around he leaves an awful hole, isn't he?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a Wonderful Life -Saw this movie today and I regret why so late, seems as if made for me. I need not comment on direction and actors because already much has been said which is no doubt a classic in every point of view.If one summarizes the movie , it can be drafted within 5 minutes. But the flow and sequence of scenes proving Bailey as a true human for his city men and how he received favor in the end was excellent.The only few scenes I thought was not required was his Childhood scenes ; the movie could have been started as showing him a mature person and then continuing forward. The beginning scene of God and angel was interesting. Real crux of the movie was the last 40-45 minutes , he realizing the actual worth and essence of life when he was made non-existing.Anyone not having seeing this movie yet ,would recommend to watch it for sure. 9 points out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's a Wonderful Life" speaks the most universal truths about the kind of values humanity should stand for to make life that wonderful. It's Frank Capra's Christmas gift to Cinema and one of the all-time greatest classics. Indeed, what we use to define as 'classics' in the Cinematic Dictionary is probably the kind of movies that look and sound familiar to movie fans BEFORE the first viewing. And for me, the great classics as those we're familiar with before watching them and without this parameter affecting the magic of the first experience. We know that Marion Crane will be murdered; that Michael Corleone will become the Don, and that George Bailey will reunite with his family but it NEVER affects the enjoyment.I've seen enough parodies from "Simpsons" episodes or TV Christmas specials to know the very basis of Frank Capra's immortal classic, I even remember James Stewart's final wink from the movie "Look Who's Talking", and I was so aware of the film's plot that the first viewing probably consisted on spotting all the references I had. Not that it ruined the whole experience though but I didn't really grasp the inner greatness of the film until the second viewing, and now I do. Yes, it's very positive, very "good-vibrations inducing", something that definitely justifies its top spot on AFI's 100 Most Inspirational list, but there is more to that. There is more.You see, I've always thought the film to be a Christmas story and nothing else, expecting a 'message'; an obligatory happy ending established by the Family reunion, I expected that and well, I got it. BUT it's surprising how dark it really gets for a Christmas film and even by today's standards, 2000's TV specials can't elevate themselves to this gutsy change of tone. And James Stewart carries it quite spectacularly in "It's a Wonderful Life", powerfully transcending the initial atmosphere of the film. I would never have expected such genuine and authentic displays of sheer anger and Stewart is really scary here. I recall one line in Ebert's review where he regretted the colorization of the film precisely because it didn't visually fit these dark undertones. I can't imagine myself watching the film in color either.And Stewart's anger is very significant, because it illustrates the overall sentiment conveyed by his character, George Bailey, toward his life. The man considers himself a failure because he didn't fulfill all his dreams of travels and explorations. Sure, all his achievements helped the community, but never did he expect to stay in his modest natal hometown, Belford Falls. Bailey exemplifies the notion of being victim of circumstances, something I could relate to who spends my whole time dreaming of what I wish to do, instead of appreciating what I already did. Seriously, could it be more frustrating than dreaming of the world and be forced to live in a dull small town? Logically, Bailey becomes a bitter man with the eyes so turned to the future that he can't turn his back and consider the extent of his achievements and his popularity. George Bailey reminded of one of my friends' sayings: "we don't spend our lives writing the future, but writing the past" It's even truer for Bailey whose past (understand: achievement) helped people to build their future. Following the death of his father, he took over the "Loan and Building" affair and played a significant role in the lives of all the people of Belford Falls by selling houses lower than the prices they would normally rent it, thus providing them the most precious thing in America: a land, a home, with prices low enough to be able to sustain to the other obligations. He naturally made himself an enemy through Lionel Barrymore as the infamous half-tyrant half-tycoon Mr. Potter, a fitting 'Capraesque' villain as the morally corrupted rich man who tyrannizes and despises little people. (Interestingly, both Bailey and Potter are in AFI's Top 10 Heroes and Villains)Frank Capra is one of the few directors whose style became instantly identifiable and "It's a Wonderful Life" is the opportunity to culminate his own standards but not with the usual emotional bias this time. Here it's Bailey, the very protagonist of the film who takes distance from the little people, too real, too down-to-earth while he is a man who dreams, who writes the future in big, bold letters. This time, the enemy is not just the rich, the powerful, the corrupted, but the hero's inner demons, unknowingly celebrating Capra's humanistic vision: a world of solidarity, brotherhood, goodness and compassion. It's also, cinematically-speaking, the incarnation of a lost era through these characters forever graved in our memories, Mary Bailey (Donna Reed), Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), Clarence (Henry Travers) and all these unforgettable faces."It's a Wonderful Life" is the coming to realization of a man that he's better than what he thinks he is, and whose achievements speak something more important about him than his dreams. The trick was to allow him to see what his life would've been hadn't he be born: a frightening alternate reality (just noticed where "Back to the Future II" took its inspiration from). This little spice of fantasy conducts the atmosphere of the climax. And its darkness is perfect because the scarier it'll get, the more convinced Bailey will be. And he finally learns it the 'hard way' but this is the fate of all Capra's heroes, they all struggle, they're all licked and desperate before triumphing. Why so hard? Why the harder it is, the louder the 'YAAY' will be and so will the 'Merry Christmas' shouted while George Bailey is running out of joy, probably the most communicative of Cinema's history.And we wouldn't have had one of the truly happiest happy endings of cinema's history, immortalized by the sight of James Stewart smiling, with little Zuzu, Mary and a thought for his guardian angel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every Christmas Eve, I watch this film with my dad. Before I can remember anything else, I remember this film. I used to be bored of it, and leave sometimes, but this is the first time I can truly appreciate what an amazing, inspiring, heartwarming and perfect film this is. Without a doubt, It's A Wonderful Life is Frank Capra's masterpiece, and one of the best films of all time.In one of his most iconic roles, Jimmy Stewart is George Bailey, a noble man living in Bedford Falls. After an intro that already leaves you choked up, we see an otherworldly conversation in which Joseph sends Clarence, an AS-II, to help George, who is "contemplating throwing away God's greatest gift". From there, we see George grow up, seeing his dreams pushed aside to help the town face the greedy Mr. Potter. Eventually, we catch up to Christmas Eve, where one of the greatest scenes in film takes place- only to be followed by another. It is a dark film, but ends with the most uplifting message ever told convincingly on the screen.Everything about the film is perfect (except for 3 cuts). The acting, and the characters, are top notch. George Bailey is one of the most likable, developed characters of all time. He is a selfless man who puts the people first. As Clarence says, "I like George Bailey." I wish there were more George Baileys in the world. His wife, Mary (Donna Reed) is much like him- kind and gentle. Together, they're one of the classic screen couples, and we feel for them. The dinner scene in the abandoned house, and their first scene on the dance floor; it's... wonderful. One of cinema's great villains, Lionel Barrymore's Henry F. Potter is the personification of greed. He has no family and no need for money, but he needs more power and tries snatching it away from the Baileys for the entire film. He is a completely realized character. The film also has a great supporting cast- Sam, the one who did achieve his dreams, Violet, the head turner, Uncle Billy and Harry... everyone brings this film together. The location is a character itself. Bedford Falls, the fictional (New York?) town, is the backdrop of Georges adventure: he wants to leave, but can't shake the town. The strip, Bailey Park, Martini's and the bridge, it's a fully fledged town created on a set.Truly great films use every shot to show something, and It's A Wonderful Life is a part of that club. Mostly little things that you can't remember, but every scene, every shot, benefits the viewer. We learn a little thing about George, a little about the town, a little foreshadowing, this quality separates great films from fantastic films.Many films try to inspire, but this one puts all others to shame. For two hours, we build up, seeing why this good man is in a terrible situation, and then he is taught a divine lesson, and then you cry for a while as he understands the lesson and viewers wish to become better people- more like George Bailey. That's a factor you can't describe in writing, and the major reason this film is played every year. No matter who you are or what you believe, you can take something good away from this film.You can call this a Christmas film, and it feels great watching it in season, but It's A Wonderful Life is timeless. The greatest actors, the greatest story, the greatest message- if you haven't seen this film you have to."To my big brother George, the richest man in town." -Harry Bailey 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few movies stay fresh forever. It's a Wonderful Life is in a very exclusive club</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to review a movie such as this. Everything worth saying about it has already been said. No words truly do it justice. It's one you have to sit down and watch. Every year without failure, millions of people plop down in front of the television to be spellbound by it.One only needs to refer to its ranking on the IMDb top 250 at #30 to see how well-regarded and beloved this classic is. It's one of those giants in film history that everyone needs to see.I wasn't introduced to this film by my parents like many were. In fact, I'm the one who instituted the policy that we must watch It's a Wonderful Life every December in my house growing up.This is the type of film which doesn't age. The themes and morals expressed in the film are the definition of timeless.I would strongly encourage anyone thinking of viewing this film to watch it in black and white. Some networks have aired the color version and the Blu-ray also contains the colorized version. The colorized version was not what the filmmakers and actors intended. Here's what James Stewart thought of the colorized version: "I tried to look at the colorized version, but I had to switch it off--it made me feel sick." James Stewart and Donna Reed are one of the best on-screen pairings I've ever seen. This isn't just a Christmas movie. It's every bit a romantic drama and explores some dark themes.Neither the director, Frank Capra, nor James Stewart knew what they had when this film was made. They hadn't discovered all the layers that existed within this movie. It took the viewing audience to find this classic on television for it gain the following it has today.We found it then and we do again every year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra's favorite, James Stewart's favorite, Jim Henson's. Who am I to dislike it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt about it that Frank Capra was one of the best directors of all time and James Stewart was one of the best actors of all time, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that this is also one great movie to watch.This movie always on a lot of top-lists and many well known and respected film-makers consider this to be one of their favorite movies, including director Frank Capra and actor James Stewart themselves. And really, it's not all that hard to see why. No, I won't call it one of the best movies of all time but its themes, the characters, the story and its message make sure that this is a movie to enjoy, over and over again.Basically it's being a very warm, heartfelt and honest movie, about real characters in real life situations. The James Stewart character feels very humane and realistic and James Stewart was always a great choice for playing a sort of average Joe, everybody in the audience could relate and identify themselves with. It's also part of the reason why his character is often being voted one of the best out of movie history.It's sort of funny how this movie has grown into being a sort of a Christmas classic, while about two-thirds of the movie are totally not Christmas related at all. It isn't until it last 30 minutes or so that the movie is suddenly all about Christmas and its themes and messages of giving and sharing with each other. It's definitely showing some parallels to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'. It's what makes the movie a very warm one, even though the movie itself remains a drama and a quite heavy one as well.The story itself is just great. It's really typical for its time, with all of its drama and developments but with a great twist to it as well. The movie has a fantasy theme in it, which is not typical for its time or genre at all. It perhaps even makes this movie feel a bit like a 'modern' fairytale. Needless to say, it makes the movie a very original one within its genre and its where the movie gets most of its charm and warmth from.The movie is really a great example of some fine film-making and wonderful storytelling. It shows once more that you don't need all that much to create an unforgettable movie, that has an impact on a lot of people, even now days. The movie is about simple little things in life and perhaps that's the movie its greatest power. Everybody can relate to it, which causes them to be easily touched by the movie its themes and messages as well.Big part of the reason why it all works out so well is James Stewart but you also need to give credit to some of the other actors as well. I for instance, also really liked Lionel Barrymore in this, as the villain. I'm normally a not too big fan of Lionel Barrymore, or any of the other old Barrymore's (John and Ethel) but I must say he was perfectly cast in this movie, as the tough, old, mean Mr. Potter.Basically a wonderful made, simple, honest, heartfelt movie, with some great, effective and timeless themes in it, which all ensures that this is a perfect movie to watch over and over again.9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate in feel-good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon first inspection it is easy perhaps to understand why when first released, Frank Capra's Christmas movie, inspired by a simple seasonal card, was not well received. It is a movie that opens with a fantastical scene of a star, later revealed to be an angel, talking to a faceless God, the voice-over obvious, stilted in sweet humour, and immediately suggesting the film is going to be one that is too saccharine a pill to swallow. The thing is, beyond that, "It's A Wonderful Life" is the ultimate exercise in feel-good cinema, its virtue as such much parodied and referenced in TV and other films.The film presents George Bailey, played by James Stewart who would go on to refer to the film as his own favourite, who stifles his lifelong dreams of travelling and discovery in order to save and run his father's Building And Loan Association. It has long been responsible for the affordable housing in his hometown Bedford Falls and he cannot see it lost to the scoundrel of the piece, Henry F. Potter, who is a major shareholder in the Building And Loan and the only man residents could otherwise turn to. After a run at the bank leaves the Building And Loan on the brink of financial ruin, and George's Uncle Billy misplaces $8000, in an act of desperation he attempts suicide, at which time he is saved by the angel Clarence. Understandably confused, he wishes he had never been born, and so his wish is granted.If the plot seems familiar even though you have not seen "It's A Wonderful Life", it is probably because you saw the idea loosely re-worked in the Nicolas Cage film "The Family Man". For all its up to date technique, its colour, modern setting, etc, this version could not capture what made the original.So, what did make the original? What could surprise people is how Capra clearly believed in the notion that you have to suffer the low to get the high. The second act of the movie gets really quite dark, with Bailey seeing what the world would be like without his birth, coming to understand just how important a person is to everybody else's existence, and bringing him to a full appreciation of his worth as a husband, father and friend. The finale is obviously that classic scene that we all know, even if we do not realise it, with his daughter's famous, "Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings", and despite how much you might think the whole thing sounds cheesy, silly, saccharine and sentimental, the power of the film is to bring a genuine tear of pure enjoyment to your eye regardless; for a while you are full of the joy of life and completely happy, no matter what.A lot of the film's success comes down to how believable James Stewart makes the plight, and for any flaws you may find with it, its colourful characters, its tremendous performances, humour, heartbreaking moments, perfectly pitched highs and lows, and its' unabashed final sequence make this an inexplicably perfect film.No wonder it remains at the top spot of many people's favourite Christmas films, and so it should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notes from my recent intro, I have five favorite scenes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notes from my recent intro, I have five favorite scenes: the shared phone call; the hat tipping rainwater in the doorway; the prayer at the bar; when snow starts falling again on the bridge and the brother toast in the closing scene. IAWL partially succeeds because of its small town charm and values. James Stewart was from a small town -- Indiana, Pennsylvania (now his museum needs a Capra miracle). You may not know this but Stewart was a real WWII hero, enlisting as a private in 1941. He flew over 20 missions and when he finally retired from the reserves it was as a brigadier general. (true story) Frank Capra was from a small town, Bisacquino, Sicily and during WWII he made a series of films called, Why We Fight. And on a personal note, Frank Capra is my favorite director because his movies inspire me. Back in the 1980's I used to write him and call him on our birthdays to chat. Donna Reed in real life was an Iowa farm girl. She sweetens the film and is lovely, innocent and pure representing both Stewarts reward and proof that he made the right choice. Trivia: "The Greatest Gift" story did not sell so the author Philip Van Doren Stern had copies printed and included them in the Christmas cards he sent out in 1943. Just like The Wizard Of Oz, IAWL did not cover its high cost upon its original release and was deemed a box office flop. And although Oscar nominated for Best Film, Director and Star it received no Academy Awards. Frank Capra wrote in his autobiography that he closed his book on the film. He thought his dream was over? But something had happened, fans found the film and wrote to him, mostly praising some complaining but they kept writing. Decades later he was still answering letters, but the studio forgot about the film and it fell into public domain. In the 1970s, hundreds of TV stations started to play it every holiday season because they did not have to pay royalties. And so people had the chance to see it more than once and with repeated viewings word of mouth began to build and spread. But I'm here to tell you it's not the only one. There are dozens, no make that hundreds of films nearly this good just waiting to be discovered. I'll toss out a few titles: MEET JOHN DOE; YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU; MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON; LOST HORIZON and MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN. Anybody know who directed those masterpieces? I have a hand written letter I got back in the 1980s that reads,"Dear Larry, Frank Capra was a fine director with high ideals who was able to put them up on the big screen without preaching. Sincerely, James Stewart." Well find some friends &amp; family to watch it with you and then sit back for some fun, and enjoy this gift from Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. Or better yet, see it the way they meant for it to be shared, on THE BIG SCREEN just before Christmas. And one last thing, I am sure they would want me to wish you ? be sure to have a Wonderful Life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is another classic that i had not seen before but i knew quite a bit about it through reading about films and i am so pleased that this movie lives up to it's reputation. This is a fantastic movie. It's not just the acting which is memorable , its the message that this film sends. If you and your family have money problems like George Bailey it's not the end of the world because you have each other. Your children are everything and that's the feeling i got from this film. It takes a lot of it's ideas from Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol" and gives it a modern edge. Even though this film is 65 years old it does not matter. It will guarantee to put a tear in your eye and that last 10 minutes is what feel good movies are all about. James Stewart puts in the performance of his life and will probably always be known for this film and quite rightly so. This movie deserves to be high up in the list of the best movies of all time.</fullReview>

How the main character George Bailey struggles with his life and always makes the right decisions was really beautiful but sometimes sad to watch. How he struggles in his childhood, how he struggled in his school to win the girl, and how he had to dash his dreams of going to college so he could take care of the family business and also so that his brother could live happily.

		<fullReview>How often does a movie come along that changes the way you think and feel about your life? If you are like me not that often. Don't get me wrong I am a "movie-guy" I watch movies all the time, yes even "chick-flicks". But this movie is separate, its not obviously Hollywood in its approach to its core topic but rather it follows the path of an everyday man, in his thoughts and methods of thinking.If you, like most of us have seen this movie, then you know that most people in our society today could walk away from a job which was unintentionally handed to us. A job which controls our life and has impact on our goals, we could walk away. But George does not he is caught up trying to do the right thing. He wants to indulge in the "its my oyster" society but does not.Husband, Father, Nephew, Son and most of all Friend. George Baily is the common man, he is you, he is me, he is within all of us. We struggle, flounder, fall get back up. Wish and want more from life. Dream of doing and being and seeing different things. George finds he is far more rich than he thought when he considers how those around him feel about him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have probably heard that It's a Wonderful Life is one of the happiest, most uplifting movies ever made. This is so true. I watched this film for the first time last night on Christmas Eve, 2007, and all I have to say is that, besides being close to tears when it was finished, it made me feel blissful. Now feeling happy is not too exciting, but this film made me feel absolutely cherry. It is the kind of movie that, were I to be abandoned on an island and I could only choose five movies, this would most certainly be one of them. The film is oddly scary in that it is truthful...not in the sense that angels will come down and make a man continue to live, but in the sense that is shows what would have happened had someone never lived in a fashion that is entirely realistic.It's a Wonderful Life is remarkable, if not life changing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This classic continues to be one of the great films of all time. The story of a simple man who changes the lives of many people, and his journey to discover that life is a beautiful gift, is one of the best ever. James Stewart gives the best performance of his career and the movie has one of the best messages in the history of cinema. This is also one of the few movies that can actually make me cry. I like to think of this movie as something to watch whenever you are depressed or feeling low, cause it definitely helps.Not only to be seen as a Christmas movie, it shows us that anyone can make a difference. A true classic in every way, It's a wonderful life is definitely a must watch for anyone, not just movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Christmas movie . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not perfectly understood at the time, It's a Wonderful Life was nearly a forgotten relic until something magical happened ? it fell out of copyright and into public domain. In the early 70s, the film began cropping up on every two-bit UHF station in the country. That gave the film access to a wide audience and the film eventually became an annual Christmas tradition.It became a tradition for me too, not just at Christmas, but anytime that I need a lift. It tells the story of a genial, high-spirited Average Joe named George Bailey who struggles his whole life to get out into the world and make a name for himself. He dreams of becoming an architect, but responsibilities at home in Bedford Falls keep pulling him back.Far up in the heavens, George's life story is laid out by the guardians above to the angel who will step in to keep him from committing suicide. We see that, as a kid, he saved two lives; he saved his brother from drowning and later his pharmacist boss from accidentally poisoning a patient's pills. As an adult, he makes a name for himself in town and continually puts his dreams on hold so others can have theirs. He holds off on going to college so his brother can go. Then, when he finally gets a chance to go to school, his father dies and he has to take over the family building and loan. Then he survives the depression by using the money from the company to build houses for the poor folks. All the while he still has stars in his eyes, dreaming of making a foothold on the world, even after he marries his sweetheart Mary and they start raising a family together. Then his uncle foolishly loses the company's $8,000 bank deposit that could send one or both of them to jail. Deep in dispair, George briefly considers killing himself.That is the moment that Heaven sends an angel named Clarence his way and he shows George the world of Bedford Falls had he never existed. Those he loved are either dead or in great dispair. The town is now owned by the mean Mr. Potter, whom George spent his life trying to keep from buying the town and molding it in his own image. His wife has never married and his war hero brother Harry drowned as a kid. These scenes are the polar opposite of what has come before and the polar opposite of the tone that Frank Capra always used. Where Capra puts every emotion on screen in the lighter scenes, he allows the alternate universe to have the opposite effect, not just dark but a complete hell on earth.Yet, Capra's great achievement is in creating a film that contains multitudes of comedy, of drama, of humanity, of the composition of a life and not just the plot points. The closing passages of the despair are so strong that we forget the reason they are so strong is because we have such an emotional investment in what has come before. Scenes like the joy of the high school reunion which turns into a pool party; the immortal scene in which Mary loses her bathrobe and hides in a bush while George teases her with it; George's handling of the bank crises and how he keeps the building and loan from being swallowed up by Mr. Potter; the scene in which George tells Potter to take a flying leap after the man offers him a job so he can liquidate the building and loan and the later scene in which he has to crawl back to Potter to ask for help when Uncle Billy loses the bank deposit.Then, of course, there is the tearful reunion when everyone in town brings him money to help refurbish the bank deposit (which turns out to quadruple the lost money). The brilliance is Capra's nerve to put all these elements into one film in a coherent, sentimental mixture. He allows the great tapestry of George's life to play out long before we get to the nightmare. When that nightmare comes, Clarence explains it beautifully: "Don't you see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it all away?" It is difficult to put It's a Wonderful Life into words. What can you say about it that hasn't already been said? This a beautiful film about the value of a single life and its positive effect on so many others. This is one of the most quoted films in history but I think the line that sums it up best comes from Clarence, and it plays to our feelings: "Strange isn't it? One man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't there it leaves an awful hole."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Christmas (and all year round) movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's 1946 drama/fantasy IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is one of the best-remembered films of all time, and it's no surprise; this moralistic tale of human suffering, poverty, greed, courage and determination is one that resounds through the ages, particularly so in our modern age of fat-cat bankers and a growing gap between rich and poor.James Stewart gives a dependably decent turn as George Bailey, a family man who finds himself at the mercy of Lionel Barrymore's criminal banker, Mr. Potter. What follows is lengthy and often profound, an occasionally twee but ultimately moving exploration of the human character and the effect one man can have on his world.What I particularly liked about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is the way that every part of the narrative hangs together without any unnecessary extras. Even the little bits like the accident on the ice at the outset later come back to haunt our characters. It's very well written, and expertly directed by Frank Capra; an unashamedly old-fashioned, heart-warming and sentimental piece of movie-making on a grand scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is considered one of the best movies of all time, and also one of the most beloved Christmas movies in American cinema, even though it was a box office failure when it was released and received some negative reviews, and it won just the Academy Award for Technical Achievements, despite being nominated for five more. What I like about this movie is that it isn't a classic Christmas movie: the movie isn't about how things get better overnight for the main character just because he/she 'believes in Christmas', or some idiocy like that. Christmas just plays a small, but great role in the final part of the movie, which is, ultimately, about life.The movie starts with God and Joseph, explaining to the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) that he has to go to Earth and save George Bailey (James Stewart), who's contemplating suicide. God then begins to show Clarence George's most relevant moments in life, from childhood till the present. Most of the movie is actually spent showing us that George always wanted to travel but decided to stay in his hometown and save his late father's business, and that he's always been a good person, who's always thought more of the others than himself and has led a good life. But when he finds out he can't pay a debt, he wishes he'd never been born ? and Clarence shows him what would have become of his town, had he never been born.As I've said before, It's a Wonderful Life is about life. When you're young you have your dreams and ambitions, and you're sure that you'll end up living an ideal life, just like the one you've always planned. But life just happens and you often can't control it, and one day you discover you're a completely different person from the one you wanted to be. Some of us can't stand this and eventually come to a breaking point: George in this movie wanted to end it all and thought everyone would have been better off without him, not realising he had done so much and that even the problems that seem insurmountable can be resolved, with help from friends and family.Because of its simple but timeless story, this movie has aged beautifully. Add to that the great acting and dialogues, the good sense of humour, the complex characters, the great cinematography ? and you get a truly wonderful movie. It's impossible not to see and feel that George Bailey represents all of us, and it's easy to share his joys and sorrows as if they were our own. Ultimately, this is a movie that truly sums up what Christmas ? but also all our lives ? should be about: being a good person, because it pays off and because the richest people are those surrounded by family and friends, not the ones that have lots of money. It might be a naive and idealistic message, but it works amazingly for this time of the year.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Holiday Film!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore and Henry Travers star in this 1946 drama. This takes place in the small town of Bedford Falls and focuses on mild-mannered man, George Bailey (Stewart) who longs to go to college and eventually travel the world. His plans change when his father passes away and he takes over his business. George also reunites with childhood sweetheart, Mary Hatch (Reed) and soon they get married. George has always put his plans on hold in order to help the needs of others. Soon, he gets down on his luck when he tries saving his father's failing company from shrewd, wealthy businessman, Henry Potter (Barrymore). George meets guardian angel, Clarence (Travers) who is sent to help him in his time of need and shows him what his life would be like without him. George learns his life is wonderful with him in it and that his good deeds will help him in return. Stewart &amp; Reed are great in this and have good chemistry. I recommend this good holiday film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unabashed Sentimental Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the edge of financial ruin. He thinks his life has amounted to nothing and is about to jump off a bridge. An angel named Clarence is assigned to give George a second chance by showing him what if he was never born.This is an unabashed sentimental tear jerker. The movie starts with George's life as it is. His dream is to travel the world, and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.This is classic Frank Capra. The nice guy struggles but always win in the end. This sentimental melodrama is especially fitting for the Christmas period, and derives its iconic status from the constant showing during those times. The failure in its original run is a long forgotten memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Truly Is A Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1946, America, and the rest of the world for that matter, had just witnessed and won the most destructive war in mankind's history. They were trying to rebuild their lives from this and the Great Depression as well and as such, Hollywood got into the act by producing a number of movies that instilled hope in their audiences. Perhaps the greatest of these movies is Frank Capra's timeless film "Its A Wonderful Life" staring the late, great James Stewart as everyday man George Bailey in small town America, Bedford Falls. George has spent his entire life in Bedford Falls, longing to see the outside world but never able to get past the confines of the small savings and loans that he is in charge of. Then, one Christmas Eve, George's Uncle, Billy (played by the memorable character actor Thomas Mitchell) makes a terrible mistake that could ruin them both forever and George begins to think that everything would be better without him. It just so happens that heaven hears his and others' prays and sends an angel named Clarence (played by the understated but talented Henry Travers) to show him how wrong he is. In a Scrooge like role, we also have the great Lionel Barrymore in an excellent performance of Henry Potter, "the richest and meanest man in town" and in her most famous role, Donna Reed as George's loving and devoted wife. This is a movie that will make you laugh, maybe make you cry, and leave you with a sense that no matter how bad things get, there is always hope. "Its A Wonderful Life" is by far the greatest Christmas movie that has ever been produced and for that matter, will ever have been produced due to the time that it was made in and its message of how we all affect our fellow man, often times without even realizing it. So, I urge you to watch this movie and take in its message of hope and also, remember, no man is a failure as long as he has friends. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wasn't the first and won't be the last of the classic's I 'get around to', but so far, it's one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't feel comfortable in my skin a few years back. My friends and family considered me 'the movie buff'. In a way, I was. I'd seen about 4,000 movies, and covered literally everything worth watching since 1980, but I hadn't broken into the vault of classic films. I'd seen a few.Wuthering Heights(9.5/10) and The Wizard of Oz(10/10) were two of my favorite films, both from 1939. I'd also seen 1939's Gone With the Wind(9/10), Dark Victory(9/10), and a few other classics:The Killing, King Kong, Frankenstein, Dracula, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, War of the Worlds, Mr. Smith goes to Washington, and some Hitchcock.Citizen Kane, It's A Wonderful Life, and Casablanca sat embarrassingly on my watchlist. So did a litany of great classic films.My journey to fill this void has been an exciting one.It's a Wonderful Life is a great film for those who haven't given classic film a chance. It doesn't overstay it's welcome. The production values are strong, and the story is a template for many of today's films. Seriously, I can name 500 films from the last 2 decades that use this story/life-lesson, but I can't name one that does it quite as effectively as it's done here.It's a film that is practically impossible to dislike.James Stewart is fantastic, and many of the characters in the film teach us life lessons, not just the lead. Words like integrity, generosity, and sacrifice take on a whole new meaning.The film doesn't really have the holiday vibe I was expecting until the last 40 minutes. The holiday season is nothing more than a platform to remind us of all that is important in life. That aspect of the film surprised me.Good guys don't finish last. Why? Because when they're down, there's always someone there to pick them up.I can see all the reasons why there are those like me that shy(d) away from Classic film. You have to take some of the customs of the day and the production stuff with a grain of salt and get past it. Or better yet, understand it. If you do - you'll find what's underneath to be fantastic. A week before the release of "The Hobbit", I think it's important to remember that as much care or more went into productions like this back in the day.Now, I get all the references to this film that I missed over the last 40 years. I see the shots of the town and the snow that will forever be etched into my mind. It's amazing how all those "production and technology" issues from the time yield more memorable moments and shots than just about anything you'll see at the theater today.This is a fantastic movie. 95/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra understood filmmaking. This is a movie that could be about anyone of us and a movie that might relate to the life of anyone of us.Sadly the weak dismiss the movie as sentimentalist. I say the "weak" because they are threatened by how real and how close to life the movie actually is.Our lives are full of sentiment and the same sentiments the movie stirs in the audience are as strong and relevant in 2012 as 1946.Interestingly it gets pegged as a holiday or Christmas movie. I don't see it that way but maybe for many that is the time when they explore their own sentimental side.Watch this movie in the dark and late at night. It will never disappoint the film-goer who drops there guard and believes they are a Bailey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had only heard of this movie before and knew little of it. My curiosity was piqued when learning it was in the top 250 movies of all time. I watched it not knowing what to expect and what I received was beyond anything I could have imagined. We meet George Bailey and learn of his ambitions to travel the world and do great things in life. George helps many people in his young life and soon he struggles to keep his Bailey Bros loan building. George soon dislikes his life and wishes he was never born. He learns to appreciate the value of his life and the impact he has had on the lives of others after his wish comes true and we learn the importance of life and the joy we bring into others lives, joy we never knew we were responsible for. A wonderful life is an amazing film which will surely bring tears to one's eyes. Truly, this movie will be remembered for many years to come, and it is now on my top five Greatest Movies of All Time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Wonderful Film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is a Christmas drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra, that was based on the short story "The Greatest Gift", written by Philip Van Doren Stern.The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a man whose imminent suicide on Christmas Eve brings about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody. Clarence shows George all the lives he has touched and how different life in his community would be had he never been born.As the film opens, it's Christmas Eve, 1946, and George, who has long considered himself a failure, faces financial ruin and arrest and is seriously contemplating suicide. High above Bedford Falls, two celestial voices discuss Bailey's dilemma and decide to send down eternally bumbling angel Clarence Oddbody, who after 200 years has yet to earn his wings, to help George out. But first, Clarence is given a crash course on George's life, and the multitude of selfless acts he has performed: rescuing his younger brother from drowning, losing the hearing in his left ear in the process; enduring a beating rather than allow a grieving druggist to deliver poison by mistake to an ailing child; foregoing college and a long-planned trip to Europe to keep the Bailey Building and Loan from letting its Depression-era customers down; and, most important, preventing town despot Potter (Lionel Barrymore) from taking over Bedford Mills and reducing its inhabitants to penury. Along the way, George has married his childhood sweetheart Mary, who has stuck by him through thick and thin. But even the love of Mary and his children are insufficient when George, faced with an $8000 shortage in his books, becomes a likely candidate for prison thanks to the vengeful Potter. Bitterly, George declares that he wishes that he had never been born, and Clarence, hoping to teach George a lesson, shows him how different life would have been had he in fact never been born. After a nightmarish odyssey through a George Bailey-less Bedford Falls (now a glorified slum called Potterville), wherein none of his friends or family recognize him, George is made to realize how many lives he has touched, and helped, through his existence; and, just as Clarence had planned, George awakens to the fact that, despite all its deprivations, he has truly had a wonderful life. What is remarkable about It's a Wonderful Life is how well it holds up over the years; it's one of those ageless movies, like Casablanca or The Third Man, that improves with age.It is due to the fact that it combines the characters, the story, the message, and the acting in one cohesive and flawless film.That is why it's easy to see why it isn't just a holiday favorite, but a great movie by almost any standards through out the decades.It is truly the epiphany of movie sentiment and a transcendent experience.In summary,this holiday classic to define all holiday classics, It's a Wonderful Life is one of a handful of films worth an annual viewing.It's truly a wonderful film!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Each man's life touches so many other lives." ~ Clarence Oddbody, AS2I believe "It's a Wonderful Life" is a favorite of many. It is certainly a favorite of mine. James Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is, well, wonderful, and one of his very best performances. Lionel Barrymore is perfection as Mr. Potter, the richest and meanest man in town. Donna Reed is darling as George Bailey's beloved wife, Mary. And Henry Travers is charming and adorable as Clarence Oddbody, AS2 (Angel Second Class).In the spirit of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol", this is the story of a man who gets a rare glimpse of what the world would be like if he never existed. Through the magic of Frank Capra, we take a glorious ride with Clarence, a guardian angel who has yet to earn his wings. In answer to many prayers from the folks of Bedford Falls, Clarence is assigned to help George Bailey, the town's hero, in his darkest hour. George Bailey is a man who has positively impacted many people's lives by putting the needs of others ahead of his own; but still, he has regrets. After giving up his own career aspirations, he steps into his late father's role of running the small Building and Loan business in order to continue his father's good work to help the folks of Bedford Falls and keep it out of Potter's greedy hands. He settles down and marries his childhood sweetheart and raises a family in the same small town despite his dream to travel the world and become an architect.Mr. Potter, the heartless villain in the story, tries everything in his power to take down George Bailey and the rinky-dink Building and Loan Company. George manages to keep the company afloat, even using his own money at times, and continues to be loyal to the people of Bedford Falls - who depend on him for a chance to own their own homes. But one fateful day, $8,000 accidentally goes missing from the Building and Loan and George fears the scandal will take them down after all. Distraught and defeated, George contemplates suicide, believing he is worth more dead than alive. Enter Clarence, the gentle and child-like guardian angel, who shows George the way.The sentiment in this movie is overwhelming and if it does not tug at your heart, you are not human. In classic Capra style, this film offers lessons in patience and perseverance, selflessness and self-respect, loyalty and compassion and faith and forgiveness. This movie is a magical journey of pure love.Even though I have seen this film many times over, I still watch it every Christmas. It is one of my essentials.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than Merely a Christmas Film ? A Film for Any Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" has become a staple of the Christmas season. It will invariably be played around the holidays, whether broadcast on T.V or picked out by a family from their DVD collection. But watching it again this year, I realized just how little it has to do with Christmas. To be sure, the famous final sequence takes place around then, but the full film is a broader celebration of life, humanity, and the human spirit. Confining it to simply a glorification of the Christmas spirit seems too narrow.Through the story of the life of George Bailey and the lives of those around him, "It's a Wonderful Life" celebrates basic human kindness and compassion. It praises selflessness and putting others above oneself, as George does time and time again ? forsaking his dreams for the betterment of those more unfortunate than he in Bedford Falls. It condemns greed, heartlessness, and fierce manipulation of fellow persons on Earth through Henry F. Potter, the shriveled and devious old businessman played to malicious perfection by Lionel Barrymore. It extols the worth of the life of any living being, no matter how poor or pitiful they appear and whatever their flaws may be. Consider the way George extends a caring hand to his dearly daffy Uncle Billy or to Violet Bick when she has fallen on hard times. Think of what he saves them both from when he could have easily cast them aside on account of their vices and imperfections, turning them away.Are these values appropriate for Christmas? Yes, of course. But they are just as appropriate for any time. Calling this "a Christmas film" somewhat underestimates the power of its themes, themes that are ageless and universal (or so I would hope). This is a film that deserves to be kept in the heart all the year round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Wonderful Life, It's A Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's A Wonderful Life is a sort of retelling of A Christmas Carol. But instead of showing a man the joy of Christmas, it's showing a man the joy one man's life can bring to others and himself.George Bailey(James Stewart)is going through a rough time during the holiday season. Nearly everyone in town starts to pray for him when they notice and that gets the angels attention. Joseph begins telling another angel Clarence the story of George's life. Throughout his childhood and early adulthood George made sacrifices for the good of his friends and family. He saved his brother from drowning in an icy lake, which cost him all hearing in his left ear, and stopped his boss from delivering a prescription to a child that he mistakenly filled with poison out of grief for the loss of his son.All George wants to do with his life is to go see the world. He tells his dream to a local girl, Mary(Donna Reed) who has had a secret crush on George since they were kids. He's decided to wait until his brother, Harry graduates so he can replace him to work with their father at their Business and Loan company. On the night of his brother's graduation they find out his father had a fatal stroke. A business rival, Mr. Potter(Lionel Barrymore)sees this as the opportunity to stop loans to the poor. The only way the board of directors will refuse his proposal is if George runs the business in his father's stead. George continues to sacrifice by letting Harry get a better job and continue to look after the family business. He eventually returns Mary's affections and they get married. Before they can leave they see a run on the bank and give everyone a piece of their honeymoon money. These types of sacrifices go on for awhile and George continues to do things for the benefit of his community, even when he is offered a better job with Potter that would give him the opportunity to see the world. But on Christmas Eve his Uncle Billy loses money that was meant to be put in the bank for the business. Without it George could go to jail. This depresses George and takes his anger out on his family before trying to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. He's stopped by Clarence who reveals himself to be his guardian angel. George wishes that he was never born because he feels he accomplished nothing with his life. Clarence grants his wish and George sees that the town has gone completely under the control of Mr. Potter. His brother died in the lake years ago, his old boss was sent to prison for poisoning the kid, Potter owns all the stores and has turned the Bailey building into a strip club, and Mary is unmarried.George wishes himself back to life and begins to appreciate that he has accomplished many things. The people of Bedford Falls help him by pitching in to give him the money they lost and keep him out of jail. Clarence gets his wings and George realizes that he did make a difference.This movie is a classic Christmas movie. I may not have done the movie justice by summing the plot up but I assure you you won't regret watching it.10/10 A+ Just perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It does not disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly my second favourite movie of all time, but at Christmas it is my number one choice. I watch this film EVERY Christmas eve and will continue to do so as long as i am able.A Wonderful Life is everything a Christmas movie should be; warm, nostalgic, funny, tragic and heartfelt. One year when watching this, my dad came into the room for the ending and with tears in his eyes turned to me and said "they don't make films like that anymore". He was right. Capra is a legend because of his ability to make a lovely film which paints the world as basically good with some rough patches to be overcome. James Stewart's skill is in making this world seem realistic instead of hokey, and convincing us to care about his character with it's good soul, kind manners and bad luck. For any person feeling glum, angry or disillusioned, this film is a direct injection of joy, love and triumph at a time when a lot of us need it most - it does not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, loved by critics and viewers alike. Well, most. So much has been said that praises this heart-warming tale of George Bailey that I won't bother going over the same stuff. What I will talk about instead is the other side of the film. While most see it as a holiday movie, at the core is a dark and powerful story. George has spent all of his life wanting to go out into the world, go to college, do amazing stuff, travel the globe, and whatnot. However, every chance he gets, he's faced with a moral dilemma: Do the right thing, or go his own way. Inevitably, George winds up doing the right thing, which almost always conflicts with what he really wants to do. As the years roll by, we see his life develop in unexpected ways. At the heart, George is a terrific guy who has chosen to put others before himself. He's made a ton of sacrifices, but in ways he's taken his life for granted. And on one fateful Christmas day, a "monetary" bomb is dropped into the midst of his life that totally throws him off. Distressed and hurting, George feels there is no way out but to end his life. And that's where the Almighty steps in and sends down help in the form of a kindly, rotund angel named Clarence. Ultimately, what Clarence grants to George is the opportunity to see what life would've been like without him. And this is the where the movie takes its darkest turn. We see that every person's life, even the town of Bedford Falls itself, has been corrupted by the absence of George. And after George asks to live again, we begin to understand that despite whatever trouble is coming for him, it's better to face it alive. Some have complained that the bad guy, Mr. Potter, doesn't get his comeuppance in the end. But I say, Mr. Potter will one day get his own tale, in the form of "A Christmas Carol." Until then, George learns what life really means: No matter the turmoils, no matter whether you're rich or poor, life is the richest reward you can be given. And that is what makes IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE such a classic, because anybody who lives long enough must face the reality of both the good and the bad in their own lives. When they sing Auld Lang Syne at the end, it does mark a new year. It's the new year for George Bailey, and anyone else who's faced similar dilemmas in life. Plus, if ever there was a mainstream (secular) movie to convince us that there is a God and angels that watch over us, this is the movie to do it. So, keep ringing those bells every Christmas!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another take on this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***This may contain spoilers*** I have to say that as more and more time goes by since the 1946 premiere of this film, the more it appears to be a naive socialist take on our society. That doesn't make it a bad film, but it does make it worthy of some alternate comments."The Meanest Man In Town" Mr. Potter actually makes some accurate comments about the banking industry before the "plot wave" overtakes him and tries to make him irrelevant.The town gets together at the end of the film to save a bank in a great socialist outpouring. That's quite the opposite of the idea that bank greed is ruining us as a society, a concept that certainly existed before 1946.Finally, I find the "wholesomeness of the human spirit" concept as it is shown to be in this movie to be quite irritating. You need to come to this movie's level in order to appreciate it, to me that's lower than I want to go.But hey, you can just call me Scrooge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is as much a part of Christmas to me as stockings, candy, snow dusted-trees and shopping. It was a tradition for our family to watch this movie every Christmas Eve before my two siblings and I were tucked into bed in anticipation for Santa Clause to visit our front door (we didn't have a chimney). I will admit that I am not usually a fan of films from this era (I gave Casablanca 5 out of 10 stars), but this feature is different. It's long, but it has to be. The storyline truly covers the main character's entire life. It all comes together in the end in divine detail. It's uplifting and romantic. One suggestion, only watch this film in December before Christmas, it's much easier to appreciate that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This always gets to me, because in its way it seems so plausible: not the angel part, but the fact that life has some ups and plenty of downs, yet the committed goodwill of a single individual can have a cascading, snowball effect on people near and far. I guess that's karma, unadorned, and I believe that love is the closest thing to god the universe will ever know. The fact, even the possibility, that you can increase the net amount of love in the world is really about as good as it gets. No fantasy about it. It's real. It's just hard to do it consistently, and too easy to destroy what it takes a long time to build. So, building and loaning seems like a good way to go....Of course, one could go about this in a somewhat savvier way than Jimmy Stewart's character. Still, for such an uplifting and Christmas-y film, this certainly cuts close to the bone, and fortunately in a healing way. Even if there's no snow on my desert island, I'm bringing this one along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the story about what is a successful life,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>he Review of the Movie, 'It's a Wonderful Life', by Jennifer HeoI happened to watch this movie a few months after watching Avatar, which was very controversial about adapting a new technology of 3D in film making in 2009. Compared to Avatar, which is visually colorful and dynamic but it has an almost non-existent storyline, this movie not only is well played and matched in the stars' roles but also gives us a message about sincere and happy lives.The setting and costumes are so classic. It is a white and black movie released in 1947 right after World War 2. Each of the movie stars' costumes, the women's hairstyle in 1940s, men's suits, and settings can be boring and weird, but it can lead me to feel calm and refined.The movie was photographed in a small village of Bedford Hill in America. It was nominated for the academy award and won the director award. It is certain that a family can enjoy it together all the time not only for Christmas. When you need some refreshment in your life, it shows you how to lead your life to be successful. Of course a successful life depends on each single person. However, I think this movie shows us true success is not how much money we own, but how we spend the money through two characters, George Baily(James Stewart) and Henry F. Potter(Lionel Banymore). In addition, Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) shows how important and helpful a lovely lover, devoted wife, and dedicated mother is for a man's wonderful life.George Bailey is an optimistic and cheerful character throughout the movie. The man with a big dream adventuring a larger and wider world from his childhood days wants to be more educated. However, he has to choose another way that he doesn't want. It leads him to sacrifice his life for his family and some other people in the village. His sacrificial life brings about that he is well-known and respected in the small village, while he has to be against the richest and meanest Henry Potter, who lives in the same village. On the contrary, Potter without any children has over money enough to live, but he doesn't give any charity for others. He tries to take advantage of people in the village to make a fortune. He even tempts George Bailey, suggesting a job with some good conditions. That is because he thinks that George prevents him from expanding his business. However, he rejects it without any hesitation and always chooses the righteous and helpful life for other people.What I was impressed most by in the story is the scenes showing how much he and Mary love each other. He meets Mary at school dance party for celebrating graduation. They fall in love with each other and she chooses him to get married and fully supports him whatever he wants to do. It encourages him to work harder for the people. Yet, he plunges into the depth of despair because of his uncle's big mistake on the Christmas Eve. At that time, through his guardian angel called Clarence, he finds out that the people who he loves including Mary, his eternal lover and wife, lead desperate lives in the world without him and he realizes that he leads a great life. Especially, the last scene where his friends collect money to help him in despair and he is paid back from the people who know him makes us contemplate what a wonderful life is. I could not control the tears from coming down my cheek.The Christmas carol in the movie and the scenes of snow make us feel happy. I am often forced to grab it in the season of Christmas every year. This old classic movie adding folktale elements by an angel's appearance also tugs heartstrings and gives a profound message. Therefore, I can recommend you to watch with your family and whomever you want. I think George Bailey can surely be your life guide in a tough life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essential Frank Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film more than any other is the reason we still hear Frank Capra as a famous film name. In recent years it has become a Christmas movie on NBC &amp; the exposure at the network level has given this movie the type of fame enjoyed by The Wizard of Oz.It deserves the accolades too. Not only is this a great script with great Direction, but Jimmy Stewart is excellent &amp; uniquely cast in the role as the hero. This film shows how good an actor he is. This film might just be the reason Stewart got the attention of Alfred Hitchcock which would lead to Rope, Rear Window, &amp; Vertigo. It wasn't that Stewart was chopped liver before this film, but the way he carries it is a great acting job. Capra-Stewart just seemed to have the right chemistry together as they had already combined in some other roles too. It is interesting that Stewart was so good that he would work with nearly every great director of this era before he was done.Donna Reed has her best movie screen role here too. The script is just a wonder of all time. Capra seems to always get a hold of unique &amp; powerful scripts &amp; this one is no exception to that. Granted Mr Smith Goes To Washington &amp; You Can't Take It With You are good scripts too, but this is the one which still invades the National stage most often today.This film rates a bravo from start to finish &amp; may never go out of style. It is indeed a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's obvious why when every time a "Greatest Ever Movies" type programme comes on, It's A Wonderful Life is always in the top 5. It's the perfect Christmas movie. James Stewart is a fantastic actor and one of the greatest central characters of film history. He plays a hard working, kind family man who, after some depressing chain of events wishes he was never born. His guardian angel pays him a visit and shows him what life would have been like had he not existed. The build up to this event is a little long but that's what makes the film so successful and helps us to feel Stewart's pain. It's a heart-warming, feel good tale which should be enjoyed by generation after generation!Thanks for reading!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some music for this film was borrowed from Alfred Newman's score written for the 1939 version of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame". Notably the hallelujah choir which can be heard when George is running down the street shouting "merry Christmas" at everybody. This wonderful music is available on CD in a Russian recording from 1996, with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, conductor William T Stromberg, on the label "Marco Polo". (disc number 8.223750) That CD also contains other interesting scores, a suite from "Beau Geste" and one piece from "All About Eve". Some music has been reconstructed by Stromberg because the original music was lost.</fullReview>

It's sweet and great and I don't know what else. My favorite scene is when George woos the girl. Seriously sweet how they did it in the 19s. The character of George is funny and true. I also love how they portrayed the family. Love how they dawned on the importance of loving relationships and seriously it brought me back to the innocent self I have been as a child.

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Christmas Eve in the town of Bedford Falls and George Bailey, a man who has spent his entire life sacrificing for others, is thinking of taking his life. Knowing George is in trouble, though perhaps not the extent, his family and friends pray that God help him. And that's exactly what He does -- in the form of an angel named Clarence. Throughout the bulk of the film, Clarence is brought up to date on George's life (as are the viewers). From childhood to adulthood, he sees that George has been a heroic noble soul, giving until it hurts and then giving some more. In order to save George, Clarence must show him what an impact he has had on the world and those he loves. James Stewart's performance is flawless. One of the core strengths of the film is how it covers so much emotional ground. From happy to sad to angry to loving, Stewart masters it all. He's an actor who appeared in virtually every kind of film and that helps here as he has to handle drama, romance, comedy, fantasy...even a little action thrown in for good measure. His performance in this film is my earliest recollection as a child of being in awe of an actor.Lionel Barrymore gives a career-defining performance here. For generations to come, he would be remembered as the villainous Mr. Potter. He had a storied career, full of so many different parts and very few of them were bad guys. One of his best roles was the gruff but lovable and wise Dr. Gillespie in the Dr. Kildare series for MGM. So it's kind of ironic that Barrymore is best known for portraying a thoroughly rotten man. But that's the talent of the man. He breathed life into Potter and made him so hissable.Such a great cast. The wonderful Henry Travers has his career-defining role, as well. Who doesn't love Clarence Odbody, AS2 (Angel Second Class)? The heavenly Donna Reed. She positively glows in this film. As a kid watching I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. I think it again every time I watch this movie. Ward Bond and Frank Faylen as the ORIGINAL Bert &amp; Ernie. Gloria Graham as the sultry Violet Bick. Samuel S. HInds and Beulah Bondi as the Bailey parents. The amazing Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy. Who can forget H.B. Warner's moving performance as Mr. Gower? William Edmunds as Martini and Sheldon Leonard as Nick the bartender. Todd Karns as Harry Bailey. And all those wonderful child actors playing the Bailey kids as well as those in the flashbacks. Just a perfect cast.Frank Capra, one of my absolute favorite filmmakers, does such a brilliant job at directing here. Amazing pace. The film never slows down but never feels rushed. He worked from a script that had many authors. Normally, this would be a terrible sign for a film and would almost certainly mean it was a disjointed mess. But that couldn't be further from the truth in this case. The script is tight, flawless even. Wonderful lines, memorable scenes. So many memorable scenes. It's hard to even pinpoint which to talk about because the entire movie is one classic scene after another. But I'll try. There are brilliant scenes like "George Lassos the Moon," the bank run, the childhood confrontation with a grieving Mr. Gower, or the wonderful ending. But here are two of my favorites. The phone call scene where George and Mary share a phone. Such a sensual, romantic scene as they give into their feelings. The prayer in the bar is such a moving scene. Stewart's performance is so powerful here it's criminal he didn't win an Oscar for this role. So many more unforgettable scenes I could mention.I think of it as the greatest film ever made. I know there are some who will knock that. I realize there are all kinds of technical and cultural reasons that this film or that is the greatest. Citizen Kane, for example. While I love Kane or the Godfather films or countless other contenders, most of them are purely dramatic works that don't have for me what this film has: compelling rewatchability. It's my favorite film. It's as simple as that. I have seen it countless times. It's a beautiful story with Dickensian touches. A charming, funny, dramatic, sentimental, romantic, uplifting movie that makes me happy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes a 'Christmas' movie? The fact that it's set during Christmas or that the movie itself is about Christmas? I personally believe that the movie's message is as important as how much fake snow is laying about the set and amazingly, this iconic picture remained unwatched until yesterday. But what better film is there to get one feeling all festive? This is a heady cocktail of festive spirit, comedic satire and morality tale in the finest tradition of Charles Dickins and frankly, even a stone-hearted cynic like myself had to wipe my eyes away as the cast gathered to sing Auld Lang Syne at the end. There are plenty of reasons why this remains the definitive Christmas movie.James Stewart plays George Bailey, unassuming everyman who can never quite live the adventurous life he wants. Cursed to living in the sleepy town of Bedford Falls, he ekes out a living at his late father's building &amp; loan company at the expense of a more lavish lifestyle for his wife Mary (Donna Reid) and their four children while giving the townspeople some respite from the financial might of local scrooge Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore). But when his business partner Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses their last $8000 on Christmas Eve, despondent George is tipped over the edge and he finds himself at a bridge, staring into the icy waters below with dark thoughts in his head. But when an angel with no wings called Clarence (Henry Travers) is dispatched to intervene, he shows George how life in Bedford Falls would have been if George had never been born.Feeling like a cross between "A Christmas Carol" and "The Shawshank Redemption", "It's A Wonderful Life" is probably the most powerful fable I've seen all year. Most of the film is spent building up the goody-two-shoes nature of George and watching his inevitable decline is harrowing and heart-breaking. But the film has plenty of laughs in there as well such as the moment Mary finds herself in an awkward spot behind a bush to the Charleston that ends up in a swimming pool. The other reason you completely buy into the story is Stewart - you can see and feel the pain as his world crumbles around him and his unmitigated joy once he realises the error of his ways provides the film with one of the most uplifting endings I can ever recall seeing. Stewart is the picture, even though he doesn't convince during the scenes when George is at his high school graduation (considering how much taller he was than everyone else, you'd think he'd been held back by seven years!). And if you were being picky, you might argue that some of the characters aren't as well defined as others (such as George's co-workers) and the colourised version is apparently pretty poor as Stewart himself reckoned that it made him feel sick.But it's Christmas and now is not the time for petty criticism - this remains the benchmark that every Christmas film since has aspired to and falls so far short that it's embarrassing. Stuff like "Santa Claus: The Movie" or "Elf" have all the jingle bells you'd ever need but none of the magic. "It's A Wonderful Life" is not just the greatest Christmas film ever made but also a fabulous movie in its own right, a fantastically inspiring film that sends you on an emotional roller-coaster before bringing a lump to your throat and a tear to your eye. It might not be terribly original or even plausible but watching it warms you up like a hot toddy after trudging through the snow and surely, that's the point. Merry Christmas everybody and God bless us, one and all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Life Matters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The strangest thing about life is how much one person can really be a importantly link to a whole. Whether it's by free will alone, divine design/power, or even both it will never been known, what is known are the results that one person does which can be extraordinary and part of what creates the whole. This is a Christmas/fantasy film I really like that I can come back to every once in a while. It really is a film that actually is pretty dark but also does in a way make you feel good, but most importantly causes you at times to evaluate your own life.There really isn't much I can really say that hasn't already been said. What really matters is the story itself which like all great stories despite how much time has passed it is timeless. The film in a way is kinda a Christian film since there are some Christian themes as well as influence that intervenes.George Bailey is kinda a Christian hero, and like most of them you actually feel a sense of heavy pathos for the guy. The guy had to unfortunately put all his dreams on hold, all to do the right thing for others. I like that he's a bit reluctant, he doesn't really want to be selfless, nor does he even enjoy doing the right thing which I'll admit is something I can emphasize with from time to time. However all the same he does it whether he wants to or not because there is no one else that will, or is even strong enough to. Like with most of Capra's films, they have one thing in common showing that being a good person isn't always the easiest thing to be.Even though George doesn't look like he has all the breaks, personally I think he does, his life actually is pretty good, he's got lots of friends, he's not boring, is active does things with himself, sure not the biggest adventure or exactly an event a minute. To me I always believed sometimes the smallest adventures are biggest, because of what you do during your lifetime. Unlike the antagonist Mr. Potter whom really just like his riches he holds doesn't do jack squat with himself, I can understand where the guys misery originates from but it's no excuse nor give him the right to ruin anyone elses life.Other than the drama, I really like the fantasy aspect which was the first or one of the first times they ever constructed an alternate scenario. This is a common place format now done in many TV shows even comic books, but this film was one of the first and I feel still the best. The alternate scenario I felt was believable because it sort of plays out the notion that we all think of everyday, what if we were out of the picture, or we made that decision instead, or did that. Indeed it would of been a very different world, and of course we see this world without Geroge which is practically a cesspool as we see the blowhole Mr. Potter has fraked up bad. It really is disturbingly believable as George and we see how miserable most residents are, grungy and dirty Bedford falls is, the people that have been deceased because he wasn't around.The film has two really good messages, the first on the importance of exercising selflessness, it not just benefits the people around you but yourself as a person. But also about valuing your life that it really does matter whether you live or die, because of how much it is connected and affect the whole.One person does matter because one can do a whole lot in a single lifetime.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoiler alert)I first saw this movie 5 years ago. Didn't know much, I remember an article mentioned it as the best Christmas movie ever made. I knew the director so i sat down and watch it. It was a big shock for me, the movie was the best thing i ever watched. It caught me at a time that I didn't appreciate much happy endings. I didn't want to see just a gathering of people celebrating all together in a house about how wonderful their lives are. No I'm not a misanthrope, I just thing movies with sad endings usually are more realistic and interesting and movies with happy endings are easily forgotten. That's the socking thing about "It's a wonderful life" it made me appreciate optimistic movies again after a really long time. James Steward gives an amazing performance, full of passion, comedy and drama, it's impossible not to sympathize his character. I watch this movie every Christmas.

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my father proposed this black and white film about a guardian angel for me to watch years ago, as a teenager, my initial reaction could hardly have been a more overwhelming 'no.' But after persistence that for weeks was just below the surface, waiting to be unleashed every evening pickings on the television were slim, one especially uneventful night I succumbed and with a sigh agreed to watch it with mostly the intention of getting him off my case. Little I knew it would be the best film recommendation I had ever, and likely will ever receive.Most of the superlatives have been used up when describing this film so I will not go into them in too much detail again. The term perfection is thrown around loosely but I believe this is one of the very few films that can claim wear that lofty tag with comfort. Jimmy Stewart gives a stunning performance as George Bailey, one of the most endearing characters in cinematic history. The whole cast is excellent and the on- screen chemistry between George and Mary is a sight to behold. The true power in this film is how it manages to, almost effortlessly but with complete conviction, leave a profound emotional impact upon the viewer. It is a film that the viewer can get so emotionally connected to and can relate to so deeply that it can become part of that viewers person and change their outlook, philosophy, and indeed, their life. Personally I have seen the film too many times to remember and it still manages to leave a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye. It is perhaps ironic that years after that first viewing, I mirrored my father in turning pest and badgered my group of college housemates into watching. It is perhaps the best measure of a film's greatness that six sceptical 20year old college students could sit down, abandon the alternative option of an alcohol-propelled night out, and sit in silence as the film happened and blink away tears in the semi-darkness as the bells signalling the end of the masterpiece tolled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Life Changing Experience!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply 'The Perfect' movie experience of a lifetime. Then again, its not just a movie, but something you can actually relate to. The fact that it was made almost 65 years ago, doesn't have any bearing on its relevance. Like the saying goes, 'The more things change, the more they remain the same'.To be honest, I was going through a very similar situation that 'George Bailey' was in the movie, and I do have a habit of watching a 'feel good' movie to enliven my spirits whenever I am going through a bad phase. I must admit, it was one of the most sensible things I did in recent times. This movie has reinforced my belief that life is truly wonderful, and one should try to make the most of every moment. The old adage 'You reap what you sow' still holds true. Do good and no harm will come unto you.Everything in the movie looks so believable and the performances by the entire cast so natural. It all about keeping the faith and hope, particularly when you feel you are down and out. I could watch this movie, each and every day for the rest of my life!</fullReview>

After a run of bad luck he tries to kill himself on Christmas Eve, but is stopped by an angel Clarence(Henry Travers).Clarence gives George a look at what life in Bedford Falls would have been like if he didn't exist.Filled with memorable characters and moments this is uplifting,touching and well acted. There's fine support from Donna Reed as Bailey's wife, the scene where they realise they love each other whilst both speaking to someone on the phone is beautiful, it's moving, passionate and tender. Lionel Barrymore is marvellous as the heartless Mr. Potter who has no time for peoples problems and feelings.It's a wonderful story of love,community spirit,family and second chances. It's hard to except that when this was first released audiences found it too depressing.It's A Wonderful Life has become a part of peoples lives and a popular film to watch at Christmas time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the film "The Bishop's Wife" and could not help feeling the same way about it as "It's A Wonderful Life".If you have enjoyed this film and are craving more in the same vein, you might want to consider "The Bishop's Wife".While it is not the same film and has a different plot certainly, it shares many of the same production values and has the same sort of feel-good factor about it."The Bishop's Wife" is very much a Christmas film, with a lovely St. Bernard Dog that steals a couple of scenes. Another warm, fuzzy family film that was made only a year later than "It's A Wonderful Life".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why it's an icon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IAWL has inspired a number of imitations lately--one I would recommend is The Family Man with Nick Cage and Tea Leoni. But The Family Man didn't really stand up all that well on second viewing. IAWL has stood up under dozens.First and foremost, there's Jimmy Stewart. His performance in IAWL is the performance of his or anybody else's lifetime. The role of George Bailey is as demanding as any could be--everyman's life, with the highest highs and the lowest lows. I really don't think anyone else could have done it. Do you really think anyone else could have done the bit as Mary's reluctant suitor after Harry comes back to town? (Spoiler) Is there a better reaction shot than when George enters their new home/wedding suite, showing its signs of having to be prepared at the last minute and yet almost outrageously ingenious, itself a little bit (of which there are many others) of classic filmdom? There are at least a dozen others like these and contrasting with them.Second, there's the high concept (spoiler alert)--what if you could see how life would have been if you hadn't been born? Usually, this sort of thing falls flat, but when it works it's magic, and all the required setup is here to make it work.Third, the portrayal of Bedford Falls, achingly nostalgic for us to experience in the 21st century. So many characters in such variety who nevertheless seem to belong together, and share an experience that is more than their individual selves. I think it's here that the Christmas motif plays in.And one more, the message, which admittedly doesn't resonate with everyone, but should, dammit! "We have to stick together." I see some have complained about too much altruism, but I think they're missing the point. In the long run, George himself is better off for having been point man in the struggle to build community.Because in the end, although it's "friends" that George is seen to have in abundance, it's really more than that. It's all of Bedford Falls, whose existence depends on people like George, who are the difference between its community values and the values of Pottersville.In the end, the film is perhaps an argument for a life that never really was, but the dream or nostalgia of which we should never lose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental, Heart-warming Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE ***** Have you ever wished you'd never been born? What if that wish were granted? That's the premise of Frank Capra's sentimental, heart-warming tale of a man (Jimmy Stewart) who has many dreams to fulfill but few opportunities to bring it into being as life seems to pass him by. Though he finds contentment through a love-binding relationship with his lover (Donna Reed), Stewart eventually spirals into a whirlwind of emotions hoping for perfection in his life before trying to cease it. A fairly simple story that remains a classic because of the realistic, poignant drama that brilliantly unfolds through its complete running time and good performances by Stewart and Reed. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Relevant Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the truly great films to have ever been released in the post war era. The themes of wondering how different the world might have been if you weren't born is still a recurring theme in many films as well as television series, but this one really does it with a even greater poignancy than most that try to imitate it. However, the film really gives a great message that no matter how unimportant you feel, your life, for better or worse, touches each person that that you come in contact with. James Stewart is perfectly cast as George really show's why he is the perfect everyman in this film. Also, Donna Reed is wonderful as Mary, the love of his life. The two of them really convey the love that George and Mary felt for one another what made the relationship between the two of them special. I also loved the fact that it pretty much pulled no punches when dealing with what probably was the touchy subject of suicide. This film is truly one of the all time greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potter probably would have won today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film probably ends more happily than any film in the annals of Hollywood, with that great sing a long of Auld Lang Sine as George Bailey discovers what a wonderful life it is. The drama, comedy, and heartfelt sentimentality are all woven together into a seamless masterpiece. It portrays the bitter struggle for the future of Bedford Falls between egalitarian Bailey and hard-nosed miser Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore). One of the best of James Stewart's films, and that is saying something, and given a magic touch by director Frank Capra, with Donna Reed looking unbelievable, and Thomas Mitchell as the kindly but careless partner who manages to misplace the deposit that ultimately sends the picture into overdrive, it is the best holiday movie out there with the possible exception of the 1951 version of Scrooge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a movie most of the American population doesn't watch for 333 days of the year. I've found that watching this in late April is more rewarding than mid December.This is your only spoiler warning...That notion aside, I feared revisiting this movie because, like so many other films from this decade, I was worried it would show its age and thus kill itself in the process--fulfilling Bailey's wish.Amazingly, that isn't the case. This is sentimentality done right in the vein of 'The Elephant Man'. Why? The frame of the story; for that reason you should see it and get some tears in the process. First we have the setting of the world where Steward lives. Then there is Heaven. All our exposition of Stewart's world comes as a story being told to Clarence. Meanwhile, we--the audience--are tricked into accepting Stewart's life as reality until Capra slaps us upside the head and tells us "I'm not even started yet!"When we finally do get to the plot, we have Clarence as our navigator. From God to the Angel. This is when George sees how the world would be without his influence.Overall, skip 'Terminator' for your need to study the importance of one life. This is polarized like Capra's other works, but so interesting in the process. Can Spielberg do the same?Final Analysis = = Learn from this...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens when a film slips into the Public Domain...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As everyone as heard by now, this film slipped into the Public Domain in the early 1970s when it failed to be renewed for copyright. This was both a blessing and a curse. There are many other great films like this one which deserve to be shown more often on network TV. But they never will because of the royalties involved and the fact that they would never make that money back. But when a "forgotten" film is shown regularly on TV it can trigger a positive audience response and get a fan base for the film that it would not have otherwise had, as was the case here. But what about when there are no royalties to be paid? The film can be run over and over, into the ground, until it loses all freshness. With this particular film there seems to be people who need to watch it religiously each year, and others who get frankly tired of it. My opinion is that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a very good film. Certainly a very emotional ending. But labeling it a "Christmas" movie is nonsense and it was never intended to be shown only at the holidays. It is a motion picture, just like any other, and deserves to be watched objectively. That's what I'll do here. How does it compare to other similar films? Well, for one thing, I find that this film can convey some very strong emotions for a nearly 60 year old film. Another example is CITY LIGHTS, by Charlie Chaplin, which can still move audiences to tears 70 years after its release. I find the acting to be quite good, but it's worth noting that this shouldn't be surprising considering the first-rate cast (especially Stewart and Barrymore). I find the script to be generally rather weak, incidentally. I feel that the sheer great acting manages to overcome some fairly cliched lines and situations. Still there are also some memorably original sequences like the high school dance. The direction by Capra is excellent as always. It is not without good reason that he is considered one of America's foremost filmmakers. He definitely is not afraid to play scenes for ultimate emotional content which adds strongly to the personal and human element of his films. From a technical aspect, I find this film to be quite well made, especially given its low budget. The giant street set is quite convincing in creating a whole little "world" inhabited by the movie's characters. The location footage of the early suburban neighborhoods is an interesting record. The story itself is good but I feel that the entire concept of the angel was simply a cop-out. In earlier Capra efforts, the main character overcame adversity with effort and common sense. But this "guardian angel" device is complete fantasy. I guess it works to some extent but I found it to be an easy out. How does it rank against Capra's other films? Well, obviously nothing can touch the brilliant, landmark IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. One of the very funniest films ever made, and one of the very best. Also, I don't think IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is as successful in maintaining a theme as MR. DEEDS (1936). I would rank it after those two, earlier Capra efforts. Generally if I *have* to watch a "christmas" movie it would be Laurel and Hardy's BABES IN TOYLAND. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a very good film, and deserves to be shown. But so do many other films. I feel another release of 1946, DETOUR, by Edgar G. Ulmer, is a much better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) thinks he has a dreadful life. He runs a loan association in the small town of Bedford Falls. The company is always on the verge of bankruptcy and is constantly fighting the evil Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). He is married to an adoring wife (Donna Reed) and has three children. One Christmas Eve he is on the verge of suicide until his guardian angel (Henry Travers) shows up to stop him. No other word for it--it's a classic! Hard to believe this was a bomb when it first came out...it's reputation didn't even start till the early 1980s with repeated television showings. Basically, there's nothing wrong with the film. The script is well-written with realistic well-drawn characters. What really makes it work is that the movie doesn't make Stewart a goody two shoes--he's really unhappy and mean in the first section of the film. It makes his "transformation" at the end more believable and realistic. Also it's one of the few movies that has an ending that will have the entire audience crying--out of happiness. The acting is just great all across the board, the set design incredible (Bedford Falls was on a sound stage!) and is heart warming without getting too sentimental. I usually hate films like this but I've loved this since the first time I saw it and make it a point to see it every Christmas. A true classic. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the tale of the classic selfless man's conflicted mind-set and the town that's ingrained in his life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should be inclined to say that Frank Capra made his masterpiece with It's a Wonderful Life, and it would probably be the obvious, easy answer to make as a movie-lover. And shock of shocks, it wasn't until today (of Christmas Eve of all times, ho-ho-ho) that I finally sat down and watched it- it wasn't a 'family staple' in my house- but I knew I had to watch it, if only to see James Stewart in the seminal role of George Bailey. It is, no doubt, with enough fantastical scenes to make up a couple more movies, and the heart that sits right in It's a Wonderful Life beats with all the vigor and pride of the most schmaltzy- and rightly proud of it- American spirit. That I ended up not finding it to be a truly astonishing movie may be that I'm just a cynic deep down, or that maybe this kind of story, and how it plays out, has ended up being done so many times I practically knew what the story was before going in. It's the most amazing of credits to Capra and his cast and crew that it does hold up this well, and that the sentimentality stringing together much of what happens is actually well earned. But it does teeter on becoming a bit too dated, or rather that it's appeal of being a fable really only works best when dealing with the crux of the character George Bailey, and almost becomes weird in how it leaps from great happiness to the terrible bleakness of modern American life.Indeed, Stewart was not only the best choice for George Bailey, but the correct one, the kind we'd probably all like to have in our town as the man who despite his better senses commits his life to being there for the ones he cares for. It almost becomes a running gag, however not really funny as much as touching, the way he puts aside his own feelings and self-wants to help save the bank and Bedford Falls from the peril that could come from the dastardly Potter (Lionel Barrymore, cast perfectly for the role as well with his sinister eyebrows and cunning attitude). I first thought it would be all about George seeing life as if he had never been born, but really this is(wisely) kept to the last twenty minutes of the picture. This works because we see how Bailey gets to that point of almost jumping off into the river, which in its selfish way would be, to him, still a selfless act (i.e. worth more than dead). Seeing George's life is like peering into one of those tall-tale American stories where the little guy gets a lot done by just being himself- or at least his better self getting the better of him. All George wants to do as a young man is explore the world, make great buildings and things. But any lofty ambition becomes squashed by reality- of his father's death, of the very sneaky attitude imposed by Potter, and by the townspeople practically needing some hope during the depression. So it's up to him to not only save the town by making a section of the town named after him for low-cost housing, but to marry a girl Mary (Donna Reed) who's fallen totally for George.What ends up being most memorable, for me, about It's a Wonderful Life is the skill which Capra makes possibly one-dimensional figures very real and immediate, and that in this seemingly simplistic world of right and wrong and good and bad there are the slivers of gray that work their way in. I loved one scene in particular where Potter, desperate to gain back control over his possible monopoly in Bedford Falls, tries to will George away to work for him at far more an amount of money he would make on his own terms with his small bank. It's a tense scene in how devilish Potter comes off, and how Barrymore turns on the ideal of greed and necessity and the ego of a man over the higher principles that George ultimately goes for. It's always fascinating too to see how Stewart plays certain scenes and lines and inflections, moments of surprise and delight which probably hide just the bits of bitterness that build up in him. There's something about the American dream that is called into question in American life, even as Capra likes to jump from sweet touches of light comedy to stark tragedy or danger. There's a great juxtaposition that is made too with the characters of Harry Bailey, George's brother, who goes on to lead the life George might have led had he not saved Harry as a boy, and as well in a small part with Sam Wainwright.It's through the sort of realistic groundings then that Capra is able to get away with reaching for the fantasy structure that ends up coming out of the film, the typical 'what if' nightmare scenario that has ended up influencing countless movies and TV shows. Like Christmas Carol, though sort of in reverse, it's sort of meant as a lesson in humanity, and how what is carried in a man or what is lacking in it ends up bringing it out or losing it in others. It all builds to help Capra earn the melodrama and ultra-heightened emotions brought out with Clarence the angel. It doesn't mean that, at least for me, there aren't things that end up being dated (however, scenes like the dance-hall bit in 1928, is timeless in its humor), mainly in how the idealism and old-fashioned ways come out in this day &amp; age. But still, it doesn't stop me from saying that It's a Wonderful Life is a must see, if only once, and there's no doubt why it's been revered as one of the great films about the triumph of the human spirit.

		<fullReview>'It's a Wonderful Life' is one of the best movies of all time. It is directed by Frank Capra and starring movie legends such as Donna Reed and James Stewart. It's a Wonderful Life shows the life of George Bailey, a kind, caring man. You see him right from childhood and even then he is giving to people. As he grows older, he has dreams of traveling. However, after a series of unfortunate events, he can't go on the trips as he has always wanted and he has to look after the family business - the bank. George gets tied down with a family and feels trapped in a world in which he doesn't want to belong and he finds himself trying to commit suicide.This is a beautiful, touching yet dark film. You see so many emotions, attitudes and values in this such as envy, love, corruption, joy, hope, faith and despair, all beautifully portrayed by the actors. It runs along at a fast pace and has a beginning, middle and an end. It also has a moral, which is lacking in so many movies today.It's A Wonderful Life is absolutely universal and timeless (you can enjoy it whether you are 8 or 80). I watched this when I was 12 and it became one of my favorite movies, which I know watch every Christmas. It sums up everything that Christmas is about.</fullReview>

Oscar-nominee James Stewart stars as a banker who has a nervous breakdown and comes to the realization that he wishes he was never born. Enter guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) who shows Stewart how great his life has been and how his life has affected everyone else's for the better. Frank Capra's direction is, well Capra-esque. The screenplay is perfect and all the performances are super as well. Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell, and Lionel Barrymore all add great moments as supporting players. Easily one of the best ever, a treasure. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rich Twin Poor Twin's View of the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an article from www.richtwinpoortwin (dot) com I hope all of you had a Merry Christmas. It's A Wonderful Life is a good classic movie. It will always bring back fond memories. For many years since we can remember, my twin and I saw the classic movie: It's A Wonderful Life air at our old home. We switched the channel every year when the movie just started because the movie is in black and white. We just dismissed the movie and thought it would be a bore. A few years later when we were in college, freshman year?. one of our best professors we had in our academic years had this movie as part of the curriculum - where we watched the movie and did the usual analysis on the movie. I didn't know it at the time, but he was a very good professor and person. He actually was searching for a purpose, more in life, the meaning of life, happiness in life, the reason for living, etc. He was actually trying to wake us up. But I digress; we will talk about this professor in upcoming entries. Now back to It's a wonderful life. The movie is quite enjoyable.We recently went back to NYC this Christmas and watched It's a Wonderful life for the first time in our old home. I recall the analysis we did after watching the show in college. We all came up with the all too familiar analysis of how Potter was rich, greedy, and evil. And how George Bailey was the good person, the hero who was doing what was right - he was fighting the good fight so that everyone else can have a wonderful life in Bedford Falls.There was a common theme painted throughout the movie: being good/doing good meant sacrificing yourself - physically, mentally, and financially- George risked his life to save his brother Harry (lost his hearing in his left ear), getting beaten up by his childhood boss after saving a client from being poisoned, taking a job that was below him in order to save the Bank and the community from Potter, getting married to Mary because just to make his mother happy, turning down Sam Wayne Wright's offer, giving away 2 thousand dollars of his own hard earned money he saved for his honeymoon to others during the bank run on black Friday, and turning down Potter's offer that would have freed him.It's A Wonderful Life enforces the idea that having money meant you are greedy, evil, selfish, lazy, cruel, racist, lonely, bitter, uncaring, and that you will lose your money as fast as you made it throughout the movie. Potter was the living symbol of this commonly accepted false idea. Potter is a "warped, frustrated, old man." He was crippled and pushed around in a wheelchair. He has no family, was uncaring - he called for a board meeting to resolve the bank after Bailey Senior's death, was a racist - he refers to his tenants as "garlic eaters", has a skull on his desk, cruel - he withholds foolish Uncle Ben's $8000 cash deposit just to get back at the Baileys, and he levied harsh rent from his poor tenants, and on the last scene where we see what would happen if he controlled Bedford falls - it would be called Potter's field where Bedford falls is just a grave yard, there would be less of the "neighborly", lots of bars, clubs, and gambling.But when we watched the movie at home, we see that the movie: It's a Wonderful Life is nothing more than propaganda. Its message is worse than its character Potter, himself. The movie tells its audience to just Settle. That is perhaps the worst and most dangerous message of all - be a noob, don't even try to become a pwner. The movie's message tells you to just try to find the good things that you have and not to try harder, not to help yourself, not to pursue your dreams, and just help others because you are seen as greedy if you try to pursue your dreams before helping others. In short - mind others businesses, help as many as you can with what little you have and look for "the good things" that you have and you shall be happy and you will have a wonderful life. The last message of the movie was " A man is never poor as long as he has friends," which is true to some degree but the movie's bigger message and idea is troubling.What if Clarence showed George Bailey actually achieving what he wanted?? As in showing George what he, his wife, and the rest of Bedford Falls would be if George would have achieved what he wanted to do - go to college, travel the world, build bridges, build skyscrapers, and become what he wanted to BE since he was a small boy - in short living his childhood dream. But instead Clarence CHEATED him and US by just showing how unhappy the community would be if he was not born. And it is very fascinating how Sam Wayne Wright becomes what George Bailey always wanted to be - rich, traveling the world, having a company, wives, power, fame, fancy cars and FREE from having to put his nose to the grind stone.And that is all I have to say about that. Or what Sam would say, "Hee-Haw!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic if there ever was one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could I possibly write about "It's a Wonderful Life" that hasn't already been written? It is my favorite film starring my favorite actor James Stewart. Beautifully directed by Frank Capra, it is a masterpiece about the joys and trials of everyday life, and its main lesson is the fact that nobody is born to be a failure and that everybody is important. A struggling man named George Bailey (Stewart) sees life pass him by as he forgoes his opportunities to travel the world, go to college, and do all sorts of outstanding things. George considers himself a failure and never realizes what a great man he is until he meets his guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers), who shows him how different many people's lives would have been had George never been born."It's a Wonderful Life" contains such an outstanding cast that it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing these parts so effectively. Frank Capra had only James Stewart in mind for the all-American George Bailey, and he could not have made a better choice. Not to mention Donna Reed as George's sweet, comforting wife Mary; Lionel Barrymore as the cold, Scrooge-like Mr. Potter; Thomas Mitchell as the fun-loving, irresponsible Uncle Billy; Henry Travers as George's lovable, kindhearted guardian angel Clarence; Beulah Bondi as George's warmhearted mother; Samuel S. Hinds as George's caring-about-others-before-himself father; H. B. Warner as the drunken-turned-responsible druggist Mr. Gower; and on and on the list goes. Honestly, no other actors could have portrayed these roles so well.Here are my favorite highlights from "It's a Wonderful Life," and there are quite a few. At the end, amidst all the donations and tears of joy at the Bailey residence, the one moment that almost never fails to bring tears to my eyes is George's discovery of the inscription on the inside cover of Clarence's copy of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer": "Dear George, Remember NO MAN is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings! Love, Clarence." George displays his darker side when he both yells at Uncle Billy for misplacing the $8,000 and lashes out at his family shortly thereafter. James Stewart's initial appearances in this film serve as a reminder of his prewar all-American image, particularly when George describes the giant suitcase he wants for his European tour, or when he talks quietly with his father at the dinner table, or when he confronts the scheming Potter, who threatens to dissolve the Bailey Building &amp; Loan Association after the sudden death of George's father. Arguably the loudest and funniest scene in the picture involves the Charleston dance at the high school gymnasium, during which the floor opens up to reveal a swimming pool below. George and Mary spend their wedding night in the same dilapidated old house that they threw rocks at years ago, but the music and the candlelight dinner are just right (as actor Tom Bosley pointed out, if George has had a wonderful life in humble Bedford Falls, to a large extent it was Mary who made it so). Mr. Gower physically abuses young George (Bobbie Anderson) for not delivering a prescription, until Gower realizes what he had put in the capsules! George runs through Pottersville in shock at the unfamiliar buildings and the interesting music filtering through some of them. Upon Clarence's announcing that he is an angel second class, the night watchman (Tom Fadden) falls backward out of his chair! And finally, the film displays its sentimentality right from the opening shots, in which the humble voices of George's family and friends are heard praying for him."It's a Wonderful Life" is a classic, no doubt about it. I enjoy it not only during the Christmas season but all through the year. James Stewart WAS George Bailey, and he has my utmost praise for such a fine performance. The film was Stewart's and Capra's favorite, and no wonder. Capra was passionate about the story, and Stewart gave it his all after five years of having not appeared in feature films. In short, "It's a Wonderful Life" is a truly remarkable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-time classic, darker than people think for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS - but if you haven't seen this already ...)Before finally writing a commentary on one of my favorite films, I read through a few of the preceding comments, and I was surprised to see so many nay-sayers. Their posts were far from the usual "this film sucks" type of puerile commentary, however; it seems this film provokes intelligent discussion even from those who dislike it (or perhaps dislike the avalanche of affection it normally receives).I won't bother to recap the entire plot blow by blow. If you've seen it, you already know it, and if you haven't there are plenty of extensive recaps already in the User Comments section. What works for me is Jimmy Stewart as Everyman, George Bailey. Unless you are very fortunate, most people wake up and find out that they have given up their dreams as trade-offs for other things in their lives -- family, friends, etc. Most of us are at peace with this. However, it's very apparent that while George has put aside his disappointment, it lurks below the surface and is the vulnerable chink in his armor. Potter (brilliantly portrayed by Lionel Barrymore) knows this and almost successfully exploits it; George stops himself just before agreeing to be bought by Potter after Potter promises him a substantial (for its time, an enormous) salary and travel opportunities.George, having had to put his own dreams on hold or away on at least three separate occasions now, prospers modestly and builds a family, and his disappointment stays below the surface until disaster strikes. His unreliable Uncle Billy (Capra regular Thomas Mitchell) unknowingly hands Potter the bank deposit, literally putting the means for George's destruction in Potter's hands. Potter informs the bank examiner and the DA about the $8000 shortage at the S&amp;L, and George faces ruin and prison for embezzlement. He tries asking Potter for help -- crawls for it, actually -- and Potter gleefully refuses. George, while holding onto his low-equity whole-life policy, realizes that the policies make him worth more dead than alive and plans to commit suicide. That's when an angel steps in and shows George what his world would have been like had he never been born.Some people think that George is owed something monetary by the townspeople, but actually George has prospered modestly by helping them prosper. In terms of money, neither really owe each other anything. In terms of friendship, George has been what Potter is financially -- as rich a man as any other. But George, in his plight, doesn't see this. All he sees is financial, legal, and social ruin because he's looking through Potter's eyes; Potter has succeeded (temporarily) in ruining him spiritually. He even turns into a low-rent Potter on his initial return home, barking at his kids and his wife, smashing things, yelling at the schoolteacher, before righting himself somewhat and trying to apologize to his terrified family. He leaves for a bar, where his friends try to find out what's wrong, and he sends up a desperate prayer to God for help in one of the most heartbreaking scenes I've ever watched. (And then he gets punched in the nose by the husband of the schoolteacher, in one of the most wry moments ever on screen.)The look at what Bedford Falls becomes without ever having a George Bailey isn't as important, although Potterville certainly is the inspiration for Back to the Future Part II's alternate Biff-run Hill Valley. George comes back to reality with his soul and his faith restored, running through the restored Bedford Falls with joy while heading towards certain ruin. His faith leads him back to his wife, who has been his support and his partner through all his setbacks. Instead of ruin, his friends -- not his debtors -- have all heard that their friend is in serious trouble and have come to help. Their faith in their friend George never wavered (they know he didn't steal anything), even if his faith in them failed, mirroring the faith that God has in each one of us even when we don't have faith in Him or in ourselves. Even Sam Wainwright, from whom he 'stole' Mary, sends a line of credit that guarantees George will be saved. His brother, a Medal of Honor winner who was to make a triumphant entrance the next day, instead comes back in time to say what George finally realizes: he is indeed the richest man in town.At its core, then, this movie isn't about Christmas, it's about faith: faith tested, faith failed, faith restored. George loses faith in himself and God and his friends and family, and is shown why their faith in him won't completely fail. In a way, this is really more of an Easter story -- Potter crucifies George, who becomes reborn. In order to make this work, you have to see George lose his soul, as he does in those moments after he realizes the ruin that Billy has made of their lives, and that means George has to do some unsympathetic things. A couple of the actions he takes at home borders on emotional abuse, which is why his wife asks him to leave. In order for the film to work, he has to hit bottom, and Stewart masterfully portrays this.At the same time, Donna Reed had to play her role as even-keeled as possible, as dependable and rock-solid against Stewart's agonizing emotional swings, in order to both highlight Stewart's work and to symbolize God's support and faith. Reed is absolutely amazing in this role, understating while not giving an inch to Stewart in their scenes together. Mary is a real woman, not some straw-man symbol, and without that the film would have utterly failed.And what of Potter? Why does Potter get away with the money? In a standard morality play, Potter would get caught and wind up ruined, but this film isn't a standard morality play. Potter exemplifies the Scriptural warning, "What does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul?" Potter, by taking and keeping the money and later turning George in, has lost his chance for redemption. He is dead already and nothing on Earth can save him but himself. However, this is not a blanket indictment of all who have money, as Sam Wainwright gladly steps in to save his friend -- and Sam is certainly the nouveau-riche type of person that is easy to dislike in standard morality plays. Potter represents himself and the greedy avarice that has consumed him.When watching this film at any time of year, we are reminded that while events can cause us to lose faith in God and in ourselves, we can still hope that those around us do not lose their faith in us. We are not defined by how much or how little money we have; our goodness comes through in how we treat others and how we all help along the way. All the money in the world cannot save us from death, but God (and our friends) can save us from spiritual death in times of crisis. That's why this is one of the greatest movies ever made and why it belongs in the top 10 of anyone's movie list.</fullReview>

The acting, the story, the directing, everything about this movie ROCKS! ***Spoilers*** George Bailey, at age 12, saves his brothers life. Several weeks later, he stops the town druggist from putting poison in some pills. We see that he accomplishes many things in his life, and he puts his dreams aside to help these people.Even after he accomplishes many things, he begins to think his life is worthless. Especially after a horrific event one Christmas Eve, in which his uncle Billy loses $8,000. George seriously contemplates suicide, but his guardian angel, Clarence, comes to his rescue. He then learns, first-hand, what the world would be like if he hadn't been born. After he sees many changes that would have been if not for his birth, he gets his life back. He returns home, and then his friends and family come, along with money that they had collected from theirs friends in the town.This is a great movie. Watch it on Christmas Eve. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why should any open-minded open-hearted person want to dis this particular film? The same as with millions of other people it's my favourite Christmas film, and a classic I've always enjoyed for all kinds of wholesome reasons, with a heartwarming moral I know I am and which everyone should be the richer for the experience.James Stewart has plans to do what he wants to and travel the world but is constantly thwarted with those plans and ends up not going and staying all his life in his crummy little town as a bank manager. His is a long story of self-sacrifice until a crisis is reached and the film veers into a charming and cathartic fantasy. Everyone played their parts perfectly, but Stewart was the essential part: it wouldn't have worked as well without his usual affecting intensity, the gulping emotion he displayed was knockout. The story was an excellent All-American updated retread of Christmas Carol with the moral surely just as decent and incontrovertible. It's worn very well, and I've never needed to watch it with rose-tinted spectacles or an excess of seasonal slush ? the first time I saw it UK Channel 4 showed it one July presumably after the copyright had been allowed to lapse in the 80's. On the other hand as the decades have gone by the hype has been ratcheted up to hopefully sell Christmas DVD's, streams etc; there were only about twenty people in the local cinema to see it last night ? a ten-day run is probably too much.I like slushy sentimentality with a strong and timeless moral ? that is if it's handled well, as was this lovely little film. Frank Capra, I preferred your It Happened One Night, but thank you for making It's A Wonderful Life and I hope you've got your wings. Money can't buy you love but love sure can buy you money!</fullReview>

And yet, as of 2014, it seems to be appreciated more than ever. Not that it is a flawless film. The editing, for example, is pretty rotten. And critical, it is probably not a great film, especially alongside "The Best Years of Our Lives", which came out around the same time. But this film really hits the heart.There are some parallels here with "A Christmas Carol", only now it is Bob Cratchitt who is the one in a need of a visit from a supernatural friend.

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life (1946) was produced and directed by Frank Apra. The film is about George Bailey, played by James Stewart, who dreams of leaving Bedford Falls, his home town, to travel around world. Unfortunately, a chain of events prevent him from realizing his dream. His father, who owned the family savings and loan, had a stroke. After the death of his father, George agrees to manage the savings and loan until his brother graduates from college. However, his brother gets married and accepts a job working with his father in law. George continues to run the family business. He eventually marries Mary, (Donna Reed) his childhood sweetheart, and they settle down to raise their four children.On Christmas Eve, Uncle Billy, played by Thomas Mitchell, loses the $8,000 bank deposit. He absent mindedly placed the money in a newspaper, and gave the paper to Henry Potter, (Lionel Barrymore). Henry Potter was the major shareholder in the Bedford Falls Building and Loan. Potter keeps the money because he wants the bank to fail, and George to go to jail. George and Uncle Billy are unable to find the money. George asks Potter for a loan. Potter turns him down, and reports him to the authorities. George gets drunk and tries to commit suicide by crashing his car into a tree. After realizing that his plan did not work, he staggers to the town bridge. Before he can jump, Clarence, (Henry Tavers) his guardian angel, jumps in and pretends to be drowning. George rescues him and he discovers that Clarence is his guardian angel. Clarence convinces George that he has a wonderful life, by showing him what life in Bedford Falls would be like without him.The theme of the film is that every life is important. Everyone is important, and everyone contributes to the greater good. George based his worth on the things that he did not accomplish. Therefore, he believed that Bedford Falls would be a better place without him. George was so focused on the negative that he forgot about the good things that he had accomplished; and all the people that he had helped. Through a series of flashbacks, Clarence convinces George that his life was important. Sound was used throughout the movie to provide transitions between two sequences. The actors projected naturalness, sincerity and truthfulness. Henry Potter and Clarence Odbody provided the theme of good and evil throughout the movie. The movie reminded me of Ebenezer Scrooge, by Charles Dickens. The movie shows us the importance of recognizing the good that we do in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the first hour and several yawns, a toilet break and a fresh cup of coffee I forced myself to go on with the rest of the film in the knowledge that it's supposed to be one of the best films of the 1940's. I couldn't quite see how though, with only 30 or so minutes left.It was only during the final section of the film that I finally understood that everything we've ever held dear would mean nothing if we ourselves had never existed, followed by the sudden realisation that I was witnessing something extraordinary; a ground-breaking film that's undoubtedly the cornerstone for many obscure films about the true meaning of life such as 'Groundhog Day' and 'The Trueman Show', for example.I've also came to understand what a fantastic actor James Stewart really is, even after watching Rear Window and the magnificent Vertigo, I hadn't really appreciated this before. Stewart masterfully goes from being a believably destitute man to a euphoric lover of all things life within the swish of a lamb's tail.I'm thankful that I didn't let my negative preconceptions get the better of me. Never have I been so initially unimpressed with a film, only to find myself spontaneously crying and laughing by the end credits.With the exception of 'Casablanca', possibly the best film of the 1940's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmas Carol in Reverse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supernatural fantasies were popular on both sides of the Atlantic during the late forties and early fifties, possibly because the heavy death toll during World War II had made people think about the possibility of an afterlife. "It's a Wonderful Life" is one of a number of such films from this period; others include "Portrait of Jennie", "The Ghost and Mrs Muir", "One Touch of Venus" and, from Britain, "A Matter of Life and Death" and "Pandora and the Flying Dutchman".This is also an early example of the Christmas film, a genre which has today become ten-a-penny. The main action takes place on Christmas Eve and it was first released on December 20th 1946. The film was originally a disappointment at the box-office, but quickly became one of the most loved films in American cinema, and the tradition has grown up of showing it on television during the Christmas season. The plot has something in common with that other Christmas classic, "A Christmas Carol", although it might be truer to say that "It's a Wonderful Life" is "A Christmas Carol" in reverse. Dickens' story tells the story of a selfish, greedy man who is saved from greed and selfishness by supernatural intervention. Frank Capra's film rather tells the story of a man who has tried to live a selfless life but who needs to be saved from despair when he comes to believe himself a failure. The film also figures, in Henry Potter, an antagonist who has similarities with the unreformed Ebenezer Scrooge. George Bailey is the manager of a small Building and Loan Association in the small New England town of Bedford Falls. We see his life told in a series of flashbacks. George was originally a man of lofty ambitions who, as a boy, dreamed of becoming a famous explorer and later wanted to be a great architect or engineer. The early death of his father, however, led to him taking over management of the Building and Loan, a business which his idealistic father had started with the express intention of helping the ordinary people of Bedford Falls to build or buy homes at moderate rates of interest. George, however, faces opposition from his arch-enemy Potter, a rapacious slum landlord and grasping capitalist businessman; Potter hates the Building and Loan because it can undercut the extortionate rates charged by his own bank. Potter's dishonest machinations lead to the Building and Loan facing insolvency and George himself facing criminal charges of embezzlement. In despair, George resolves to commit suicide. What saves him is the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody who, by showing George how different life in his community would be had he never been born, persuades him that he has done an immense amount of good in his life and that life is worth living. The above synopsis could have formed the basis of a horribly sentimental story, and the film is not entirely free of sentimentality, particularly in its idealised view of small-town life and its treatment of the courtship of George and his wife Mary. The picture drawn by Clarence of what Bedford Falls would be like had George never lived also seems exaggerated; the town, renamed Pottersville, is dominated by Potter, who has filled it with sleazy nightclubs, gambling joints, pawn shops and bars. Its people are cynical, selfish and immoral. It struck me as rather extreme to suggest that the life of one good man was all that stood between Potter and his ambition of turning Bedford Falls into the Las Vegas of the North-East. (For one thing, small-town businessmen, however corrupt and unscrupulous, do not generally possess the political muscle to overturn State anti-gambling laws).What saves the film from turning into pure treacle is the characterisation of the two main roles. Angels have traditionally been portrayed as young, beautiful, all-wise and androgynous, but Clarence is an elderly man who is not even very good at his job. He has been in Heaven for two hundred years, but has not yet earned his wings- according to the film angels are only given their wings after performing some meritorious deed- and his mission to save George is his chance to redeem himself. Although George may be an idealist, he is not idealised, and is far from flawless; he can, for example, be bad-tempered. It is the interaction between these two characters, Henry Travers' shambling, kindly, eccentric angel and James Stewart's flawed, frustrated idealist which lies at the heart of the film. Both actors are excellent, and Stewart earned a "Best Actor" nomination. Donna Reed is rather bland as the impossibly perfect Mary, but there is another memorable contribution from Lionel Barrymore as Potter. Stewart and Barrymore had earlier worked together with Capra in his "You Can't Take It with You", and Stewart had appeared in his "Mr Smith Goes to Washington". Capra was born in Italy, but became an ardent patriot for his adopted country, and many of his films celebrate what he considered to be American values. ("Mr Smith Goes to Washington" is another example).The lasting popularity of "It's a Wonderful Life" can perhaps be attributed to its quiet celebration of small-town values, of basic decency, of friendship, of generosity, of idealism, of community spirit and of faith in a benevolent providence. Yet Capra is not afraid to criticise other cherished American values- the figure of Potter can be taken as a critique of untrammeled free-market capitalism- nor to face up to the darker side of life, to despair, to selfishness and to villainy. The false values of Pottersville may have been vanquished in Bedford Falls, but as audiences in 1946 would have been aware, those values still prevailed in many real-life communities. In the contest between good and evil, victory can never be taken for granted. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I should probably give this movie 10/10 but the only things that I don't like about it is that it's not as Christmasy as I thought it would be and it takes a long time to get to the punch line of the film about what a miserable place Bedford Falls would be like if George Bailey was never born.But it's still a classic and it's a real heart- felt movie! And what makes it a Christmas classic is that it's all about caring for others and how important family and friends are. James Stewart (one of the greatest actors of all time), gave a lot of classics and memorable performances in his time, and George Bailey is truly one of his best. It's a crime that he never got an Oscar for it. George Bailey, ever since he was a kid, wants to go traveling and build bridges and buildings and make something of himself. But something that had to do with either his friends or family got in the way of living his dreams. But what makes George so memorable is that he always puts others before himself.The supporting cast like Donna Reed (Mary Hatch), Thomas Mitchell (Uncle Billy) and Henry Travers (Clarence) all do wonderfully in their roles as well. But Lionel Barrymore as the mean and greedy Mr. Potter (who reminds me of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons) shows how despicable a person can be. And Frank Capra's directing is masterful. And the ending is what always makes me smile and feel good because George realizes it's a wonderful life after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather late in the day - I'm 60 - I finally caught up with Frank Capra's 1946 feelgood morality tale.George Bailey (James Stewart), after a lifetime of putting his own wishes on hold in order to do the best thing for everyone else, finally cracks one Christmas Eve when his uncle carelessly misplaces $8,000, leaving the family business facing ruin. Seeing suicide as the only way out, it is up to probationary angel Clarence to pull him round by showing him the difference he has made to the rest of the world.Reading rather like an updated version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, the first three quarters of this movie leads us in detail through George's life as set-up for the eventual climax. And the story works well, with Stewart, in one of his keynote performances, oozing decency and good humour throughout (except for the high contrast moments when he snaps).Yet there are weaknesses. The 90 minutes spent on George's life story is, perhaps, a little too long, given that its dramatic purpose is mainly to set up the differences in a world without George - it rambles. Lionel Barrymore's Machiavellian Potter is a little bit one-note in his pantomime villainy - you get the feeling that he wishes he had moustachios to twirl villainously while tieing damsels to the railway line. And, worst of all, for me at least, the film ends without the issue of Potter's malicious retention of the missing $8,000 being resolved.But these are minor quibbles with a film which deserves its happy reputation.The DVD transfer I watched was beautifully crisp and sharp, with sensitive colorization (being British, I would prefer to spell that "colourisation", but I sacrifice technical correctness in favour of accuracy).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressed about how your life turned out? Watch this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reminiscent of the story of Scrooge of A Christmas Carol, the movie in itself is predictable and slightly less haunting. Similarly, the center of the film is also focused on the Christmas holiday, making it much more dramatic because contemplating suicide on a night where everyone is celebrating is such an irony. Throughout the film, you feel powerless for George, as if all the world's problems continue to fall unto him, a character that most people can relate to regardless of age or generation. Dreams come with sacrifices.Supposedly a feel-good movie, its one of those where you are made to feel bad so you can feel better after. It has you cringing and falling flat on your face before you get picked up. Though the ending may be touching, it does not do much in terms of solving the main character's personal issues and is unconvincing in a real-world setting. Perhaps in an ideal world, that is all it takes to be happy.A movie with a big case of 'you don't know what you have til its gone'. All it takes is an imaginary slap and you're back to accepting the life you have been dealt, only this time, you're happier about it.From an optimistic point of view, the movie is a good reminder to everyone that happiness isn't a checklist you have to accomplish, but a state of mind you attain when you feel content.7 out of 10 stars, because it's a classic and has a better storyline and script than most movies these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are movies that I like so much I never get tired of. I like old films (even very old ones from the 40's, no matter if they're colored or in black and white). This one? Not really.After reading so much about its fame and veneered classic status, as well as seeing it so much in the lists of the best films ever and even IMDb's Top 250, I decided to give it a shot. I was lucky to find this on YouTube. Besides, its whole presentation on YouTube is terrific, with crisp image quality instead of blurry as "per common" in so many films on YouTube. I'm not surprised why it got off to a bad start. I think that even in 1946 people already had the perception that this wasn't such a great film. Even in those days they already had much better. This one didn't age well and doesn't stand the test of time.It was only some 30 years later that this film became the beloved classic it is today, all because it became a TV staple in the 70's and 80's Christmas seasons. It's almost as if it didn't exist before the 70's. Also, this is the film watched by the McCallisters in the first two 'Home Alone' movies, only dubbed in different languages (French and Spanish).This is considered a Christmas film. I don't totally agree. Yes, it takes place on Christmas and you see a lot of Christmas decorations, Christmas lights, snow and such, but it doesn't feel that Christmassy. In my opinion a Christmas tale is supposed to bring joy and a "feel good" feeling. Instead, this is a bitter film with a lot of unpleasant scenes. Besides, with a title like that, I'd expect a light-hearted, "feel-good" movie in the line of 'Mary Poppins', for example.The beginning is excellent and frankly couldn't have been better: with visually delicious details such as the opening credits resembling Christmas postcards, the town with its Christmas decorations and lights and snow, the stars's speech, a group of kids sliding on the ice of a frozen pond where little George Bailey saves his brother's life and the pharmacy sequence except for the disturbing part when Mr. Gower beats up George causing his ear to bleed after George's heroic act. Bobby Anderson does a fine portrayal of little George Bailey.From the moment George Bailey grows up, the film slowly loses its initial greatness and excellency. James Stewart's acting is great but I think he overacts in this role. Adult George Bailey lacks the charm and sympathy of little George Bailey.Mr. Potter, while well portrayed by the actor, is not a likable character, being a corrupt, despicable and malicious man. To a point, George is so frustrated and desperate that he takes it all out on his family and on a teacher by insulting her at the phone and wants to kill himself, feeling he's more worth dead than alive and wishing he was never born at all. His savior, an angel named Clarence, makes his wish come true so that he sees and experiences what would the world be like without him. And that alternative reality is creepy in many ways.To finish my long review, it's truly a pity that the rest of the film doesn't match the brilliant beginning, otherwise it could have been one of the all time greats. It had potential for that. It cost a lot to be made and it looks expensive.After filming was finished, the director considered it the best film he ever directed and even the finest film anyone ever directed. With all due respect to Mr. Frank Capra, but I have to disagree.Some things also don't make sense. For example, adult George Bailey is supposed to be around 18 or 19 years old but James Stewart was nearly 40 years old when he played the role. Also, when his wife announces she's pregnant, there isn't a single scene with their kids as babies or during their first years of life and all of a sudden they're already "big". Well, not "big" literally, but already quite some years older. And, after George wishes to "live" again, he wishes a merry Christmas to everyone (including Mr. Potter) like a mad man and yells «I'm going to jail! Isn't that great?» I can't see how going to jail is great, but to each their own, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how many times I've see It's a Wonderful Life over the years. But after seeing a clip from it in The Ref a couple weeks ago and after hearing references to it in various findings on the internet, I got a hankering to watch it again over the holiday season (I was a day late for Christmas, but close enough). This was the first time I'd watched it in years, and I was amazed how much more you pick up in such a familiar film when you're older.I was surprised by the overt sexual overtones in at least two scenes between George and Mary that I was to young to recognize in years past. And, while this was more of a reminder than a realization, the depth of darkness this film reaches is quite shocking, especially for its time. And yet there was always a shimmer of light in that darkness. I was struck by the scene (major spoilers if any of you haven't seen this classic film) when George is contemplating suicide. Even at his darkest hour, at the lowest point in his life, when he sees Clarence jump in, he doesn't give a second thought to go in after him and save him. What a testament to the ultimate goodness of man.Not only is It's a Wonderful Life a classic holiday film, but it's also an all around great movie for anytime. It is a wonderful story filled with many great characters. It contains many thought-provoking themes on how we effect the lives of others, even if we don't realize it, and what would happen if these effects were taken away or changed.On a side note, I was extremely disappointed to see that the DVD release of this film includes a colorized edition. It's sad that in this day and age we feel like we have to change things to make them more appealing rather than appreciating it the way it was intended, for it's original artistry.

		<shortDescription>Classic Capra-Corn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's a Wonderful Life" is probably the most cherished of Frank Capra's trademark feel-good movies of the 30's &amp; 40's. James Stewart plays George Bailey, a compassionate small-town businessman who becomes despondent when faced with a financial crisis. When he decides to do away with himself for the insurance money an angel arrives to convince him to reconsider.James Stewart, in the lead role, gives a legendary performance, one which was recognized with an Oscar nomination. That being said, the supporting cast is also well-stocked, including such notables as Lionel Barrymore, Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell &amp; Henry Travers. That's not to mention some others in smaller roles like Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond &amp; H.B. Warner.Capra's direction is as good as always and resulted in an Oscar nomination. The editing &amp; sound were also recognized with Oscar nominations but Dimitri Tiomkin's stirring score was not. The screenplay, based on a story by Philip Van Doren Stern, contains some quality material but the fantasy elements could be considered a bit corny by some.Overall, "It's a Wonderful Life" still delivers the goods as a feel-good holiday classic more than sixty years after its release. It's not my favourite Capra film but it's definitely one of those films that everyone should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Christmas film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I became aware of this film I must have been in my teens and it was referenced in the sitcom "Cheers" with the normal cast mocking the film's sentimentality at the end and then uniformly bursting into tears. I guess when you think about it, that's what this film does better than anything else. It takes our jaded world weary selves and reminds us that their are better things in life than money and success.I know I won't be the only person to say that the casting of Jimmy Stewart as the perfect George Bailley maybe the most fortuitous part of casting ever, and they may well be right. He is perfect as both heroic boy to disillusioned man that has ever been portrayed on screen, and he plays these myriad of emotions with the same intensity and passion that he plays every scene in the film. The scene in the bar where he is praying for help is one of the most heartfelt moments I have ever seen in film. As you watch it you are drawn into his plight as you know that his life and soul are on the line.The script is dynamite and like most of the best films has had scenes stolen and reworked and spoofed a thousand times over (Hell one of the best Simpson's episodes is the Leftorium for Chrissake and that's the Simpsons!) If you had to pick a downside it would be the stereotypical black woman who seems to have walked off the set of the Tom and Jerry cartoons and straight onto the screen here, but that aside, it doesn't stop this your enjoyment and as long as people watch movies it probably never well.M</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No other film will make you feel more, or more deeply. No other film will leave you in this state. The immediate effect is something like that of a drug. It leaves you feeling very loving, and very loved, and very grateful. I don't think any other film captures what it is to live, as an emotional experience, so well. Capra was unsophisticated, we're told. His film is unsophisticated, we're told. But there is such a thing as emotional sophistication, and often the other kind serves only to render a man unable to articulate just what life is like, emotionally, how deep the despair and how high the exultation. This movie should be a book of the Bible.</fullReview>

Upon release in 1946 the critics preferred 'The Best Years of Our Lives', which is also a great film, but which is better remembered &amp; loved today!</fullReview>

W/O commercials that would be nice, but not with em in the middle.I have watched this movie every year since I can remember. Dads got the colorized version that Stewart hated so much (I don't like it either) I found my mom a copy of the b/w version with a free christmas ball to put on the tree a few years ago. Last year I got a copy and and this year I bought the DVD version. Either way, when this movie first came out it's amazing people didn't see it for what it was. A masterpiece!!!

		<shortDescription>A Movie To Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's impossible to hate "It's A Wonderful Life". Even if you hate all the sweet in the cartoon movies, you can't be of stone in the great end of this movie: it is one of the biggest and sincere moments of happiness in all the story of cinema. It's the zenith of the philosophy of a master of happy life, who was Frank Capra: a story of a good man, George Bailey, who decides to commit suicide, when the family's factory is going to bankrupt. An angel without wings, Clarence, will save him and he will show him the world without the presence of George Bailey, a world of corruption completely in the hands of his enemy Mr. Potter. George Bailey is interpreted by the man with the right face for this role, James Stewart and his wife by the sweet Donna Reed. Lionel Barrymore portrays Potter, a sort of Scrooge without possibility of redemption and Henry Travers is the old, sweet and naive Clarence, desperately seeking wings. Then we mustn't forget the contribute of a great task force of actors like Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Sheldon Leonard, H. B. Warner and the up-coming Gloria Grahame. Really the perfect story for Christmas, pure and sweet. Merry Christmas Frank and James wherever you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say that hasn't already been mentioned? It's a Wonderful Life is a true classic in every sense of the word. Frank Capra's directing hits dead on and moves you like any great film should, and he injects just the right amount of humor at the same time. Jimmy Stewart.... well, we all know how great of an actor he is, and in this film his performance is perfection. Every time I see him as he runs down the streets wishing everybody a merry Christmas, I can't help but cry, I cry at the sheer joy that I am witnessing onscreen. It's moments like that, moments that touch you, moments that you never forget that show how powerful film can be.Although "It Happened One Night" is my favorite Capra film.. "It's a Wonderful Life" is without a doubt his greatest masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been keeping a "top ten" list of movies which have affected my life for the last decade or so. The first entry I added to the list was "It's a Wonderful Life" and it hasn't moved from that #1 billing.There is nothing complicated about this movie; it simply states in a very heartwarming and loving way that "you" matter. The visual image of George Bailey running down the street of Bedford Falls will always evoke a positive warm glowing feeling in me. No matter how discouraged you may be feeling it does help to stop and remember that you do have worth and can make a difference during your sojourn this life.Perhaps "It's a Wonderful Life" doesn't have the pizazz, action and special effects of today's movies and may not be able to hold the interests of today's audiences but to that I'd like to say, "Please slow down and just let the story enfold you." Watch it with a friend. People matter and so do you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good message film which I really wanted to like, but I just wish that it hadn't been so boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a wonderful life chronicles the life of George Bailey (James Stewart) from his early childhood right through to his adult years when he ends up taking over his father's building &amp; loan business after his father passes away.This was a film that I really wanted to like since it does have a lot of heart &amp; warmth to it, but the problem for me is that it was so dull and tedious. I understand that everything that is depicted in George's life did eventually serve a purpose in the context of the narrative, but if I'm being honest I found the journey from A to B to be rather uninteresting. The other problem is that this uninteresting aspect of George's life is dragged out for about 2/3 of the film (had the film been 90 minutes long that probably would have been just about OK, but in a film that is over 2 hours long it's just unforgivable). I just couldn't get involved in the story, I didn't care about the characters and pretty much lost interest in the film.Focusing on the positives, I thought that Stewart was excellent and this is probably the best I've ever seen from him. Likewise, Donna Reed was also really good and I thought that they both had really good chemistry together.Another big positive to be taken from this film is its message and the best way I can describe it without spoiling anything is 'Be Careful what you wish for'. The last 30 minutes of this film were excellent and if I was to rate the last 30 minutes alone I would give it a 9 or a 10. The ending of the film is particularly good and is actually quite moving and it's just a shame that the first 2/3 of the film was so boring.Even though I've only rated this film a 4 out of 10, I would still recommend watching this film because as a 'message' film it's absolutely first rate. However, no matter how good the message is with this film, for me, it didn't make up for how tedious and boring the majority of the film was as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Talk with Jimmy: Seeing a 'Wonderful Life' through His Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A VISIT WITH JIMMY STEWART: Inside 'Wonderful Life,' a Wonderful Life "'It's a Wonderful Life' sums up my philosophy of filmmaking ... to exalt the worth of the individual, to champion man ... and to dramatize the viability of the individual." _ director Frank Capra JAMES STEWART, whom Frank Capra lovingly described as being "unusually usual," the movies' quintessential Everyman, sat down to reminisce about "It's Wonderful Life" on Nov. 16, 1987, not quite 40 years after it had opened in theaters across the country. Then 79, Stewart, in his familiar crackling Indiana drawl, explained that the movie was never really intended as a Christmas film. RKO, the movie's distributor, originally planned to premiere it on Jan. 30, 1947. But its big color film set for the holidays, "Sinbad the Sailor," had to be put on hold when Technicolor went on strike. Enter black and white 'Life" instead on Dec. 20, 1946. "Christmas was just sort of part of it, and a wonderful way to end the movie," Stewart said. "The picture didn't do well when it opened because -- and I know Frank (Capra, the movie's director) feels the same way -- it was right after World War II, and the substance of the film wasn't what people wanted to see. They wanted something sort of relaxing, a rejuvenating film, a lot of comedy -- Red Skelton, Martin and Lewis, who were just coming into their own just then. The war was a tough thing to take for the people back home here. I think they wanted something sort of wilder than this." Another thing didn't help box office when 'Life' opened: a real white Christmas that year. Snow blasted the eastern U.S. Ironically, the film actually had been shot from May through July 1946 at RKO's Encino Ranch during 80-degree weather. Snow was simulated by use of 3,000 tons of shaved ice, 300 tons of plaster, 300 tons of gypsum and 6,000 gallons of chemicals. The "snowstorm" that occurs when Stewart's character, George Bailey, attempts suicide took three weeks to create and required the largest special effects crew assembled for a movie up to that time. "Frank didn't even have the story for 'It's Wonderful Life' on paper when he invited me over to his house one day. He told me, 'I have an idea for a picture,' and started taking about an angel named Clarence who hadn't won his wings, and that I'm gonna commit suicide, and he said, 'I'm not telling this very well.'' I said, 'Frank, if you want to do a picture about an angel named Clarence who hasn't won his wings, I'm your man." The movie was Stewart's favorite. "For quite a few reasons," he said. "Number one, it was the first picture I got to do after the war, and maybe for that reason, it's sort of a sentimental favorite. But beyond that, I think the picture had the main sort of things that mean so much to me ... an idea with two basic points: There's no man who is born to be a failure, and that no man is poor who has friends. Now, from the those two sentences, the secret of the movie is made." A number of things were improvised, like the recurrent bit where George keeps knocking off the knob on the Baileys' banister railing. "The first time I walked by, it was loose and it came off when I grabbed it. We just left the bit in. Frank and I never discussed it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film with a powerful message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never much of a fan of older movies, especially not movies as old as It's a Wonderful Life. Being the ignorant teenager I was, I was turned away from the black and white film. The only other film I had ever seen in black and white was 12 Angry Men, which I had to see for my American government class. Although I surprisingly really enjoyed that film, I was in no hurry to see another like it.Years later, while going through a rough time in my life, I came across this movie on this very website. I had known the film existed for years, but upon reading the IMDb page I became curious. Maybe it was just because I was lacking direction in life needed an inspiring message, or the fact it was one of the most redone plots in cinema history. Whatever it was, I set all my ignorance aside, looked the full movie up online and gave it a watch.The outcome was nothing short of life changing. George Bailey (James Stewart) was a very likable character, which made him easy to feel for throughout the movie. The other actors were great as well, making the film feel natural. Hailing from a small town myself, I could relate the family-like atmosphere of the townsfolk. Capra did an excellent job at capturing that quality.But what truly made the film the greatest of greats was the fact it delivered a message we can all truly relate to and appreciate. It was a message that left me feeling that maybe my life wasn't so bad after all. It left me feeling I had purpose.This film now holds a special place in my soul and I've grown to greatly enjoy classic films, possibly even more so than films today. If I were to recommend just one film for everyone to see before they died, without any shadow of a doubt my answer would be Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie of all time. I just saw a school do the play and they did just as an excellent job as the movie. My cousin does a radio show of this play also and thy do an excellent job. I like the message of the movie and how everyone came together at the end to help. It also shows how mean some people can be so they can get what they want, but it does not help them as people will turn away from you like what Potter tried to do to George with the missing money. I like how they brought Mary and George together and especially like the dance scene when they fell in the pool and then when they walked home and saw the house that they end up getting. How George stated home so that his brother could go to college, which meant George gave up his dreams for his brother. Showing what like would have been like without George was a scene as it shows that with you around life is good and if some of things did not happen then things and people could be worse off. I also like watching this in the black and white version vs watching the color. The color I think spoils it. The message comes out a lot better in Black and White.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many people I had heard about this film and seen the parodies or things inspired by it but had never sat down to watch the actual film.However now I am pleased to say that I can understand why this film is so beloved by people and continues to stand the test of time. It's now not just one of my favourite Christmas films but one of my favourite films of all time.It has everything. It has a strong story (inspired by a Christmas card no less), heart and mixes comedy and drama effortlessly. It's also a beautiful love story between Mary and George as well as showing us the importance of friendship and loyalty.I can't fault this film - wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Inspirational Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some films that I have trouble writing a review of because of their greatness. Frank Capra's masterpiece It's A Wonderful Life is one of those beautiful masterpieces. It's difficult to make a normal review about a film such as this. It's rare that a masterpiece as great as this is shown to the world. Few characters and stories are as engaging as George Bailey (James Stewart) or his story. This movie deserves a commentary rather than an actual review. The movie gets everything right in telling this story. George Bailey gets an opportunity that would benefit every person who has ever lived- he gets to see what the world would have been like without him. George is the perfect character for this journey. He is the closest to being a real person out of every other character I've ever seen in cinema, even Rocky Balboa. George Bailey is full of love, kindness, and optimism, and he has dreams of going places and doing big things. However, he is unable to achieve these things, and gives them up to help his family and friends. We all can relate to this kind of disappointments, and they can make us all better people. And he is obviously disappointed when he makes these decisions, but he ultimately does the right thing. Then there comes a time where he is desperate. George is a good person, but he despairs when he has upset everyone he knows and is in danger of going out of business and going to jail. He is shattered, and decides to kill himself. George has been such an optimist the entire movie, that seeing him despair is truly disheartening, and yet it's believable when he falls apart because George is so human and capable of anger and sadness. But when his guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) shows him what the world would have been like without him, he thinks. He realizes how many people he's affected, how many lives he's touched. Because he loves people so much, seeing his loved ones not recognize him is terrifying. After this night, he learns how wonderful his life is, and how much he alone has touched so many others. This message and journey is more inspirational than those of any other movie I've ever seen. Jimmy Stewart is George Bailey. He plays this brilliantly written character with absolute conviction and love. Few actors have felt as real as Stewart. He talked like a real person when he acted. He stuttered like a real person, and didn't always think through what he said, just like a real person. He gives a chilling performance, one of the greatest in any film. George Bailey is It's A Wonderful Life, just as Rocky Balboa is Rocky. He is part of this amazing story, backed up by an outstanding supporting cast, including Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter (one of cinema's greatest and most despicable villains), and Henry Travers as Clarence. No film could ask for more. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See WONDERFUL LIFE on BluRay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to really appreciate this wonderful film, be sure to see it on BluRay.In 2009, the film was issued on BluRay in pristine form.The picture and sound are both clean and crystal clear and what you get is a better audio-video experience than theater audiences had when this was first released.I personally prefer the artfully colorized version and adjusted my TV with the color level up about 10% above normal. Film to video restoration/transfers do not get any better than this.Frank Capra's masterpiece honors the ideal of a good man who lives a good life but doesn't realize how blessed he is until it's almost too late. Watching it anytime of the year - but especially at Christmas - is an inspiring experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would the world be like without you? A question many of us take for granted or even don't understand.This movie not only touches on the fact that each one of our lives are so intertwined that when you remove a single link, the whole chain falls apart, but also it touches on the importance of family, caring for others, and the most important fact, that without God, our lives are meaningless.Harry Bailey, Played by Jimmy Stewart, is feeling like hes more of a burden than a blessing, but through the grace of God, he is given a rare gift...a gift to see what the world would be like had he never been born.This journey is guided by the often misguided angel, Clarence. Who, while he doesn't have his wings yet, is still the perfect one to guide Harry along the way. The fact that a sub-par angel can open the eyes of a 'sub-par' man, is a point that is often missed by viewers. It shows that no one is perfect, but everyone, no matter how imperfect, can still help others.A must watch for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bailey Battles The Bully Banker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Bailey shouldn't complain. Yes, he desperately wants to get out of his one-horse town and see the world, but he's got a gorgeous wife, a herd of rambunctious kids, a big house, runs his own business, his brother is a war hero, and he even scrounges up enough time to build a model bridge in his living room. The life! It's wonderful!Okay, it's not all sunshine and lollipops. George (played so memorably by Jimmy Stewart) must go head-to-head with bully banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) on a daily basis. Potter wants to own the town of Bedford Falls and it seems like he's one man away from achieving that goal. It's not like the family business (the Bailey Bros Building &amp; Loan) would flourish---or even survive---without George. Absent-minded Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) would ruin the place within minutes if he was put in charge.It's gotta wear on a guy to take on a money-grubbing banker when that banker's morals are at pre-redemption Ebezener Scrooge levels. After Uncle Billy stupidly puts a large sum of dollars into the hands of the enemy (on Christmas Eve, no less), George feels he'll be blamed and finds himself in a suicidal bout of depression. Along comes a simpleton angel (Uncle Billy's counterpart, perhaps?) to show him a glimpse of what the town would be like if George had never existed.You know this story, obviously. Everybody does. Either you buy the cornpone or you don't. Some of director Frank Capra's projects lay it on too thick, but this movie balances quaint charm and epic darkness. The American Film Institute clearly loved it because it was in the Top 20 of both their 1998 and 2007 Top 100 lists. I say this one belongs in the Top 5. I may not believe in angels, but I do believe in a movie that can still wring tears out of my eyes after so many Christmas viewings. It's a keeper!If this briefly wonderful review made you say "more!", check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 52-minute It's A Wonderful Life 'cast...and many others.

		<shortDescription>Still the best film ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era where CGI dominates and film budgets are ever increasing it's refreshing to watch a movie with heart that is uplifting, and is still as relevant today as it was when it was made in 1946.I have watched this film countless times, both in the original black and white (which I prefer) and colour and I have to say it is my favourite movie of all time. I think it's because I believe in the innate goodness and kindness of all human beings, and the need for us all to appreciate what and who we have in our lives.James Stuart is on fire in this film and the way the film builds up to the point of him being on the verge of taking his own life is superb. It sets the scene beautifully laying out all the traits of a good hard working honest man and the relationships he has with the people of his town, and the various crossroads in his life where he has to make life changing decisions.Stuart perfectly portrays the desperation of a man who realises what joy he had in his life only to throw it away, and his need to get it back at all costs.Lionel Barrymore plays Potter superbly, the man with only money on his mind hell bent on closing down Bailey Building and Loan and squeezing as much money from the residents of Bedford Falls as possible.Frank Capra's ability to show the good in people whilst also highlighting the difficulties of life is second to none. This film along with Mr deeds goes to town, and Mr Smith goes to Washington (again starring Stuart)are essential viewing, in fact anything made in the 30's or 40's by this man is superb! All in all a truly WONDERFUL film that lifts my spirits no matter how many times I watch it. If you haven't seen it it's a must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie of all time. I can watch it any time of year. Jimmy Stewart is perfect in his role. It gives such a unique slice of American life in the 40's. Lionel Barrymore plays the town banker and does such a good job that for years I wouldn't watch any show with him in it. Donna Reed is so young and pretty - truly the beginning of her career. Ward Bond and Gloria Grahame are outstanding in their roles. Many established character actors are in this movie (Uncle Billy, Ma Baily). The scene where George gets his ear slapped by the pharmacist (Mr. Gower) is so hard to watch - George cared for everyone in that town. And at the end when Harry (George's brother) says George is the richest man in town I always cry -- even after seeing this film over and over.I love this movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra's perennial holiday favorite stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a good man who has lived for others his whole life who has a crisis occur on Christmas Eve when Uncle Billy(played by Thomas Mitchell) misplaces the $8.000 he was supposed to deposit in the bank, which could destroy his Savings &amp; Loan company(especially with the bank examiner visiting) Despondent,George considers suicide, but is rescued by his guardian angel Clarence(played by Henry Travers) who proceeds to show George what his hometown of Bedford Falls would be if he had never been born. Having been briefed about George before his arrival, Clarence reveals that hated tycoon Mr. Potter(played by Lionel Barrymore) would rule the town, which is now a sin-filled haven of uncaring people. Even worse, his beloved Mary(played by Donna Reed) would end up an old maid, and of course the children he loves wouldn't exist either...Life is not always wonderful, it's true, but only a real-life Mr. Potter could hate this joyous film, filled with uproarious comedy and poignant drama, showing how one ordinary man can make a huge and positive difference. Unforgettable characters and a genuinely heartfelt ending that will move you to tears make this an all-time classic to be enjoyed any time of the year.</fullReview>

For me, its a ten, out of ten... As you noticed this the first review that i make about a movie, and solo because these one compelled me to do it. After i saw it and experienced so many good emotions and values, i felt it was a duty to write this, to try opening the eyes of the film lovers to the quality of this intemporal masterpiece by Frank Capra.Excellent 2013 to you all, and sorry for my bad English!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago some friends were sitting around the living room discussing movies as we like to do when there is nothing else to talk about, or even when there is. Someone asked everyone to name the best movie ever made, a nearly impossible feat to do if you have seen a lot of movies. *Citizen Kane*, *The Wizard of Oz*, *The Godfather* and other titles came up, but then I blurted out *It's A Wonderful Life*(IAWL), surprising even myself. No one seemed to take me seriously, but I insisted and explained. The original purpose of the motion picture, as I understand it to be, is to entertain, which can mean a lot of things, of course. IAWL makes people both laugh and cry. It insists on tugging at every emotion, even anger. We laugh when George and Mary fall into the swimming pool and later loses her robe, the only thing she has on. We cry when George and Mary are on the phone as he uses all of his strength to deny the fact that he loves Mary. It angers us to see George hurt Mary. They kiss. We cry. It's a victory over George's denial, also, that he is a human being. We celebrate their marriage, and are thrown into suspense when the bank is about to collapse. And we are again glad to see George be a human being, generous financially and spiritually. And we see Mary and George becoming one on spirit as she helps him save the bank with the money they were saving for their honeymoon. We hate Potter, the embodiment of evil--greed and envy. We even want to kill Uncle Billy for being so stupid, so lame brained as to lose the bank's money and cause incredible chaos and deep despair. And on Christmas Eve yet? We feel deeply for George Bailey, for Mary, for their children when Dad comes home and tears the house from limb to limb in utter frustration. The situation appears utterly hopeless.This film has emotional ups and downs until now--it becomes bleak,dark and hardly what one would call sentimental. Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed give the performances of their careers. And the camera closes in on a terrified man, alone with his worries. He gets drunk and in his darkest moment decides to kill himself. On Christmas Eve? Then Capra saves us all by introducing Clarence to George. The movie takes a refreshing break from the hell we were in, but doesn't stay there for long. George gets to see his world if he had not been a part of it. We see George Bailey as the antithetical Scrooge. Scrooge makes people miserable. George makes people smile. But without George (without each of us) we see a world that seemed to have been created by Dickens' nastiest character. This changes George's attitude and ours.Capra's masterpiece is the epitome of entertainment--an emotional tilt- a-whirl that leaves us completely satisfied. This is why it is the best film ever made. Not one line, not one move, not one scene, not even the snow, seems artificial. Whether or not angels exist, we do have something else--hope. Without it, the earth would collapse. And without the tiniest bit of goodness we all have within us, this world would be all Pottersville, heartless and meaningless. If that is schmaltz, let there be SCHMALTZ! *It's a Wonderful Life* is indeed the best movie ever made because it is the most entertaining film ever made</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my opinion the best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without wishing to seem like some kind of overly sentimental la-dee-da type, I genuinely believe that 'It's a Wonderful Life' is the greatest movie ever made.Perhaps if all you concentrate on is the potential sexism or the child acting, you could find shortcomings with the picture, but in the grand scheme of things, when you look at the movie as a whole, there is something so good, so sweet and human about 'It's a Wonderful Life'. The heartfelt central performance from Jimmy Stewart (I believe tipping Vertigo to be his best role) is magnificent, just by his face, during scenes like the one where he prays at the bar, Stewart sucks you in, makes you as invested in the wellbeing of George Bailey as the citizens of Bedford falls. But as good as all the performances are (Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore included) they are not the driving force behind what makes Wonderful Life great. That I don't think I can explain.There's just something there you know? something almost mythic and beyond understanding. The tale of how good men can be made to suffer for the hatred of others, and at times how goodness seems doomed to fail, it doesn't sound that happy a concept and despite being hailed as one of the most uplifting things ever, It's a Wonderful Life does not have that happy an ending? I mean? once you really look at it? Potter is still striving towards the destruction of Bailey building and loan and will continue to haunt George's children an grandchildren, Mary is stuck at home with a load of kids who keep getting sick all the time, and George in his depression has neglected many of those who would have liked him otherwise and his childhood dreams are seemingly shattered forever? Honestly if you skip the final message Wonderful Life is depressing hell! But it's not is it? It's beautiful? a testament to the goodness of humanity?. It is a celebration of mediocrity that can not be argued with. "Yeah I'm going to jail? Isn't it great!?" Regardless of the world around, the knowledge that this moment here and now is perfect, dominates everything.The idea that one man can change so many lives has cemented itself into the modern consciousness. It's a Wonderful life has actually managed to become a cliché in itself. A Christmas necessity? I don't really think it needs to be viewed at Christmas, it packs a punch all year round? but it has made a mark on people.I love this movie? I love every lingering second of it? every awkward happiness, every moving sadness, everything... It? It's just? Elation? as George runs down the street yelling "Merry Christmas!" to all the random passers by, as he bangs on Potters window like a madman, as he gives Zuzu back her petals, and that final scene? God that final scene? I actually find it kind of annoying now? I really don't want to cry? every time I want to retain my manliness and just go "What overly sentimental piddle paddle" but Jesus God! The bit that gets me? every time? it's when Harry raises the glass "Here's to my brother George Bailey, the richest man in town!" Then the whole room erupts into Old Lang Zyne and you see Jimmy's face smiling, by then I'm just gone. "No man who has friends can consider his life a failure" Even though it is never spoken, Clarence still has one of the greatest quotes of all time.So I accept this review may seem a bit bizarre and yeah? it kind of is? but I find it hard to talk about this movie without rambling a little. So, to sum up, Frank Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life' is a very depressing, very uplifting, screwball comedy biopic that has an inspiring moral about humanity? Yeah that sounds about right? Honestly this movie is the best. It's almost a good thing it's not perfect because then it runs the risk of seeming cold and mechanical, which Wonderful Life isn't in the slightest.I think if aliens come to earth planning to wipe out the human race after having seen all our wars and all our suffering, but they give us a chance to redeem ourselves? I think we should show them Wonderful life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a sentimental film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it has something to do with waiting a few years between viewings of the same film. Maybe it has to do with maturing or that mysterious acquisition of wisdom that comes with years. Maybe it has to do with slowing down in retirement, paying more attention to details and people and surroundings. Maybe it's a combination of these and other things. But after going a few years without seeing "It's a Wonderful Life," I played the DVD at home just before Christmas this year and saw much more than I had remembered of the film in the past. To be sure, there is nothing wrong with the warm sentimentalism I had associated with the movie over the years. But this time I saw and heard and became immersed in a film steeped in values and development far beyond plain entertainment or of a happy story with a happy ending. Good movies of various genres must be entertaining to be enjoyable. Comedies, romances, musicals, and others may provide good talented performances, humor, action, excitement or mystery. And some may have one or two social values or morals interwoven in their plots. But good drama demands exposition and exploration of more values and a wider range of emotions and mores. That is what we see and hear and become part of in "It's a Wonderful Life."This film has the standard good guys versus bad guys, and the good-over- evil happy ending. But it probes and reaches much deeper into life in its many characters. It contrasts greed with unselfishness, ambition and dreams with sacrifice and kindness, disrespect with trust, arrogance with humility, lies with truth, power and loneliness with compassion and friendship, exploitation with integrity. It's about taking and giving, honesty and dishonesty, hating and loving, family and friends. And as these themes weave throughout the texture of the story, we see the emotions of love, anger, happiness, shame, fear, hurt and joy play out. In his state of despair, George Bailey gets a chance to see his world without his having been born. We viewers share in seeing the sharp contrasts in the people, places and events that we had seen in George's life up to that time. The enduring message is the huge importance of a single life in the lives of all others. And how one person ? each one of us ? is so important in shaping the lives of others and the events of life far beyond our own small worlds. We have much to celebrate when we realize how wonderful life really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man receives a rare gift</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's sometimes dark post-war film, "It's a Wonderful Life" was released in 1946. It was intended to be released in 1947, but when a Technicolor print of "Sinbad" couldn't be delivered on time, this film was put into release. For that reason, "It's a Wonderful Life" - possibly the most wonderful film ever made - was overshadowed by "The Best Years of Our Lives." But you can't keep a great film down, and as the years have passed, "It's a Wonderful Life" has found its place as an iconic film that means Christmas. It's survived the public domain (due to a clerical error, when the copyright was not renewed in 1974), where it was cut to ribbons and shown so often on television (and why not, networks could show it for nothing) that people were sick of it. Now that it has to be licensed again in order to be shown, the film is shown in its totality and not as often.This remarkable story of a man who sacrifices his dreams for the betterment of his community and the business his father built resonates today more than ever, when it often seems like no one cares about anything except what's in it for them. James Stewart is perfect as a caring man who swallows disappointment after disappointment and finally is ready to give up, until he is given the gift of seeing what would have happened had he never been born. No man, he learns, is poor who has friends.I can't think of a better message or anything more inspirational than can be found in this film. George Bailey is all of us, and his story is a reminder that we're all important and, no matter how tough it gets, we need to keep going. One of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a Wonderful life after watching this wonderful film, a film that has changed my view about life, a film that really made me think twice before doing any action, a film that allowed me to look deep into myself, to find this thing that is called "optimism " which is really our only hope in living this life.I have watched this movie recently, and as i remember, at the same day or the day before, i have watched a real Italian masterpiece called " La Vita E Bella " and both of these pictures are photos of the good things in life, that we some times forget because of few bad things happens to us. I don't want to talk about the artistic perfection of this film, because i think, that all of us agree about the tremendous performance of James Stewart as" George Baily" and The Brilliancy in Direction that is brought to us by Frank Capra but the thing i want to talk about is what a great deal of joy will enter your heart when you see this picture . First, the film shows us the amount of sacrifice that good men as "George Baily" do in order to see people around them happy. from the beginning of this movie, Baily starts to Sacrifice, First when he get beaten by the old pharmacist in order to prevent him from serving the wrong medicine, then the rescue of his brother, then dropping his dream in becoming an adventurer to allow his brother to study, and much more of these things, these allowed Baily to be rewarded for his acts at the end of the film, when all those people really were by his side in order to help him ! Talking about the ending of the film, there is a great moral lesson we can learn from it, it the old " Do Good things, and good things will happen" which is in my point of view, is the theme of the film. In addition, in the last scene of the movie i've cried tears of joy as if i were him, and as if those people were my family and friends, who are not always there, but the appear when i need them.Another thing i would like marking to, is the debut of the Angel, which i see a very important thing happens at that moment, the angle throw himself at water to let George rescue him. And i think, the significance of this move, is that this Angel is trying to call Baily's Depth and reality as a good man. Also, the disappear of Baily from life is a very important thing, showing all people, that no matter how insignificant we can see our selves, but there is a whole balance in this world depending on us, and that is our vanishing from this system, could lead to a great gap in it that we cannot understand as long as we are there.It's A Wonderful job, i can say at the end...Capra has presented a real picture , a picture that sticks at the viewers mind , and could really change their lives.As for me, "It's A wonderful Life" helped to shape a whole new identity, an identity that is based on looking on the Bright Side of this life....and i really liked it...nowadays, every time i am about to do something that doesn't go with this fact,i immediately remember this Film, and Directly imagine a world without me...and as i said, i maybe an insignificant tiny individual....but i am a part of the balance of this huge Universe !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Uplifting Story - Too Bad We See It Only 1 Time A Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers My favorite movie of all time and it has been that for decades.This movie makes one believe in heaven, angels, miracles, the good in the world, and other things that sometimes in our darkest moments we choose to avoid. This contrast of the heavenly optimistic and the down to earth pessimistic is the point and the reason this movie works. The powerful uplifting super-climax takes place because the movie will draw the viewer into the very bad down-to-earth pessimistic view of a situation, and the wrong way of seeing things, and then the movie lifts the viewer up in a way that seems almost beyond this world! To keep with the otherworldly concept, the movie at the same time teaches the viewer an over-arching life concept of spending life cultivating friends/relationships instead of money, as if we are listening to a voice from heaven that knows all.The movie was loosely based on the short story by Phillip Van doren Stern, "The Greatest Gift". This was the story of someone who got to see what life would have been if he never existed.The movie's climax for 1940's was and still is powerful. If one did a remake of it, today, you could add tremendous heavenly sites/colors and music to the climactic words that end the movie, but I really do not think it would add anything of value.I have read the negative reviews of the movie and I believe many did not get the main point or do not like a happy endings. Some people feel Peter Baily is too selfless. I am happy those views are in the minority.I watch this movie every time it is on, which probably totals about 1,000 times to date. I'll probably watch it many more times. The ending always is an uplifting experience. If you want to feel the uplifting power of the ending for yourself, watch the entire movie and when the ending comes and people begin singing the song "Auld Lang Syne" immediately turn the volume to the max and listen to the words and sounds until the ending credits start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would Nietzsche say if he were to see the movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have ever heard of the quote by Nietzsche "Hope is the worst of evils, for it prolongs the torments of man?" Well you feel really down and you can't see a way out when you hear such a quote! An idealist guy named George Bailey(played by James Stewart), a man who has forgone all of his dreams wants to help his town out. When he starts thinking of committing suicide, believing that he has achieved nothing worthwhile, an angel shows him a view of what the world would have been like if he had never lived when he Bailey just wished he had never been born! He sees that his wife would never marry,his brother would never get a medallion for his heroic achievement(the only thing that I didn't like in the movie it shows war as some sort of heroic achievement though it is supposed to be about hope and life all over)the pharmacist who gave him a job would go to the prison but for Bailey's help etc... The movie just puts itself right there when you are torn apart between hope and wishing you had never been born. Every one of us feels down and wishes to see something different in our life sometimes we do think that we are not worth living but each ordinary life has something to give even we're down or discouraged. A realist view like Nietzsche's could help us keep our head above the water but we need the concept "it's a wonderful life" to enjoy the every little perfection of our small lives!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film about 5 times, I'm by no way a fan of black and white films or old films in general, in fact I would go as far as saying that i am usually put off by such factors. So why is it that this film will never feel that way to me? the answer is simple, its a superb uplifting film which can bring a tear to your eye with every viewing. I have four brothers, three of which have all been caught with a tear in their eye at the conclusion of the movie and my youngest yet to see it but I'm confident he will be the same. the ending has to be the greatest ending in the history of film making, with the songs being sang and the emotions showing, its a wonderful life is simply amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* Contains spoilers * This is the movie that has that "I wish I never been born" thing, where an angel shows him how his life would have been if he hadn't been born, and before seeing this movie today, I had seen it re-done a thousand times in various (mostly lame/gross) stuff, even in "Married with children" (which was a bit funny, and quite the opposite of this movie). So when I found out that this was were it came from (unless I'm mistaken), I must admit that I felt a little grossified. But after all, I liked the movie, and the small grossification was blown out of the water by the ending. Although it was happy, preachy and so on, it impressed me and sent chills down my spine and gave me a bit of a lump in my throat. Overall, this pushed the movie up to be among the best of the old movies I've seen and I'll be a little generous and give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have two competing trains of thought about this movie. One is the obvious praise/adoration/no-holiday-season-complete-without that all of the other reviews have said. The other is much darker.Does anyone else see that the point of the movie is divine intervention from holiday suicide? Does anyone see this as a bad thing? Let's examine the facts. 1. George is unhappy with life. 2. He gets in financial difficulty. 3. Because he sees no way out, he decides to commit suicide. 4. Divine powers intervene and save George from killing himself at the last minute.Does this happen in real life? Ya, all but #4, which never occurs. I hate to say it but this movie that we all love should be avoided by depressed people. It is probably indirectly responsible for thousands of suicides. People aren't thinking clearly when they are depressed and seeing divine intervention save someone at the last second, if and only if they are good enough, is probably enough to push people over the edge. That stupid 'Touched by an Angel' TV show is just as bad.People have a hard enough time distinguishing truth from reality without suggesting to the weak-minded that some supernatural entity is going to come along and solve all of their problems.All that having been said, I still love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but hamstrung</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only two things wrong with "It's a Wonderful Life" - unfortunately, they are the beginning and the ending. (I don't reveal what happens at the end, but I do reveal something about the feel of the ending, and those who wish to come to the film cold may wish to read no further.)To begin with the beginning ... This is the story of a man's life AND of the way the town would have been had he never existed; but the device whereby we are shown that counterfactual is the most ham-fisted and grating one Capra could have chosen. It involves a bumbling angel named Clarence who has yet to get his wings (and, if I were in charge of Heaven, never would). Heaven (or perhaps God - it's hard to tell) appears to be the Crab Nebula and it flashes whenever it utters an accented syllable. Clarence is a half-witted interstellar firefly. I'm not making fun of the special effects: I'm questioning the fact that the deus ex machina had to be made into a character at all, let alone such an annoying one.But the ending is worse. It's clearly MEANT to be a happy ending: the trouble is that it's no continuation whatever of the preceding story. Difficulties are vanquished by being ignored. It's as if Capra visualised the scene he wanted at the end, and when he discovered it didn't fit, filmed it anyway. A genuinely happy ending would have been great - even a tragic ending would have been less painful, and depressing, to watch.Now for the good news. Between the faltering beginning and the sour conclusion it's sustained magic - one brilliant scene after another, to the point where it's difficult to believe that so many good bits found their way into the same film. And I don't just mean that individual scenes play well, but to no purpose: there really is a fine and complex story supporting them. The ending is a genuine shame, but if you can get past it, good luck to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless enjoyable classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only watched this film about 3 times but I like it for all sorts of reasons. It has an extremely powerful message and for me it is delivered in a subtle way by introducing it very early on in the film. Its almost as though its a very subtle product placement during one of the external scenes. All of the cast are perfectly suited and that is rare indeed. The film is a timeless enjoyable classic and it does not pull any punches when it could have. Due to the year it was made it could have been reduced to a slick waste of money but fortunately the professionals who were responsible for making this tale had the good sense to make it right and I suspect that the actors enjoyed the experience every bit as much as most of the people who have watched this film in the sixty odd years since it was made. At the time of writing this film is at number 30 of the IMDb top 250 and in my opinion it is there on merit. I would thoroughly recommend anybody watch this film but please pay attention and you will enjoy the experience that much more.</fullReview>

I watched it almost every year around Christmas time. I missed seeing it for the first three years after I moved to Taiwan, then i bought the DVD.... and watch it at least once a year.I have introduced this film to ALL of my English students, and 9 or 10 of them have borrowed it from me. Every one of them that has borrowed it has loved it, and 3 or 4 of them ended up borrowing it again at some time later on.This is a timeless classic, that has no barriers, be it time, age group or language (my DVD has no Chinese subtitles).The story is absolutely wonderful, the acting is superb, and the right people were doing the right roles.Based on my student's reactions to this film, I can safely say that this film is a must see and will be appreciated and treasured for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful, moving movie. It takes you on the journey again every time you see it. Every scene is a classic. Jimmy Stewart is quite incredible in this movie. If you ever thought classical actors couldn't rival method actors, see how genuine Stewart's performance is. Two special moments: Stewart's tears as he sits in martinis, and the scene where Mary and George both listen to the same telephone receiver. Its such a magical scene - one of the best scenes of all time. Neither of them listen to what Sam Wainwright is saying on the phone, because all of a sudden the two of them realise they are standing the closest they've been together in twenty or so years. He can smell her hair and she can smell his aftershave. The scene is played out in expressions and movements, and you can read their thoughts on their faces. A joy.This movie does a difficult thing, something we love to be reminded of each christmas, it makes you appreciate the important things in life. Its about falling back in love with life. Frank Capra was a master director. Not only are his movies brilliantly realised, perfectly shot and constructed, but they contain just enough awfulness to ensure that the endings do not seem corny - their positive messages do not seem contrived - they are a joy and a relief. Frank Capra doesn't pretend the world is a perfect place, but he does something many filmmakers can't - he actually provides answers as to how best to deal with the world's imperfect nature. If you're ever feeling sad and low, or too concerned with trivial things, watch Its a Wonderful Life.</fullReview>

The story line is that a Building and Loan owner is on the brink of suicide because he thinks that he is a failure however an angel brings him back. This is the ultimate feel good film. as it ends with a very happy ending the story line is simple but i think it works. It stars James Stewart, Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore. It is directed by Frank Capra. It has a good narrative as it shows the principle actor growing up and helping everyone as he does. The musical score is also very good written by Dimitri Tiomkin it adds to the atmosphere of the film. Just remember that no man is a failure who has friends !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sentimental Hogwash!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Bailey is a thoroughly nice guy, the backbone of the small American community into which he was born. George's story is that of America in the first half of the twentieth century - a happy childhood before the First World War, ambition growing with maturity, then trouble for the family in the wake of the 1929 crash. George and his family make it through the Depression, and are blessed with success as George's dearly-loved brother Harry wins the Congressional Medal of Honour in World War Two. From this high point, George's fortunes take a steep nosedive, and the defining crisis of his life is suddenly upon him ... George's twin ambitions since early childhood have been to explore the world (travel has always fired his imagination) and to "build things". Events are constantly cheating him out of his travel plans, and sheer selflessness prevents him from getting an education, his passport out of Bedford Falls and into a career as an architect. Like his father before him, George is too kindly ever to advance his own personal aims.  His adversary and nemesis is Old Man Potter, "the richest and the meanest man in the county". He is as unlike George as a man can be. Immobile and with no curiosity about the world, Potter dominates the small town, and is universally feared and despised. Without family or home life, Potter has only his money, which he ruthlessly ensures will increase and multiply. George believes in the community ("we've got to have faith in each other"), whereas Henry F. Potter regards the people as exploitable "rabble". On George's study wall hangs a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. Potter has a bust of Napoleon. This famous Capra tear-jerker is a masterpiece of emotional manipulation, and incidentally a tremendous piece of cinematic craftsmanship. The film has two premises, firstly that the fabric of the nation is sound so long as Americans stick to the early settlers' values of communal mutual assistance, and secondly, an enlightened liberal doctrine of the perfectability of mankind. If ordinary folks are offered chances for betterment, by means of building improved housing and encouraging financial thrift, they will prove themselves to be sober, hardworking citizens, keen to advance the prosperity of their progeny. George is the liberal hero who embodies these beliefs. His dream is to raise "dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw", and when the Martini family takes possession of its property, George is on hand to see Giuseppe realise the American Dream - "I own my own house!" The young George knows that he doesn't want to squander his life "cooped up ... in a shabby little office". However, George is the responsible type, and to protect the working people from Potter, and put Harry through college, he assumes the burden of running the family's Building and Loans business. He grows to realise that his father's legacy is a noble one, the foundation of America's future. George continues to dream of "anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles", but the thoughtlessness of others keeps him trapped in Bedford Falls. Alone outside a house party, he reacts wistfully to the wail of a distant train. His crisis of conscience when Harry announces the marriage and the new job is a tremendous piece of cinema. Kind, decent George goes through silent turmoil as it sinks in that his hopes have been dashed again. If the propositions on which the story rests are simple folksy ones, the story itself is a strong one, told with great zest. Pacy effervescence keeps the action moving snappily along. Mary loves George from childhood, as we see in the drugstore sequence. The prepubescent George shows the traits we come to love in him - industriousness, reliability and social conscience - and he saves Gower the druggist from committing an appalling act of negligence, at great cost to himself. The tight narrative sweeps us from the kiss to the wedding, and from the honeymoon taxi to the run on the bank. World war Two, during which "George fought the battle of Bedford Falls", is an object lesson in concise story-telling. One of Capra's narrative techniques is to exploit clashes of opposites. We plunge from elation to despair as Harry's triumph gives way to the financial disaster. Christmas bonhomie is tainted by the chilling presence of the bank examiner. George's desperate prayer in Martini's bar is accompanied by a jolly Italian ditty. The 'drowning' drama is followed swiftly by a gentle comedy scene. The heart of the film is the relationship between George and Mary. A silent look passes between them at the high school dance, and we know that they have fallen in love. Their charleston dance (a superbly-choreographed sequence) cements the incipient romance and is followed by a great two-handed scene in which the lovers throw stones at 320 Sycamore, the house which will one day be theirs. George's later visit to Mary's house once more blends romance and comedy with splendid success. It is a joy to watch the aching desire of each for the other as they listen to Sam's phone call. Clarence the wingless angel offers George "a chance to see what the world would be like without you". The nightmare sequence shows Bedford Falls (now known as Pottersville) to be a seedy Gomorrah of jazz bars and strip joints, peopled by a surly, unhappy populace. George's creed is borne out - "each man's life touches every other man's life", and he sees that his patient, benign influence has worked its magic. Bedford Falls is a better place for having known George Bailey. Watch out for a young Gloria Grahame as Violet, launching a career of playing bad girls. And is that Donna Reed in Martini's, posing as the bar girl in the peroxide wig? </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart was not George Bailey. It was one of the reasons audiences of the time did not welcome back with open arms one of the stars of pre World War two. Although George Bailey was the almost perfected emotional core of every man and woman's heart, Frank Capra delivered the darkest yet of three movies featuring one of his best stars. It ruined his somewhat wholesome, small town man in the heart image that Capra had given his characters in their previous collaborations "You Can't Take it With You" and "Mr Smith Goes to Washington". Angel, second class, is forever associated with "It's a Wonderful Life". A brilliantly silly Henry Travers as Clarence the illusive protector of a shattered man created an immortal legend. Donna Reed as Mary in her first notable role delivers on her promises, but outclassed by the deliverance of two of the most difficult roles in cinema history. Capra faves, Thomas Mitchell, as Uncle Billy and Lionel Barrymore, in a role a far cry from lovable Grandpa Vanderhoff in "You Can't Take it With You", is convincingly sinister as Mr Potter. In its imagery, "It's a Wonderful Life" is frightening. Dark, grim, terrifying moments exceed the Capra trademarks. The comedic moments thrill, and there are plenty of them. Three viewings, the first not at Christmas, have imprinted the memory of unforgettable sequences into my mind forever.Few films were ever designed with a message to remain immortalised through the years. It remains simple and complex on certain levels however it is viewed, but the most important two are all there in the script. "No man is a failure who has friends", and "Life is wonderful". The film must be watched until on some personal level, the viewer connects with what the film is trying to say. The movie is the stock treatment I prescribe to others in times of depression. A decent dosage could bring a more positive outlook of optimism to even the most cynical prepared to look beyond the black and white images. There has never been a more capable Hollywood movie made to create tears and laughters in excessive amounts which makes it a masterpiece of the American cinema, and the definitive Holiday classic. It remains the most influential of movies I have seen in my life. I was originally one of those cynical with a refusal to view any movie made in black and white. With little effort, it changed my perspective on life, but however easily I have forgotten the lessons this film teaches, it just as simply reminds me of what I need to know. It holds the record for the number of times a movie has made me cry. "It's a Wonderful Life" was a Christmas ritual I was never dragged through when I was younger. I wish I was.

I know everyone likes it for it's feel-good properties and it's happy, happy, happy ending, but let's face it, the vast majority of this film is a downbeat, depressing experience. And that's why I love it. Turn it off at the point where he's on the bridge, and this is a wonderful, wonderfully depressing tale. The way his dreams get crushed and his town becomes his prison is so well done. People have already said how well this film is written, and that includes the depressing parts as well. You have to believe in his suffering, his agony. You have to believe in his desire to jump off the bridge so that you too can be saved by Clarence in the end. That's why I don't want the end section in there. I believe in George's suffering. If he wants to end it, then so be it. If I'm in a depressed mood, and want to watch a superbly put together sombre film, then It's a Wonderful Life is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946) **** James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Henry Travers, Beulah Bondi, Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE FILM : Perennial Christmas classic about George Bailey (Stewart's best acting performance, one for the time capsule), an idealistic dreamer whose out-of-reach plans for himself are constantly set aside for his family and the town he helped in more ways than one. One of the best films ever made about a man's universal struggle with what he wants and what he does resulting with the immortal question: What would life be like if I were never born? Stewart's performance depicts every emotion superbly and facing suicide shows just what a complex character interpretation he has. His salvation comes in the form of Clarence, his guardian angel still trying to earn his wings, who shows him exactly how things would be had he not existed. Best scene: after Stewart is refused entrance by his mother he races into an intense wide/close-up and the registering of fear, horror and finally understanding that spreads across his face is ultimately moving, chilling and heart-breaking all at once. My favorite moment; if you're not moved by this, you 're simply not human. Dare not to sing along at the end to "Auld Lang Syne" and dare not to cry. Definitely a film ahead of its time (originally a box-office flop and snubbed royally at the Oscars losing largely to the WWII American classic "The Best Years of Our Lives"). Frank Capra's masterpiece was his and Stewart's personal favorite films.*Trivia note: characters named Bert &amp; Ernie would eventually be paid tribute as "Sesame Street"'s immortal buddies and Stewart's and Reed's characters, George and Mary are also my parents' names.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the heart of this marvellous Capra film is a man, who from when we first see him in Gower's store, longs to see far off places. As we all know, he never does leave Bedford Falls and it is this sadness that is at the core of the film and the main character George Bailey, a man with unfulfilled dreams. It is also what makes this film stand the test of time. The characters are believable and compared to current Hollywood heroes win hands down. They are all so well defined and fleshed out as in a Dickens novel that one enjoys spending time with them. So much has been borrowed from this film and so much written about it. Essentially it is James Stewart's central performance that is outstanding and to watch his realistic gradual breakdown is very distressing. I always find it difficult watching the scene when he goes home after realising he cannot find the money and Mary(his wife) turns to see him clutching his daughter with such a desperate look on his face. Her reaction to him is extremely moving. A man driven to the brink worth more alive than dead, this is a much darker film than people often expect. But he does get a second chance and maybe this is why we like it so much, because in real life this is rarely possible. George Bailey played by James Stewart is someone who has a great face. I like George Bailey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part of a staple Christmas Eve diet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My family's annual viewing of 'It's a Wonderful Life,' on Christmas eve, has become as ritualistic as eating turkey on December 25. With the fresh smell of the tree in the corner of the room, a flickering candle on the fireplace and a mince pie soaked with brandy butter in my hand, relishing the spectacle of 'It's a Wonderful Life' is, despite the number of times I've now sat through it, something I look forward to and treasure each year. It is, quintessentially, a Christmas movie, and I'll never be able to bring myself to watching it in the middle of an August heatwave.I can't quite put my finger on what exactly makes this film so special. But surely the heart-warming plot, which proves to us that, us humans, we can always eventually triumph over despair, and the overall magical feel of the film, is a crucial element of Capra's masterpiece. It teaches us, as privileged westerners, many lessons about the true meaning of humanity and forces us, just as it does to George Bailey - played with relish and sincerity by James Stewart, capturing some of his finest moments - to appreciate, on reflection, just how lucky we actually are.There are countless of our favourite films that, through sheer force of habit, we find ourselves enjoying on a regular basis. But the very fact that, on the same day each year, I ensure that I savour 'It's A Wonderful Life,' proves that this film is really something quite remarkable with an ability to make its mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The darkest side of humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this film is associated with Christmas because it has been shown at Christmas time, it is really a dark study of the insides of the human soul. George is driven to the point of wanting to die and wanting not even to exist. Frank Capra takes us through the life of a man so that we can see why someone would be willing to choose oblivion rather than existence. Then we see that, even though life may seem meaningless, we, like George, have choices and that these choices can make a great difference in the world even though we may not realize that fact. The film helps us to realize why we are alive. That is its real enduring appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is depressing, which makes it quite inappropriate for a so- called "Christmas movie." I made the mistake of watching it on Christmas Day one year, and it turned out to be a damper on the whole holiday. Not just for me, but the whole family. The acting left a little to be desired. I will say whoever acted the angel was very good (I think it was Henry Travers). His character was also strong. But James Stewart's character was pretty depressing. He makes the small mistake of saying "I wish I had never been born," and shortly after, his wish comes true! He still lives in his hometown and is the same person, but all of his old buddies ignore him when he tries to talk to him. Even his family shuns him. If you are going to watch this movie, make sure it is not actually on Christmas or any holiday, for that matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's an average movie. It's got classical Hollywood propaganda- and politics. I think people tend to ignore the undertones of trying to get people to stay in the 'homeland' of America. There's also political messages about democracy and individualism, as well as small messages about family life and propaganda about the war. It's good in that it gets people to appreciate life, yet it seems to discourage people to aim higher. For some people having a wife and kids and friends is nice, but for some they have other goals. Seeing the world and achieving ones goals is important, we can't all accept second best. We have to be selfish in some ways if we are to get what we want. There needs to be a balance, but in this movie George lives more for others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the all-time Christmas classics, this excellent piece of work from Frank Capra focuses on George Bailey (James Stewart, in one of his career-best roles) who is stopped from jumping into the river in despair by a friendly angel called Clarence (Henry Travers). We then see in flashback what has brought George to the brink of suicide and key events from his life - saving his brother from drowning when the ice breaks; alerting his chemist boss to a fatal mix of drugs; courting and marrying his childhood sweetheart (the winsome Donna Reed); and dealing with the film's token bad guy, Mr Potter (brilliantly played by the crusty Lionel Barrymore). Clarence then shows George what the sleepy town of Bedford Falls would have been like without him and proves that you're never alone if you have friends around you and if you make a difference.Interestingly, two direct influences from this film were on the poetry e-zine 'Zuzu's Petals' (George Bailey's little daughter, who leaves some flower petals in his jacket); and, so it is said, on the children's TV programme, Sesame Street (Bert and Ernie, the mad puppets, who are the names of the cop and the taxi driver in this).And let us not forget, when you hear a bell ring, it means an angel has got its wings!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: Don't read this if you believe the title doesn't take the ending away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't wonder why this movie is among the top 30 movies. It's an American classic, you don't need more. If this was a European movie, it would get bad critics and ratings. But with the Americans we tolerate it. They are like that. The film they like best is the film with the happiest happy-end that is so happy that it's already in the title. Where I live, they dare to show it once a year, at Christmas, and that's it. It's typical for the American people that they adore movies where someone is shown by God Himself how much the world needs him! That's what gives them hope that their own life isn't meaningless. The problem is: That man the film is about has in most cases nothing to do with them. He is an angel himself, saved two people's life and gave homes to many poor people in a small village. Who else can say that about oneself? The plot is constructed, so the film isn't valuable to give you hope and people who realize that are rather made sad then happy.America doesn't realize and that's why it loves this movie. Fine. It's not a bad film at all! It's really enjoyable, even humorous at the beginning, and James Stewart is a great actor. But again, I'm sure this film would have been fallen into oblivion within 50 years of movie history if it was a European film. ?It's a Wonderful Life` is one of many bizarre drolleries of the American kitsch society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I beg to disagree...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, here is one movie where I will have to disagree with almost everybody. I do not care that this film has become a Christmas staple, and notwithstanding my love and admiration for Frank Capra and James Stewart, this movie is far from even being particularly good, let alone a masterpiece. This is a movie that somehow got hyped up with the passing of time, and now exists in a universe of its own. It is telling that at the time of its making, it did not even receive a single Oscar. Apparently, at the time, nobody thought it to be so special...Now, if you look at this picture objectively and without the typically "small-town-America do-good pink-shaded sunglasses", you will find a very simple, obvious and at times boring story. The characters are so simplified, that most are just caricatures of real people (just look at the local villain). Technically, there is nothing to write home about either. The sound, as a matter of fact is terrible, one can barely discern the (sometimes confusing) dialog.And then we come to (according to the masses, and not only) the most important part of the movie: the message. Here is where I have another major problem... I may be cynical or stupid, but I do not see what this all-important transcendental message is; If it is simply 'be a good person', this could have been (and has been) done much better. This movie is a mix of slapstick Hollywood 'feel good' and of political correctness '1947 style'. No wonder it fares so good in our modern times...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguided celebration of self-destructive charity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a folktale concerning St Martin, who as a soldier on a mission of importance, gave half of his cloak to a naked beggar he met in a snowstorm... the moral being that there are circumstances where it isn't worthy (or rational) to be charitable to the point where you can't survive yourself. It's a A Wonderful Life, however, is the story of someone who - in effect - gives all his cloak, then complains about the consequences.There's been a deal of revisionist criticism focusing on the political subtext, but I'm more interested in the personal angle. In my view, George's suicidal state of mind is not caused by the greedy Potter or by family mishaps, but by his invariable decision to respond to such situations by throwing away all of his own wellbeing and hopes in favour of others.His actions are not even necessarily 'good'. At every turn, George lets sentiment completely swamp reason. What if covering up for an incompetent pharmacist led to further deaths? Perhaps Uncle Billy *ought* to be in an institution? Perhaps George should have recognised a no-win situation, made a settlement with Potter and moved on, instead of selfishly saddling his family with a company he deliberately runs so unprofitably that it hasn't the capital to ride a financial setback.Furthermore, the alternative timeline presented by Clarence is clearly fake, concocted to justify George's failure to break out of this self-created rut. There is no reason to asssume, other than because Capra wants it so, that if George hadn't existed his wife would have remained unmarried, his brother fallen through the ice, or the town's social change necessarily proved negative in the long run (Potter after all, won't live for ever).Sorry, but I find this film deeply exasperating. This is not, as some have commented, a modern-day Book of Job, since George's problems are not inevitable fate, but so much down to his own choice to be a doormat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic bit of American propaganda that never fails to warm the heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`George Bailey is a pillar of his community whose life has been selflessly dedicated to the welfare of others. Through the evil machinations of the town's business mogul, George is driven to the point of suicide. In answer to the prayers of the townsfolk, a missing angel comes to the rescue. He shows George what a sad and sorry place the town would have been without him. Can this life George out of his despair?'Who hasn't seen this film? Anyone? It is an unashamed tribute to homely values and is hugely warming. The story itself is not exactly rocket science, but it is does contain plenty of nice touches as we follow George through his life of missed opportunities and sacrifice through to his marriage and eventual down fall. The world that this happens seems so distant nowadays, with our friendless society - so few people do anything for their fellow man in big cities etc. So this is very touching to see a man who serves others in such a major way. It is a story of how every little helps and how you cannot overdo friendly gestures.Stewart is excellent with his partner Capra. Barrymore is also excellent in a thankless role - he represents all that is wrong in society and of course he rises to a powerful position. Henry Travers is good as Clarence, the wingless angel and of course who can forget the excellent Donna Reed as Mary.It's pure hokum of course, the regular Christmas movie that lifts everyone's spirits. But isn't this what we all wish the world was like really? Why can't it be - if only for two hours. This is what Stewart and Capra do best - enjoy and forget the real world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Wonderful Life is a Wonderful Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Christmas fantasy comedy-drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra, is a movie that creates suspense, emotional appeal and joy for all ages who intend to watch this movie. James Stewart as George Bailey, represents an average dad with average problems. At some point in everyone's life, you hit a time in your life where everything goes wrong, and you can't seem to stop the bad luck. The character George Bailey represents that. However, at the end of the movie, he realizes that he is needed in his society to not only benefit himself, but the whole town. Due to the movie being in the 1940's, it was indeed in black and white. This creates a more unique feeling for a person who was born in the 1960's-present, but also isn't unpopular to many people in today's society as well. This movie is still watched as a Christmas tradition, and will remain that way for a very long time. 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's one movie I probably haven't watched enough times, it would be "It's a Wonderful Life". The characters, the situations, the message all come together in a way that intrinsically defines it as a Christmas movie, but when you get right down to it, the film transcends Christmas in a way that's truly heartwarming and magical. Jimmy Stewart had that unique ability to put the Everyman into his roles, and this picture certainly qualifies as one of his finest performances. Donna Reed could not have been a better choice to play Mary, displaying a wholesome sex appeal to go along with those traditional home town American values that pictures of the era were so skillful in portraying. Had Director Frank Capra made only this one picture, it would have earned him recognition as one of the true masters of cinema. I could go on and on, but there's really no point in trying to heap further accolades on a picture that has earned it's place in American film right at the top. Watch it, and watch it again, and in taking the picture's message to heart, reach out and help an angel earn it's wings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly before everyone has a go, I am not in any way knocking the film or the quality of it. In fact its a shame films today are not made with the same love, care and attention to detail. I also agree that it is one of the greatest films ever made, its just I see the film a little different when taken as a whole.Where most people see this film as a happy one for all the obvious reasons, including that ending, I see it as one of the most depressing and sad stories ever made. Ask yourself the question, why did he want to commit suicide in the first place. The reason is that throughout the first half of the film/story, all you see is everyone doing what they want, including his brother. Whereas he is forced via circumstance or emotional blackmail to stay and cater to the wants of everyone else. Where were the 'friends and family' when things got bad, why didn't anyone see what was going on. The main reason was cause they were more concerned with themselves. The outcome of all this is the famous bridge seen. And in my eyes, even Clarence ended up using him to get his wings.By showing him what life for all those he has helped, would be like if he hadn't existed, is if anything, another case of emotional blackmail. He is again made to feel bad and ungrateful for his lot.My point is, why didn't anyone ask him what he wanted and then help him go for it etc.My final comment is, when you next watch this film, or read this comment, take a look around you and see if anyone you know and care about is quietly sinking and give them a helping hand before it gets too bad. The chances are if they are your friend or part of your family, they have already helped you and now they quietly need your help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uplifting and heart-warming tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is one of those movies that is beyond its time, especially in transferring emotions to the audience. The plot is highly sophisticated; it centers around the life of George Bailey, a successful business man that is thrown out of control when financial aspects hinder the progress of his Building and Loan enterprise. The business crisis is the focus of the story, but the majority of it is a laid-back reflection of the good parts of Bailey's life. In the end, Bailey is brought to redemption and sees the world in a new light, ultimately leading to one of the most uplifting endings in any movie.The cast was perfect all around; there was not a single actor that jumped out as a poor choice. James Stewart shines with the critical role of Bailey. He starts off as a confident and envisioned man, but is eventually consumed by business problems and sees no way out. He completely misses the positive impact that he has made on the community, but reaches a sort of understanding by the end. Stewart is excellent at conveying this development of ideas. Even Mr. Potter, the antagonist of the film, becomes a sympathetic character. Even though he initially comes off as a selfish pest, it is hard not to respect his business achievements and feel sorry that he does not enjoy other company.The plot is put together so well that it is impossible not to be drawn in, even for modern audiences. The idea of guardian angels watching over us might seem ridiculous, but ends up being an intriguing plot element. The mix of fantasy with reality works out. The camera work, dialog, and way the scenes were set up are surprisingly modern. It does not require the audience to watch the movie from the lens of someone from the 1940's, but rather is a timeless experience that can be enjoyed by families of any generation.Simply put, I recommend this movie to all people, especially as a family. If you get a chance, it would be best to watch it during the winter holidays because it fits in really nicely with the atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSIt's A Wonderful Life (1946) Director: Frank Capra Starring: James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore and Henry TraversRunning Time: 130 minutes If you don't know a single thing about It's A Wonderful Life then you cannot seriously call yourself a movie lover. But we'll tell you about it anyway. It's a Christmas Classic that has survived criticisms of schmaltzness. And a movie in the 40s being too schmalzy has to be a worry. Anyway heres the story. George Bailey (James Stewart in his signature role) is a man who has put his friends and family before his own happiness his entire life. Whether it is jumping into ice to save his little brother Harry, an act that cost him his hearing in his left ear. Or if it's sacrificing his dream of travelling the world to look after his late father's bank so it can stay in business or so Harry can have a bright future with his wife. He even gave up a lucrative $20,000 a year contract from local miser Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) simply because of the townsfolk he has already helped enough. After all, he built them a bunch of good quality houses, allowing them to leave Potter's slums and enjoy a good life. Whatever the deed George Bailey hasn't thought of himself once in his life. He has dreamt of leaving Bedford Falls but through his own good nature has never been able to. He has settled down with his wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four kids. So when his Uncle Billy `misplaces' $8,000 (Potter finds it, keeps it) George is faced with scandal and prison. He is a man at the end of his tether he takes it out on everyone, even his own family. In the end he is told he is worth more dead than alive and decides to commit suicide on Christmas Eve. Only, that's not the end for right at the beginning of the story we know that an angel is watching over George and it is he who saves George from suicide. The angel is Clarence (Henry Travers) who, as you should know, shows George the good he has done people in his lifetime, starting with a trip to what should be Martini's. We discover that George wasn't there too save his old boss Mr. Gower from accidentally poisoning food through his grief. Then we find out that Harry, who is to be given a medal from the President for bravery in WW2, died when he broke through the ice, because George wasn't there too save him. Bedford Falls is now Pottersville because George wasn't there too battle Potter, Mary ends up an old maid because George wasn't there to love her, Uncle Billy went insane because George wasn't there to help with the business, it goes on and on. When George begs to live again and is re-united with his family there isn't a hard heart in sight. It's A Wonderful Life has many themes of love, friendship, kindness, redemption even just pure coincidence, but there is one clear message running through this dark but magically uplifting Frank Capra Christmas Classic: It truly is a wonderful life.</fullReview>

A man is brought back from the brink of suicide by internal reflection on his life, pointed out by the external source of the guardian angel. One of the few films to address, albeit subtly, the power of prayer. The prayers of friends and family manifest themselves in the help of the angel. It is through the community that George had defined himself, and through that same community he found redemption. The film is very deserving of its accolades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I did get a bit sick of it a few years ago when it played on just about every channel at just about every hour just about every day from Thanksgiving to Christmas. But I never quite got to the point where I hated the movie.This movie, like a lot of Frank Capra's, is sometimes thought of as sentimental almost to the point of schmaltz. It is true that a first glance this seems like a "feel-good movie" to use the present-day parlance. But, again like a lot of Capra's movies, it has a dark side lurking under its sunny exterior. It's usually not patently obvious, but rather subtle. In this case, James Stewart's dark hard-edged side is most notably seen in the scene where he goes home and abuses his family before going out to get plastered. It's only a small part of the movie, but it's there, nicely complementing the sweet, nice, aw-shucks good-guy character he portrays throughout the rest of the movie. It also shows what an actor of range Stewart was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a Christmas movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart has long been a favourite actor of mine. Not just because of his effortless charm and wry wit both on and off screen, but because of the variety of roles he played in his distinguished career. He was the favourite actor of many eminent directors. Capra, Hitchcock and Ford all used his ample talents more than once, and although many people associate him with either westerns or sugary, cutesy roles, he was very versatile and a remarkable talent. It's a Wonderful Life shares the same misfortune - to be misunderstood. Often written off as a Christmas film or schmaltz, It's a Wonderful Life is neither. George Bailey is a complex character. He is first and foremost a man, and he feels the acute pain of bitter disappointment. He doesn't act out of love for his fellow man, he acts out of love and respect for his family. He is burdened with being the eldest son, and the responsibility that that entails, and his greatest desire, to travel, is thwarted by these responsibilities. We share his pain because George Bailey is a good man and we want to see good things happen to him. While his brother and his friends achieve fame and fortune, George is left behind in Bedford Falls, the town he grew up in and so desperately wants to escape. George is resentful of the people who put him in this situation, especially the unscrupulous Mr Potter, played by the excellent Lionel Barrymore. When $3000 goes missing from the Building and Loans, George is at the end of his tether, and Clarence the angel is sent to save him.This really is not schmaltz or saccharine, the film is a dark study of responsibility and disappointment, and even though all ends happily around the Christmas tree, this certainly is not a Christmas movie, because by definition they have to be crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is more than just a Christmas classic it's a classic in general and has passed with flying colors in the test of time. Even today in 2014 it is on the top 250 in the top 30 as a matter a fact and deserves its spot very much so, it may be a tad high rated but I guess in the end it deserves it.The movie is corny and cheesy at moments but is more than made up for in its serious moments. The story is about a man named George Bailey who is probably the most unselfish and considerate person you'll ever meet. It can be tragically sad and then brings you up with a great message and warm feeling.In my book there is three types of crying I've associated with films. These types are when something is sad, tears of joy, and crying for just the beauty of the film, and I can say I did all three. It isn't like the film was so visually beautiful that it made me tear up it was the beauty of the message and the ending. I don't think everybody will enjoy it to the same extent but it literally is for anybody kids and adults of all ages. That's all I have to say thanks for reading my review and enjoy this Christmas Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful tale of life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child, I grew up watching this movie. Attempting to put my bias aside, "It's A Wonderful Life" is the one of the highest quality films I have ever seen. James Stewart is phenomenal at being the ''work hard, no reward'' kind of worker who is constantly struggling and must sacrifice how own desires for the good of his home. Whether it's keeping the Building and Loan alive or fighting off Potter from controlling Bedford Falls, Georgie Baily has always done what was best for the many in place of his own ambitions. With setback after setback in Geroge's life, Stewart portrays these struggles exceptionally well, sometimes even without speaking. This captivating story can be watched countless times and still hold it's weight. With everything coming full circle by the conclusion, the audience can really share in George Baily's emotional discontent and eventually, overwhelming joy in his life.10/10 for telling a beautiful story of life and teaching values everyone can appreciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is forever a classic due to it's holiday significance. That isn't the only reason it is a classic though, the movie begs the question all of us wonder and that is about our self worth. James Stewart creates phenomenal speeches just as he had in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and we get to feel his emotions first hand. It's a Wonderful Life contain such an inspiring story it makes it impossible not to look away. When a movie such as this can make you look into your own life and think about the others around you and inspires you to be the best you can be, there is no other greatness as big as that in film and that is exactly what this movie does. An absolute classic that will withstand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the film is a significant contribution to the cinema, the art of depicting an idea which is a reality. Really life is wonderful and this is what we find out to be the motive of this drama. more like a cinema version of stage drama this film is a must watch......not (just) to appreciate it but also to remind our self in the bad time of life that how important everything and every life is, including our self in this space-time fabric . Its like a discussion to the basic ancient concepts we find from Indian subcontinental region and also from the recent book by Rhonda Byrne "the secret". it tells you that you are ... it tells me that i am the center of this universe and at the same time it also shows the importance of being good. even a single random act of kindness will trigger the sequential chain of good things to happen with others .....and if we think over it this chain finally ends on our self</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest movie I have ever seen. I watch it admiringly. James Stewart is the best actor and his performance on that movie is brilliant!. Also I love Frank Capra's movie and I think Wonderful Life is the best one. I watch it about 5 or 6 times.Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst.Makes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film at any time of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is It's a Wonderful Life the greatest Christmas movie ever made, or the greatest film ever made, period? Certainly many people on the IMDb think so; although a strong contender for the former, I'm not sure about the latter. One is hesitant about pronouncing any film something that eclipses all others, because that means every film you watch thereafter will seem inferior somehow, and I love movies too much to be pigeonholed.The film's genesis is an interesting one; to my knowledge, It's a Wonderful Life is the only movie in history to originate from a Christmas card. Written by Philip Van Doren Stern, and originally titled The Greatest Gift, it told the story of George Bailey, and how his guardian angel Clarence shows him a glimpse of what life would be like if he had never been born. Stern shopped the story to various studios, and many of them turned their noses up at what sounded like such a frivolous idea for a movie.But when it fell into Frank Capra's hands, he loved it, and wanted it expanded into his first feature after World War II had put his directing career on hold. After selecting fellow war veteran James Stewart as his leading man, and a rather troubled production, It's a Wonderful Life got the go-ahead.But the film was met with indifference, where the public seemed to share in the studio heads distaste for the source material. It wound up forgotten about for several years, until the 1970s when copyright expired and the film landed in the hands of the public domain; suddenly It's a Wonderful Life was hailed as not only a Christmas classic, but a shining icon of cinema itself.What is it about It's a Wonderful Life that has earned it that distinction? When reading other reviews on various sites, one thing that doesn't come through about the film is how little of Christmas there is in it. The framework Capra was working from only took up the last half-hour of the movie; nearly everything before that isn't even set at Christmas. It's a long road that we're on before we even get to George on that frigid bridge, considering suicide on that dark and snowy Christmas night.Frank Capra takes his time with the story, investing plenty of development in the character of George Bailey. George has lived his whole life in the town of Bedford Falls; he has lofty ambitions that take him far, far away from this place, but he's forever having to make sacrifices for others.Although he puts on a brave face while giving up his dreams of travelling the world and a college education, secretly a frustration burns deeply within George. He has to take over the Bailey Building &amp; Loan, a job he really has no love for, and he watches friends and family go off and live their dreams and even become war heroes in the case of his brother, while he feels trapped in Bedford Falls.This type of story could easily become saccharine in the hands of a lesser director, but Frank Capra's skillful direction makes sure the film avoids all of the obvious pitfalls (something the film's imitators often fall into). If George had taken each setback with a smile and a kind word, that is unrealistic, and I'd agree the film is worthy of the term Capra-corn that It's a Wonderful Life coined. In fact this is a dark, relentlessly harsh Christmas film. Just look at George's face fall when he knows he must take over the BB&amp;L to thwart the ambitions of the town miser Mr Potter, or when he forces a smile at the news that his brother Harry has gotten married and accepted a job offer, meaning the burden of responsibility over the future of the BB&amp;L now rests in George's hands.James Stewart was never better as George Bailey; as his life snowballs into an avalanche of misfortunes, he handles the increasingly depressing situation perfectly; even he believed this was his finest role. But equally good, if not better, is the film's villain, the heartless and chilling miser Mr Potter, played to perfection by Lionel Barrymore.Potter makes Ebeneezer Scrooge seem a wimp; this is a man with no redeeming qualities, none whatsoever. He leans on the town of Bedford Falls like the Devil atop of Bald Mountain; he has no respect for the people who live there, and crushes anyone who dares challenge him, with George his favourite victim. He delights in seeing George's ambitions come to nothing, and vindictively pockets money that if not recovered, will bankrupt the BB&amp;L and ruin George. He doesn't even get any kind of comeuppance; Potter is one of cinema's most chilling villains.The final 30 minutes is where It's a Wonderful Life becomes ever more wondrous, and is the film at its blackest. George's failures have finally bested him, but just as he's about to end it all, Clarence Odbody, his guardian angel falls to Earth and shows him what Bedford Falls would be like without him. The town becomes a dark, twisted shadow of its other self, with Potter as its king and the people as his subjects. It's the film's darkest chapter, and a stunningly nihilistic vision of how things might have been.The fact that things end on a happy note is never in doubt of course, but those who say seeing the townspeople come to George's rescue is Capra giving in to the soppy stuff before the end missed the point. After such a thoroughly miserable ordeal, George deserves his happy ending, and truly earns his redemption, like all the great film heroes. It's a Wonderful Life is often thought of as an upbeat, sentimental Christmas fable. What utter tosh! This is a film that takes us on a journey fraught with raw emotion, and rightfully earns a hallowed place in the Christmas pantheon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra produced a quartet of timeless films that managed to combine a heartwarming sentimentality with hard edged social commentary. "It's A Wonderful Life," which was initially a box office disappointment, is his masterpiece. In my view, it also represents the apex of cinema, the finest achievement in the history of motion pictures. The irresistible plot borrows heavily from Dickens' "A Christmas Carol," but manages to put a unique twist on it; instead of Ebeneezer Scrooge being reminded by the spirit world of just how horrible a person he's been, George Bailey is reminded by the spirit world that he has touched the lives of countless people, and that the world would be a horrible place without him. James Stewart is perfect as Bailey, somehow 'aging' throughout the film, beginning as a believable college aged man even though he was thirty eight years old at the time of filming. Donna Reed is lovely, and the rest of the cast is filled with the type of character actors Capra's films were noted for. There is an interesting cameo from Carl "Alfalfa" Swtizer, grown from his "Our Gang" days into a gangly, rather homely teenager, whose prank sets off the unforgettable scene where Stewart and Reed Charleston their way into a swimming pool. "It's A Wonderful Life" is that rare film that never gets old, never ages. The viewer can jump in at any point in the movie, and feel satisfied. The movie used to be played repeatedly by numerous channels during the holiday season, but in recent years copyright issues have reduced air time to only one or two broadcasts by NBC. Everything about this movie is first rate. The dialogue can be, and should be, quoted endlessly; it is filled with Capra's trademark pro- little guy populism. The final scene, where the cast sings first "Hark The Herald Angels Sing," followed by "Auld Lang Syne," never fails to bring a tear to my eye, from the moment younger brother Harry Bailey proposes a toast, "To my big brother George, the richest man in town." Capra's movies always inspired, but this one is in a class of its own. To watch James Stewart, cradling little Zuzu in his arms, while his friends and neighbors shower him with money and affection, is to understand how powerful this medium can be, and how in the hands of a truly good soul like Capra's, that message can be positive and uplifting. The lesson everyone should take away from this film is: "It IS A Wonderful Life."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want to live again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the greatest Christmas movie ever made, and one of the greatest movies ever made. It is not Christmas until my family and I watch this. It in cases every meaning of Christmas but can, and should, be watched all year long. When I was little I thought this movie was just boring and long but now I see that the movie takes it's time so as to develop George Bailey. From the very beginning we see George (James Stewart, in a wonderful performance) saving his brother from the frozen pond and his boss from overdosing a woman. We actually care about him and feel bad when others take advantage of his kindness (his brother in particular. This doesn't happen in today's movies a lot.In the end, after George wishes that he was never born, he sees that every man touches the lives of countless others. One of the best lines in the movie is when he begs for his life back and cries out "I want to live again". Such a simple line gets me every time. If you have never seen this movie you may have seen a TV show that has used this story line:man gets down on his luck, worth more dead than alive and wishes he was never born and then sees how bad live would be if he never was born. This movie will make you see the good in man and the evil that tries to bring us down. Just watch and see just how wonderful life is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no film quite as fantastic as 'It's a Wonderful Life'. A beautiful script from Goodrich/Hackett and of course Frank Capra, the magician. The person who turned Phillip Van Doren Stern's short story 'The Greatest Gift' into a masterpiece. And of course lets not forget Jo Swerling for the additional scenes that made the movie an American classic. Acting was another grand part of the story. Full of great actors such as Ward Bond, Todd Karns, W.B. Warner, Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame, Frank Faylen and Frank Alberson. But the performances from James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore and Henry Travers were Oscar bound and unforgettable. Even if 'IAWL' didn't win any Oscars, it is still the most powerful and most celebrated movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I last cried so much with joy after watching a film. The last minutes of It's a Wonderful Life are so beautiful and heart-melting that you'll probably want to stand up and clap! At least I did. I can't think of any flaw in this film. The acting is perfect, and James Stewart and Donna Reed shine out with their own light. The script is funny, witty and sometimes even sad. But what's most important about this film is its message; that life is often hard, but always beautiful, and something you should never give up on. Definitely, this movie is a classic that should be celebrated for the years to come. No matter if you're an adult or a child, you'll enjoy it.10/10.</fullReview>

The evolution of George Bailey - from a compassionate youth, to a bitter and broken man that cannot see any end to a dark and foreboding tunnel, is both subtle and thoroughly real. There are very few people who cannot relate to that kind of despair, and his return-trip to salvation never fails to be uplifting.Fantastic film.</fullReview>

While I don't know exactly how, I think more could have been added.I didn't like the temper of the main character. I feel the movie could have benefit if the main character was a bit more likable. I found him to be easily angered and temperamental. While I do see they were trying to draw a contrast to him from before the angel and after, I think that if they made him more likable throughout the movie, you would have felt more sympathy and happiness for him in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic film opens with the voices of various people praying for George Bailey; it is clear that their prayers will be answered when voices in the heavens discuss how to help him. Angel Clarence will be assigned to save George but first Clarence, and the audience, must see how George came to be considering suicide. As a child George Bailey dreamt of getting out of the small town of Bedford Falls; he wanted to see the world, get an education then make his mark on the world. It wasn't to be though; he constantly sacrifices his dreams to help others. This leaves him stuck in the town running the savings and loan company that his father ran. It isn't a job he wanted but he does it anyway giving loans to people nobody else will help. This makes him popular with everybody apart from the miserly Mr. Potter who doesn't like to see the people who were paying him to rent slums buying their own houses. The years pass and George gets married and has children; he isn't rich but he is content; then one day Potter gets the opportunity to ruin George; thinking the only way he can help his family is to kill himself for the insurance we get to the point the film started. As he hits the depth of despair Clarence appears in his life and showed him just what the town would have been like if George had never been born; a miserably place full of bitter people lorded over by the odious Potter. When George returns he understands what good friends he has.I'd obviously heard of this film a long time ago but had somehow never seen it until today. I knew the film was considered a classic and think James Stewart was a fine actor so I had to watch it when it was on television. Now that I have seen it I ban see why it is held in such high regard. I was a little put off by the opening but once we started seeing George's life from the time he saved his brother's life when he was twelve till the very end I was engrossed. Stewart did a great job as George; the man destined to miss out on his dream each time it looked as though it would come true... even the moment he was about to go away on his honeymoon was ruined meaning he couldn't go. It isn't all disappointment though; there are many joyful scenes as George helps various people and falls in love and then marries Mary Hatch. By the end it is likely that the viewer will have shed tears of both sorrow and joy. If you haven't seen it yet watch it the next chance you get and if you have seen it I'm sure you don't need anybody else to tell you how good it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fabulous ode to life, love and solidarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fabulous ode to life, love and solidarity.It is one of the most beautiful Christmas stories, although not exactly about Christmas. It is about how real miracles happen in our daily life. It shows us how to live life in happiness, love and solidarity.In a small town in the United States, George Bailey, a man who tried all his life to be fair, honest, caring and good, has reached the limit of its mental, physical and financial strengths. It's right on the verge of losing everything he has and leave his family destitute unless a miracle happens this Christmas. But as George does not believe in miracles, he decides to commit suicide by throwing himself to the icy river. When he is about to jump he is prevented from doing so by a stranger named Clarence, actually an angel trying to earn his wings. He will prove to George, who wished never to exist, the importance of his life and show him the nightmare that his city could have turned if he had not existed.Technically it is a bit poor, with bad cuts inside same scenes, but we must care that this is a 1946 movie and this doesn't takes down the 10/10 rating I gave. A remake of this movie should be made in order to update such a remarkable story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about 'It's a Wonderful Life'. I have just watched the film this evening on Christmas Eve 2012, and every time I watch the movie, it just gets more powerful and grander each year. The film is on top of thousands of peoples lists around the world as the greatest film ever made. It is definitely my favourite film. I am seventeen years old, and you would think the magic of 'It's a Wonderful Life' would die out in the older generations, but no, it gets more magical through every generation that comes.Have you ever herd the expression, "They don't make films like that anymore." Well, the thing is, they don't. And really, there is never going to be anything in the whole history of motion pictures that will be greater than this masterpiece classic. The moral to this film is that no man is a failure who has friends (as written by Clarence inside the 'Tom Sawyer' book in the film).The film is brilliantly casted with exceptional roles from James Stewart (who should have won an Oscar for the role, never mind just getting a nomination), Donna Reed (the smart and beautiful actress who every man would love to be an ideal wife or mother), and Lionel Barrymore (for his exceptional role as the wicked Scrooge like character, Mr. Potter). The film was nominated for five Oscars without winning any, you can thank 'The Best Years of Our Lives' (1946) and the film critics for that. Really nowadays, you don't hear anyone talking about that film. A lot of films that are at the top of polls have never won an award anyway, like 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1992). Both 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'The Shawshank Redemption' topped a poll in the Empire magazine for the greatest film never to win an Oscar (IAWL came second). But gladly, the film did win a Golden Globe for Best Directing (Frank Capra) in 1947. So not all was lost.Overall, this film is a masterpiece and a classic, and for those people who have voted the film under seven, what are you thinking? 10 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a little shocked by the criticisms of the portrayal of George as being selfless amid so much opportunity. I'll admit that I'm nowhere near that level of dedication toward improving the lives of people in a community, but I've known several people of that caliber and have always been in awe of what they do. If you watch George at the very end and all you can think is that he short-changed himself in life, you're overdue for a thoracic stone removal. I, like many, have made "It's a Wonderful Life" a Christmas tradition. One of the bits of magic I appreciate more and more in movies is when the ending brings such a sweet atmosphere that stands as complete resolution to all the bleekness and despair that permeates the plot. In the end I have nothing but admiration and gratification for the character of George Bailey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves its 'Classic' label...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard many times that this is a classic Christmas film over the years but it has always evaded me, until now. I decided it was time I saw what all the fuss was about and took the plunge when it came up on the TV schedules recently. To be honest, it's better than what I was expecting, although still a little too saccharine in places for my taste. But I digress, here's a very brief summary before I give you more of my thoughts (summary haters please save that drowning angel while I write the next paragraph).George Bailey grew up in the small town of Bedford Falls. He has always wanted to leave and travel the world and find his fortune but the fates have always prevented his leaving. His father runs a local Building and Loan company with George's uncle Billy and when his father dies it is George that is chosen to carry on the business. His brother, Harry, who was supposed to take over when he left college, gets a better offer. Even when he gets married himself, to Mary, and they are about to leave on honeymoon, he is drawn back to the town. When a local businessman, Mr Potter, refuses him a loan after some money is lost, this is the last straw for George and he decides to take his own life, thinking he is worth more dead than alive. At this point an Angel (second class) called Clarence intervenes and shows George what life would be like if he had never existed, and I'm here to tell you it ain't pretty. Better not say any more, don't want to give the ending away.This is a very well made film, with excellent direction from Frank Capra and a tremendous performance from James Stewart as George Bailey. He really steals the show here and, not surprisingly, was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. Honourable mentions must also go to; Donna Reed as Mary Hatch, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy and Henry Travers as Clarence.As I said at the beginning, I found this film a little too saccharine in places, but it's still a great film and deserves its 'Classic' label. It is a very long film which mostly deals with events in George's life that lead up to his attempted suicide and it is all very well done. If you haven't seen it before I can highly recommend this film. I am not a religious man myself, but still enjoyed it.My score: 8.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie. It goes beyond the typical holiday special, and gives us something to think about. Rather than giving us that jolly feeling of Christmas through something visual or emotional this film gives it to us in more of a mental way. It makes us think about how important our lives really are, and that we should be glad to be alive. It makes us think about how we have changed the lives of people though we wouldn't realize it. It gives the mind a message that is received the brain and stays there. Yes it does give a heartwarming feel that I love, but I feel the main focus of the story was lesson it wanted to teach its watchers. They deliver that message stronger than any other film I have ever seen. You learn from this movie. This is really one of the best I have ever seen. The cast delivers wonderfully, the script is strong, the cinematography is excellent, and as I said the message it gives is genuine. I love this movie.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a wonderful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite movies. It took some time for me to get to the point of liking it so much though; the first time I watched it I thought it was o.k., but after subsequent viewings I now like it very much. I have always loved Jimmy Stewart's work, he's my favourite actor, so the fact that he's in it is a plus. The message of this film is that one man can make a difference, and that should never be forgotten by anyone; we all make a difference individually, but whether it's good or bad is up to us. Donna Reed is excellent as the dutiful, loving wife, and Lionel Barrymore is classic as the miserly, greedy opportunist. Henry Travers shines in his role as Clarence the guardian angel 2nd class, sent to pull George up by the bootstraps and make him see his place in the world of Bedford Falls. This is the movie which should be played every Christmas, as it engenders in the viewer the true spirit of Christmas: the joy of giving and investing in your fellow man. If you can get your hands on the behind-the-scenes extras' please do, as they contain very revealing interviews with both Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra. I only wish that they still made good quality movies like this nowadays. I give it a 9 because it's a B&amp;W; it would be great in colour, but either way 'It's a wonderful life' is indeed a wonderful family movie with a great message. Note: There is a coloured copy of this classic movie floating around, so you might like to grab it if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The truest meaning of Christmas....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's a Wonderful Life" epitomizes the true meaning of Christmas. Hope, understanding, forgiveness, friendship and sharing, all of the attributes we strive to achieve the whole year through, though somehow they manage to elude most of us. However, we come closest to being all the best we can be, at least once each and every year, at Christmas time. Frank Capra struck a chord, I would hope, in every cynic, miser, curmudgeon and Scrooge among us, when this film originally made its debut in 1946. The war was finally over, those who were lucky enough to be coming home were home, and the world was struggling to get back some semblance of the joy and peace in life, much the way things were in a prewar America. Although the innocence of that generation was gone forever, great movies like "It's a Wonderful Life" helped to restore some faith in mankind, as well as joy in some of the simple pleasures in life. Films like this one are milestones in history and a credit to humanity itself.There are a few films of this type that come to mind which epitomize the nature of the unselfish heart and giving spirit: "The Bishop's Wife", "Scrooge-A Christmas Carol, 1951", "The Bells of St Mary's", and "Going My Way" to name a few, there are others, but these along with this film sticks in my mind as being the paradigm of hope, generosity and the truest nature of the Christmas spirit. These films are precious, their stories immortal, their moral lessons invaluable, and the genius behind these films are, sadly, of a bygone era. Hollywood "broke-the-mold" with these productions offering us wholesome family fun, genuine entertainment bearing an endearing notion while teaching a valuable moral lesson. It is this type of film that truly makes the "Holidays" fun. Bravo! A perfect *10*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow how i enjoyed this! i really don't know how to start describing what i feel about this beautiful film but its just that i am in about the same point in my life as George Bailey is in most of 'its a wonderful life' so you probably understand why I'm so excited.not knowing exactly what i want to study and where and also having so many things i have to consider and so many things i have to decide if i wanna give up or keep, thats basically what is happening with the main character in this wonderful film...the story that is told to us is about the whole life of a guy that owns a heart of gold, throughout the movie were being told about his whole life since he was a child and until a point where he's considering about taking his own life away.i really don't want to say too much because i think it will just spoil the whole experience for a first time viewer after reading this.go watch this only knowing that it is a very old film that is considered to be very good, you will never expect a 1946 film to be made like this was made just as you will never expect it to be as enjoying as this is.i watched it by myself but i can really imagine that watching this with someone you love or someone close to you will make it so much better.it certainly deserves its spot on this site's top 250 list and i truly hope that more and more people will watch it so its recognition among top movies will be much higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not only the best feel good movie of ever, but my personal favorite movie of all time. The story of the movie is great, and the moral that goes along with it is excellent. The movie makes you feel as if you are a very important person, and it is one of the very few movies that can do that. It was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, and didn't win any, which is a little sad considering it is an absolutely fabulous movie. In this day and age when movies are all about sex, drugs, and alcohol, I know that I can watch this and feel a lot better about cinema, and also feel better about myself. The acting in this movie was so great and the characters were so cute, sweet, and lovable. But some of the characters were mean, but were still well acted. This movie is a great Christmas classic, and in my opinion it is so completely flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a wonderful life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Please note: this may contain a spoiler) This film epitomises what a good film should be - humoured, heartfelt, funny and touching. 'It's a wonderful life' is not only viewed as a classic but also lives up to the audiences' expectations - a truly satisfying experience.Never having previously experiencing Capra's work I chose to rent this film - arguably one of Capra's finest achievements.The film follows lovable character 'George Bailey' a man whose life is filled with love and friendship. Like many people, he does not always realise the great support and affection he holds with the people close to him. Bailey was an ambitious, determined child with hopes of building bridges and buildings, touring the world and seeing famous sights. Bailey's dreams come back to earth when his father suddenly dies and he is asked to fill his place.Slowly, Goerge builds a new life with his family (and of course..the girl!). They don't have much - for Bailey's heart is slightly over-sized and his business makes little profit but does much good for the citizens of his town. But things don't always go smoothly and when Bailey's uncle misplaces a large sum of money, they face severe financial crisis, as well as criminal.Bailey's life has apparently come crashing down around him..until he meets somebody - an angel to guide him on his way. The Angel shows Bailey what his life would have been like had he never been born. Bailey discovers unnerving things - his town is completely changed and nobody knows him - they shy away from him. His family doesn't exist and his wife is a lonely librarian..George Bailey's stark realisation - his life made great impacts on the people of the town..his brother didn't survive - because he wasn't there to save him. Bailey realises - his life impacts so many things - and if he wasn't there, everything would be different..much worse.This film is perfect - not too overpowering to watch and not too bland. Stewart's character shines as a lovable and sweet man - caring, sensitive and completely selfless. Capra's ingenious movie brings to light a very good topic - how one single person's life impacts the people he/she meets and knows...how everything can be so completely different - how fate and reality go hand in hand.The production is fantastic as is every other aspect of this picture - unique and memorable. Even in black and white! A must-see for all the family, for every film buff and cynic - children and adults alike - a truly memorable piece of cinema that will forever shine a true mastery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't really a Christmas movie, the story just takes place around Christmas. George Bailey has always wanted to be an explorer, but instead he lives in the same little town his whole life, marries his childhood sweetheart, and takes over his dad's savings and loan association, Now he is in danger of going bankrupt, through a mishap that is used to the advantage of the local evil codger and main competition to Bailey. Despondent, he decides to jump off a bridge and end it all.Enter Clarence, a student guardian angel who is trying to earn his wings. Saving George Bailey will get him those wings, if only he can show George how the world would have been had he never been born. He reveals the impact George has had on others -- even saving lives --- to prove he is not a failure and very much needed and loved.Keep an eye out for the grown-up Alfalfa (from the Little Rascals) as the jealous guy at the high-school dance who opens up the gym's swimming pool so the dancers fall in. It's priceless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Take (mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie and can watch it again and again. To me, this movie is intentionally bittersweet and ironic. George Bailey's life is, or isn't, wonderful, depending on how you look at it, or how he looks at it. I don't think the movie's purpose is a sappy homily about how George will never be poor so long as he has friends. I think it's more like Voltaire's "Candide". Life is difficult, and often unpleasant, and you have to work to make it worthwhile, but the rewards of life are not unattainable or small.I think "It's a Wonderful Life" makes a great companion to "Shenandoah", another James Stewart film, one which touches on the same theme from another perspective. "It's a Wonderful Life" is a happier film, and hence is easier to watch over and over, and it's one of the few holiday classics that really deserves repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still wonderful, 55 years on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many things to rave about in this wonderful classic movie: the competent direction, the detailed creation of a town on a 4-acre lot, the sheer amount of hard work, love and inventiveness that went into its conception and completion.I wish, however, to restrict my rave to the (previously unrecognised) dramatic abilities of the lead actor, James Stewart. If there's one reason to watch IAWL again and again and again (all the other wonderful factors notwithstanding), it's for the amazing performance Stewart turns in as George Bailey. The nuance and subtlety captured in the actor's performance is wonderful, just as the desperation he shows at the end of the film when he's running through Potterville looking for traces of his old life. Watching Stewart play college-age at the beginning of the film takes a little getting used to, but it's the end of the film that truly establishes him as one of the finest actors of his generation. His performance is an absolute marvel, and just as it's a crime that Cary Grant never received an Oscar for his amazing work, the fact that Stewart didn't win an Oscar for this shows how meaningless award ceremonies can be. A beautiful, heartwarming movie. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sidebar Point Or Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no need to echo the praise this film receives from seemingly everyone, but I've always been fascinated by its continuing, if not growing, appeal to modern audiences. The Bedford Falls of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has never existed and I think we all know that: it's sheer fantasy composed of equal portions of wish-fulfillment and nostalgia, but the type of fantasy that summons the better angels within us and ennobles us by lifting us out of the mundane and towards the ideal. Bedford Falls is childhood and innocence tucked away in the safe harbor of the past. Where this movie's immense power lies is in the Pottersville scenes...let's face it, Pottersville is what contemporary America IS. (Has anyone ever noted that while Bedford Falls is obviously a studio set, the camera pans through nightmarish Pottersville look like stock footage of any postwar American city?) That contrast, that emotional dichotomy, is what strikes such a chord within us: the idealized never-was vs the harsh, unforgiving can't-wish-it-away of grim reality. By the same token, the movie's true message - Bedford Falls is within reach of us all if we love our friends and family, stay the course despite setbacks, and treat others with kindness and respect - is even more seductive and affecting now than in 1946. It's little wonder this movie tanked on first release, as its peculiar magic needs to acquire antique status to reach its full power. I'm sure the first half of the film seemed as unbearably corny to postwar audiences as it now seems impossible to resist to audiences who are unceasingly bludgeoned with entertainment built upon callousness, carnality and levels of brutality once unthinkable. (Which is why the notion of a remake is utterly laughable: even younger audiences who don't 'get' old black &amp; white movies are intuitive enough to grasp that this kind of heartfelt sentiment properly belongs to a different America - the America contemporary Hollywood has taught them to despise.) Though everyone focuses on the well-known plot and a truly stunning performance by Jimmy Stewart, it's worth noting that this might be Capra's most superbly directed project. There's no exotica a la LOST HORIZON or showy MR SMITH filibusters on view; WONDERFUL LIFE is more introspective and mellow a film, Capra in a minor key. But every setpiece is staged and photographed expertly, and all the big payoffs resonate with honest and powerful emotion. The scene with young George Bailey and the drunken, grief-crazed druggist is as beautifully done as any in Capra's long career, and that's just the first of many high points here. Maybe the most satisfying aspect of the film is the inability of film critics to resist taking a shot at it: you keep reading over and over how IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a 'dark' film with a pessimistic view of middle-class aspirations, despite the fact that millions of viewers, year after year, watch it as a reaffirmation of those same values. And Frank Capra made movies for ordinary people, whom he loved, and not critics, whom he tolerated.</fullReview>

I could never imagine anyone else playing him, and a wonderful supporting cast backs him up beautifully.

		<fullReview>If you're one of those people who've never seen this movie -- you've GOT to. It's as simple as that. In fact, if I were limited to viewing 3 or 4 movies during my lifetime, and could somehow make an intelligent choice of which movies to choose, "It's A Wonderful Life" would be on that very short list.Even if you've seen it quite a few times, like I have, you can still find details you've previously missed. (Do you know what words Peter Bailey put in a plaque on the wall of the Building and Loan? Didn't think so!)I personally find this movie so important because of what it says about such things as: the meaning of a single individual's life; the potential of an ordinary person; getting the hard stuff in perspective, etc.Feel-good movie? Yes -- but darker moments are gripping as well; from the very beginning in which we hear (among other voices praying for a man named George Bailey) the desperate voice of his young daughter. There's a rather horrifying drugstore scene. Classic moments, however, include the touching and the funny as well, like the dance scene ("Hey, we must be pretty good!")Writing about it all makes me want to see this movie again. If you've never done so, I highly recommend making it next on your list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are multitudes of Christmas films that have been made. Some are only for kids, some are more serious, and some are simply classics. It's a Wonderful Life fits under the last category. Ever since I was a small child, I cant remember one Christmas where everyone didn't cuddle up under warm afghans and watched this movie. Jimmy Stuart gives his most brilliant performance in this movie. He does a very well job of portraying a man who's down on his luck at the beginning of the movie. I can hear the frustration in his voice when the stair banister breaks. But he not only plays this one shade of a man. He plays many more. He is the sweet father who watches over little sick ZuZu, but at the same time he is the man with too many troubling thoughts when he yells at his daughter Janey for practicing the piano too loud. Then again he shows his helpful side when his old friend comes back looking for money to head out to Hollywood and start a acting career. Although this story has vast differences, I find that it contains a hint of A Christmas Carol. The underlying story is still there. A man who is heading down the wrong path and is shown how he changed the world. If you haven't seen this movie before rent it in the middle of July for a little bit of the Christmas cheer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of the great stories of this century, we meet George Bailey, who in a desperate moment is shown how his life touches so many others. It is a story of a man who has given up money, adventure, and excitement in favor of integrity, loyalty, and sacrifice. It is a loving tribute to everyone who knows the value of making a house a home, and making a place a community. Jimmy Stewart, as George Bailey, is able to effortlessly give us such a man, but he is also able to give us a flawed hero who is at the end of his rope. It is when he sees what life would be like without him that he truly appreciates his "wonderful life." While this film was billed as a romance, and Donna Reed and Jimmy Stewart do not disappoint on that end, director Frank Capra is going for something deeper than romance. What he is aiming at, and succeeds like few have done before or since, is to demonstrate the value in placing people above money, integrity over opportunity, and sacrifice over adventure. While these values have been demonstrated in movies before, none have done so with Capra's poetry.</fullReview>

It is a Christmas tradition that will never die. I feel as though I've been transported to Framingham, Massachusetts where it felt like Bedford Falls in the early 70's as a kid. I guess I was about George Bailey's age when he saves his brother Harry from drowning in the pond. My Grandparents reminded me so much of Jimmy Stewart &amp; Donna Reed that I swore the movie was about us. I felt like I knew everyone in the entire movie from Nick the bartender to Clarence the angel who gets his wings! A fireplace forever warms my heart every cold December when I watch this incredible masterpiece. No matter where in the world I may be, it's home. The 20th Century is nearing it's end and with a new millennium approaching "It's A Wonderful Life" should reflect what was good about the last 100 years.

I think that part of it's enduring appeal is that all audiences young and old can relate to this movie, I introduced my daughter to it last christmas and I look forward to sitting down to watch it this year with my baby boy.O.K as you grow older you realise that some of the dialogue is perhaps a little corny but there can be no denying the strength of the acting, especially Stewart who in my opinion gives the performance of his life.Some scenes take your breath away especially the bridge scene when George Bailey begs for his life back when the harsh wind dies away and snow starts to fall again, pure brilliance!The ending always makes me fill up.I don't think a movie as good as this will be ever made again</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that has to be experienced to be appreciated. The names may be changed, the time periods, settings, situations and places may be different, but, this is the story of every person who thought they lost everything and were given a second chance to find it. Jimmy Stewart at his usual best. Donna Reed at her most lovely. Great acting all around, especially Barrymore at his most sinister. Although this usually appears at Christmas, this is more than just a Christmas classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lesser cast would flounder with this story, about a small-town man who suffers a setback and ponders ending it all on Christmas Eve. But Jimmy Stewart and friends make the tale truly uplifting rather than sappy. The rare kind of movie that can actually influence you years after you've seen it. Supporting cast provides great backdrop for Stewart. As good viewing the tenth time as it is the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a wonderful film too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the entries for 'Star Wars', 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'The Third Man', about everything that can be said about this one has been said already. I will say that it's a tremendously affecting film, even after seeing it every year for ages-it still delivers. Watch this one after watching, say, 'You Can't Take it With You' or 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town'-you'll see many of the same faces in the cast, and a similar magic working in them as well.Personally I have always enjoyed Sheldon Leonard (as the bar keeper) and Sam S. Hinds as the father, among many, many others. Of course, the ending where he gets help from the Halohead, and begs God for his life back, absolutely wrenches your guts to tears every time out; no one could deliver the goods like Capra, Reed and Stewart. A film too good to see just in December, by all means see it, watch it, enjoy it. They do Not make them like this anymore; for all I know, they don't know how.**** outta ****, as good as it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good movie builds up to the one great scene on the bridge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie feels just the same no matter when you watch it, but today it's viewed mainly as a Christmas movie. Still, no matter when you watch it, you can't help but like it and get something out of it, unless you have no heart at all or have an absolute, unshakeable hatred for movies like this. Throughout the movie, you think George Bailey's a nice guy (James Stewart was great in the role). You may get a little tired of the endless flashback scenes, but you'll undoubtedly not really be that bored, especially in the electrifying telephone scene with Donna Reed. Once the flashbacks are dispensed with, you feel sorry for George as he begins a sudden downhill descent. You hope (okay, you know) his lovable, bumbling guardian Angel Second Class will be able to talk sense into him by showing him what the world would be like had he not been born. And then it all comes down to the scene where he almost goes crazy, runs back to the bridge and begs God to let him live again. That is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever seen in movies; unless you're one of the above-mentioned people with no heart, there's no way you will be able to keep at least a couple of tears from falling. You will almost certainly be pulled into the scene, right alongside George, begging God to let him live, too. But if somehow you can prevent the tears from coming, then they'll immediatly come flowing when he runs back home rejoicing and yelling, "Hello, Bedford Falls!" Yeah, it is what's come to be called "Capracorn", but it's utterly genuine and very emotional. The mood is masterfully orchestrated by Capra and masterfully performed by Stewart. It's the most, well, wonderful way to close a movie.While that scene and the performance in it are the best things about the movie, that does not mean they're the only good things. Donna Reed makes a great companion with Stewart (witness that telephone scene), Henry Travers is a pleasent diversion as his guardian angel, and Lionel Barrymore is wonderfully wicked as the devious Mr. Potter. The whole film is pretty well-done. Even though everything seems happy, you still do get a little sad knowing George gave up everything. There is a dark edge to this film, especially when he contemplates suicide. Nothing happy there at all, but still well-performed and genuinely sympathy-provoking. While it may be at its best when viewed at Christmas, it's just as good any time of the year and should have a lot of meaning, especially to a depressed or bereaved person. It's just as wonderful as you've heard, honestly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's a wonderful life" is one of those movies that is so good that it has the same effect on you even if you watch a million times. The story is brilliant and at the same time it is somewhat simple, James Stewart's performance is probably his best, and Capra's directing is excellent as well. Beginning with God talking to one of his angels telling him that George Bailey (Stewart) wants to kill himself, the movie never drags. You then see Bailey's life and how he married Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and why he now wants to kill himself. But when George's archangel is sent on Earth and meets with Bailey, the movie is at its best. Keeping it simple all along, Capra made his best movie ever when he did "It's a wonderful life". It must not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love today's movies and today's actors. But if I were to name my favorite movie of all time, I would have to go back to more than 50 years ago to a film called "It's a Wonderful Life". This movie has become a holiday classic, but it's much more. A movie that makes us realize the value of life, family and friends transcends any season. This film could have come off as overly sentimental had it not been for the superb acting of what I believe is the best actor of all time, namely Jimmy Stewart. His performance, along with a brilliant Donna Reed, makes this a film for all ages and all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To my utter dismay and disbelief, I recently discovered that a friend from work hated this movie.This friend, whom we will call "Jean", says she saw it for the first time recently and absolutely hated it. "What a crappy movie" or something to that effect.Not that it's important how old Jean is, but let's just say she's had ample opportunities to view the film in previous years, and by her own account she feels her parents had the good taste to protect her from this film.I can only react in shock as one of my most beloved film experiences is torn asunder in such a harsh way. But perhaps I'm blindsided by the tradition of the film, with it being a staple for Christmas fare. Maybe I'm being merely nostalgic. Maybe I can't see it for what it is.I tell you something dear friends, I hated Christmas this year.It seemed to be one obligation after another that nearly stamped out any Christmas cheer I could usually muster with the greatest of ease. My beloved wife and I were busier than ever before and didn't even find the time to put up a Christmas tree, much less enjoy "It's A Wonderful Life".You know something, I think it's because we didn't take the time to enjoy the finer points of Christmas, and part of that is Frank Capra's delightful film, which I've just acquired on DVD and plan to watch just as soon as I'm able, despite my hectic schedule.I don't know if Jean will ever give this film another chance or not, I hope she does. Because nothing on film can compare to the touching scene at the end, where George Bailey discovers just what kind of an impact he's had on the lives of the friends around him. Just try to fight those tears, but it won't make you feel any less choked up, no matter how many times you see it, whether you start at the end or not, it doesn't matter. C'mon Jean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a wonderful life is a magical piece of film-making that has entertained and inspired several generations. While it is easy to be critical of technical and creative aspects of the film., anyone who thinks this is less than a classic can only be seen as a cynic and totally devoid of any heart. The inability to appreciate the warmth and heart on display here is sadly a reflection on a persons bitterness about life in general and a need to drag down anything that smacks of "sentimentality".As a person who chose a career in film and has studied film history I stand proudly on this movie as a genuine classic. Of course this film is subject any analysis. It can even be rated a B-, but to rate it anything less than a 7 out of ten speaks volumes about the critic's lack of any true feeling for the emotion of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big-Box Swindle of Bedford Falls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many, "It's A Wonderful Life" is a staple to their holiday traditions. With all major networks vying to get their hands on this mediocre blockbuster, this little film transforms from ordinary to cult status every holiday. As a viewer, outside of the final act, this Jimmy Stewart classic is more than just a Christmas movie, but instead a powerful Capra film that demonstrates an America from long ago. It shows a small-town America, without the plowed Wal-Mart roads or big-box makeovers. For this critic, it demonstrates the power of independent business, and why we may never find this type of service ever again. As an independent, downtown shop owner of about a year and a half myself; "It's A Wonderful Life" transformed this viewing from holiday pastime to dedicated film exposing the corruptive nature of capitalism as well as the realism of independent business. With this change in tact, Jimmy Stewart's words become more emotional, Donna Reed's actions become more honest, and our little Christmas film transforms into a man's journey to search for himself. I cannot denounce that this is a holiday film, Stewart screams "Merry Christmas" throughout the entire ending, but before that final conclusion there are about two hours of small town America and one man's struggle to escape. "It's A Wonderful Life" is a powerful blend of realism and fantasy, individualism and community, dreams and truth, as well as frustration and joy. The cast is superbly placed in their respective roles and Capra's action behind the camera stands boldly in place. This is not just a movie, but an experience coupled with foreshadowing ? giving George not just a glimpse of a world without him ? but also a glimpse of a world without small business "It's A Wonderful Life", the film itself, is beautifully crafted. With new editions being released each season, one can easily see the crisp beauty of Capra's image. Its characters; George Bailey, Mary, Sam Wainright, Potter, Bert and Ernie, and even Clarence seem to jump from the screen, giving us imaginative citizens to this quaint town of Bedford Falls. Capra not only gives these characters spirits and souls, but also the town. Capra built three blocks of Bedford Falls so that he could capture the honesty of the town that Stewart so adamantly wanted to leave ? and upon doing this gave this little town a soul of its own. Watching this film, Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey runs the gambit of powerhouse acting. Stewart, freshly back from the war, was worried if he could carry the weight of Bailey's cynicism. His ability to care for Bedford Falls, while always dreaming of wanting to escape could only be portrayed through Stewart's Americana eyes. When he screams at Mary, denouncing his desire to be on the ground floor in plastics, or when he yells at Potter's bid to join him ? we scream with him. This film works from an acting standpoint because we believe in the characters ? we trust the actors to give us a slice of their souls for these roles ? and they do. One cannot fault anyone in this film for their acting and that is a rarity in today's Hollywood.Capra's eye in this film seems far more advanced than the credit he has received. His enormous sets, the birth of a new "snow", and his ability to create a world we care for without having to travel the globe. What I enjoy about "It's A Wonderful Life" is that Capra tricks you by the end. Here we believe, outside of the brief opening, that this is just your typical drama, a man's life is shown in scope so that he can see his full worth, but then sneakily Capra brings in (depending on your religious basis) a huge science-fiction element that was unheard of during the time. One cannot argue the validity of science fiction vs. religion in this film ? since Joseph is portrayed by the stars and planets. Sure, Clarence was an angel, but there is this aura of the supernatural. Clarence offers no evidence that he is, in fact, sent by the man upstairs, so one has to question the time this film was released, the faith in spirituality, and the fact that Capra's Clarence could be alien, vegetable, or mineral.Overall, "It's A Wonderful Life" remains in constant rotation no matter the time of year in my home. The acting is superb, the sci-fi element seems fresh every time, and the growing fact that George Bailey is pro-independent business means quite a bit in this rushed Wal-Mart world. Bailey, and this film, is the voice for the little man, the quiet shopkeeper who doesn't want to sell to Potter, but instead dreams of keeping their home-style values. The spark between Potter and Bailey can be seen in every facet of today's growing world, as the rich continue to get richer ? the less fortunate work harder and feel more held back. Dreams are traded for jobs ? communities are strengthened by friendships. This film is a time capsule for the future, as we discover convenience overcomes customer service; it is nice to look back and see a world like Bedford Falls. The science fiction element to this film, yep ? that is what I am considering it ? comes in sharp and remains powerful throughout. Did anyone else see Jimmy Stewart's eyes throughout those scenes? Brilliant! While this film will remain a staple through the holidays, I persist that you watch it away from the holiday to see the real message behind the film. Capra was a genius in creating this film, and subsequently crafted a cult film that will remain forever. Even today, nearly thirty years since my first viewing, I am more impressed that ever. It is a film that grows with you, and that is quite a rarity in today's cinema.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

When he almost ordered us all to watch it on Christmas Eve, i wasn't expecting to be amazed. By the end of the movie, when all his friends and family come together to help him, the tears came flooding thick and fast. I think it is a sad thing that I'm only 16 and that seeing such brotherly love between him and people who barely knew him was so strange to me. I cried not only for the happy ending, but for the fact that this movie, made less than 70 years ago and that the world it shows no longer exists. From now on, every year on Christmas Eve, that movie will be brought down from the shelf, because i think it is an important and thoroughly enjoyable film with an amazing moral: Everyone will get their Just Desserts one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uplifting holiday favorite praises value of an ordinary life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's indeed a wonderful movie, an old black and white classic that tells the story of an ordinary man whose unheralded life makes such a difference to his small town. This man feels that he has wasted his life, but a dramatic turn of events convinces him just how significant he has been, not only to his own family but also to so many of the town's inhabitants.The film chronicles the life of George Bailey, who, upon the untimely death of his father, forsakes his dreams of traveling to remain in his hometown of Bedford Falls and take over the helm of the family business. George is not really content, but marries a nice, pretty local girl, embarks upon raising a family, and becomes a respected community member, especially when he refuses to sell out to the local bigwig, a rich miser named Potter, who is willing to do anything to enable a takeover. Disaster befalls George's business and he despairs, contemplating suicide. This situation calls for dramatic intervention by a particularly endearing angel...What an inspiring theme and so well captured. The value of an ordinary life lived with decency and integrity is portrayed with quiet brilliance by that very decent actor, much respected himself, James Stewart. He masterfully conveys George's joys, sorrows, regrets, sacrifices, frustrations, all the aspects of everyday life...and that is what makes this film the classic it is. That scene where George is irritated and snippy with his young daughter, who is proudly and diligently plonking out her recital piece on the piano, what parent can't identify with that type of normal and later regretted frustration? Donna Reed is also wonderful, both as the lovely sweetheart and later the seemingly ordinary but moral wife who supports George and helps raise their four children. It is a timeless piece of cinema that our hearts can turn to any time for inspiration, but especially at Christmas when people tend to look for the important truths in life. It's a traditional holiday favorite with many, including myself. You just glow all warm inside like a cozy fire every time you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is just a note to other commenters out there who have the experience and authority to contact IMDb on items such as deaths. The IMDb shows that actress Argentina Brunetti passed away on 20 November 2005. MSN is showing that she passed away on 20 December 2005. I'm sure it is a typo and may have already been corrected. However, I could not contact IMDb to advise them of this because (as they indicated) I am not "qualified" to comment on deaths. So, perhaps one of you viewers can pass the word on to them. I only am doing this because I noticed the discrepancy and I am really trying to be helpful. However, the IMDb people have imposed some restrictions pertaining to what can be said and just how many words and lines of type can be used to communicate with them. By the way, the movie is as good now as it was almost 60 years ago. Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artful and Chance-Taking Film; Powerful and Well-Acted; Capra's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's a Wonderful Life"'s storyline stamps it a socialist-Catholic European confrontation between the despised peasant class and their feudal overlords. The additional character to this class warfare, the first of a huge series of downtrodden against the uncaring films, is George Bailey. What stamps him as a democrat are two things--he does not define anything; and he wants to help those "in need"--even though what he actually does as director of a savings and loan is to invest in people he believes in--not for huge financial gain but to affect people's lives positively in the belief that a strong Bedford Falls citizenry living decently will enrich his life in the town and those of all his fellow citizens. His rival in the film, old man Potter, despises the poor and middle class and wants to keep them downtrodden and coming to him as infallible leader, to beg. The other amazing feature of the film is its flashback nature--2/3 of the film dramatizes Bailey's history; only in the last third do we see--through the bumbling agency of Clarence, George's guardian angel sent to help him on Earth--how important George's life had been to those touched by it. This was due to his work as much as to his nature; but I fnd this a difficult, jarring and very effective use of fantasy, especially in such an early film. How George got into trouble is a plot detail; he needs money, and despairs of finding it--leading to the sending of Clarence by the angel's bosses upstairs, whose voices are supplied by Moroni Olsen and Joseph Kearns. The film seems artistic to me from start to finish; its USerized and chance-taking script is also focused, purposeful and frequently very moving. Music by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Joseph Biroc and Joseph Walker complement Frank Capra's very sure direction, in my opinion. The story, adapted from Philip Van Doren Stern's "The Greatest Gift' was written for the screen by Frances Hackett and Albert Goodrich, with additions by director Capra, dialogue by Jo Swerling and Michael Wilson. Art Direction was by Jack Okey, with set decorations by Emile Kuri, costumes by Edward Stevenson. Familiar faces in the minor parts include Marian Carr, Ellen Corby, Almira Sessions, Stanley Andrews, Charles Lane, Sarah Edwards, William Edmunds, Argentina Brunetti, Sheldon Leonard, Mary Treen and Beulah Bondi and Samuel S. Hinds as George's parents. Other showing well include Lionel Barrymore as Potter, Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, H.B. Warner, Ward Bond, Frank Faylen, Donna Reed, Henry Travers as Clarence and Lillian Randolph as the family's black maid. The film belongs to Jimmy Stewart, however; he is always interesting in the film and is given a wide variety of moods and challenges in the piece, from rage to surprise, to persuasion to sympathy to bitter complaint. Apart from the gaps in logic noted, the film has been given a powerful plot line, good acting and a contexted set of scenes that are frequently honest and always well-considered, in my view. Not to be missed nor overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Film, The Best Christmas Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of George Bailey. But, who is he? He's a man from Bedford Falls, grew up there as a boy, took over the family business in his twenties, and fell in love there too, to Mary. Yes, it was a wonderful life, but what would happen if he had never been born? Well, that's where Clarence comes in. He's the angel sent to show George that his life has meant something to people, a lot of them, in fact. If not for George, Harry would have drown at the age of nine, and therefore, would not have been there to save men in World War II.So you see, not being born changed many peoples lives in Bedford Falls, including his family. Uncle Billy was sent to a psychiatric hospital, and his mother was unable to trust a stranger. And of course, not being born changed Bedford Falls too. It was known as Pottersville in this alternate universe, where Henry Potter was more rich and more corrupt, and owned the town. Now you know why Clarence had to jump into the river after George to save his life, and why George had to jump in to save Clarence. Without George, what else could have possibly happened? Bedford Falls may have been in ruins. George learned his lesson, and hopefully Mr. Potter would learn his too, for stealing the Bailey's money. This is a great story, but "don't take my word for it." Go watch this brilliant classic. It is worth the time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly one of the finest films ever made. It's message still resonates after nearly 60 years. It's central themes of love, appreciation, loyalty, and sacrifice are valuable reminders any time of year. I saw this film for the first time when I was about 8 years old and even then could understand why it had become a tradition in many households at Christmastime. Like many other Christmas-themed films, this one reminds us to pause and take in our surroundings. It is unfortunate that such films are only celebrated once a year, but that particular trait also adds a certain degree of rarity to its charm. The characters are well-developed and whether loved or hated, each plays a vital role in the film, as in George Bailey's life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie with my mother when I was six years old, and have loved it ever since. I am a fan of Jimmy Stewart, and his performance in this was wonderful. It begins when he is a young boy, and progresses as he grows into a man, gets married, and has a family. Then he gets into 'trouble.' In the beginning of the movie, you here all of the people who are close to him praying for him, and the angels talking about him, then you learn why near the end of the movie. This movie is a wonderful and memorable Christmas classic, and in the summer I can hardly wait for Christmastime so my mother will let me watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this film every year without fail, and I cannot watch the end without crying. AFI says Citizen Kane is the greatest movie, but it takes someone in film school to explain the techniques that make Citizen Kane great. The greatest movie should be one that anyone can see and realize that it's beyond a regular movie. This film is the greatest work of an amazing director and transcends all other films. I've heard people say it's depressing, but what movie is less depressing (as a whole) than this? There are times, yes, that are necessarily very strikingly sad, but it shows how little by little one can forget the plethora of blessings of which a modern life is composed. The entire idea of a value of a life was changed by this film, and I heartily recommend it for anyone who has missed out on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is more than about a young man, who like many young persons, are forced into their parents business. It is about the historic times he grew up in. That may be why it appeals to so many, especially older Americans who lived through the depression, bank failures and World War II. The idea of leaving the small town and getting out into the big world is one of all youths dreams. The character George Bailey doesn't want to remain tied down to his small city roots, but wants to explore the world and go to college. Fate however, draws George a terrible blow, with the death of his father. He decides to forfeit his dreams in order to help others. He marries a local town girl, has kids, sends his younger brother off to college in his place, confronts the local big money boss and fights the battle of small town America during WWII. True, in the end he is helped by a prayer, but wasn't that the thing most Americans were doing during those tremulous times. Every person should be granted the wish that was given to George, all our lives would be much richer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My ex would coin the term. Timeless she would call it. Yes, I would have to agree with her on this one. I'm jaded, however, being so much older than when I first saw the film with wide-eyed wonder. But you have to look at the film from non-jaded eyes, from the perspective of freshness, and just observe the IDEAS as they are presented to you in the story, in the pictures, in the details. Yes, it's GEORGE's story, but it's REALLY everyman's story, and that's why my ex's idea of timelessness keeps coming back, every time I watch It's A Wonderful Life. Capra's themes come back to haunt us, much like the haunting play Our Town, where the young dead wife gets a chance to re-live one day, one easy day in the life of a 12-year old. Here, we see what life would be like without George. We all suffer our own existence, yet like George with his own personal angel, we all have our little angels ringing bells reminding us that we have purpose in our suffering. In It's a Wonderful Life, we get to see that George's simple purpose, in his small town Savings and Loan, is a kind of microcosm of the greater good, a greater good that is possible in all of mankind. This greater good and George's discovery of that greater good in himself is why the film is timeless. It's because we wonder if we have the potential to find that greater good in ourselves. Of course, then we step on the cat, or open the wrong end of the popcorn, spilling it all over the rug...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can One Man Really Make a Difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said about its A Wonderful Life that hasn't already been printed a thousand times? I don't know why but it took me years to get around to seeing this film but finally I decided to give it a go, and how much have I missed out! The central character in the film is George Bailey (played masterfully by James Stewart) a small time dreamer who has lost his way after a lifetime of disappointment. We follow George through the eyes of his guardian angel Clarence from childhood right up to the point where he has to make his most important decision while stood on the edge of a bridge.Copra has forged a gem in celluloid, he has been smart enough to pull the sob strings with the audience but never too much so as to go into farce or seem phoney. The film is by no means a masterpiece in terms of cinematography or musical score although these are executed to a good standard. Copra captures the close nit community spirit of the small town superbly, and focus throughout on the 'David versus Goliath' relationship between George and Mr Potter excellently.The stars of this film are most certainly Jimmy Stewart and the story itself. Never have I warmed so much to central character, George Bailey is without doubt one of the most lovable screen figures ever written. I really enjoyed the performances of the supporting actors in the film mainly Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter and Henry Travers as Clarence Oddbody, Donna Reed also puts in accomplished performance as George's wife Mary as do the films child actors.It's a wonderful life is a charming heartfelt film which can be enjoyed all year round but with special meaning at Christmas time, and sparks the question 'can one man's life really make a difference?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's A Wonderful Life tells the story of George Bailey, an honest, hard-working resident of Bedford Falls who dreams of seeing the world. We learn in flashback how circumstance and his own good heart have prevented him from pursuing his dream until one Christmas Eve, when a dark night of the soul pushes George to the brink of suicide and he is saved by divine intervention. George gets the chance to see what life would be like in Bedford Falls if he had never been born and realizes the true importance of his life.It would be easy for people to miss the true meaning of It's A Wonderful Life and dismiss the film as sentimental nonsense due to the corny opening scene and the appearance of a supernatural angel. However, it is hard to think of another film that examines the overwhelming complexity of one individual's life so deeply or questions how our choices affect the lives of others.It's A Wonderful Life contains some of the most unforgettable moments in cinema. Once George is redeemed, we are treated to a moment of life-affirming splendor which suddenly lifts the spirits of the viewer after the relentless darkness and gloom that has preceded. The snow-storm that only hours earlier mirrored the bleakness of George's situation has now converted Bedford Falls into a winter-wonderland as George races through its streets with a renewed joy for life and all its miraculous beauty.I don't think I will ever tire of seeing the truly heartwarming final scene in which George finally learns his reward for the sacrifices he has made in life. The best line of the film comes when Harry returns early and offers a toast (`?to my big brother George - the richest man in Bedford Falls') recognizing the real treasure of the friends George has rather than the superficial treasure of material wealth. An impromptu and communal singing of `Auld Lang Syne' then swells into a euphoric crescendo to close the most perfectly crafted film ever committed to celluloid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just an absolute joy to watch. I will not deny it, I shed a few tears at the end every time, something no other film has ever managed.The acting is superb and the story, although dark and foreboding at times, is perfect. True, the Heaven scene effects at the beginning are lame, which is a real shame, but they certainly do not spoil the movie. Frank Capra has created a movie that tugs at all your emotions without even trying. One cannot help feeling anger when life doesn't happen the way George Bailey expects it to, or elation when life does. No-one else could have portrayed George Bailey quite like the late, great James Stewart - perfect casting. And, as for the rest of the characters, one couldn't want for anything more. Marvelous. Lionel Barrymore even manages to out-scrooge Scrooge (which is surely no mean feat!) as Mr Potter.Overall, this is a film to watch over and over again. Full of mixed emotions throughout and beautifully heartwarming at the end. The Greatest Movie of All Time.A true masterpiece sprinkled with magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? The values of "It's A Wonderful Life" still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!In this film James Stewart acts so naturally you forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. "It's a Wonderful Life" details the life of George Bailey, a man who put the needs and well being of others before his his whole life. Later in the film he feels he is a failure and is on the verge of suicide. He is taken by his guardian angel in need of his wings, Clarence (Henry Travers), who shows him just how important he has been. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film. Ultimately, it is perhaps the most emotionally moving film ever made, and it offers insight that everybody can use about what's important in our lives. To phrase a heavily used cliche, this is one of the few movies that gets better with every viewing, and never loses any of its power. And the icing on the cake is where, after George finds that he has his daughter Zuzu's petals in his coat and runs home to his family to find how much they love him, many of his friends come to his aid to help him in replacing the $8000 that went into Mr.Potter's hands before. This part of "It's A Wonderful Life" moves me to tears and can help many people look at their own lives in a new light,especially when one is in despair and feels that their life is worthless. 10/10</fullReview>

So when I saw the tail-end of It's A Wonderful Life I quite liked it and thought I'd give it the chance when it came on at Christmas a year later. By the end I could only say it was one of the finest feel-good movies ever, and one of the finest movies ever - period. It's a simple tail of a man called George who's reached his wits end with life and feels everything is going wrong. The story is told in flashback from the point of view of an angel, Clarence, who's been sent by God to make George realise certain things, and gives him the chance to see things from a different perspective. The story is extremely well-told, and the ending will have you cheering. It's heartwarming and was recently rated as one of the top 10 movies ever made. As rated by the whole of society and not just older people this shows the broad appeal. Your life is not complete if you haven't seen this.I challenge you not to have the tears welling up at the end.</fullReview>

The story of George's life (magnificently played by James Stewart) developed beautifully, as he met each situation with amazing courage and humility, putting others feelings before his, leading upto the wonderfully happy climax when all the people he's helped in the past come to his aid.Special mention for Donna Reed as Mary, I can only imagine at the time she was a huge star, as not only did she perform superbly throughout the movie, she had the most beautiful face I can ever recall. The combination of Reed &amp; Stewart were essential to this film feeling so warm, but the assorted cast all put in great roles too.What an absolutely beautiful story, not only at Christmas time, but all year round, and it makes you think how even the littlest thing you do can impact on many other people.I don't think i've cried as much over any movie ever as I did today, it was so emotional.Thank you Capra, Stewart, Reed, et al, you made my Christmas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the "light-hearted" or "corny" film that many who haven't seen it perceive it as. It is very introspective, dark cinema, that, while classified as "fantasy", shines when it revels in the real, everyday delights of family, friends, and kindness.There is no such thing as "CapraCorn". Capra was not a sugary sentimentalist. He was a great filmmaker who understood that life is beautiful, and just how precious the little moments that bind our existence together are.This wonderful film, which, in my opinion, rivals Citizen Kane and Vertigo as the greatest American films ever made, is the lasting testament to a great talent, and a gift we can open every Christmas and never get tired of playing with.</fullReview>

Each successive screening , I see something more , than thelast time I watched it. Reading Capra's book about its making, hephoned Jimmy Stewart, who was just back from the war, and triedto explain the plot outline. Stewart, who had already starred inseveral of Capra's films, interrupted him and agreed on the spot,to star in the film.Years later when asked, Stewart always said that?Wonderful Life' was his favourite film, and if it is good enough forhim, then it is good enough for me. One other story that I heard, isthat when asked if ?Wonderful Life' was the best film that he hasmade, Capra is said to have replied, that it is the best film thatanybody has made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Government Warning: This Film Could Seriously Damage Your Health</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's A Wonderful Life is one of the perennial Christmas favourites, a seasonal treat that has the admirable trait of being screened annually at British wintertime, along with the incongruous choices of 39 Steps and The Great Escape. Why the latter two should be used, without fail, to mark a time of religious significance has never been discovered, yet It's A Wonderful Life's winter-set, ultimate "feel good" atmospherics make this ideal for such a schedule-filling occasion. However, a warning should be issued to people that brave to see this film: it could end up making you feeling a lot, lot worse.When I first saw this film for the first time it was indeed the 25th of December and I had split with my girlfriend just three weeks previously. I had indulged in that bizarre male ritual of "purposely losing touch with all your friends when you meet a new girl" and no buses were running that year to my parents'. Bear with me, this is no idle backstory, but did in fact greatly effect my appreciation of this movie.Endearingly shot, it concerns, for those that don't know the famous story, George Bailey, a man on the verge of suicide. So far, so able to empathise. A wonderfully surreal opening gives us Angels that are the stars and constellations in the sky, looking over key moments in Baileys' life, like a kind of supernatural Citizen Kane. This is all carefully wrought and contains enough sense of (stylised) reality to keep it watchable. When George's guardian angel finally arrives, it is in the form of Clarence, a vulnerable angel who is so saccharine-coated and self-consciously loveable that he could have walked straight in from a Disney production. He gives us a glimpse of George's life as if he had never lived, and shows the influences he made, sort of like Quantum Leap forty years early. This segment of the film rapidly sees the invention start to dull somewhat and the film capsize under the weight of its own overplayed sentiment. Yet I'm sure it's no spoiler to reveal the picture's parting "message", (Though if it is, Spoiler Alert, Spoiler Ahead) that a man's life is always worth living, provided he is surrounded by people who love him.I looked around my empty house and suddenly that "head in the cooker" option took on a fresh urgency...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand this move is from the mid 40's, when most US American's thought the United States was the only nation on the planet. (not unlike today really) But WOW! Can this move get any more Americana? I guess the writer's felt that God prefers US American's over us ordinary people.At the beginning of the movie some "angels" are boasting about the main characters brother, that as an US American soldier, he shot down Japanese planes saving US lives. Because that's what God would want, right? They make reference to the brother again as an "All American", as though in heaven that would really be of some significances. If they edited out the first ten or fifteen minutes, the movie would not be so absolutely intolerable from the get go. However, half way through you might feel a little numb from all the unfiltered good will by George Bailey. If by midway through this movie you don't feel like punching George Bailey's uncle in the nose, you're a much better person than I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" is completely surprising. This is a time of Film-noir movies where there is a love in the air, mystery lures and the atmosphere is thrilling. But this movie was completely different from it's time. That's the reason why it failed at the Oscars (the same happened with Inception). The story is amazing and it is based on George Bailey's life.We live in the age of action movies with gore and love movies with dirty scenes and all... But still this movie will get you. If it doesn't then you seriously have a problem. I won't elaborate on the story because it's a kind of a spoiler. I highly recommend you this title. Don't think twice and rent it now...10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only a heartless person will not have a smile during the course of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart combination have given cinema lovers some great movies to cherish in the Black and White era. This movie is not only one of their best, but also one of the best of that era. Based on the basic principle of cherishing the greatest gift god has given to humans - Life, this movie takes the help of fantasy to explain this point very beautifully. The movie has a very simple story, the good virtues against the bad virtues and the triumph of the human spirit in the end. But, the treatment of the story is very fresh and it still remains evergreen. A Lot of suicides are reported nowadays due to various reasons, people ending lives without thinking of their near and dear ones. A Similar situation arises in the movie with the protagonist George Bailey (Stewart), who due to bankruptcy and other reasons decide to end his life leaving his wife and four children. He is about to end his life, when a guardian angel from heaven stops him and advises him against it by saying that every life is precious and ending it would change a lot of things around. He proves his point by showing George how his town, family etc would have been if he never existed. Seeing, the dreadful situation of his family and town if he had never being born, he understands the preciousness of his life and takes the suitable decision. The movie ends on a very happy note. Only a heartless person would not have a smile on the face or perhaps a tear in the eye during the course of the climax.James Stewart lives the role of George Bailey. My admiration for this actor never ceases to grow. Donna Reed is gorgeous. The other actors have done a great job. Well, this is the king of feel good movies, the ultimate family movie. It can be watched multiple times without even the slightest feeling of boredom. Recommended for people who watch movies with their heart.Rating : 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" You called me a warped frustrated old man, well what are you, but a warped frustrated young man "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is called " It's a wonderful life " and stars one of Hollywood's favorites. Frank Capra chose James Steward to play George Bailey, a young idealistic young man who believes he is destined to travel the world and make a fortune. It's a great dream, but unfortunately will never happen. Instead, George is forced into an obscure existence, as he admires his father so much it dooms him to replace the old man in Bedford Falls. The Bailey family establishes a tiny savings and loan and attempts to compete with the richest man in town, Mr. Potter played to the hilt by Lionel Barrymore. Things are bad enough when Mr. Bailey dies, just as George is about to go to college, but then he is forced to replacing him as head of the S &amp; L. Years go by and Mr. Potter takes advantage of the 1930's depression and his domination of the town is nearly complete. The second world war descends on the town and directly after a economic calamity caused by George's uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) threatens the family business by accidentally losing $8,000. Facing bankruptcy, George panics and believes he is going to be arrested. Knowing this will destroy his family, ruin his reputation and send him to prison, George opts to commit suicide. Praying for a miracle, George is hoping his insurance policy will save his family. However, an instant before he jumps into the frigid, frozen winter waters of the river, George is startled to see a strange little man jumping in first. That is when George's life enters the world of the "What if." The stranger (Henry Travers) turns out to be an angel named Clarence, who shows him what life would be had he never been born. In this alternative world George watches with astonishment as all those he knew are changed forever by his absence. Potter is in fact the richest and most powerful man who indeed owns the town. George on the other hand becomes a total stranger and terrorizes his own wife (Donna Reed), mother (Beulah Bondi) and children. He is subsequently run out of town by his former friends Ward Bond and Frank Faylen and neighbors. Repeated yearly as one of the finest Christmas films of all time, the movie has indeed become a family Classic. One of Jimmy Steward's all time favorites. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stewart Is Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life' became a huge success, there have been numerous films that have borrowed its story. Though it starts off a little slow and some of the scenes seem rushed, the pace gradually picks up in the second hour. The small town is well structured and one does get the feel of it. The appearance of an angel is a little awkward but one gets used to it because of a charming Henry Travers. 'It's a Wonderful Life' tends to be melodramatic and loud at times but the lead performances somehow make up for the faults. Stewart is wonderful as an ambitious and good-hearted dreamer who loses everything and then finds his way back. Donna Reed is brilliantly subtle as the caring and supportive wife. This does not rank among my favourite Capra films but it is a good enough watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Holiday Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By Manny CastroThe movie-Gods must really love It's a Wonderful Life. This is a film that, upon its inital release, was a flop. It won a Golden Globe for director Frank Capra and received five Oscar nominations, but the public hardly noticed it until about the 1970s. During that time, the film's copyright had expired and stations like PBS could air it at no cost. It slowly began to build an audience and eventually became a beloved classic.Perhaps the reason for this is because of the film's powerful message. Jimmy Stwart plays George Bailey, a man who spends his entire life devoted to his small town, Bedford Falls. When his life suddenly takes a turn for the worse, he considers suicide. It is up to his guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) to stop George by showing him what the lives of the citizens of Bedford would have been like if he had not been born at all.It's a Wonderful Life is one of the greatest holiday films of all time. In fact, it might even be the best. This is a wonderful film because it allows you time to discover the history of George Bailey's childhood, his romance with Mary (Donna Reed), and why he came to love his fellow townspeople. Director Frank Capra also makes the smart decision of giving many of these townspeople a good amount of screen time, so we as an audience begin to love them too. Or perhaps even hate them in the case of Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the man who wants to ruin George Bailey. If you haven't seen this film then do so because you will end up falling in love with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George is unlikable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie a few times and really like it. The more I watch it, the more I can't stand George Bailey. He has a frog in his throat which is annoying. He is very abrupt at times. He was very mean to that kid at the dance where he falls into the pool. They should have casted someone better for the part. Someone more likable. Someone you can root for. Of course at the end, once he realizes how lucky he is to be alive, he becomes likable.In my opinion, Clarence the angel was the best character in the film. He was perfect for the part. Mary was very good too, and not bad on the eyes either. The maid was funny. The brother Harry wasn't too likable either (must run in the family). He seemed like a preppy snob.Great movie and one of the best endings, but if I could change one thing, I would cast someone else for the part of George Bailey. Someone who actually seems nice, but has had a few bad breaks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rises Far Above Most Movies of Its Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie rises far above most films of its kind. Not only are all the important aspects of the film done with care and skill, there is much more substance to it than there is to most 'feel-good' movies or holiday stories. It succeeds where many similar movies fall short, and while it is ultimately a feel-good fantasy, many viewers who don't ordinarily enjoy such stories end up liking this one.One of the major strengths is that hero George Bailey is not a one-dimensional good-guy, but rather must combat his own weaknesses and disappointments at the same time that he is trying to help others. He has his own dreams and hopes, which never seem to materialize, and this is a genuine struggle for him. And it doesn't hurt that the character is played by a terrific actor like Jimmy Stewart, who brings out all the sides of George's character, and who gives almost any viewer something to relate to. There are many other positives as well - plenty of interesting characters, a very good cast, and a story that makes use of every available resource. "It's A Wonderful Life" is an enduring story that is still worth watching and remembering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most overrated film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be the most overrated film ever made. The plot is so corny, the dialog so trite, and the basic theme so preachy, that I cannot recommend it to anyone. You probably know the movie's basic premise -- a banker is planning to commit suicide, proclaiming his wish that he'd never been born. An angel appears and shows him how things would be if he'd never existed.WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER! In this alternate reality, the town is renamed Potterville, after Mr Potter, who is the villain. To be frank, I found it to be a lot better than the dull, boring town that the banker had left behind. Potterville, for a small town, has fabulous nightlife; the scene in the bar includes a really good band, and plenty of single women waiting to get picked up. I sure wish my town had a place like that. For me, that was the best part of the movie. If you want to see a good movie about angels, see Dogma. It's far more original, more irreverent, and definitely funnier. And it's a better holiday movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can still dream, still hope -- this Masterpiece will Live!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's a Wonderful Life" is a Work of Art and of Great Craft that will survive the eons for its many, many qualities -- acting, script, direction, details, clear commitment by all involved....and a rather 'eccentric' structure.It careens so closely to schmaltz -- no, to pure saccharine -- that one is surprised to not find goo on the sleeve after viewing it. But it stays just inside that sugary boundary for several reasons --The actors are absolutely committed to the truth and motivation of their characters. They don't judge their roles, they don't act at them, they strip down, then dive completely into them and make them live and feel and suffer. There is no more well-meaning, ethical, but often disoriented character than Jimmy Stewart's 'George Bailey'. As one watches all the shifts of emotion from self-control, to whimsy, to befuddlement, to searing anger, to sweetness, it is hard to remember that this actor is a Bomber Pilot just returned from World War II, from flying deadly B-17 missions through the terrible 'black blossoms' of flak over Nazi Germany. And more, that this is his first film since he returned!No meaner, nastier non-caricature of a horror than Lionel Barrymore's 'Potter'. The more infamous 'Ebenezer Scrooge' is a curmudgeonly, dismissive, venal and unsympathetic man. But he wants to be left alone. Potter is pure evil, while still able to remain in a society. Unlike Scrooge he is voraciously acquisitive, constantly intrusive -- an active predator and crippler of those whose shadow even falls across his view, much less his appetite. No scruples, no ethics, no empathy for anything or anyone. And somehow Barrymore and Capra make it work.No sweeter yet frustrating relative you have tried to rely on than George Mitchell's 'Uncle Billy'. No more uncertain but determined Angel than Henry Travers' 'Clarence'. No more interesting array of people who decorate George Bailey's life -- Donna Reed, so sweet, so pretty, yet anything but naive or simple ... Gloria Grahame, man-hungry, sensual of tastes, but whose heart and hopes just keep her from being one of 'those' girls ... Ward Bond and Frank Faylen as the Cop-and-Cab-Driver buddies, who look out for George, when they can.And of course the Center of this Life is Frank Capra -- directing, writing, bleeding, feeling, thinking at his very, very best. Clearly written, crafted, produced, directed with every cell, both cerebral and cardiological. A lovely film become rich in its details and contrasts. A decent George Bailey whom we assume would gave back Mary Hatch's accidentally dropped robe -- which leaves her apparently unclad in a large hedge -- is just about to, but then stops. "You know, we have a very interesting situation, here....it's not every day a man...." And actively toys with her over her desperate pleas (remember, it is the 1930's) right up until tragedy sticks a bony hand into the scene and wrenches the moment away. George at the kitchen table talking with his Dad (Samuel S. Hinds) and sees family housekeeper Annie (Lillian Randolph) doing a little eavesdropping through the kitchen door -- "Why don't you just pull up a chair and listen...? "....to which Annie replies -- "I would if I thought there was anything worth hearing!" A family.The film moves into ever darker hues, step by step, until plunging suddenly downward. George is pushed beyond even his elasticity, and snaps into a sequence of sudden and exploding rages, savaging even his own bewildered family, that is stunning -- the kind in real life that make you wince in embarrassment and turn away. And because the terrible moments are so very real in this film, you wince just as uncomfortably. This from the craft and the commitment of one James Stewart, the bomber pilot. Here you see the sometimes-dismissed as the "Aw, shucks" actor at an incredible artistic complexity, with a very large actor's toolbox.The interesting thing about the structure is this ?It's a story about George's world (yours) would be like if he had never existed.But for 1 hour and 50 minutes, we are shown the 'before' that happens, what life was with George around. Then in the final 10 minutes we are shown that world without George Bailey, and his understanding of that consequence, and his reclamation. Life with George was complicated, often difficult, frustrating, confusing. Without him, it is cold, harsh, cruel and dead, except for the brassy, blaring glitter of a world gone to seed and sensuality, having lost its human way without him. And when Jimmy Stewart's face turns into stone as he first sees and tries to understand this other world he cannot possibly grasp, so do we.This is a movie about humanity challenged, of the heart being squeezed, of dreams being shattered or stolen. And yet the good in a few people ? or just one -- can keep the endangered good in others alive. Alive until it can re-ignite and re-spread its warmth and light.Unless the shade of iron reality and cynicism has rung down around you, you can hope and dream with these citizens of Bedford Falls, because Capra and Stewart and Reed and the others hope and dream so very, very well.Oh, and if you can EVER see this in a real theater, please do so! I just did for the first time, and the silvered emotional reality that Capra paints on that big screen is almost overwhelming, it is so large. Capra will gently squeeze your throat and your tear ducts. He did mine and a lady friend's (though she can cry at a pantyhose commercial).</fullReview>

How nice of them too! Of course that could only happen in America, the earthly paradise where everybody loves their neighbour and life is beautiful. And they all lived happy ever after.

		<fullReview>(92%) Could this be the best Christmas movie of all time? Well if it is then the fact that it doesn't stuff elves, a fat man in a Coca-cola winter suit, and endless amounts of consumer based gift buying down the audience's throat helps matters greatly. Performance wise it has James Stewart playing a big hearted everyman without it ever once feeling forced or unrealistic because it shows both the good and bad elements of trying to the right thing in life. The plot does share more than a little similar elements than "A Christmas carol", only it focuses on a good man rather than an old miser, which if anything works just as well as it doesn't pull as hard on the regret emotion which is something one doesn't really want to feel too much around the end of the year. Above all else though this is a timeless classic, with great direction, well drawn characters, a brilliant sweet ending, and best of all it actually shows, in most powerful fashion, that Christmas can be an awful time of year if things aren't running smoothly, which is something really lacking from almost every other holiday movie making this 100% unmissable for all true cinema fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey (James Stewart) is man who wants out from his small town life but something always keeps him from breaking out and fulfilling his dreams. Instead he ends up working in the family loan company, helping other people out. He has a wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house which they make their home.On Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Bill loses $8000 while he is attempting to deposit the money in the bank but loses track when he brags to the town bigwig Mr Potter. The Bailey family nemesis, Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore) finds the cash but keeps it to himself. George realises when the bank auditor finds out that the accounts do not match he might lose everything and go to jail. George decides to kill himself However an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people around him by taking him to the time as if he was never born where he sees an alternate timeline. George discovers that he has made a positive contribution to many peoples lives.The story has been told many times since then in television, books and films. Even the last episode of Classic Dallas was a variant of this movie based on the Ewings if JR was not around!The film is regarded as an all time classic and it does have merits for being novel such as the beginning of the picture with a supreme being calling for an angel and the angel being one who has yet to gain his wings that is another story done many time since.The film is charming, winsome but also a shade too long. The alternate timeline where the town becomes a cesspit looks improbable with Mary being a spinster librarian, a friend of George (Violet) becoming a good time girl and other townsfolk becoming nasty and rather brutish.Also Mr Potter never seems to get his comeuppance, even during the days of the code Mr Potter still managed to find a way round things!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life***1/2 (out of 4)130 mins/ UCast: James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Henry Travers, Beulah Bondi, Frank Faylen, Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame, H.B Warner, Frank Albertson, Todd Karns, Samuel S. HindsDirector: Frank CapraPlot: An angel shows a charming, likable but frustrated man what life would have been like if he had not lived. JJ's Verdict: What makes It's a Wonderful Life so special is that, although we see what the world could be like if George Bailey never lived, it is so personal. Bailey could be anyone. He isn't very successful or particularly rich, he's just your average everyday gentleman who, like everyone, has touched and influenced so many lives. It shows that everyone has worth in life and that we should never throw that away. In It's a Wonderful Life, we have James Stewart's George Bailey who, like I mentioned before, is your average small-town American gentlemen. Kind, friendly and helpful and always looking out for others around him. This is also his weakness, because he sacrifices so many of his life ambitions like travelling the world to save the local people of Bedford Hills from the tycoon that is Lionel Barrymore's Henry Potter. Because he never reached these goals and spends most of his time fighting off the advances of Mr. Potter to seize the town, he becomes tired of life and extremely cynical. For a man so loved by the local people, George felt very unappreciated for all the sacrifices he had made throughout his life. So when his Uncle Billy misplaces an important $8,000 cheque and the bank examiner discovers this, George begins a rampage across town and finally ends up at a bridge, ready to end his life. However, just as he is about to jump in, an angel appears, ready to show him his life's true meaning and prevent him from going through with his plan. The angel does this by showing George what life would have been like had he not existed. Of course, his family and friends all turn out worse off and the town had been fully taken over and commercialised by Mr. Potter. James Stewart, although very good as the charming but reluctant and living George Bailey, is perfect as the never lived George Bailey, and his scenes where he discovers life without him are emotionally devastating and Stewart makes you feel for his character throughout. Donna Reed is superb as George's loving and caring wife Mary as are the rest of a huge supporting cast that includes Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers and Thomas Mitchell.Although it's ending fails to create as big an emotional impact as it promises to, (still a pretty good impact but you just expect more) It's a Wonderful Life is an uplifting masterpiece which just gets better on every viewing. Most people say this is the perfect Christmas movie or the perfect movie to watch if you're depressed, but I say the perfect movie to watch anytime and whatever mood you're in.</fullReview>

Honestly some of the acting and films today aren't the same as they were in the olden days. It's one of those moving free spirited movies with no graphic violence or swearing.

Frank Capra gently takes us from step to step with our subtly heroic lead, throughout the highs, the almost lows, and the real lows, and you really feel for the guy - He is never presented as perfect - he sometimes yells at his family, his friends, he gets frustrated like all of us, but always does what he can to right his wrongs, and help his townspeople. We like this guy because he's decidedly human, but a good man overall.The films big payoff comes in its finale - after George realises how much he has to live for, he immediately sets about doing just that, embracing his family like he hadn't seen them in years, despite his financial turmoil and seemingly grim future.If this film had been made today, no doubt the ending would be deemed cheesy and unrealistic - today it seems impossible to have a happy ending without the film being accused of taking the easy way out, which is crap - let people end their movie in the way that seems best to them. This film however, though simply shot and unremarkably acted, is truly affecting. George finally realizing that he was cherished and appreciated all along by his friends and clients is a touching moment, and to be honest, i was in tears, crying like a baby with a smacked arse by the end credits.I really urge anyone who has not seen this film to give it a go, even if you think its way, way off your normal movie map. I like Michael Bay films for crying out loud, and i still loved this! Go watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFEAnother classic film I dad never seen before. I liked it.The most I had seen of this movie before was in Gremlins, when Billy's mother was watching it in the kitchen.The movie is about a man who is completely selfless. He thinks about everyone else and other thing before himself... he gives up so much for other people. But when things start to go wrong for him, he feels desperate and tries to kill himself... until he is saved by an angel. The angel then teaches him what things would have been like if he had never been born.It is a lovely film. It has romance, comedy and drama in it. It really is a nice film to watch at Christmas time.The movie stars James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore &amp; Thomas Mitchell. The acting was over the top a little bit, but back in the day when this was made, all acting was over the top in one way or another.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It is a nice family film that will have all the old women crying.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Praised to death by movie buffs and critics alike, 'It's A Wonderful Life' is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and for certain, one of the greatest family films and Christmas films alike. As a person who is currently planning to view classic films, I realized that I had to check out 'It's A Wonderful Life' and did not regret it afterwards.James Stewart stars as George Bailey and Donna Reed stars as his wife, Mary Hatch in this absolute family classic. The story is one of extreme depth and emotion as the film takes around three quarters of the duration before the actual plot begins, but never does the film truly bore you. Filled with amazing black and white cinematography, fantastic acting and often great humorous relief, 'It's A Wonderful Life' truly succeeds at creating such a universe and letting one immerse themselves in the story. To not care entirely for 'It's A Wonderful Life' would clearly show that one would not be human at all as this film deals with great emotion as George Bailey comes the lowest point in his life, full of struggle and frustration that he wishes he were dead so that he would not have to deal with this pain and so that his film would be happier. It is then, that George's guardian angel, Clarence, who had been paying attention to him since he were a child, arrives and gives a tour of what life would be for everyone had George not been born.I had absolutely no idea how this film would turn out. I wasn't even sure whether this would be a film that I would enjoy very much but the film is structured fantastically and the writing and directing is amazing. The best element of the film is the attention to detail on George's character and how much backstory there is. Even the small things such as his father or his brother turn into something more important for George. The way the film depicts everything about George was fantastic. From the scene with him as a child, saving his brother, I was endeared by the character. Of course, a great character only works with fantastic acting and Jimmy Stewart delivers just this in the grandest of style! His ability to display emotion throughout the film is unbelievable, completely allowing anyone to buy the character and the performance. In fact, for much of the film, you forget that Stewart is actually acting in the film! Not only is the film amazing in terms of cinematography and depth of characters but the film offers such fantastic moments such as everything at the end of the film involving Clarence. The emotional aspect of the film is truly terrific with each scene carefully crafted, featuring just the perfect amount of emotion to it. Even the humor, which is plentiful in such a film, is done in a way that it does not overplay the humorous side of the film and unbalance the tone. These sequences are so immersive and the fact that this is a feel good Christmas film just truly ensures that this film delivers. The characters are truly unforgettable, the acting and story is amazing, written and directed intelligently, 'It's A Wonderful Life' truly exceeds at being a masterpiece in every way and it is indeed, no surprise that this film be ranked so highly on many of the top films list, most notably IMDb's infamous top 250, to which it holds a place at 29. 'It's A Wonderful Life' is truly an unforgettable classic that shall live for generations. Literally, the greatest Christmas film ever made. They don't get better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra's holiday renewal works because of its' simplicity and because we love the American underdog. We all want to achieve something more grandiose than small town success while living in a fixer-upper with a growing family. We beat ourselves up over doing the best we can and spend nights worrying about how we're going to do the right thing day in and day out. We're all George Bailey in need of a kick off the pity pot. Thankfully, Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed re-light the holiday fire. They really do need play against each other because if Jimmy wasn't such a malcontent, Donna couldn't be so strong and vica-versa. The first "what if" film to become Americana unto itself. Hee Haw!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a Christmas Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes it is isn't it. Well, pedanticism aside, this is one fine movie. It is about a man who grows up in the town of Bedford Falls and never actually leaves it. This may not be that interesting, but when we discover that ever since he was a kid he has had dreams of going abroad and travelling and becoming rich, then it is quite different. It is considered a Christmas movie, and is generally played every Christmas, but in fact it is a far darker movie and Capra never meant it to be as such. The only thing about Christmas is that it happens to be that time when he has his revelation.What this movie is about is shattered dreams. We watch our hero (James Stewart) as he grows up with all of these dreams, but they seem to be continually postponed as things happen. It also shows the battle inside of him as he tries to maintain his integrity, yet also tries to follow the dreams that keep him going, yet these dreams never manifest, especially since he becomes more and more fixed to the town to a point where he cannot leave.The climax of the movie is where his wish is granted, that is that he never existed. As the angel tells him, he is free and can now do what he wants, but as he looks around he sees that he has made such an impact on the town. I don't think the point here is that he didn't realise the impact he had on the town, especially since the angel told him that he no longer has any attachments and he can do what he wants, but rather the integrity inside of him won't let him leave, especially since the town has changed so drastically. Even though he wants to get away, he knows that he cannot because the town relies upon him to stop the bad guy from taking control of the town and turning it into a cesspool.The struggle here is between what he wants and what is good for others: a struggle between selfishness and selflessness. No matter how selfish he tries to be, he has an integral selfless nature where he instinctively puts the welfare of others before himself.The thing is that It's a Wonderful Life is not a warm fuzzy Christmas movie, but rather a movie about a man who is fighting a constant struggle within himself and in the end accepts who he is and is joyful about the hope that he has put in many other's hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch a lot of movies, mostly classics, and to this very moment i considered To Kill A Mockingbird to be the greatest classic i ever watched, but tonight i came across It's A Wonderful Life and after i read a summary and so some of the reviews i gave it a try and i'm glad i did... what a Wonderful Life.I honestly can't believe that i hit 20s and just now i found out about this (so far best movie i ever watched in my life)movie.Because i don't want to spoil it (in case there is someone "like me" out there that missed it), i won't get into details, but i must say i'm touched during the minutes of the unborn George, those minutes were so emotional that i had to wipe me eyes several time during those minutes.I also should mention that the acting was great too, James, Donna, Henry were magnificent. This was the first movie from Capra that i watched and this really made my mind to lookout for others Capra works.At the end of my review i just want to say that this movie really brought something into me, so people out there who missed this by any chance...watch it already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different take on Frank Capra's masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is my different take on Its a wonderful life.Potter is Margaret Thatcher, is Ronald Reagen, is George Bush Jnr.Both the UK and the USA are Pottersvill's.Right wing Republicanism, and British right wing Tory's are both hard nosed, profit entrenched political systems.In It's a wonderful life, George Baily's father runs a lone company, not for profit, but to help people.George Baily's father is a Socialist, in America, a Social Democrat.Due to decades of Republicaism in the States, millions are homeless and unemployed long term. This is Pottersville.Due to the same system in the UK since the 80's, thousands maybe millions are equally homeless, are equally long term unemployed.It's a wonderful life reveals what can be achieved by one person in a position to help people in his community.And It's a wonderful life proves the other side of the coin when attitudes change at grass roots level, when the people in charge have hard hearts, just like Potter.After George Bailey meets Clarence the Angel, and Clarence the Angel gives George Bailey his wish that he wished that he had never been born, everything changes and George Bailey's community become's Pottersville, hard harsh people, trust all gone, love all gone, the soul all gone.Everything that happens to George Baily in Pottersville, is a direct result of not only George Baily never being born, but also of ruthless Capitalism taking root because everybody is looking after themselves, and not caring about other people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A must watch, surely on Christmas Day, Capra's evergreen classic will surely stir hearts and emotions so long as there are eyes and ears and hearts and minds to drink it all in.Incredible to think it was a commercial failure on first release and indeed was the great director's last recognised masterpiece of a long, distinguished career. The story, of course, is pure "Capra-corn", the last word in his trademark straight-guy-takes-on-big-bad-world M.O. and through sheer humanity overcomes adversity to restore our collective faith in human nature.I've seen it many times previously, but not for a long while, yet still had to wipe away a tear at the gladdening conclusion as Everyman James Stewart's George Bailey gets his just rewards for a lifetime of good intentions and good deeds and so overturns the machinations of the grasping local tyrant, Henry Potter, played with almost pantomime relish by Lionel Barrymore.The writing is wonderful, (people forget the playful humour which abounds in the early sections), Capra taking time slot in all the components, before the breathtaking twist which sees George's careless remark, as he turns his back on the world, fanned into flame by his angel overseer, Clarence, played beautifully by Henry Travers. As ever, Capra manages his ensemble cast of familiars with aplomb, but still leaves plenty of room for Stewart's wonderful performance to occupy centre-stage. Yes, the viewer's emotions are manipulated occasionally (for example,the heavenly choir is heard in the background, for all of the last 10 or 15 minutes), but Capra by and large reins in the schmaltz and leaves you thinking that the "wonderful town" of Bellfield falls could have actually existed in some between-wars long-ago.Although not completely perfect (let's not forget Potter effectively gets away with Bailey's Bank's depositors' hard-earned money), Capra's universal parable will surely forever continue to maintain it's pre-eminent position as a true Hollywood classic, for all seasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's what we all would want to be like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been screened and looked at so many times that you would think there is nothing more to say about it. I thought the same, although I always loved it I'd gotten so used to the film that it was almost background noise once a year, until I saw it on the big screen. A local cinema screened this one Christmas and I happened past, and for some reason paid my fee and went in.Wow!It really is a film that couldn't be made in modern times, we are too cynical, and what a shame that is. This is a total tour-de-force of what makes a man and the events, painful and sweet, that get him there. George Bailey is the everyman, played brilliantly by Jimmy Stewart, and never has anyone been identified with so much on screen by everyone who watches it. I've heard the argument from various parties that the film is too sentimental and sickly sweet, and in any other movie they may be right. Not so here, the film works somehow, it is sentimental, but it is beautiful and moral and life enhancing. I know I haven't said much about the plot, I don't have to, just watch it and if you've got a soul you'll love it. To quote Stan Lee "Nuff Said!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much has been said that all I can say is this : If you can watch Geroge Bailey charge down Main Street yelling, "Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan" without your eyes filling up, you don't know what it is to be human. Well, I'll guess I'll say more, because some silly rule prevents me from being succinct. "It's A Wonderful Life" shows us that we are all heroes, in our own right. How many lives does each of our own touch? Like George Bailey, I've wondered if everyone would be better off if I'd never been born. Thanks to Frank Capra, I know what an awful, selfish feeling this is. Here's your hat, what's your hurry?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic. It touches your emotions making one to learn to enjoy life, while bringing tears of joy at the films end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally after all these years I decided to set down and watch the Frank Capra classic from 1946 "It's A Wonderful Life" and I must say overall I was well pleased a film that makes one feel down and depressed yet it touches your emotions and makes you be thankful especially the way the film ends it can bring your eyes to water up. The legendary Jimmy Stewart who performs fine here plays George Bailey a man who thru life has always seemed to have gotten the short end. From his days as a child when George felt guilty for not watching his brother to the days of never reaching his full potential and having to take over the business of banking loans once his father passes unexpectedly. It seems that George's life is problem after problem even after he enjoys life with his significant other Mary(Donna Reed) then his business sinks and the loans of bank customers turn to debt and it seems life for George is now finally doomed as if he will be broken just before Christmas. All along from the films start we as the viewer can see somewhat of a foreshadowing technique starting out with the stars in the sky of angels up above who keep a close eye on everyone including George. Then upon Christmas as in so many holiday fairy types a magical visit occurs this time it's from an angel named Clarence. The journey that George takes is even more depressing, but in the end he sees the true light and love from everyone in town. Capra really proved with this film that no matter how bad it seems or it gets in life that in the end if you have loved and given friends will turn out in the end in time of need and not let failure or darkness happen. Many times some of us aren't felt to be loved or liked, but we are fooled and surprised in the end with a little help from up above. The ending with the bell and angel is timeless and a classic well remembered by most viewers. Clearly thumbs up for Frank Capra who made an emotional and touching classic with a little help from the angels in the heavens above it touches a viewer and makes them feel loved and uplifts their spirits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorized Version VS Black &amp; White</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up Paramount's double DVD for "It's a Wonderful Life" to upgrade my earlier Republic release. This two disc set comes with both the original B&amp;W edition and a newly colorized version on a separate disc. This is not the first colorization job on this film. Turner attempted it some years back and both James Stewart and director Frank Capra were appalled at the results. They did everything in their power to discourage this practice. Well the technique for colorization has greatly improved since those early attempts and I thought it worth taking another look at the results. It is quite amazing -- yet after watching it for about one hour I changed to the black &amp; white version and have NO desire to watch it in color. Flesh colors are on the orange side and everyone has the exact same tone of color. The beautiful shades found in the b&amp;w version are far more effective. Let's face it -- if a film was originally designed and shot in color then it should be seen that way. It's the same with watching a wide screen film in full screen or a full screen blown up to fill a 16:9 wide screen television set. The film itself remains one of my all time favorites -- and I will continue appreciate it in black and white!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler!!! The viewer learns about George Bailey as `angles' are discussing his current situation. These angels go through all of the major events in George's life. They show that he dreamed of traveling to far off lands and discovering all the world had to offer him. But, that all didn't quite work out for George. He grew up and found that business life changed him and made him feel as if he was a failure for never leaving Bedford Falls. All of it just adds up to George coming to the end of his rope and ready to jump off of a bridge. But the angel Clarence comes down and jumps in, ultimately saving George. Clarence then shows George what it would be like in Bedford Falls if George wasn't ever born. George learns that even though he didn't live out his dreams of travel and adventure, he still had a major impact on people. As Clarence the angel shows George around town, he learns how truly wonderful his life is. This movie is a favorite to many, and for good reasons. The movie (based on a book named The Greatest Gift) is such a wonderful tale that shows viewers what the really important things in life are. `It's Wonderful Life' wasn't a huge success as it was released as WW11 was ending. But as time past, it has become a classic, ranking number twenty six out of Internet Movie Data Base's top two hundred and fifty. One of the best things about this movie is the character development, with a strong protagonist and the powerful antagonist, Mr. Potter. The viewer can feel as if they are there, in the cozy town of Bedford Falls, living right along side with George and his family. There were no camera techniques or special effects that made this movie what it is. It is simply an amazing story that people fall in love with. The average user rating for this movie is 8.6/10, but this viewer gives it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie with important morale values.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is the story of George Bailey, a savings-and-loan manager, played by James Stewart, (Stewart), the , much-loved hero of Bedford Falls. As a child, George risked his life and lost his hearing in one ear to save his brother from drowning. While he was growing up he dreamed of traveling around the world and going to college. After his father passed away, he forfeited his dreams to move away from the small town that he grew up in to stay home and manage his father's business, the Bailey Building and Loan. Throughout his life, George believe that meeting the needs of others was more important than accumulating wealth. The film has it share f romance, especially when George marries Mary Hatch, who is played by Donna Reed. On their wedding day, George ends up sacrificing his honeymoon so hat he can prevent the Savings an Loan fro going out o business. As with many movies from the 1940's, the film has a villain. He is a is a stingy old man named Potter (played by Lionel Barrymore), who owns most of Bedford Falls. The Bailey Building and Loan Society is the one of the only businesses in town that he doesn't own, and he's willing to do anything to get his hands on it ? lie, cheat, bribe, stealAlthough for the most part it is a a lighthearted story, the movie does show the despair that overcomes George when his personal and financial troubles force him into a feeling of hopelessness and ultimately has him considering suicide. George is rescued by Clarence (Henry Travers), a lovable yet bumbling guardian angel, who has been given the assignment to prove to George that his life is worth living. He grants George one wish: to see what the world would be like if he had never been born. George observes how much worse off many people would be. Mary, is wife is a lonely spinster; George's brother, Harry, is dead because George was not there to rescue him when he was a child George's uncle, Billy, is in an insane asylum; and Mr. Potter owns the entire town, which has been named after him. The reviewer would rate this movie a five out of five star rating. It's A Wonderful Life deals with the desire each of us has to feel that somehow our existence makes a difference in this world. And even though it doesn't actually say it, we can all learn not to be too confident, and that we should be careful of what we wish for.</fullReview>

Made at the end of the Second World War, it is hard to believe that the film was not as well received on initial release, whereas today, it would have grown through word of mouth and the power of the Internet (Mr. Knowles, your netrangers await!!)It is refreshing to view a film where the only key optical effects are a simple starfield representation of the angels and one or two moments of illusion as Ward Bond arrives to save James Stewart from oblivion and that the true special effect is in the acting and script, still among the most essential parts of the film-making process.In turns funny, tragic, revealing and observing, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is at first glance the tale of a man,George Bailey (Stewart) out to keep his livelihood alive against outside oppression (in this case a local businessman determined to buy out his stake in his business with a rich payoff) and to retain the dignity and trust of the township, but when pressure gets too much, the locals begin to take exception to his beliefs and manner, resulting in one of the husbands of his colleagues hitting him and him reexamining what is important in life.....Influential to many of today's wishful thinking movies (think WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE) as well as any number of top fantasy blockbusters, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE continues to give pleasure to many and is in spite of it's Christmas setting, a movie for all seasons....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Family/Feel-good movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right, as I write this there are EIGHTY shopping days (not including Sundays) left until Christmas!What a depressing thought, eh?Anyway, with this in mind, I have decided to submit my review of the, and I do mean- 'THE', best Family/Feel-good Movie ever made...Frank Capra's: It's a wonderful Life.(Added to which, it is, by far and away, my personal all-time favorite.)Many, many words (not all complimentary) have been written about this Classic Yuletide tale, so what makes mine any different from the rest?In truth, probably nothing! But by damn it, I'll have my say! You hear?This Film is a Classic, of a by-gone time, where life seemed so much more innocent, than it does today, and boy does it show! Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad thing. Not by a long-shot! In fact, it is this overwhelming sence of innocence, which gives the Film it's undeniable charm. That, at it's best, can melt the coldest of Hearts! No small wonder then, that, after a decidedly shaky beginning, this Film has been consistently voted as America's all-time favorite Movie, and one of the best Film's ever made. To which, I whole-heartedly concur.Best seen with all your family around, during the Festive season, this Film, in my humble opinion, can NOT be beat, and will ALWAYS be, as far as I'm concerned, the TOPS!"That-a-boy Clarence!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An American classic well worthy of it's reputation, "It's a Wonderful Life" details the life of George Bailey, a man who feels he is a failure and is on the verge of suicide. He is taken by his guardian angel in need of his wings, Clarence (Henry Travers), who shows him just how important he has been. Ultimately, it is perhaps the most emotionally moving film ever made, and it offers insight that everybody can use about what's important in our lives. To phrase a heavily used cliche, this is one of the few movies that gets better with every viewing, and never loses any of its power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply the best film i have ever seen. Every cast member is perfect, the plot is faultless and the acting, (especially from Stewart, is unbeatable). I think, that in the 56 years since this film was made, only The Shawshank Redemption has come close(and extremely close at that) to equalling this wonderful film.Some people have given this film 1 out of 10, but they are due to be released quite soon.If you have never seen this film, do so, with no interruptions. It is nothing less than utter class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surely a Christmas classic, with one minor complaint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have viewed IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE countless times over the years, and it is a true American Christmas classic. I cannot add further to the praise this film deserves and has received. At the risk of sounding Scrooge-like, I do have one complaint (and it is a minor one). I realize that Karolyn Grimes was only six years old at the time, but she delivers one of the most irritating performances I have ever seen from a child actor. Every line of dialog she delivers (with a machine-like monotony, at the top of her lungs) grates like a rasp over my nervous system. They could have used a robot to essay the role of "Zuzu" with better results. Thankfully, she is only on screen for a relatively short period of time. I still enjoy repeated viewings, but must lower the sound level whenever the young Ms. Grimes prepares to speak. Aside from that, a rewarding and excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about this miraculous film that hasn't been said before? "It's A Wonderful Life" is one of the greatest films of all time and it isn't hard to understand why. It is the type of rare film that sticks with you forever, very much like a treasured childhood memory. The film tells the story of George Bailey, a bank manager who has fallen into serious financial trouble. A culmination of all the troubles in his life leads him to pray to the heavens and wish to have never been born. Unknown to him, of course, he is being watched from on high and an apprentice guardian angel named Clarence - yet to attain his wings - is sent down to guide him. Clarence makes George's wish come true and he soon discovers what a mistake he has just made. The film poses the question - What would have happened in the lives of everyone you knew if you could see the world without you ever existing? The film gives one possible - and daunting -answer to the question and George Bailey gets the chance to see the world without him ever being there. "It's A Wonderful Life" is a truly magical film, there simply aren't enough superlatives to describe it. See for yourself if you haven't already, and experience a real gem of a film that will leave you with tears of joy rolling down your cheeks by the end. Superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the elements come together to make this movie a must-see for anyone with a heart.Ever wonder what life would be like without you? Frank Capra transformed a wonderful story into a moving, forceful display of the human spirit. And Jimmy Stewart was never better. Every conceivable emotion (even a little lust!) comes through loud and clear, and right on the money. His "mad" stare into the camera near the end will never, ever leave you.This movie is a tradition for me every Christmas. It's a postcard from a different time, when small-town Christmases meant community, family, a light dusting of snow... and a reminder that the love of community and family is the reason for living. Put this in your top ten movies of all time, and it'll be up to you to put it number 1.</fullReview>

Standing out in the cast that was put together took some doing as the performances from the top of the list to the bottom are exceptional.If you only get the chance to see 1 film then this is it. No fancy special effects just a good plot, good acting and good directing.This film should be screened regularly by the Samaritans as a way of inspiring people to go on with life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch this movie every year and never get tired of it. I think it is Capra's best work and I'm happy to see it is appreciated more now than when he made it. All of the acting is perfect.One quirky thing to note is Capra's subjective use of time and crowds. For example when Uncle Billy is at the bank window, a crowd suddenly appears behind him when he can't find the deposit money. Similarly, when George tries to get Violet to go on a romantic (to him) romp through nature, a crowd suddenly forms when she ridicules him. Same with Mr. Gower in the bar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't do well in the box office ???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie supposedly did poorly when it was first released in the box office. I was never a fan of films from pre-1960's, and had always thought they were inappropriately dramatic, poorly acted, and boring. It's a Wonderful Life may be one of the few exceptions to this. I thought the movie was phenomenal. The acting, script, and plot was incredible. Some of the lines were so simple and yet the acting made it all come alive. At the end of the movie, there is a featurette called "The Making of It's a Wonderful Life." It was revealed that the actor/actress forgot several pages worth of script lines in several scenes, but the acting was so great that the director decided to trash that segment of the script. This might might have been the ingredient that saved this movie from the boredom that plagues most films from this era. Without going into the spoilers, I will just say that this is definitely one of the top 5 feel-good dramas of the century, and the IMDB votes certainly reflect this. So why didn't this film do well in the box office? The featurette covers this in detail, but watch the movie and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

I am a guy who is definitely not 'churchy' and who rates the Matrix as the second best-ever film (and a Jackie Chan fan as well).

		<fullReview>This is the standard for movie making. If you are on your deathbed and had to watch a movie, this is the movie you would want to watch. No other film has ever had such a perfect blend of all the elements that make movies great. From acting to wardrobe, from directing to script. Drama, comedy, charm, this movie has it all. The pacing is superb and you root for George Bailey from beginning to end. But best of all, it has one of the most basic and beautiful morals of any film ever made: No man's life is unimportant. It's a Wonderful Life, said by director Frank Capra to be his best work, plays to all ages and stands the test of time even with repeated viewings. This in spite of its campy 'Capra-corn' moments. A stunning dramatic performance by Jimmy Stewart, considered by many to be his best, and that is saying a lot. The scene in the bar where Stewart reaches the end of his rope and cries out in utter desperation, "Dear Father in heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me? show me the way" is gut wrenchingly vivid to anyone who has ever faced trials and tribulation. Stellar supporting performances, too, including the incomparable Lionel Barrymore as Henry Potter and H.B. Warner as Mr. Gower. This is in the top 10 of most every respectable 'best movies' list ever made. Watching this film will change your life, it is that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best films ever made! It is certainly one of my dearest favorites. I never tire of watching it and I always get a little more out of it the more that I do. Perhaps as we age and mature, we see more of life's lessons through George and Mary Bailey.We learn that sometimes when our best ambitions, hopes and dreams fail... there is more to life than what simply meets our eyes alone. We are not alone. God does move all things to our best interest, even though we don't always see the immediate results that we hoped for.Further, it is a message of hope; nothing in life is ever so desperate that taking your life is an answer. Giving up is never the answer.This film should live on through generations to come as one of the best classics of our time. Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed have never been better. It is a poignant dramatic film, a classic portrayal of all that is good and descent and hopeful in life... surviving though all the injustices and downfalls that befall us.This may be my most favorite film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A toast to my big brother, George: The richest man in town"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that I get a little teary every time I watch 'It's A Wonderful Life (1946)?' The title says it all, I suppose. Despite the film's reputation as a holiday classic, Capra's film succeeds because it doesn't forget about the other eleven months of the year ? it truly is about life, and what makes it wonderful. Even the most understated moments have a tendency to expose me as a romantic: in one of my favourite scenes, George Bailey (James Stewart) offers the Moon to his sweetheart, Mary (Donna Reed). Yet Capra doesn't patronise the audience with a string of happy moments. George, at first, seems like the unluckiest person in town, a man whose big dreams never came to fruition, for reasons entirely outside his control. It is Capra's miracle that George, and the audience, ultimately realise that life's greatest wonders are not necessarily those that we had anticipated ? friends we never expected to make, a girl with whom we never expected to fall in love?On a snowy Christmas Eve, George Bailey stands on a bridge in his home town of Bedford Falls, contemplating suicide. Throughout his life-time, George's grand dreams of exploration and excitement have been repeatedly stifled by tragedy and obligation, and now he sees no future except in death. God, watching from Heaven, sends down guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers), who tries to convince George that life is something to be treasured. 'It's a Wonderful Life' was adapted from Philip Van Doren Stern's short story "The Greatest Gift," and carries shades of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" (indeed, Lionel Barrymore was chosen for the role of Mr. Potter based on his much-lauded radio portrayals of Scrooge from 1934). James Stewart, who had served in the U.S. Airforce during WWII, brings a painful weariness to the role of beleaguered family-man George Bailey, and the warm, soulful eyes of Donna Reed ? as George's wife Mary ? are enough to remind any man that life is, indeed, wonderful. 'It's A Wonderful Life' differs from 'You Can't Take It With You (1938)' and 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)' in that the film's central immoral character does not undergo a change of heart (though, admittedly, Jim Taylor in the latter film does remain a rigid villain, even when Senator Paine reveals a human streak). Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is one of cinema's most formidable villains, a heaving bulk of a man, confined to a wheelchair, who desires money and power for the sake of money and power. In the swelling emotion of Capra's final act, it's easy to forget that Potter goes unpunished for his moral crimes. Here, Capra deals in blacks and whites. George Bailey is a good man; Mr Potter is a bad man. The director's own unique brand of "Capra-corn" required that the audience's sympathies never be confused, so that they can commit themselves to a character who is destined for a happy ending. After having watched 'You Can't Take It With You,' Barrymore's role- reversing characterisation is stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHILE MAKING IT yet another early Winter's eve spent with the handy work of Mr. Frank Capra, Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, et al, it suddenly occurred to us that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (Liberty Films/RKO Radio Pictures, 1946) is one film that has a most checkered history. Inspite of the exalted position of preeminence that it has occupied for some thirty or so years now, as hard as it may seem to believe, the movie was not a success at the time of its original release.WE CAN RECALL viewing it for the first time. It was while in Junior High (in the 7th Grade), circa 1958. The temperate zone setting was very appealing; rather than being set in the warm and sunny Southern California, Mediterramean clime that characterize so many cinematic works. This was a most friendly way of getting the attention of this kid, here (that's me, Schultz)! I really identified with it.SO, WE CAN now magically fast forward our time line about 12-15 years to the early 1970's. It was during this period that our subject film was wrongly thought to be in Public Domain. Without the benefit of copyright protection,it would be open season on this or any other movie. Every and any print of it could be, and was shown over just about all of the commercial TV stations in the land; as well as those which come under the umbrella of (everybody bow their heads) the Public Broadcasting System.* THE MEGA DOSSAGE of exposures to the Film, rather than wearing out its welcome with the Public, surprisingly served to permanently cement its endearment to the masses. In much the same manner that all the films and characters which are numbered among all that is the Walt Disney Legacy, the characters and happenings of this screen story are all second nature to us now.HAVING SUCCEEDED IN capturing the affection and imagination of the public at large, the characters and storyline would surely invite imitation; for after all, they say that..."Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery." Yet, there has never been a movie which we could say with any reasonably high degree of certainty that was an attempt to emulate the story and the spirit of the film.WE SAY THAT there was no imitation of the movie; a statement that you may well be disputing. And believe us when say we can hear you when you say, "What about that made for TV movie, IT HAPPENED ONE Christmas (Daisy Productions/Universal TV/ABC TV Network,1977), which was a starring vehicle for Miss Marlo Thomas and Wayne Rogers; with support from Cloris Leachman and Orson Wells!!IT REQUIRED A Sex Change operation for the principals as Mary was now the main character and head of the Savings &amp; Loan; with the Angel's role being consigned to the feminine side with Cloris Leachman (relpete with an annoying &amp; phony Cockney accent) being called "Clara", instead of Henry Travers' name of "Clarence"! (Clever these Americans!) WELL, WE SAID it before and we'll stick by our statement. This is not an imitation or derivative of the original. It's an outright piece of Plagiarism, plain and simple! It may have been do one all legal like and above board, but it's still Plagiarism. Just screen it and see that the script has been a carbon copy of the Capra Film.AS PERHAPS AN unintended, though extremely beneficial, consequence of all of this super dosage of this variety of what has been described as 'Capra-corn'**, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE eventually rose to the pinnacle of success as America's Favourite Film of the Christmas Holiday Season. In doing so, Mr. Capra's pet project managed to supplant the former Yuletide Christmas favourite, WHITE Christmas (Paramount, 1955). (Yuch!!!!!!!!!!!! But that, my dear buddy Schultz, is another story!)NOTE: * We prefer to refer to it as the POLIT BUREAU SYSTEM.NOTE: ** It has been said that while it was true, that the copyright to the Movie had not been renewed therefore it was legitimately considered to be in Public Domain, the Music in the Film was a different story. In this case, the impossible was accomplished, with "all the Horses being put back into the Barn!" The Music Copyright lead to having a single copyright owner (Republic Pictures). Hence, we see the movie usually twice a year on NBC.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the all time greatest Christmas movies ever! Jimmy Stuart plays the roll of George Bailey with his normal genius. All of us have a little George Bailey in us and sometimes need to be reminded how we affect the world around us. Of course Henry Travers is quite lovable as Clarence (Angle 2nd Class). It brings back to memory a time much more innocent and always leaves me wishing I could have grown up in that era. If you don't feel good after watching this movie, you should watch it again. This movie is great for the entire family and is one of our Christmas traditions. It is always an event when we turn it on and officially starts our Christmas season.</fullReview>

This is the movie that shows you have a purpose. It shows have important one life is to all the lives around him/her. Capra was masterful in this directing and I believe this movie was better than The Best Years of Our Lives which beat it out for all major academy awards. James Stewart is also my favorite actor of all time and he was at the top of his game in this movie and one of the high points in his career. He gave a worthy best actor performance. This movie should inspire anyone who thinks they are worthless and don't have a meaning in the world. This is truly in the top 3 or 4 in my movies behind such classics as "The Godfather" or "Casablanca". A true milestone in cinematic history.10 out 10 stars without a question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

Although I'm a teenager but watching this movie I want to go in the past &amp; want to live a very simple life like George Bailey .

Brilliant acting by James Stewart, Reed &amp; Barrymore. I loved the movie &amp; want to at least for 1 day in that era. By watching this movie one can learn a lot about life,- that life is not just about you, its about everyone. Its not about your gratification but about how much sacrifice you can do for your loved one's.

		<shortDescription>A great, big, fat masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there anything actually left to write about "It's A Wonderful Life" that hasn't already been written? Forget all about it being the greatest Christmas film of all time ("The Wizard Of Oz" is also a great film, but it is not really a Christmas film), "It's A Wonderful Life" is actually one of the greatest films of all time, full stop.Simply put, the film revolves around the life of a kind and caring, but frustrated man, who one night during the worst crisis of his life, is shown what the world would have been like if had he never been born. Funnily enough, the whole 'alternative reality' section of the movie takes up less than a quarter of the running time towards the end of the film, although it is always the thing that is mentioned when discussing the film. Prior to that plot turn we are treated to a master class in film acting from the genius that was James Stewart, running from goofy comedy, shyness, happiness, disappointment, frustration, despair and then the blackest dark night of the soul. It is one of the greatest performances in cinema history and I will fight anybody who disagrees with me.In the packed cinema on Saturday I sat near a young woman who had obviously never seen "It's A Wonderful Life" before. Every now and again I picked up on her reactions to what was going on in the movie. Laughter, gasps and then, of course, tears. She was still wiping her eyes when the lights came up. Actually, so was I."It's A Wonderful Life" is a great, big, fat masterpiece and everybody should see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Life (1946) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An acclaimed holiday classic which took a very dramatic turn for me this last Christmas season and has finally emerged as a truly emotional and uplifting film in my eyes. To be fair, I had to ask myself if this was the same film I had tried out for only the first time three years ago and which I initially felt was vastly overrated. Back then I was expecting a completely "Christmas-y" movie and had been disappointed while missing the whole point of the story. So I satisfied my urge to give this acclaimed film a second chance and it was a completely different experience for me. Jimmy Stewart was great in the role of George Bailey, a man who gives of himself to others and puts people ahead, often at his own expense. I found Bailey to be not only tragic at times but funny too. I appreciated a lot of chuckles that I somehow missed originally. I also relished the photography and atmosphere (this being a better quality DVD than the first time I saw it).But I think I was simply in a better frame of mind and mood this time as well, which goes to prove yet again how sometimes movies can really affect you differently at any given time, depending on whatever state you're in when you're watching them or what your expectations are. I also have to say this film touched me greatly emotionally because I just think I can personally relate to a lot of feelings in the film more today than I did yesterday. It touched a spot in me, and I spent the last entire Christmas Season feeling better about the holidays and in more of a generous Christmas spirit than I'd ever felt before. I think I've also learned a little something about life and how to better live it from this classic this time out and it was a fully rewarding experience all around. It may be required every year now to give me that inspirational kick I may need. And that is a true accomplishment. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who grew up in Ontario might remember TVO's "Magic Shadows".Elwy Yost would spin half an hour of a movie...each day for the week. Now I don't know how anybody today could watch that and even then as a kid I only watched one entire movie on Magic Shadows.That was the week he showed "Its a Wonderful Life". This was not the Christmas classic then.Mid seventies I had never heard of it and I was excited to watch every half hour of it. The audience knows there is a man who will be brought to despare and that he is a good man...well he must be because the angels are talking about how to save him.It is in this manner... how the story is set up... that there is a suspense and eagerness in watching.It almost feels like two films because you are watching the buildup to James Stewart's tragic demise all in flashback and then we are in the present and he isn't saved yet. Really well done film because it entertains and makes you feel good. Glad to see it became a classic and will always be there for us at Christmas. On the serious and dramatic side what happened to George Bailey could happen to any of us....he has the best intentions but at the end he is feeling unfulfilled and abandoned.James Stewart's acting captures this very well. Thank you Elwy Yost...Its A Wonderful Life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Miracle at Bedford Falls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (Liberty Films, released through RKO Radio, 1946), directed by Frank Capra, is a heartwarming story about how one man's life touches so many others, and without that one solitary life how circumstances and events could have turned out so differently. Quite an original premise that in many ways reflects the lives of every human being. In spite of some flaws (women's 1940s hair styles during the 1920-30s settings), it remains a true masterpiece, thanks to frequent revivals over the years, especially during the Christmas season from which much of the story takes place.Story opens on the night before Christmas and all through Bedford Falls, a small town where prayers are being said for a good-natured man named George Bailey (James Stewart), whose life is in jeopardy and intends on destroying God's greatest gift, his life, through suicide. Voices are then heard communicating from the great beyond as Joseph, the head angel, proposes to answer the prayers by sending a guardian angel. The chosen one is Clarence (Henry Travers), who has yet to earn his wings. Before assuming his Earthly mission, Clarence is given an hour to learn the life story of George Bailey, beginning in 1919 with George, age 12 (Bobby Anderson), becoming a hero by saving his little brother, Harry, from drowning in frozen water, and preventing Emil Gower (H.B. Warner), druggist and employer, from unwitting making a serious mistake that would have sent him to prison; moving forward to 1928 with the courtship of George and Mary Hatch (Donna Reed), their marriage the at the start of the Depression of 1929, taking up residence in an old house at 320 Sycamore; George taking over his late father's (Samuel S. Hinds) building and loan business which millionaire banker Harry F. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), wants to monopolize, as well as the entire town; the birth of the couple's four children, their happy and troubled times leading to the present day of World War II where George finds himself in desperate need of $8,000 misplaced by his Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), and appropriated by Mr. Potter, or else his shortage of funds will lead to financial ruin and a stiff jail sentence.For an American movie classic, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has all the elements of several Charles Dickens novels combined, namely "David Copperfield" where youngster George falls victim of child abuse in the Mr. Murdstone fashion as he gets his face slapped numerous times by Mr. Gower to a point of causing his deaf ear to bleed for not delivering the medication to a customer, but unlike the evil Murdstone, Gower, a troubled old man who had just lost his son in the war, realizes his trial and error after learning the pills he accidentally placed in the order were actually poisoned, thus hugging the boy in gratitude; and "A Christmas Carol" where the adult George, the hero, not Scrooge, is given the opportunity from his guardian angel to see what the world would have been like had he never been born. Also borrowing from "A Christmas Carol" is the characterization of Barrymore's Mr. Potter in a Ebenezer Scrooge-type fashion ("the richest and meanest man in town.") Unlike Scrooge, Potter has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The only time he shows a touch of kindness is when he wants a favor from George, knowing full well that once that's accomplished, he'll have nothing more to do with him.For first time viewers, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE comes across as dark, gloomy and depressing story, atypical for a movie categorized as a comedy, particularly with its 1940s "film noir" trend, with off screen narration and flashback sequences. Aside from these basic elements, there are many key scenes (crowds gather together singing "Hark the Herald Angels Sing') and classic quotes ("Every time a bell rings, an angel gets it wings."), that make this a timeless classic. Aside from Frank Capra's commendable job with this production, the supporting players, including Beulah Bondi (Ma Bailey); Gloria Grahame (Violet); Todd Karns (Harry Bailey as a man); Ward Bond, Frank Albertson, Sheldon Leonard and many others, are also first rate. Larry Simms, best known as Alexander in the "Blondie" movie series, assumes the role as the eldest Bailey son, Peter. And who could forget Karolyn Grimes as Little Zuzu with her famous closing line of all? The film did meet with controversy in the 1980s, falling victim to public domain, poor video transfers and shorter prints from its original 130 minute theatrical release, having every commercial and cable TV station (American Movie Classics included) over exposing it throughout the month of December, and even worse, colorization, in spite the fact that its black and white photography is so right for this film. Currently, DVD transfers have improved and television revivals became limited. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a type of movie that can be made once. Regardless of imitations as well as the 1977 television remake, "It Happened One Christmas" with Marlo Thomas, the major preference continues to be this 1946 original. It still a holiday classic that doesn't seem to ever go away, thanks to viewers and film historians who continue to find something special with a film based on a short story titled "The Greatest Gift," the gift of life.

		<fullReview>It's A Wonderful Life is about George Bailey played beautifully by the late great actor, Jimmy Stewart. It's directed by Frank Capra and it's an impressive film overall. Donna Reed plays his loving wife and the mother of his children. Who could forget his guardian angel, Clarence? and the wonderful people who make Bedford Falls, New York. The film is long but it's worth watching. Before NBC bought it, it used to be shown repeatedly around the holiday season. There was never a day without It's A Wonderful Life! Still almost every show from Married with Children to Saturday Night Live has used the story line of what it would be like if George was never born. He learns at the end that he had a wonderful life and it sends chills down your spine and tears to your eyes. It's the kind of film that you don't forget or want too. It makes us all feel important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For several years, without fail, it has been a Christmas tradition of my family to sit down and watch this movie on December 24th. This year will not be an exception! Of all the Christmas movies out there, this is by far my favorite. Who could not root for poor George Bailey? Who could not have related to him at some point or another? While the movie has a happy ending, IAWL isn't made out to be sugary-sweet like many Christmas movies have a tendency to have. There are definitely Kleenex box moments, but thankfully, mostly out of joy for seeing someone so down in luck, climb back up.Bottom line, this movie could -- and should never be -- remade. You could get the best crew together in Hollywood and they still wouldn't be able to even touch the grandeur that this sentimental, timeless classic has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George lassos the moon?It's a Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how I went 23 years of Christmas without having It's a Wonderful Life playing during the holiday season. Last year I saw the film for the first time on the big screen at the Screening Room in Amherst. Once again, as it seems to have become a yearly tradition there, I have found myself loving it just as much the second time this year. Frank Capra has put a masterpiece onto celluloid here, and that is quite a feat for a holiday niche film. Never dull, always heartwarming, funny, and true, It's a Wonderful Life is truly one of cinema's shining achievements.Sure there is the whole cliché of seeing the world as though you have never existed; the waking up to show how important life is to so many. It's a rendition of Dickens yet spun in a way that makes it its own. The entire film could have run with the gimmick and created a complete story from it, as numerous reinterpretations have done?Mr. Destiny, The Family Man, etc?however, that would have been the cheap way out. Instead the filmmakers have started us at the end, a tragedy has occurred and a man's faith in life is waning. Prayers have been sent above and the Gods have decided to send down an angel to help our hero out of his predicament. Well this angel knows nothing about George Bailey, so for the first three quarters of the movie we go along for the ride to catch up on the life of this great man, just as our angel Clarence does the same. We are shown the life of a man who has given the whole of his being for those around him. With naught a selfish bone in his body, George continues to sacrifice his happiness for the joy to see his friends jubilant. Through his good deeds, he eventually wakes up to the treasures of life that have been in front of him the whole time and really takes a small town from the Depression to a close-knit, successful society. It is almost too difficult to think he could be in so much trouble that he would be contemplating suicide, but once again we see his caring nature come through in that trying, desperate moment. When the story finally catches up to itself we learn that the predicament he is in is actually one of another that he has taken responsibility for in order to see if he can't solve the town's problems again.James Stewart is a revelation here. The self-deprecating nature is prevalent at all times, and the intellect his character contains juxtaposes nicely with the humor and goodnaturedness. Stewart is George Bailey, as the role fully encompasses his being. Every nuance of emotion is etched to his face as he goes from wide-eyed explorer to smitten lover, responsible adult, compassionate son and brother, loving husband and father, beaten failure, and finally redeemed hero and friend to all men and women he has ever come across. Of course what hero can exist without a nemesis of equal power whose immense strength comes from evil? Here we have the loathed Mr. Potter played brilliantly by Lionel Barrymore. I don't think anyone who has ever seen this film can have any real compassion for this man who is truly a scrooge to all. People are numbers and figures to him, which need to be conquered and claimed as his own. Barrymore is despicably slimy and true to his character at all times. There must also be mention of the beautiful Donna Reed as our protagonist's love interest. Her striking beauty and self-assuredness shows why George Bailey could be so taken by her, always getting distracted away from his dreams of leaving Bedford Falls. The sexual tension between Reed and Stewart throughout begins humorously at a dance and after when drenched with water and culminates in a serious and real moment as the love takes over during a phone conversation with an old friend. The relationship is believable from start to finish, portrayed even by the young actors who played their roles as children.True there is a segmented population during Christmas time containing those who watch A Christmas Story, those with a love for Christmas Vacation, and those championing It's a Wonderful Life among many others. I must say that I have been converted to Capra's classic film and would have no problem watching it every Christmas for the rest of my life. The story means a lot of things to many people and has been remade countless times in many forms, (there are chunks of time here which show how even Back to the Future II is ripping it off completely). If you want a perfectly written and acted tale of the joy of giving and the strength of friendship to help show the true meaning of Christmas, look no further than this gem that has endured for 60 years. Yes, I will be purchasing the newly released 60th anniversary DVD?sometimes waiting half a century has its benefits as the first copy I own will be the definitive package available.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie outdoes them all for me. It shows that no matter how downtrodden you feel about your life, your mere presence in this world impacts on the people around you. In George's life, he felt he was a failure and didn't get to do the things that would make him happy, such as traveling, building things, etc..... However, in the end, he learned a very powerful lesson that he did a lot of good in his life and therefore, made others lives better. In the end, he saw that he was surrounded by family and friends and in reality, we don't need anything more! George has many contemporaries today that feel the same way. I, for one, feel that I have not achieved all that I have wanted to but then, I look back on my career and see that I have done my best to impact on others in a positive way. This movie impacts us all in that it shows we are successful if we do our normal jobs to the best of our ability and treat others well. We leave our mark on society without even knowing it just by "being".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has everything going for it: A director with an unshakeable optimism and faith in human nature, a wonderful clutch of players (headed by the sure-footed James Stewart), and a great story. Synopsis: As the film begins, we see Bedford Falls through falling snow and hear the quiet prayers of the locals. They are praying for George Bailey, who is in trouble. We hear the Angels considering what action to take as George contemplates ending his life. They summon a rookie Angel - Clarence - and look at George's life. *SPOILERS APLENTY* George Bailey is a likable young man who wants to leave Bedford Falls and make his name, but every time he tries to get away something holds him back. His father owns and runs the local Building Society, which helps the poor of the area get on the housing ladder and is warm-hearted and generous to his clients. His nemesis is Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore), head of the local bank, who runs a hard bargain and keeps *his* mortgagees in the dirt. After George's father dies suddenly, he finds himself running the Building &amp; Loan, unwilling to allow it to collapse and put the townspeople in hock to Potter. Time passes and George is to marry childhood sweetheart Mary (lovely Donna Reed), but then absent-minded Uncle Billy loses $8000 and it falls into the hands of Potter - and this on the eve of a bank inspection. At his wit's end, George pleads with Potter for help, but the price (all George's clients being passed to the evil Potter) is something he cannot stomach. He walks out into the night and has a drink at the local bar where he prays under his breath, asking God to get him through somehow. All he gets is a fat lip from the husband of a local teacher whom he has upset. Things can't get any worse for George, and he makes his way to the river bridge with the intention of jumping off. We are now up-to-date. Director Frank Capra has spent half the film, if not more - carefully laying out his characters: George, Mary, Potter, Uncle Billy, Bert &amp; Ernie. We have also had a heart-rending scene showing the local drug-store owner's anguish at the loss of his son and the almost tragic consequences of his grief. We know these people - we know that George is an ambitious man who decides his own happiness must take second place behind that of his friends and clients. We know Uncle Billy has had trouble with the bottle and shouldn't really be helping run the Building &amp; Loan. And we know that Potter hasn't a decent bone in his body - the only thing that matters to him is money, and getting his hands on the expanding Baily empire. Capra has made us care. George jumps in the freezing river and prepares for death, but now the *real* story begins! Clarence the Rookie Angel jumps in at the same time and makes a big fuss about drowning - and George being George swims over to him and drags him out. After some 'double-take' comedy as they dry out in the keeper's hut, Clarence listens to George saying he thinks the town would've been better off if he hadn't been born. This gives Clarence an idea - he decides to show just what would have become of Bedford Falls and its people if George hadn't been around. The snow stops falling. It's an awful place, dominated by Potter's bank and seedy clubs. The people of Pottersville (as it is now known) are miserable and mean, and even his mother is a cold-hearted land-lady. The small acts of kindness and generosity that George did now never happened. As they visit the graveyard, George desperately asks Clarence "What's happened to Mary?" This is somehow the emotional hub of the film, as Clarence shouts over the wind "You won't like this George, she's an OLD MAID, she never married!" Forcing Clarence to reveal her whereabouts, George finds her and pleads with her to recognise him, but of course she doesn't - he was never born. It is in this scene that the whole ghastly truth hits George. The emotional punch is terrible, both for George and the audience. Neither he nor we can take any more and back at the bridge he pleads with God to put things back as they should be. He wants to live. He wants his friends back, and it doesn't matter about the money. It begins to snow again. George races home and finds the whole town - all except old Potter - has been desperately worried about him, and the story about the missing money has spread. They realise that without George, without his tireless efforts and his repeated sacrifices, their lives would be infinitely poorer. As George hugs and kisses Mary and the kids, a few friends turn up, bringing with them the few dollars they can spare. Soon, the house is full of his friends and customers and the money begins to come thick and fast. His younger brother - whose life he saved in childhood - turns up having just arrived home from active service and an old schoolfriend wires him cash from abroad. George is back in the bosom of his family, and realises that no man is ever poor if he has friends. THE END. Sorry to take so long almost setting out the entire screenplay, but this is one film about which enough can never be said. The depth and warmth of the characters, the naturalistic acting of Stewart and his carefully-chosen cast, the roller-coaster ride of emotions and the importance of the message (which is delivered all the way through, not just at the end), come together to make the finest, most satisfying and most deeply moving film of all time. It really *is* a wonderful life, and may this film always remind us so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a wonderful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's peak,this movie influenced a lot of directors and ,unlike some of his other works such as "you can't take it with you" ,it is as fresh today as it was 60 years ago.Capra's detractors criticize his eternal optimism but even that is questionable:What would have become of the town,had the hero taken his own life?Was there only one just man ,like in Sodom in Genesis ,to save the city from the impending fall?It brings into question the so-called trust Capra puts in the human race.It's not a rosy world.The scenes between James Stewart and his guardian angel are so powerful you cannot hold back your tears.No other artist told us that ALL human beings were important in such a wonderful way.And nobody depicted the yuletide spirit like Capra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Capra Movie, The Best Christmas Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best Capra movie, the best Christmas movie, the best Stewart movie, the best Reed movie, and the best Liberty Films movie ever. The movie is a great story. It was a success only after it hit TV. It not only gave new visual effect ideas to the industry, it also made the inspirational characters that we see on screen. It's a Wonderful Life was not built for Film, but Capra did an excellent job adapting it to the screen. As well as the actors, James Stewart, and actress Donna Reed. They do an excellent job portraying the characters. The truth is that you cannot see anyone else with the character (George Bailey) than James Stewart himself. The same with Mary and Donna Reed, and the character Clarence. These actors can never be replaced. The writer/producer/director cannot be replaced either. (Frank Capra) If you have never seen It's a Wonderful Life you need to. My family and I see it every Christmas, and I suggest whoever reads this does that as well, it is not only a great film to watch, but its also a great experience to share with your family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most inspiring, true to heart movie that I have ever enjoyed. It is truly a work of love and passion and will be remembered throughout filming history. It has such a touching and moving storyline and catches the audience in a sort of tearful melancholy stateof mind every time it is watched. I have seen this movie no fewer than100 times and discover new idea's and encouragements from it every time I watch it. I don't think that I can truly get into the Christmas mood without enjoying this movie each year. The funny thing about the movie is that I watched scenes from it several times, years ago, when I was channel surfing and didn't stop to enjoy it's warmth. I don't recall why i finally decided to "stop" and watch the movie but ever since that night I have been thankful for the pleasure it has brought to me and my family, friends and associates!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only movie that makes me cry every single time I watch it. Just thinking of the ending makes me tearful. What can I say about this movie. It is just perfect. Story, acting, cinematography, casting and script. Just perfect. For emotion I would say the best movie ever. When I think of Jimmy Stewart this is the movie I think of. It never bores me and is a joy to watch every single time it is shown. Due to its renaissance in recent years TV has been the medium to see the film but we make a special trip as a family every year to go and watch it at the picture house. this not only gives the movie more intimacy but also zones you into the tone of the film. It is a gem, a legend and by far and away my favourite film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen better movie than this one. It has everything you could possibly want: James Stewart, an angel, (or rather, an actor playing an angel) and many other things. Since I first saw this movie, I can honestly say that I will never like any movie better than this one. How anyone can not like this movie is incomprehensible.***Spoilers*** George Bailey, played excellently by James Stewart, is a successful banker. But one Christmas Eve, his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses the business money, $8,000. Desperate, George contemplates suicide, but before he can do it, he saves another man from drowning, who turns out to be his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers). Clarence tries to convince George that suicide is not the right thing to do.George then wishes what a lot of us wish at some point in life - that he'd never been born.He then gets to see first-hand what the world would have been like had he not been born. It turns out that the town he lived in, Bedford Falls, would have been called "Pottersville", named after Mr. Potter, a rich and mean man, who actually was the one who found - and kept - the money that Uncle Billy had found.George then wishes back his life, and it turns out to be better than he'd ever imagined.This is a classic. No movie can top this movie on my list, no matter how hard anyone tries.The best time of year to watch this movie is Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one, I mean, NO ONE can make a movie as good as this one. It's all but impossible to remove as my #1 favorite movie.James Steart puts on his best performance as George Bailey, a banker who wants nothing more than to leave his home town of Bedford Falls. Little does he know that while he's there, he makes a tremendous influence on everyone in his town. Even the town Grinch, Mr. Potter, can't stop George from helping others. George sacrifices most of his dreams to make others happy.After a horrible event on one cold Christmas Eve, George contemplates suicide. He ends up "saving" his guardian angel, who tries to convince George that he had done many good things. He then shows George a vision: we see, along with George, what the world would have been like had he not been born. Through this "vision", we see that George really had a wonderful life.What makes this movie really good is what we see in the Tom Sawyer book at the end: "Remember, George, no man is a failure who has friends," with the word "no" underlined.This is the best Christms movie. The best time to watch it is Christmas Eve, right before going to bed. If you like James Stewart, you will LOVE this movie. Don't miss it! This movie gets a perfect 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life has earned its place in film history. A beautifully shot film with grand performances and a script that has its heart and mind in the right place, this film certainly is the best Christmas film. It also ranks as one of the must-sees when studying the classics of film.James Stewart is at the top of his game as George Bailey, the man who sacrificed his dreams because he was truly a good man and nearly gave up because he couldn't see it. With steady handed direction from Frank Capra and a host of truly fantastic performances by Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell and Henry Travers, this film never weakens from start to finish.It's a Wonderful Life offers a truly important message for all people to take to heart. It is hard to imagine that a film that centers around someone contemplating suicide could be such a perfect Christmas story, but when one takes into account how much George Bailey gives in his life, it makes sense to center it around Christmas. The film itself is a gift to any fan of good cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this film to do it justice? This really is a masterpiece that sadly not enough people have seen due to it's age. But this really is a story that no matter how many times I watch it, I always get lost and emotionally attached to George Bailey's story. It really is timeless and great look at all that is good and inspiring about humanity. For viewers to love a film so much can only show what genius went into making the film. Frank Capra use of the best story that i have ever come across is brilliant, with the structure and the great editing to keep the viewer on a rollarcoaster of emotions, as although this is one of the greatest feel good films, there are many dark moments to create this feeling. James Stewart also is purely acting at it's very best in this film to show why he should stand up with the great's of film acting history.

		<fullReview>This has got to be the top feel good movie of all time. For George Bailey ,all round nice guy and reluctantl businessman things have hit an all time low and he is about to end his life.Help comes from above in the shape of rookie angel Clarence Oddbody,played superbly by Henry Travers,who has been waiting 200 years to get his wings. George Bailey is shown what life would have been like if he had never been born and realises that every man's life touches someone else's life and that we are all here for a reason. The film is filled with great character actors from that era including,Donna Reed,Lionel Barrymore and Thomas Mitchell. This film has one thing that modern movies don't have and that is the faith factor.This the simple belief that family,friends and the supernatural do have a profound effect on our lives and that even when life is at it's lowest,faith still counts and the good guy can still win</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For my money, there is no better film that this one. Excellent acting all around, including one of Jimmy Stewart's best performances. An uplifting film and I think the most heartwarming conclusion of any film in history. Hard to believe it didn't do well when it first came out in 1946. An excellent lesson in failure and redemption. A great movie not only for Christmas, but any day of the year. Donna Reed is excellent as Stewart's wife, and Lionel Barrymore is outstanding as the greedy banker. And of course, there is an angel, but if you haven't seen it (I can't imagine anyone who hasn't) I won't spoil it for you. I have watched this film countless times and never get tired of it, and I can't think of very many films I can say that about. Not only a must see, but a must own in your library!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to capture exactly why It's a Wonderful Life is such a fantastic film. On the surface, its sentimentality may seem overboard, its view of the world grossly idealised, but somehow it all comes together perfectly. I had for many years not bothered watching it, as it is portrayed as the stereotypical Christmas movie (not a genre I have any particular fondness for). After finally getting around to seeing this film several years ago, I went straight out and bought it on tape. Likewise, the first time I saw it on DVD I purchased it straight away. This is both an uplifting and edifying film to watch.This film had a profound effect upon the way I see the world. If ever there was the perfect role model for how to behave like a decent human being, it is George Bailey.This is, and always shall be one of my top ten films of all time. If you have never seen it I highly recommend doing so. Don't be put off by its age, it is one of the truly timeless works of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Librarians, Boogie Woogie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this again yesterday. I've been sucked into watching this (sometimes up to eight times when it was still public domain) every December for about 40 years. It's that good.I always enjoy this movie, but there are two and a half elements that stop me cold, leave me cold, make me not like the scenes I'm watching:1) The climactic horror that Mary is a librarian. And presumably single. And wearing white lipstick before 1964. Alternate scenarios? An early death? An an abusive marriage? At least she wouldn't be an "old maid." 2) That the music in the bar sucks because George exists. I guess the "Bailey exists" music is coming from the juka boxa of final scene fame. Martini's is depicted as a reasonably earthy neighborhood bar otherwise, with forties guys in hats ordering shots, but their audio ambiance is Deanna Durbin. If George had not been born the bar would have been a tougher hangout, but there would have been a live piano player performing good boogie-woogie.1/2) Since it's not integral to George not being born, this doesn't divert me quite as much: Annie's idiotic line about "savi'n' up for a divorce i'f'n I ever get married" is the sort of "humor" that mars movies up to the sixties. Capra has mitigated this somewhat, it's Annie's only embarrassingly stupid line, and he shows sane African-Americans, albeit only as as extras, in other scenes. For a brief example, an attractive, not overweight/mammyish, 40's "New Negro" lady donates money to the George basket soon after Annie's "comic" turn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tip toeing around a classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate writing reviews for films such as this. But I must do it, as a movie goer and fan. Whether I love it or hate, people can be very touchy when you try to critique an absolute classic. Capra's It's A Wonderful Life is definitely that.The timeless Christmas story about a man named George Bailey who has always been handed the short end of the stick but has persevered through it and never complained. He lost his hearing in one ear, had his college dreams halted, travel plans stopped, all to help out other people. He's a good decent man but never has he been rewarded for his decency. Finally his good cheer and helping others catches up to him and in one swoop it appears his father's business, all it's clients, his family, everything is on the line and he could go to jail for losing money. It seems this time George feels he would be helping everyone by ending his life and contemplates suicide on the worst night of his life. Fortunately for George an angel-in-training Clarence must help George realize how fortunate he is in order to get his wings. Clarence grants George's wish that he had never been born and he gets a look at what life would have been like without George Bailey. By the time George realizes all he has effected in his life, he also realizes the only thing important is love, and family, and friends.This amazing Epic as I will call it clocks in at an impressive 2 1/2 hours and doesn't apologize for it and doesn't need to. Nothing is left to the imagination as we watch the entire life of George Bailey, from beginning to his current situation. We see the major events that shaped him into a man, falling in love, his children, his job, his dreams, his aspirations. We become so incredibly attached to Bailey that we are right there with him. Capra creates a character that is unforgettable and then builds this amazing little world of Bedford falls around Bailey. The characters within George's life are no less realistic to the viewer. We feel like we know everyone, know the little town and we are right there. Jimmy Stewart, one of the all time greats is probably the best person to suck us in and make us love him even without Bailey's amazing character. Capra managed to bring on board some amazing actors for the time and it brings the film to life. I waited until I was 22 to see this movie because I was determined to watch it at Christmas to fully appreciate it and I did. It has blown me away ever since. It's heart felt realism, it's sadness, it's Christmas spirit, it's tone, it's characters. Everything is amazing. This is without a doubt, a true Hollywood Classic.I can't find a single bad word to say about this movie. Some might find it boring but everything that is in the film is so vital to the story that it must be left in. The dark edge to the film which is necessary in order to truly scare George back to his senses gives the film a little twist to stand the test of time. I never see this film as an "oldie" because it could happen any time, any where. Go watch it right now!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's A Wonderful Life" is one of the glories of American cinema, to be ranked with "Casablanca", "The Wizard of Oz" and "Citizen Kane", a work of art and entertainment that seems to be destined to last forever.It's a movie that not only doesn't age but gets better with age.High praise for a (deceptively) simple three-act 1940s "Christmas movie" about an angel who comes to Earth on Christmas Day to convince a suicidal man that his life is worth living.The movie opens with a conversation between two celestial bodies as they hear prayers for a man on Earth and appoint him a guardian angel. The guardian angel is shown his charge's life in flashback, up until he stands on a bridge contemplating suicide. Then the guardian angel comes to visit him and shows him what would have happened to his community and family if he hadn't been born. The man sees that (here comes the message of the movie) he has had a wonderful life and that the world is a better place for his being in it.This is a virtually perfect movie. Yes, it is unabashedly sentimental but anything but corny, shameless or naive. It couldn't have been improved in any aspect-except one. The angel in this movie is the soul of a dead man from the nineteenth century. Any Christian child knows angels are beings created by God for companionship before He created humans and are not former humans but apparently the director, writers and stars did not. This movie is theologically absurd and what's worse every single crappy Hollywood movie involving angels coming down to Earth to help humans (like "The Preacher's Wife" spit, spit) has copied this! When I saw for the first time "It's A Wonderful Life" as a 13 year old, I saw it as a lovely and triumphant movie about the difference one man can make in the world. Now, I see it more as a movie about a talented, ambitious, extraordinarily kind man of superior intelligence with big dreams who sacrificed it for a few ignorant, unintelligent, ungrateful and selfish losers. It's unspeakably sad that a man like George is forced to spend his entire life in a small town as a savings-and-loan manager and even sadder that the people of Bedford Falls have so little awareness how much he gave up for them and how much they owe him. Well, that's a true sacrifice, one that is offered willingly and selflessly, whether the receiver is aware of it or not and expecting nothing in return, not even recognition or gratitude.In real life It's NOT A Wonderful Life. One person's life is completely insignificant in his/her own lifetime, much less on the spectrum of seven million years of human history, where it isn't even a fourth of an eye blink. Whatever you may think, you are not important, your life has less than zero impact on those around you, even the closest.It would be a priceless gift to be able to see what you life would be like without you in it. Very likely, it would be exactly the same-the same teacher in the same classroom teaching the same students, the same neighbors, your friends would be the same, the same city. Only your parents would have one child less.To use a line from the movie you think the whole world revolves around you, well it doesn't, in vast configuration of things you aren't a scurvy little spider, Mr. Potter and that goes for you too and for you too, George Bailey.Is life, pointless, useless and insignificant, well living all the same? Absolutely.Life is a great gift from God to the individual and if you had never been born, you would never have been born and missed out on all of it. It Still Is A Wonderful Life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartwarming Tale That's Filled With Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I love the cinema and all the gossip that comes with the cinema, I must confess that I had never seen It's a Wonderful Life until just recently. That's shocking for me because I love movies so much and I'm a big fan of the classics. I had heard that the film was a Christmas classic and one of the most heartwarming films ever made and I must say that everything that people say about this masterpiece is absolutely true. It's a Wonderful Life is filled with so many great things that one cannot feel humbled to be watching such a brilliant film. First of all, Jimmy Stewart's performance is one of the best ever given in the history of cinema. His portrayal of a broken-down loan officer named George Bailey is profound and deeply moving. He captures the essence of the character's personality and makes the audience literally weep for this man. The character of George Bailey is written as if he was the nicest and most generous person you could ever meet in your lifetime. And yet for some reason he is never able to catch a break and every stroke of luck that he receives just vanishes into thin air. Jimmy Stewart is perfect for that part because it seems as if he is just the sweetest guy you could ever meet in your lifetime and to witness him being swallowed into an inescapable black hole of bad luck is heart-wrenching and sorrowful. We feel sorry for George Bailey because we know how great a man he is. So when Uncle Billy misplaces that $8,000 deposit and George is literally petrified of what could happen to him, he loses his mind and contemplates suicide. Without the assistance of George's guardian angel named Clarence (who is only a second-class angel because he doesn't have his wings), George would never have realized just how great a person he really is and how wonderful a life he has. Jimmy Stewart's performance is richly detailed and he plays the nice-guy level so perfectly in this film that it makes the audience cry at the very end of the film. Frank Capra's direction of the film is flawless as always. He uses many layers of film-making to tell us this imaginative story and creates a masterful work of art. There are terrific supporting performances from Donna Reed as George's wife, Mary and especially from Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter. Barrymore is perfect in this film as the villainous Mr. Potter who controls everything in Bedford Falls except for the Bailey Bank &amp; Loan. The scenes with Barrymore and Stewart are absolutely unforgettable and you love to see Potter suffer at the end of the film because he is indeed the meanest man you could ever meet in your life. The writing is masterful and imaginative and gives the film its heartbeat. It tells the story of a man who deserves to be rewarded in life but instead stands aside and cares for the welfare of others. He doesn't realize that his life is worth something until the very end of the film when everyone in Bedford Falls (except Mr. Potter) bails him out of his problem. It is then that he realizes that his ship has come in and he is now being rewarded for all the good deeds he has done. The film is inspirational and makes us realize that we should always have hope because without hope, we can never be able to realize just how wonderful life can truly be. "No man is a failure who has friends" That is the basic moral of It's a Wonderful Life and it teaches us that you don't need money to be happy. The film is not necessarily a Christmas movie but it still preaches the ideology of the holiday and that is what characterizes it as a Christmas film. Indeed, it is perhaps the greatest Christmas movie of all time and one of the best films ever made in my opinion. Thank You Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart for giving us this masterpiece of the cinema.Lenny's Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched this film in about 4 years. But I love the film. Sure, there are things borrowed from previous stories, but there are certainly things unique in this film. Jimmy Stewart was great in his role as the troubled George Bailey. He was not the typical "good-guy." He has flaws. The subject matter is dark which may be the reason the film didn't hit well after WWII. If you look at the movies that were made in that time period, they were upbeat and musicals were hitting their stride----again.I had a problem with the film, though.....When Bert is going after George, why did Bert shoot at him with innocent bystanders in the way? Could you imagine the lawsuits had he hit one of the pedestrians?I thought Capra did a wonderful job with this movie. Geroge has dreams of travelling the world but the death of his father postpones his plans. Then he falls in love with Mary and they get married. On their way to the honeymoon, George is sidetracked again, by the crash of the market. Then George is ready to leave again to fight in WWII and he's sidetracked---again because the army can't accept him the the hearing problem. All the while, George is helping people. He just doesn't realize his contributions until a hapless, wingless angle named Clarence shows him just how meaningful his life is. The end of the movie IS uplifting. It's a fantastic movie with a fantastic cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless American Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** I honestly cannot conceive how anyone who possesses a heart, mind, and soul can detract from this wonderful, brilliant, classic piece of American cinema. Aside from being THE movie to view over and over every Christmas season, "It's A Wonderful Life" is a fantastic celebration of the human soul, and how sometimes when we find ourselves at the brink of disaster, it is crucial to realize that miracles can definitely happen, as George Bailey discovers in his guardian angel Clarence. This is a whimsical, endearing, and somewhat somber story about life in America, and how accumulating enough fame and friends can salvage you from any financial burden which may befall your life. George Bailey is a simple, gregarious, and even pompous figure whose inherent responsibility is to retain his father's banking company and to ensure that his life-long nemesis, the wretched, sinister Mr. Potter, does not succeed in taking over the business and eventually the town of Bedford Falls. We soon learn that an egregious and critical error has been committed which has plunged George's bank into potential bankruptcy and what's worse, possibly jail time. All of this despair and turmoil befall the typically fortunate Bailey and dangerously consume him to the extent that he silences his daughter's playing on the piano, relinquishes his distress upon his loving wife and children, and storms out of the house to get dazed at a bar, and eventually, find himself at the edge of a bridge, contemplating suicide. The story follows George Bailey through times of good and times of despair, so that we get the sincere impression that suicide was once the very last intention on Bailey's spirited and ambitious mind. At an early age, he proclaims to his lover and future wife, Mary, "I'm shaking' the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm gonna see the world", and pleases Mary with such charming gestures as "You want the moon? I'll throw a lasso around it for you". We learn that he has had quite a fortunate and prosperous life, and before his recent downfall, could be said to be the happiest man in Bedford Falls. However, it takes a whimsical and vivacious guardian angel named Clarence to really remind George of his wonderful and important existence, as in reflection, he not only prospered in bliss in his personal affairs, yet also impacted the lives of countless acquaintances throughout the town, some of whom wouldn't even have existed without him, if that is too marvelous to conceive! This is the quintessential American classic, most enjoyed around the reflective, cheery holiday season, that reminds us about the riches we enjoy in life, how we can easily be bereaved of them, and how we might possibly salvage whatever losses we encounter in life. George Bailey eventually learns that it is not the present, mundane, or even discouraging details which define our lives, but the whole of our existence: our contributions, successes, fortunes, possessions, and impressions we achieve throughout our time upon the earth, and to simply enjoy everything we are so very blessed to receive. This is a brilliant, timeless film, featuring wonderful direction, superb acting by James Stewart, an incomparable screenplay, and is just an overall priceless experience to behold. It's one of the most endearing, heartfelt, and important films you will ever have the privilege to view, particularly around the holiday season, when you are reflecting upon what you should be thankful for, and forgetting as best you can, any negative details which try to diminish your happiness. George Bailey: "Isn't that wonderful, I'm going to jail!" This is the kind of happy, fearless spirit we should all aspire to achieve! "It's A Wonderful Life" is a truly wonderful movie. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sweet. So very very sweet. The quality and style of James Stewarts performance in this movie cannot be underrated. His quick wit and dry delivery are perfectly coupled with Capra's directing style and the result is a magnificent piece of artistry that has withstood time and critics alike.The scene where Mr Gower smacks a young George round the head and makes his ear bleed, for me, provides the most insight into his true character. Trapped in his little head, George faces yet another taste of the constant battle between right doing and wrong doing. A way of thinking that embedded itself into his character and ends up being his greatest strength, and paradoxically, his greatest resentment.But he wears it well. I was given a copy of this film as a gift from a dear friend 9 years ago. Sadly this friend is no longer in my life. But I remember unwrapping my Christmas present at the time and thinking "why'd you give me this? Musta been on sale at Woolworths". Today i know. My friend was George Bailey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a wonderful film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, to kick off, i had never seen this film before this afternoon (Im 21), when i decided to grab my mothers copy off the shelf and stick it on. Everyone saying that this was one of those 'must see classics' finally got to me.I was very pleasantly surprised. I must admit i tend to favour more recent films - these days i like to look out for groundbreaking acting, superb camera movement, stunning cinematography etc , but 'It's A Wonderful Life' just goes to show that all that does not make a good film. Its the story, its the characters.Released in 1946, a whole 36 years before i was born, i thought this would just be another film that the oldies loved, but is just no match for todays masterful film-making techniques. I was wrong, and that makes me happy...The film is all in the story, detailing George Bailey's struggle to get out of his small town, but always putting others before himself and continually sacrificing his chance to live his own life and see the world. By the end, his life takes a nasty turn or two, and he ends up considering suicide to make available his life insurance money to help his family - until a gentle angel named Clarence arrives to show him what life in his town would be like if he was never around...Very well acted (for its era) and very well told, 'It's A Wonderful Life' really is one of the most uplifting films i have ever seen. Frank Capra gently takes us from step to step with our subtly heroic lead, throughout the highs, the almost lows, and the real lows, and you really feel for the guy - He is never presented as perfect - he sometimes yells at his family, his friends, he gets frustrated like all of us, but always does what he can to right his wrongs, and help his townspeople. We like this guy because he's decidedly human, but a good man overall.The films big payoff comes in its finale - after George realises how much he has to live for, he immediately sets about doing just that, embracing his family like he hadn't seen them in years, despite his financial turmoil and seemingly grim future.If this film had been made today, no doubt the ending would be deemed cheesy and unrealistic - today it seems impossible to have a happy ending without the film being accused of taking the easy way out, which is crap - let people end their movie in the way that seems best to them. This film however, though simply shot and unremarkably acted, is truly affecting. George finally realizing that he was cherished and appreciated all along by his friends and clients is a touching moment, and to be honest, i was in tears, crying like a baby with a smacked arse by the end credits.I really urge anyone who has not seen this film to give it a go, even if you think its way, way off your normal movie map. I like Michael Bay films for crying out loud, and i still loved this! Go watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly wonderful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in elementary school when I first saw "It's A Wonderful Life". My teacher (or perhaps a substitute) had little to do in the last day before the holidays began, and so she decided that the class would spend the entire morning watching "It's A Wonderful Life". I had, of course, heard of the film, and seen several parodies and takes on its ending (on Tiny Toon Adventures, for example), but I had never seen the film itself. Seeing that movie was a life-changing experience. Simply put, "It's A Wonderful Life" is one of the greatest movies ever made, and one of the few black and white films that can hold my attention. Jimmy Stewart gives the performance of his life as George Bailey, the humble man from Bedford Falls who sets aside his life's ambitions in order to help others. Stewart is truly phenomenal, even if the spectacle of him playing the "young" George is a bit difficult to accept. Also in fine form is Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, the nastiest and richest man in town. Mr. Potter is the very embodiment of the self-satisfied aristocrat, and an easy man to hate. Donna Reed is great as George's true love, Mary, although (like Stewart) her unchanged appearance despite the passage of many years requires some creative disbelief. Particularly heartbreaking is Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, the good-natured but forgetful man who nearly ruins the family. The plot of "It's A Wonderful Life" is well known, and has been frequently imitated, but never surpassed. George Bailey decides to end his life, and God sends an angel to help him. George then becomes convinced that the world would have been better off he had never been born, so the angel Clarence transports him into an alternate timeline where he did not exist, and shows him how George's selfless life altered so many people's lives for the better. George returns, and is greeted with the results of his compassion. I watch "It's A Wonderful Life" once a year, when it aires at Christmastime, and it always brings me a great feel of renewal. This is a true classic, one that all people should watch, regardless of their faith. 10/10, and a cheer for all those involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is what I call classic Capra and classic Stewart. This is a great film to watch with your family during Christmas time. It makes you think about the things we take for granted everyday and for those who don't have it so good. This film shows how God works in strange and mysterious ways. This film should be in every Christian's video/DVD library.My favorite character besides George Bailey is Charlie, George's guardian angel. He truly does steal the show as George's voice of reason and logic. "It's a Wonderful Life" is a timeless classic that should be seen by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holiday Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's A Wonderful Life (1946- Directed by Frank Capra) I suppose most of us are familiar with this holiday classic. It's hard to believe that on it's initial release the movie didn't really do well at the box office. Jimmy Stewart plays the Job-like George Bailey who gets taught the lesson of a lifetime by friendly angel Clarence Oddbody played by Henry Travers. With Donna Reed playing his wife Mary and a host of other familiar character actors, Capra weaves a tale of the importance of a single human life. Old timer Lionel Barrymore (great uncle of current Charlie's Angel, Drew) gives the quintessential performance of a rich soulless banker.What's so great about this movie after repeated viewing is how well the story is constructed. Every scene ties so well into the overall plot and gives information about the action about to take place or explains events in the past. So many lines from this movie are quotable that it's hard to chose one for inclusion here. Although one of the sweetest is early on in the movie, when our heroine Mary, as a child whispers into her already man of her dreams, George's bad ear, "George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die."Don't rent this video. Buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one movie that viewers need to see during the holidays it is `It's a wonderful life.' George Bailey gives up his dreams for a family and his family business. One Christmas eve he becomes short 8,000 dollars, and considers suicide. Clarence an angel with ` wit of a rabbit, and the faith of a child' is sent down from heaven to help George. He then shows George how he has impacted a countless number of people's lives. The real meaning of life is shown through George's experience and is a message to all people. America today is described as being selfish or greedy. In `It's a Wonderful Life' Mr. Potter represents this idea of America, because he is the business man that does not care about people, only money. This is the complete opposite of George Bailey, who even loaned out his honeymoon trip money to save his business and friends. Mr. Potter is America as the world views it, selfish, unkind, and greedy. But many do not think about the individuals of America who care and love this country and others who live in it. Though Mr. Potter owns most of the little town of Bedford falls, George is responsible for the happiness and lives of its citizens. Many people forget this as they think about America outside or inside of the United States. The acting of `It's a Wonderful Life' is wonderful, the sweet love, and simple mind of Clarence could convince any scrooge to love life. As he takes George through scenes of his life there is never an unkind word and always patients. James Stewart however makes this movie come to life for the viewer. He is a man with a wonderful home, family, and job, when everything seems to go wrong he wonders what good he has done for the world. Every person has asked this question one time or another, this relates the viewer to the movie and its actors. The holidays is a time for love, excitement, and family. This movie emphasizes this concept in such a way that all who watch it are effected. There are many people out in the world that are feeling down or lonely during this time of the year. They may wonder what they have really done, or who they have impacted. `It's a Wonderful Life' demonstrates that everyone is important and needed. It is a message of hope, of which people can look to and remember their worth as individuals.Rating of 1-10 is a 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`It's a wonder life,' is a truly perfect name for quite a perfect film! There is no doubt that this movie is made for any stressed out, overly depressed and wants to give up on life too soon, kind of person. Don't be scared though, this movie isn't depressingly sad or makes you want to go home and slit your wrest. `It's a wonderful life,' is quiet happy and funny for the most part. The film is very straightforward and doesn't leave a complicated mess for you to figure out. `It's a wonderful life' stars, Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore. Frank Capra, the director and producer of the film, does a great job getting the point of the film across to audiences. The title describes itself fully, `wonderful.' The film takes place, for the most part during the great depression and takes you through many time periods. George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) is an upbeat, funny character, for the most part of the movie. George is known by everyone in the town and is well respected. Since growing up there is whole life, it was natural for him to want to get out. Traveling from place to place without a care in the world was his dream. Until he met his future wife, Mary Bailey (Donna Reed). At a school dance, Mary and George instantly fell in love as they spotted each other from across the floor. Though it wasn't until three years later when they got married. They went on to have a family and live in a big and beautiful house, though George wasn't too happy. Things weren't going too well for him, one Christmas eve night. I guess you could say things took a turn for the worst and it took one big wish for him to realize, what he had was what he needed! Released in 1946, right after WWII, `It's a wonderful life' was a nice family film everyone could enjoy, especially after such a tragic time in history. Its message gave such a positive outlook on even the most bittersweet events in history. By taking a regular guy, in a little town and giving him problems most people could relate to, the film adapted well with audiences. Besides the fantastic story line, the cast added an amazing appeal to the film. This is a cast that complements each other easily. Jimmy Stewart is a profound actor. He sucks you into the movie so well and brings George Bailey to life. Donna Reed is a delight with her performance. She plays the perfect part as George's wife, Mary. This reviewer loves the cast ensemble and the chemistry flows great on screen. `It's a wonderful life' gives a good look into what Christmas should be about. It's about family and appreciating what you have. It's an old classic with a lot to tell. This movie is an enjoyable family film for all ages. This review gives `It's a wonderful life' an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true Christmas classic, `It's A Wonderful Life' is a poignant, heart-warming story. Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed have great on-screen chemistry, which helps the audience to get involved. Not that it's a hard story to get involved in, it's written well and has a really well thought out plot. There are a few rough spots in editing and one scene that could use a little improvement, but the positives outweigh the negatives and leave the audience mesmerized.  Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed play George Bailey and Mary Hatch the lovers of the story. They have such strong chemistry it's almost hard to remember that it's a movie not real life. To watch the pair grow-up together and to see him reunite with her at a party and suddenly see `Little Mary' in a new light, builds up the romantics and tension until the fateful long awaited kiss. Ah yes, the kiss, which is supposed to be one of the most romantic and emotionally involved moments in a movie turned out to be a dud. Being of the female mind and body, this reviewer was starting to really feel the anticipation of the kiss. There they are, George and Mary, huddling close to the phone, both trying to listen to what the man on the line is saying to them. George smells her hair discreetly, Mary looks longingly at George and they both grow ever closer, closer, closer ?WHAM, a hard kiss on the cheek/lips and a strong hug, talk about the perfect example of anti-climax. Yes, kisses at that time were the strong kiss, sway your head side to side and hug, but this was a little ridiculous for words, this reviewer was truly disappointed. The only other part of this movie that got this reviewer down was the bank scene in which Uncle Billy and Mr. Potter run into each other and have a brief conversation. The problem in this scene was simply editing; it was choppy they would change the camera angle for unnecessary reasons or just cut to the same angle which served no purpose. It was a bit distracting, a little annoying, and gave the impression that the actors may just have had a hard time delivering the lines in this scene so the director had to `cut and paste' to make it work. But that's where it ends; those are really the only things that would be irritating to the audience if they were picked up. The story is wonderful, no pun intended, and tells more of than just Christmas spirit but of appreciating what you've got and who you are because you do make a difference and matter in this world. This reviewer gives this movie top honors and believes that every person needs to watch this movie, especially if they're having a downer day and just need to take a step back and look at the whole picture. As dumb as this may sound `It's A Wonderful Life' really does help you to appreciate that it truly is a wonderful life. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People often forget the true meaning of Christmas. It's not about getting presents or going shopping; it's about what God has gifted you with. Not taking things for granted and appreciating what someone already have. Frank Capra's film It's a Wonderful life is a masterpiece reminding the people who watch it to think twice about what they've received. The characters are lovable and anyone could fall in love with this movie. This film was made post World War II and the American people really movies that touched their emotions and made them feel good.The story starts with George Bailey (James Stewart) who has had anything but a good time and things aren't exactly going his way going down hill. Everyone in the town of Bedford Falls is praying for George to make it through his dilemma. Angels who are represented by constellations of stars or galaxies get together to talk over what they should do. Clearance (Henry Travers) who is an angel who has yet to get his wings is called and is informed about George and is then told of his life. The movie cycles through his life as you watch George and his family struggle to keep their business afloat from the corrupt Mr. Potter. George never seems to be content with his personal possessions but always longs for materials. George has always had the big dreams to travel Europe and the rest of the world his whole life but are all crushed when his father passes away. He is the only left to keep the building and loan running and he is made to see that you don't need all the money in the world to be rich. George struggles to see this until his guardian angel is sent down to help him. This movie will make a person feel things that most films would never make them feel. It really makes a person think of how much movies can sometimes be a work of art, molding and shaping characters and putting you on an emotional roller coaster. This movie gives an awesome life lesson and I would recommend it for all ages. This film gets a 9.5 out of 10 because it has to be one of the best movies ever made. The casting was terrific, the plot and storyline were absolutely wonderful. This film plays with your emotions and touches your heart. Brings up good points about how the world is so stuck on itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler* When most people think of Christmas, they think of Santa Claus, lights, presents, Christmas trees, Jesus Christ, Mary, Joseph, etc. But, do you ever stop to think of the things that you're given? How much you're blessed? Not often. Yet, `It's a Wonderful Life' isn't like the common `happy go lucky' Christmas story. It brings out the fact that you should maybe stop and think of what you've been given?how much God blesses your life, no matter how `rich' you really think that you are. The main character in the movie `It's a Wonderful Life,' George Bailey, grew up in a small town with his father and little brother. Ever since he was a small boy, he'd wanted to get out of that town, so he got a job and saved up enough money to go to college, planning to travel the world. Yet, unfortunately, his father ended up dying around the time that he wanted to go to college, forcing him to take over the building and Loan Company that his father owned. So, he gave the money to his brother who then went to college instead. Eventually, he married his wife, Mary, and had four wonderful children. But, as he found out that $8,000 was missing and he could possibly go to jail, he kept thinking about how horrible his life was?how his house was drafty, he had too many kids that he couldn't support and give wonderful things to, he didn't have a lot of money, he never went to college, etc. So there's an angel who comes down to get his wings and shows George what his life would be like had he not been born. Needless to say, he realized that he touched a lot of people's lives and also realized how much he loved his family, how wonderful his children were and how grateful he was for his life as it had previously been. Clearly, this movie is very wonderful, because it was voted #26 of 250. It takes a lot to jerk emotions out of the audience and that's exactly what this movie did. It made you a variety of emotions. This movie not only found every emotion that it could, but it has good plot and a good moral. It contains every aspect that a great movie should possess and watching this movie would be worthwhile to anyone of any age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Life is smart, legendary, and inspiring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life The snow falls on a dark winter night, and lands on even darker waters. A lone man stands on the bridge above a swirling black river, at the end of his rope. He feels like he would be better off not born at all, so it becomes up to a goofy, guardian angel to show the hopeless George Bailey that the world needs him. George Bailey is played by Jimmy Stewart who is brilliant. The audience follows him through his whole life of dreaming about the outside world, being held back in Bedford like a prisoner. Years later, an unfortunate mishap brings the strong George to his knees. `I'm worth more dead then alive,' George says when he hits rock bottom. On every line, it sounded like Jimmy Stewart believed it. He showed a range of real emotions from love to anguish, and he nailed each one of them. He delivered legendary lines masterfully like, `You want the moon? Then I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you.' Jimmy had a supporting cast that told the beautiful story like it was meant to be told. George Bailey's rival, Mr. Potter, was perfectly evil. He had the whole audience grinding their teeth with indignation every time Mr. Potter appeared on the screen. Because every great protagonist needs a great antagonist, Mr. Potter was perfectly cast and perfectly acted. And what would genius acting be if we the audience couldn't see it? Because the photographers of `It's a Wonderful Life' captured all the great moments very smartly. It showed the story and brought the pages of the screenplay to life, with close ups of George in tears, and wide shots of the quaint Bedford Falls. The sets of Bedford falls were all very charming and a good representation of the times. A time when whole towns were owned by corporations or old men in suits.  The suits and dresses of all the characters were real and didn't take any attention away from the story. The aging make-up on George's friends in the future was believable on everyone except on Marry Bailey. She still looked young as an `old maid', and all the make-up in the world couldn't hide how hot Donna Reed was. Musically, `It's a Wonderful Life' was perfect and timeless. The director (Frank Capra) chose to use a beautiful orchestra with arrangements that matched every mood of the story.  Once in a life time a story like `It's a Wonderful Life' comes along, and when Frank Capra held the pages of this tale in his hands, he didn't let go of it. Frank once said, `I've been waiting my whole life for a story like this.' In fact, he took full advantage of the situation and he made this film into the work of art that it deserved to be. The poignant tale of a man finding hope at the end of a long and hard road, was nothing less then heart warming. This poorly written review isn't worthy to analyze such a masterpiece of the cinema. And a masterpiece can't be enjoyed by reading about it, so I recommend everyone to see this A+ film, `It's a Wonderful Life'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOOD MOVIE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true Christmas classic, `It's A Wonderful Life' is a poignant, heart-warming story. Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed have great on-screen chemistry, which helps the audience to get involved. Not that it's a hard story to get involved in, it's written well and has a really well thought out plot. There are a few rough spots in editing and one scene that could use a little improvement, but the positives outweigh the negatives and leave the audience mesmerized.  Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed play George Bailey and Mary Hatch the lovers of the story. They have such strong chemistry it's almost hard to remember that it's a movie not real life. To watch the pair grow-up together and to see him reunite with her at a party and suddenly see `Little Mary' in a new light, builds up the romantics and tension until the fateful long awaited kiss. Ah yes, the kiss, which is supposed to be one of the most romantic and emotionally involved moments in a movie turned out to be a dud. Being of the female mind and body, this reviewer was starting to really feel the anticipation of the kiss. There they are, George and Mary, huddling close to the phone, both trying to listen to what the man on the line is saying to them. George smells her hair discreetly, Mary looks longingly at George and they both grow ever closer, closer, closer ?WHAM, a hard kiss on the cheek/lips and a strong hug, talk about the perfect example of anti-climax. Yes, kisses at that time were the strong kiss, sway your head side to side and hug, but this was a little ridiculous for words, this reviewer was truly disappointed. The only other part of this movie that got this reviewer down was the bank scene in which Uncle Billy and Mr. Potter run into each other and have a brief conversation. The problem in this scene was simply editing; it was choppy they would change the camera angle for unnecessary reasons or just cut to the same angle which served no purpose. It was a bit distracting, a little annoying, and gave the impression that the actors may just have had a hard time delivering the lines in this scene so the director had to `cut and paste' to make it work. But that's where it ends; those are really the only things that would be irritating to the audience if they were picked up. The story is wonderful, no pun intended, and tells more of than just Christmas spirit but of appreciating what you've got and who you are because you do make a difference and matter in this world. This reviewer gives this movie top honors and believes that every person needs to watch this movie, especially if they're having a downer day and just need to take a step back and look at the whole picture. As dumb as this may sound `It's A Wonderful Life' really does help you to appreciate that it truly is a wonderful life. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>People often forget the true meaning of Christmas. It's not about getting presents or going shopping; it's about what God has gifted you with. Not taking things for granted and appreciating what someone already have. Frank Capra's film It's a Wonderful life is a masterpiece reminding the people who watch it to think twice about what they've received. The characters are lovable and anyone could fall in love with this movie. This film was made post World War II and the American people really movies that touched their emotions and made them feel good.The story starts with George Bailey (James Stewart) who has had anything but a good time and things aren't exactly going his way going down hill. Everyone in the town of Bedford Falls is praying for George to make it through his dilemma. Angels who are represented by constellations of stars or galaxies get together to talk over what they should do. Clearance (Henry Travers) who is an angel who has yet to get his wings is called and is informed about George and is then told of his life. The movie cycles through his life as you watch George and his family struggle to keep their business afloat from the corrupt Mr. Potter. George never seems to be content with his personal possessions but always longs for materials. George has always had the big dreams to travel Europe and the rest of the world his whole life but are all crushed when his father passes away. He is the only left to keep the building and loan running and he is made to see that you don't need all the money in the world to be rich. George struggles to see this until his guardian angel is sent down to help him. This movie will make a person feel things that most films would never make them feel. It really makes a person think of how much movies can sometimes be a work of art, molding and shaping characters and putting you on an emotional roller coaster. This movie gives an awesome life lesson and I would recommend it for all ages. This film gets a 9.5 out of 10 because it has to be one of the best movies ever made. The casting was terrific, the plot and storyline were absolutely wonderful. This film plays with your emotions and touches your heart. Brings up good points about how the world is so stuck on itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stepping away from the holiday clichés attached to holiday movies, Capra delivers It's A Wonderful Life, an original and heartfelt piece easy on the eyes, and entertaining enough for the whole family to enjoy. Focusing more on the ups and downs of life and a the value of having a little bit of faith, rather than Santa Claus and Jingle Bells, this film exposes the audience to a much more realistic Christmas environment, filled with laughter, tears, and heartache. We're not all Barbies and Kens living in a dream house with smiles painted on our faces, we're real people who deal with real problems and this is a movie anyone can relate to. The acclaimed director shows us another side of Christmas, which at times are a little rough on the edges. From financial problems to suicidal tendencies, Capra really knows how to bring the heat to the viewers! One would think that this movie would be a downer since it's plagued with trials and tribulations, but the goal is not to focus on the negative things happening to the characters' lives, but more on how the characters deal with these hurdles in their lives and what good or bad emerge from their actions. George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) is a down-to-earth family man who, along with his eccentric Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), runs the town's Savings &amp; Loans, which was left to him by his father. George fights many uphill battles. One of which are financial problems and the other is one that has lasted ever since he was a boy. Mr. Potter, the richest and meanest man in the town virtually owns everything, except of course, George Bailey's little bank. Refusing to be bought over by Potter, George bailey is content with working hard in order to keep the last honest business around to serve the public. But when George's dimwitted uncle losses a large amount of money they owe to the government, tensions rise which drives George to question the value of his life. He gets an answer, but in the form of a wingless cross dressing angel named Clarence with an eerie revelation... Stewart definitely did an excellent job at portraying both the good and bad sides of George Bailey. You could feel his excitement and joy as well as his heartache and pain. The despair of this broken man really came through when he allowed the audience to see his morale dwindle down to nothing during all of the yelling, binging, and overall decay of the blissful character we first saw. This is hands down Stewart's best performance. It's A Wonderful Life is the epitome of the perfect Christmas movie. Without getting too tacky, the obvious ending is forgiven by this reviewer since it produced a very important message pertaining to the significance of human life and a strong faith within you and God. This movie is highly recommended for anyone who's up for a little uplifting in their spiritual and/or emotional lives.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkest holiday fantasy since Dickens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all its reputation as one of the greatest feel-good movies of all time, `It's a Wonderful Life's' main strength comes from its expression of pain. After a long and charming (but not overly sentimental) buildup, the dark final act of the film comes as a terrific surprise. This isn't a didactic but fundamentally kind object lesson like `Miracle on 34th Street'; instead, the moral gets delivered to us via a much crueler narrative turn. Indeed, the last 45-minute stretch is a spiraling nightmare, with jovial angel Clarence teaching his suicidal charge a lesson by showing him a sick, inverted caricature of his world. It's like a perverse version of `A Christmas Carol' imagined by Rod Serling. Of course it has a happy ending, but make no mistake, the genius of the film is that Capra is not afraid to hurt George Bailey (and by extension to hurt us)--often quite badly. Perhaps the most painful moments happen even before Clarence steps in; the last scene at the Bailey house is one of the most emotionally excruciating scenes in film history, with all of the technical elements (the witty dialogue and camerawork, Jimmy Stewart's dazed, crazed performance and Donna Reed's understated one, and perhaps most important of all, Janie's incessant rendition of `Hark! the Herald Angels Sing') combining to get us gritting our teeth and clutching our armrests in agony. After all that, the resolution comes as one of the most deserved, redeeming happy endings of all time--the audience feels as liberated and transformed as George does. As I mentioned, the sentiment never really overwhelms things; Capra and his (credited and uncredited) screenwriters inject enough darkness into the script (beginning with the Mr. Gower scene), and enough sharp and self-deprecatory humor, too, but most important the director never lets the plot stand still long enough to get treacly. His oft-imitated style looks to modern eyes not to be cheesy or dated, but remarkably elegant. It doesn't really matter how often we see this film; it still hurts, every single time, and in this case that's a beautiful thing. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is a extremely good movie, it starts the movie off by telling a story of a little boy named George Bailey. Of how when he was a little boy and he saved his brothers life, and how he lost his hearing in his left ear. Then it shows him growing up and how he worked at a little shop with this older man and how he was going to give this kid some pills that had poison in them. The only reason this older man was going to give this kid these pills with poison was because he was very upset that his son had died and he was trying to take it out on other people. George stopped him and in return the older man hit him on the bad side of his head making his ear bleed. Then as he gets older works for his father at the building and loan place, until he saves up enough money with his fathers help to go off to college. Because his brother was more interested in playing sports for school, and also George was the oldest son. Well he sort of likes this younger girl Mary but ends up ignoring her as he gets older only because he ended up staying home instead of going to college and he sent his brother. He stayed and worked with his father, because he and his brother made a pact that one would go away for college for four years and then come back and the other would go. By the time George was ready to leave his father had a stroke and died which George could not go to college he must stay home and help his fathers business. As then movie goes on he has some problems but he ends up falling in love with Mary the younger girl from earlier in the film. They have 3 kids, and something happens, his business is short money. He gets so worked up that he walks to the bridge and is about ready to commit suicide, but this other man was already in the water drowning. So George jumps in and as he is sitting talking to this man who's name he finds out is Clarence and that he is an angel with no wings here to help George. Though George has a hard time believing this and he is so frustrated that he wishes he was never born. Clarence grants this wish and as George goes around town he slowly figures out what life would be like with out him. Then he realizes that he had a wonderful life before and he just never saw it, because he was to worried about money. At the end of the movie George returns home to his wife and kids. Then the door bell rings and all of the town people come in and donate all the money they could just to help George out. George got a Mark Twain book from Clarence and it said `No man is a failure, If that man has Friends'. This is a wonderful movie and im glad that I now own it in my movie collection. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in a very good story. Not only does it show that good people do succeed in life but that no matter how things happen you always have your friends and family. It has a romance, comedy, drama, and once you start it you must finish. Though I am not a very big black and white fan I am becoming more of one from films like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the greatest movie ever. Jimmy Stewart is the absolute best! I first discovered this movie as a junior in high school; it was actually part of a school assignment. I was hooked! Back then, it was shown on several stations throughout each day around Christmastime because its license had run out. I drove my family crazy watching it so often. I still love it. I watch it every year around Christmas and once in awhile at other times, too. I finally bought a DVD player this year and, of course, bought It's A Wonderful Life on DVD right away. I can't wait to watch it during my Christmas vacation. Everyone should watch this movie and pass it on to their friends, relatives, children, etc. It's a great movie with a great message. It leaves me feeling all warm and tingly every time I watch, even after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What comes to mind when you think about wintertime holidays? Family? Friends? The endless airings of `It's a Wonderful Life' on television? I personally tend to think of the third choice, but that's just me, one-track mind and all. Anyhow, there's good reason for the constant showings of this movie during the holiday season. It has become a staple of the American holiday tradition. It's like having 4th of July without fireworks. Unthinkable!  Over the years, Frank Capra's masterpiece has gained popularity and has now become a classic piece of cinema. It's a story that's timeless and well crafted. Much like a modern day version of Charles Dickens' classic work of literature, A Christmas Carol. The story could take place even during a different season; it's not just about Christmas. The thoughts about the value of human life reach everyone young and old. A perfect plotline for this type of movie. Jimmy Stewart is the real prize in this movie. He's just one of those undeniably good American actors. He does great work here as the down and out George Bailey. A man forced to find himself and the values for which he stands. Should he follow through with his dream or is everything he wants right in front of him in his hometown? He tries valiantly to save the morals of society from the corporate America symbolism of the rich old Mr. Potter. Things eventually work out, with a bit of outside help. This movie has some definite symbolic themes to it. Personal adversities, how people take their lives for granted, and what good can come from standing up for what you believe in. These themes are very important and not to be overlooked in this movie. Look past the façade of the average Christmas feel-good movie and see what this movie really represents. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Even if you're not a big Christmas fan, such as myself, you'll still enjoy this movie on some level.Overall grade for `It's a Wonderful Life': B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is a well constructed old fashioned Hollywood movie that I care less if I ever saw it again.What turned me off was the whole divine intervention plot device. It's a blatant escape valve that allows Capra to be very cruel to George Baily and get away with by saying "Oh don't worry, God will save him in the end." (Note: Capra does the same thing to both Jefferson Smith and Longfellow Deeds). My goodness, think if someone used that as a plot device in a movie coming out today. The audience would laugh the pic off the screen.So, I have no desire to see this hunk of schmaltz and mediocre acting. If you want to see a really good message pic about helping your fellow man, watch Sullivan's Travels instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film. I came to this film late partly, I guess, because I was under the impression it was OTT Hollywood schmaltz - the "Happy Christmas everybody!" running through the streets is the bit they always show. But the way George's life unravels and his ambitions are thwarted at every turn breaks my heart everytime. The speech (which Stewart did in one take) in which he shouts "I don't want plastics!" gets me crying (a bit) every time.First time I saw this movie was at the Hyde Park cinema in Leeds, England (Gawd bless it) and I was blown away. I came out into the afternoon sunshine in an amazing mood - full of the joys of life - and bumped into some friends who had been fellow volunteers during a short stint I spent working with Bosnian Muslim refugees from the then on-going war in former Yugoslavia. The film: Welcome to Sarajevo. I decided to acompany them.Two hours of reliving bad memories and being reminded of the truly horrific stuff that I was lucky enough not to see saw my euphoric mood in tatters.The most bizarre double-bill ever. The SHOWING TODAY board outside the cinema might as well have read "It's a Wonderful Life" and then, underneath, "Oh no it isn't".Still, thank God for Jimmy Stewart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True and Timeless Classic. It Can and Will Endure the Test of Time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It annoys me to no end to see movies like "My Cousin Vinny" depicted as a "new classic" on certain cable stations. I mean, no way can that movie hold up to TRUE classics such as It's A Wonderful Life. Sure, I can understand certain films being deemed "new classics" considering times change and so do our interests in movies and their plots. But It's A Wonderful Life can and does withstand the test of time and will forever be a True Classic. Very few movies can surpass generation after generation and still hold up as one of the all time best movies ever made. This movie certainly accomplishes that...and this is after watching it 9.2 million times a year around Christmas time for the past 20+ years (only a SLIGHT exaggeration).The acting is phenomenal, and throughout the sometimes depressing story there are bits of humor sprinkled in...simply perfect! Clarence is one guardian angel I would LOVE to have for no other reason than his humorous outlook and childlike demeanor.The storyline depicts a real man struggling to maintain his values and responsibilities all the while putting aside his own dreams, only to find that all he wants and needs he already has before him. He is a real hero in a realistic world and can still be identified with today...even though times HAVE changed.I watched this film time and again growing up and it has become a tradition...like with many families. Now, my husband and I enjoy this movie with our kids and they love it as much as we did. This is definitely a movie the ENTIRE family can watch and enjoy...from the oldest to the youngest. Few movies are able to be so profound, entertaining, and yet still reach out to all audiences. It's A Wonderful Life has done that time and again.A definite 10 stars out of 10 and a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic portrayal of what everyone should be able to experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some may call it sentimental, but I believe it to be one of the greatest films ever made. This film explores a theme which everyone should be able to experience: what life would be like for others if they had not existed. This film conveys the idea that love, family and friends are the most important aspects of life. So many films are about going out and achieving success in greater things then what they have and do not show the importance of home and the things that complete a person. This film shows exactly what a person needs to live a successful life- family, friends and love, and I don't believe that a person could watch this movie and not be at all touched by it.Furthermore, a wonderful story is followed up by a stunning cast including James Stewart with his simple-man modesty, Donna Reed with her girl-next-door beauty and Lionel Barrymore with his tyranical glare, all compliment each other fantastically.All in all, this movie is flawless in its casting, direction and story. I would find it very hard to believe someone who claims they were not at all touched by this story, because it really is a special and wonderful movie which everyone must see, if not for the sheer joy of watching Jimmy Stewart on screen for an hour and a half, then for the appreciation of the values this film is trying to encourage- family, friends and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a wonderful film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this, believe it or not, for the very first time this week. I usually find it difficult to watch old films, some of them don't have the sheer timelessness that films like this and Citizen Kane do. I don't like those old films where people burst into song at the drop of a hat either, its not my cup of tea. Anyway, this was put on in my film studies class and I have to say that it was a fantastically made movie, you rarely see films of this nice natured ilk anymore. It is basically about a guy called George Bailey who feels like he has failed and wasted his life, he figures it would be better if he had never been born. The start of the film introduces us to an Angel called Clarence who hasn't got his wings. He is given a brief recount of Georges life, from his childhood to his adulthood, full of lost ambitions to travel and create. Having been told of Georges life, Clarence must now save him and make him see how important his life is.  I think the key thing in this film is the real Christmassy spirit it has, you don't get that anymore, even in real Christmassy movies, that's because in the last ten years in particular, the Christmas spirit has been falling with the dramatic rise in commercialism and broken families. The performances are great too. James Stewart really does shine here, it is one of the great performances in movie history, from what I have seen, he is really likeable and he is just fantastic in his role, its a real lesson for wannabe actors. Overall I would say that this is worthy of its classic status and I will certainly watch it when it is on at Christmas. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is almost perfect. It is infinitely easy to suspend one's disbelief and be completely immersed in this movie. You forget that those are actors up there on the screen (with the exception of the young Ms Grimes. I'm afraid that I must agree with a previous comment. Surely there were better child actresses available.) Noting that exception, I must say that the rest of the casting was perfect.I'm not going to rehash the plot. I just wanted to make some observances.Possible spoiler:A dissenting comment was written by a person that surely must be extremely naive. It is as follows:"But the worst flaw? THEY NEVER GET BACK THE MONEY THAT WAS STOLEN. It is morally unacceptable that this guy doesn't get punished and the townspeople have to rush in with a bailout."Don't you know, young sir, that for those of us who attempt to live our lives correctly, there are many others living around us that get away with murder and are never punished or found out. The good people of the town of Bedford Falls didn't know what happened to the money. They only knew that they loved George Bailey and were willing to help him out of a bad situation. I wish all the miscreants of this world would be punished. Sadly, that's not the case, so you must give Capra credit for being realistic here.In spite of the untalented young Ms. Grimes, in spite of the water that was supposed to be a rushing river looking like a studio tank that Clarence and George jumped into, I still give this movie a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Ain't Such A Bad Life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Christmas Eve night in the town of Bedford Falls, everybody was saying their prayers and praising George Bailey. The heavenly angels heard them and they knew that night George was planning to commit suicide and he had to be stopped so they sent for Clarence, who was new at this so they showed him George's back story beginning in 1919 when George was 12-years-old. He, his little brother Harry and their friends were sledding down a hill on shovels, but when Harry tried he went on thin ice and fell in the frozen river. George jumped in after him and saved Harry's life, however George caught a nasty cold that rendered him deaf in his left ear. Soon the cold went away and George returned to work at the corner drug store. Two girls, Mary Hatch and Violet Bick, were often in there flirting with him. One day, he got word his boss, Mr. Gower's son had died so Mr. Gower wasn't concentrating on his work and accidentally mixed poison pills with regular ones. George quickly noticed this error and corrected it. George's father, Peter, ran the family business: Bailey Building &amp; Loan, which was constantly trying to be bought out by Henry L. Potter, the richest and meanest man in town. Peter refused to sell to him, but Mr. Potter badgered him and made him look like a fool infront of his son. George's uncle Billy was Peter's partner. Some years later when George is graduating high school. He had big dreams and ambitions. He wanted to see the world and build houses. He attends Uncle Billy's party that night and is reunited with Mary and Violet. He and Mary dance and soon become very close, but then George got word that his father died of a stroke. Mr. Potter tried once again to buy the building and loan, but the board voted him down and wanted George to run it. He had to or else Potter would take control so now George couldn't go to college. He sent his brother Harry though. Mary went too and they returned four years later. Harry had married! George went to see Mary, they fought, made-up and got married and on the way to their honeymoon, there was a run on the bank. Mr. Potter had promised to give everyone their money anyhow but George successfully convinced everyone to stick with this bank and they did! Soon, World War II began. Harry joined the navy. George couldn't participate because of his ear. Harry performed a major act of bravery and was commended. As for George, Mary soon gave birth to a little boy. Soon three more children were born. Things were going pretty good until the present day: December 24, 1946. Uncle Billy was going to make an $8,000 deposit in the bank when he misplaced the money! He couldn't find it anywhere. George heard and freaked out. The loss of that money could mean bankrupcy! They looked and looked and couldn't find the money. George, distraught and disgruntled, went home where he shouted at his wife and children for almost no reason then he went to the one man who could possibly help him: Mr. Potter. Not only did Potter deny George the $8000 loan but said George was to blame for the money's disappearence and called the police. George wandered through town, suffering more misfortunes and everyone seemed like an enemy. He came to a bridge overlooking a roaring river. It was snowing. George considered jumping in and ending all this fuss when someone else beat him to it. It was Clarence! George dived in after him and saved him. Clarence tells George he's his guardian angel and George thinks he's nuts. George says he wished he was never born so Clarence shows him what the world would be like if there was no George Bailey. It was a world George didn't like. First of all, Bedford Falls was called Pottersville, the house George lived in with his wife and kids was a run-down old shack, his friends Burt the cop and Ernie the cab driver didn't recognize him, nor did his own mother! He also learned that his brother Harry had died in 1919 because George wasn't there to rescue him from the ice. George then saw Mary who didn't recognize him. George had had enough. He returned to the bridge and asked to have been born again. Soon, everything goes back to normal. George was born again. He raced through town screaming, "Merry Christmas!" to everyone, including the movie house. When he returned home, he found a wonderful surprise: everyone in town had collected money when they heard George was in trouble. George decided not to kill himself and it was a merry Christmas after all. A pretty good movie. Good to watch around the holiday season. Jimmy Stewart was good, Donna Reed was good (and beautiful), Lionel Barrymore was good, everybody was good!! I don't think any of the cast members are still with us today, but we will always remember them for their brilliant performances in this movie. Anyway, this Christmas, make this one of the films you watch along with Rudolph, Frosty, Grinch and Ernest Saves Christmas. All you Jimmy Stewart fans out there, be sure to see this one if you haven't already! You'll enjoy it! I recommend it!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this on NBC, and I was surprised how good it was. Most movies in black and white bore me, but this movie was different. It is about a man who has many obstacles in his life. He has dreams of traveling the world, going to college,and having a nice career, but it all shatters when he has to take control of his family's business. The man tries his best to support his family and business, but after some money is lost, he becomes desperate to the point of being suicidal. The ending is interesting; I'm not going to tell you what it is, (you can probably just look at another summary to get it) but in the end he realizes that he really did have such a "Wonderful Life".10/10</fullReview>

Then an angel-in my case a gorgeous girl- came onto the scene, lodged herself deep in my heart, and we hope to get engaged at Christmas!!! I'd LOVE to officially ask her to marry me when this film's on!! Then, it REALLY would be "A Wonderful Life"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The golden age of Kansas City jazz enters this movie as George wanders through downtown Pottersville. Hot live music spills from every doorway, what a gas! George stops in the "alternate reality" Martini's bar, and it looks like Meade Lux Lewis pounding out infectious barrelhouse piano! To heck with Bedford Falls, give me Pottersville! Shame on Capra for slandering jazz as evil.Does Uncle Billy keep a free-roaming pet squirrel? Is Capra using the squirrel symbolize that Billy is a nut case?Billy loses the money, and at Billy's house George screams that Billy is going to prison. George shakes Billy by the lapels and storms out. Poor Billy collapses is despair at his desk. There is no comfort from a small Scottie dog under the desk, but a squirrel climbs up Billy's sleeve and tries to give Billy's arm a hug! Priceless!Who keeps a squirrel loose in their home? Can a squirrel be trained to use a litter box? I am serious, IMDB fans, send me a note if you've ever heard of a squirrel kept loose indoors.The crow in the Savings &amp; Loan. Is it left over from a filming of the Poe's "Raven"? Awwwwk! Sit under the rafters at your own risk.Donna Reed lights up "like a firefly" as Mary, in the performance of her career! I wish I could like the angel Clarence, but to me his part is weak. This is not a perfect film."It's A Wonderful Life" is a sappy, corny, sentimental, mawkish old tear-jerker. It kicks my ass! 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How does this communicate to you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this I had the same misconceptions as everyone else about films from this golden age and especially this festive flick. The film fortunately put such doubts to rest. Many will argue it is too sentimental, while partly true, such scenes are handled with the utmost care and NEVER feel cheap. Being from this current generation of cynical drones, this film to me, was a revelation. Capra fills each scene with such feeling and character that one cannot help but feel slightly moved. The film has the perfect cast especially the immortal Jimmy Stewart and the ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS Donna Reed (underrated, underrated). While labelled as a feel good christmas movie, such a label is disrespectful. The film encompasses a variety of values and emotions, from family, faith, hope, love, aspirations, despair to many others. Although it is a universal film and there are some lighthearted periods, there are also scenes of depression and unhappiness(exploiting the talent of Stewart perfectly). If this is a happy, festive film, then it is the most depressing one I have ever seen. Every scene is excellently realised by a director at the pinacle of his craft and furnished with layers of detail and feeling. The film is also complemented by the best cast ever assembled (yep beating all others I think in my opinion). Every performance is refreshing and unlike 99% of all other golden age films from this era, the acting and dialogue is wonderfully accomplished and refreshing and has not dated in the least. Many polls do not consider this to be the greatest film ever after all it has to be something 'cool' something for the 'twenty something generation', something like the Godfather or Pulp Fiction. It effortless surpasses my previous favourites: Shawshank Redemption, Magnolia, Chungking Express, The Truman Show and Memento. These films while excellent do not touch me PERSONALLY in the same way as It's a Wonderful Life. They do not ignite the same sense of joy and euphoria, that little 'magic'. This is cinematic utopia, a film which breaks free from the boundaries of motion entertainment and into the realms of your emotional senses. And it feels nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best filmed performance ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interested in learning everything you need to know about film acting in just over 2 hours? Then observe the glorious Jimmy Stewart in "It's A Wonderful Life." It's all there. Just keep watching his eyes. Ask any actor and he/she will tell you that the secret to good acting isn't what you do when you're reciting lines - it's what you do when you're NOT saying anything. Stewart was the MASTER. Proof? Take a look at the scene towards the end when George turns away from talking to his mother (who in Clarence's world does not recognize him) on the porch of Ma Bailey's Boarding House... oh my GOD, the way he looks into and THROUGH the camera, the film, the walls of the studio, across time and straight into your soul! How did he do it? And to think he never won an Oscar - shows what a sham that whole concept is.So I watched it again for the billionth time this past holiday (NBC actually seems PROUD of the fact that they have a lock on the TV rights and yet feel no pressure to perhaps NOT cram as many commercials as possible into a masterpiece) and a funny thought occurred to me: wouldn't it have made more sense for Clarence to simply tell George WHAT HAPPENED TO THE $8,000 ?!? :-)</fullReview>

Even seeing it for the umpteenth time, I got choked up all throughout the movie. There is no denying the focus of the movie: life is more valuable through the people you effect than the fame and fortune you make. The idea that this is just a Christmas movie is silly; everytime I feel down or meaningless, this movie shows me exactly what life is all about. I want to be George Bailey, because, as brother Harry says "To my big brother George. The richest man in town." Anyone who has not truly watched this movie is missing out on one of the most important lessons of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone's life is important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies ever made, Frank Capra's Christmas masterpiece shows us that even in the depths of our despair, our lives mean something to the people around us. The overall message of "It's A Wonderful Life" is that all lives are interconnected, everyone's life touches so many others, that when one person doesn't exist, it leaves an "awful hole." Capra's genius was that even though he gave us small town stereotypes, they were lovingly human. The characters were nearly all likeable, even when they had problems, and you honestly feel for the misery of George Bailey and the confusion among his family at his plight. In the end, George is redeemed by the people he helped all the time, and Clarence, the guardian angel, finally gets his wings.an outstanding film about redemption and realization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really is a wonderful life, isn't it? How could someone not think so after watching this? One of the few movies that is guaranteed to make a grown man cry, "Wonderful Life" is a staple of the Holiday season around my home. Truly uplifting, very nearly epic in it's message and scope and one of the few unadulterated tear-jerkers, it looks to remain a staple of every new generation. Among Jimmy Stewart's many grand performances, his every-man, uncelebrated hero in "Wonderful Life" is probably his best loved. To describe this movie is pointless--if you haven't seen it, do--if you have, see it again. "Should auld acquaintance be forgot..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Return to Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that Stewart on his return back to Hollywood after the Second World War. If he left Hollywood in 1941 to join the Royal Air Force as a gangling boy, then he returned to Hollywood in 1946 as a grown man. His experience of being near death and witnessing attrocities gave him a new sense of fear and depth of emotion. So much so, that he wasn't just the gangly idiot who couldn't speak properly, he was now a man with emotions that we could connect with and care about. This all began with his first film after the Second World War. It's A Wonderful Life is about a man who's desire is to get out of his home town to see the world. His dream is to move away from the small town that he grew up in to see what the world has to offer. The sad reality is, he never makes it. He is prevented from leaving the town because of his inheritance of his father's business, and goes on to become the town hero. This was a profile that would stick with Stewart for the rest of his career. By staying in his home town, he becomes a small town man with family values and is loved by his contemporaries for that purpose. When he loses the money to pay off the debts of his father's business, Stewart is driven to suicide, and it is at this point in the film (and in his career) where we identify with him emotionally, care for him enough to join him on his emotional and psychological journey, and become a fan of the post World War Two James Stewart. As with fiction, Stewart receives his salvation in the form of an angel who decides to commit suicide in his place (the Christlike figure who dies for our sins in our place), but is rescued by Stewart and they begin develop an intimate acquaintance. The angel reveals to Stewart what life would be like without him, and we experience the haunting reality of a world without James Stewart engaging with the characters of the story. This, more than any other point in the film makes us connect with the whole narrative of the plot, lifting Stewart to a higher level of creative potential. He is no longer the gangling idiot of the pre-war years. He is now the serious actor with a depth of emotion that everyone can connect with. This is the point in the film (and Stewart's career) where James Stewart becomes an 'everyman' in all of his subsequent films. The resolution comes when Stewart pleads with the angel to bring him back to the world that he knows and loves, and when his wish is granted, he appears back into his world (and home town) a renewed and refreshed person. He becomes the 'small town man' for all of his fans with 'family values' at the heart of his character, and every other role that he plays after this film is a progression from the person that he became at the end of the film. Truly, for Stewart, and his fans, it all becomes a wonderful life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film with a Cutting Edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included. It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things. George Bailey is in trouble. He has decided to end it all. The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle. George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities. There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene. George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll. He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living. He has gifts he doesn't realize. He has family. He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is. Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it. His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over. His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank. George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.I love this movie, but I also take it seriously. It can be painful to watch sometimes. The best scenes are the ones where George never existed. His despair is evident and the tension builds higher and higher. When he comes back, such a weight that is lifted. Jimmy Stewart is at the top of his acting form; I loved him as a living human being and as an actor; he portrays the kindness I believe the world should have.And then there is Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, and all the others. They are superb. It's a question all of us have wrestled with: "What if we had never existed?" There is no peer in Capra's canon. I truly believe that this is a necessary part of our heritage. We need to see things as they should be. I love Christmas because it at least portends to be the time we all look at our gifts. This movie is a gift to the world and one we can learn from over and over, even if the events never took place.</fullReview>

One could buy it on 8 Millimetter film for peaunuts.The film woud gradually develop a cult folowing and would be seen on countless occasions during Christmas week. Two of the fims most important forces, Director Capra and Leading man Jimmy Stewart would make frquent talks show appearances and each would name it as their favorite film.Capra would be so linked with the film that his Baltimore SunObituary would read "Its a Wonderful Life Director has Joined the Angels"The film would like the hero would come to be recgonized for its outstanding contribution . For just as George Bailey provided Bedford Falls citizens with "a few rooms and a bath" Mr Capra warms our souls every Christmas and will do so as long as the world has souls that seek warmth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a Wonderful Film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to cut straight to my main point here. Although Its a Wonderful Life is a great film, with wonderful preformances, especially from James Stewart, his portrayal of the young George Bailey is the Forrest Gump of the 40's and from Donna Reed, there is something lacking behind this film. It starts off with Clarence the second class angel being given a briefing by God on a man called George Bailey. The film then goes through certain stages of Georges life. This is all very well, as many of the situations are interesting and amusing. But suddenly, George changes from being a kind and warm hearted man, into a cold and bitter person. This transition happens way to quickly, and does ruin the film. Clarence only appears about 20 mins before the ending, shows George what life in his town would be like without him and then George begins to enjoy life and everythings all right. From reading the plot summary e.g. 'An angel shows George Bailey what life would be like without him', this is totally misleading. Its a Wonderful Life is about George Baileys life and not about how wonderful life is. This final moral only comes at the end and doesn't totally convince, as it people just can take in that for about 70% of the film, George Bailey is a kind person, then all of a sudden he wants to commit suicide. This film should have been longer, showing Georges gradual decent into bitterness, then the other 50% with Clarence showing George how wonderful life really is.I usually feel this way about 'Great Classics' the first time I watch them. You know, I just can't see what makes them so special. I expect after another two viewings, my opinion will have changed completely and Its a Wonderful Life, will be one of my favorite Wonderful Films....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holiday Treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily my favorite Christmas film and also one of my favorite films of all time.The story of George Bailey (James Stewart) who as a young man dreamed of traveling the world and making a difference, until outside influences and obligations tie him forever to his small home town of Bedford Falls. While George endeavors to make a difference in Bedford Falls while raising a loving family, circumstances would once again take a hand causing George to questions what good his life has been and whether everyone would be better of if he had never been born. Thus we have the premise upon which our story will focus with some very obvious debts to Charles Dickens "A Christmas Carol".While the movie wasn't a huge success upon its initial release it would still be nominated for 5 Oscars including; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Editing. And this film has a very impressive pedigree in terms of both its Director Frank Capra and its cast. So while some will see this film as a surprise belated hit I don't think it's really all that surprising.The films cast includes five Academy Award Winners; James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame along with Ward Bond, H.B. Warner and a pair of Academy Award nominees in Beulah Bondi and Henry Travers.The message of film along with its depictions of family, friends and small town life are the great strengths of Director Frank Capra's work perhaps best realized here. Although Capra would not win here, he would earn three Oscar's as best director over his career.As has oft been told, the films popular revival is due largely to a lapse in its copyright in 1974 which allowed local TV outlets to air it for free which made it very popular as seasonal programming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At its center, the film works because we all have wondered what would the world be like if we were never born. Have we had an impact? After all, whether it's leaving behind descendants, works of art, discoveries, or just our name, we all want some recognition, that we mattered, or at least were here. It helps define our sojourn, and allow us to extrapolate meaning from a cosmos which is random, indifferent, and so large and eternal as to defy the meager human ability to fully comprehend. With that as a base desire, the film then goes nearly two hours showing us a life that has many tangents with ours- be you an American, Mongolian, or Zulu. We see the effect George has had, even if he does not, and know what can only await him when Clarence pulls out his life's rug from under his feet- if not the particulars, certainly the general effects, which can only be negative. Yes, George may be more involved with others than the typical person, but we are all connected, however peripherally. This film does a better job than any other film in espousing the notion of The Butterfly Effect, even more so than the recent film of that name. We all see ourselves in George Bailey, for the film does not focus on George's mere home nor business lives, but all the important moments they bound, and even fail to contain. We can easily extrapolate ourselves into his position, especially at his moment of crisis, when he literally, as Potter taunts, is worth more dead than alive- at least on a material level?. This toweringly great film is all about corralling the material instincts and aspects of the world, and using them for the right reasons, while appreciating the values that lie beneath those instincts. The cynics, dummies, and willful misreaders of this film be damned! It is not corny, cheesy, hokey, nor a mere feel good tearjerker, like its many inferior copycats are. Too often the commercials or excerpts that are shown damage the overall film's perception, for it's a synergistic film, whose whole far surpasses its parts. It is great art, period. It is defensible not only on an emotional level, but on intellectual and artistic levels. It is also testament to the fact that great art always rises to the surface, even if bad critics pummel it. This has an extra resonance for me and those who produce excellence with no immediate reward nor recognition. But, even without that, It's A Wonderful Life deserves its plaudits, and your viewership.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime eloquence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart's rendition as George Bailey is staunched, in a heart warming, provocative and emotive semantics, parallelled only in the sublime eloquence that the director has encapsulated an audience for over sixty years. Truly a focal point in the 'golden era' in Hollywood history, oozing and rich in sensual pros, this flamboyant director has mesmerised millions, spurned in conjunction with the diligent personification of co-star, Donna Reed. Perfection at it's best.To coin the phrase, It's a Wonderful Life,is perhaps an adequate sentiment to conclude, therefore no variety of lexical linguistics can do sufficient justice to a movie that has spurned film buffs and critics alike to hail this sublime eloquence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could I say more than "It's just a wonderful film." It really is. It makes cry like a woman ( please excuse me ladies), even if you are the toughest guy on Earth. It does it by taking you through all the psychological states you could imagine, in a very logical and calculated way. You just can't escape it. You cry at the end, and you understand, that Christmas isn't about gifts, it's about the people around you, the one you care about. Watch this movie! Do not expect miracles. No matter how prepared you are, it's better. What's even more wonderful, is the fact that it is in black and white. I love it that way. The shades, the photography is just great. This is one film that should never be changed into color. Thank you, Frank!, Thank you, Jimmy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A life lived for others is a life worthwhile" - Albert Einstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is a classic movie with a simple plot that, now in the 21st century, may seem clichéd with scenes that are somewhat corny, but take into account the year it was made (1946, making it "new" and refreshing, though not necessarily an instant classic at the time of it's release) and more importantly, the message it conveys, and you realize it's more about the message of the piece rather than (as I see it in hindsight) the little quirks that I found so "corny." The opening sequence which turned me off at first initially left me questioning those who claimed this work a masterpiece. "Is this what everyone talked so highly about???" As the story progressed though, I began to enjoy the story more and could not help but cheer on George Bailey (James Stewart), an everyman who sacrifices his ambitious dreams to help others and subsequently, has a huge impact on his town of Bedford Falls.James Stewart is fantastic as George Bailey! This is his first movie after the war and he felt insecure with his acting abilities, but that definitely doesn't show on screen. Instead, he effectively delivers both sides of Bailey's personality: righteous, loving, ambitious, sacrificing and confident as well as bitter, frustrated, with high temperament and vulnerability. These juxtaposed personalities show James Stewarts versatility and raw talent in one of his most beloved roles.Donna Reed, who plays Stewart's Wife Mary Bailey, and Lionel Barrymore, who plays the wicked, monopolizing antagonist Mr. Henry Potter, both deliver fantastic performances as well. Donna Reed and James Stewart's chemistry is believable as seen in one of my favorite scenes-- the "telephone scene." I was surprised to find out it took only one take to film such passion and emotion. And Lionel exudes such evil that you cannot help but feel angry towards him.The acting is excellent, the direction by the great Frank Capra amazing, the scenes breathtaking and set magnificent (4 acres of RKO's Encino Ranch!--see trivia). This film just wowed me on all different levels of technicalities.But on top of all of that, this movie made me see my life in a different light. It made me want to help others more than I already do, just the small things even and appreciate the people that I come into contact with everyday of my life, learning that they have had a major or minor impact on me, an impact nonetheless, and I on them. To want to waste or give up on Life is to waste away or give up something so Wonderful.A movie is truly great if it moves the human soul and this one is one of them. If you haven't seen "It's a Wonderful Life" ... I strongly suggest you do-- during your highest or lowest, it will only bring you up. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over rated because it so darn good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once, in the mid 1980's I was visiting someone at a gated community where Frank Capra owned a home and there he was standing by the guard gate talking with the gate keeper. There was Frank Capra, the director responsible for such films as It Happened One Night, Mr. Smith goes to Washington, Meet John Doe, Lost Horizon, You Can't Take it with you, Arsenic and Old Lace, Platinum Blonde and so many others but as I passed by the first film that came to mind was It's a Wonderful Life. Is this film just too indoctrinated in my mind or is it that good of a film? Well, maybe a little of both but it is that good of a film. Is this film over rated? Maybe so but even at it's critical worst it's still a great film. Jimmy Stewart shines as he leads an excellent cast of Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers, Ward Bond and Frank Faylen among others. This film was nominated for three of the major Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Jimmy Stewart. It was also nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Well photographed by cinematographer Joseph F. Biroc who would have a long career in film and beautiful art direction from veteran art director Jack Oakey with music from Dimitri Tiomkin this is a well balanced piece of American Cinema. It's amazing that Capra, who would live until 1991 would only direct five more theatrical features after Wonderful Life in his long life. My only fault with this film is of no fault of the film itself but because it has become somehow the benchmark of Christmas movies and gets too much airplay during the holiday season while other great and near great Christmas-themed movies get overlooked. It's a little sentimental but dark enough not to be a Norman Rockwell painting on film and as over rated as it has become I still can't give it less than a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who can ever imagine what life would be like without them had they not been born? A very clever idea put to the test in the classic 1946 film, "It's A Wonderful Life."As George Bailey, James Stewart truly shined. Anytime he was about to leave his town, tragedy struck and poor George could never leave.Lionel Barrymore steals the show as a cantankerous businessman nearly succeeding in bringing ruin to Bailey.Donna Reed is marvelous as his George's wife. Remember that famous dance scene as the boards open and the young teens fall into the water? That scene in itself is a classic.If we could only see what it would be like had we not been born. We could see that our beloved ones and others may have lived totally different lives with divergent personalities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My second favorite movie of all time. It is Brilliant and heartwarming, and a movie that reminds you of the value of life and friends. James Stewart is captivating, George Bailey is the ultimate average man, but he always dreamed that he would be a world traveler, go to college, explore and know everything there is to know about life. On Christmas Eve George is struggling, he feels that he is a failure, and wants to end his life. What happens next is what we all wonder, what would life be like if I was never born. This movie truly demonstrates that we are all interconnected with each other, and can never see our own worth. A great holiday classic that reminds you how important you are to your friends and family, and how important you are to them. Heartwarming and beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie during my 6th grade year. The week before Christmas Vacation was a short week and so my teacher decided to show movies that entire week and among them was this movie Its A Wonderful Life. At that time I didn't even know who James Stewart was, and only through Nick At Nite did I know who Donna Reed was.As teenagers tend to do when teachers show movies in school, I fell asleep, but I did manage to catch a few bits and pieces here and there. Years later I saw the movie again on NBC and I was like "this is that movie I fell asleep with in 6th Grade!!" And every Christmas since then I have been hooked I urge anyone who may need a little boost to get them through the Holidays to watch this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why its not a classic to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the premise is that one person's life affects dozens of people, far more than we could ever imagine and that all of us have value and purpose, and there are some religious aspects thrown in. I do agree that we affect people even when we don't think we do and even when we don't even want to.I used to love this movie as a kid but I don't love it anymore as an adult. I don't respect George anymore because in my honest opinion, I think there should be a balance between helping other people and following your dreams. Making yourself a martyr at the cost of your life is not altruistic. At least not to me.Also the movie seems to imply that if the right people don't show up to encourage people that people will give up. Like George is shown that Mary would have become a spinster without him being born. I believe that we should always be our best friends, because someone can't always be there to encourage us.We really carry ourselves through life even though we may have family and friends in our lives, but we really do carry ourselves through life and we just can't give up on ourselves and our own lives just because the right person didn't show up to encourage us. Its great when others encourage us but all of us have been through horrible periods in our lives when no one was there.Sometimes you have to be your own best friend. I don't believe that another human can be everyone's martyr and they show that its okay with the character of George Bailey. Sure its wonderful to help people but to be a martyr? I don't think so. No way. Also its implied that rich people are evil.Why couldn't they have shown another rich person that was nice and decent, to balance out the point of view? Its not wrong to want to be wealthy and a lot of wealthy people contribute to charities. I mean look at Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, and others like them. The wealthy contribute far more to charities than any income bracket. Not all of them are evil. There are good wealthy people too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy Americana (with a somber undercurrent)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heartwarming Frank Capra film which has become (quite unintentionally, I presume) a Christmas perennial. Set in small town America, James Stewart stars as a discouraged and suicidal banker who learns a lesson about life from an angel anxious to get his wings. Fantasy with a holiday theme took many years to garner its classic status, yet it's a shrewd mixture of comedic, dramatic, and emotional elements. Capra's direction is quite sensitive, creating an evocative overview of middle America and the struggling working class. Stewart gives his usual sterling performance, and Donna Reed is a good romantic screen match for him; Henry Travers is the perfect twinkle-eyed old angel. Capra also co-adapted the screenplay based on the short story "The Greatest Gift" (which seems to have a touch of Dickens as well). Later remade as the 1977 TV movie "It Happened One Christmas", which featured Marlo Thomas in the lead. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my generation - the MTV generation - there are certain things its cool to like and things that it isn't cool to like. We have to be able to look at the harder things in life and, if we want to be cool, take them head on. We have to be Fight Club members, listening to Jay-Z and spouting about how we're all atheists looking for anarchy. Luckily, for just 1 or 2 of us, we have a few embarrassing secrets. A few guilty pleasures in terms of music and film taste. On the music side we can see Beach Boys - PET SOUNDS and Elvis Presley or Frank Sinatra (it IS cool to like the BEATLES). But, like the 1st member of a cinematic rogues gallery, ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is the least cool film that has ever been made. BUT - No surprise - this film is magic captured on celluloid. I adore It's a Wonderful Life. It is perhaps my single favourite cinematic achievement. It takes a writer (if I do say so myself) to fully appreciate the power of this film. Recently, I've been working on a kind of Ikiru/IWAL Christmas story and difficulty isn't the word to describe it. Every step you take you have to stop and think "this is so much better in It's a Wonderful Life". Even everything in Ikiru is at least bettered in It's a Wonderful Life if not blown out of the water (but its cool to like Ikiru). As a piece of literature, it's a masterpiece. Every character is perfect and almost Dickens-esque in their individual necessity - I actually think that it is more effective and powerful than A Christmas Carol - and not just ANY film can better Dickens in my opinion. As a film - it is so perfect that I just want to feel it melt on my tongue. I want it to destroy me, I want it to build me back up, I want it to affect me. And it hasn't let me down yet.To conclude, It's A Wonderful Life is one of the most important and satisfying films ever printed. Fantastically abstract storytelling captures a mans entire life with miraculous ease. Barefaced and not embarrassed about any of its notions or characters, its complete lack of pretension strikes a chord with most viewers - it is the kind of movie most film makers are too afraid to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Stewart's most brilliant performance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think we could all relate better to "It's A Wonderful Life" if we lived in a Norman Rockwell type of world or small town where the George Baileys of America live. As it is, we have to take this slice of Americana as the real thing--and that's not always easy, given all the sentimentality on display here.Don't get me wrong. I like the film, but I think it has a kind of warm, cozy, cuddly look that becomes a bit saccarine and cloying by the time the film reaches its fairytale ending. It's impressively acted, photographed and scored and definitely contains one of James Stewart's most brilliant performances. He runs the gamut of emotions in close-ups that show the real genius of this actor. Behind him is a wonderful cast that is with him every step of the way. Donna Reed is especially appealing in one of her sweetest roles.But the Frank Capra/Norman Rockwell touch of small town lives gets a bit sticky at times--especially the falsity of the ending with everyone just opening their hearts to George Bailey. It's all a little too simplistic to swallow, like a pill that doesn't quite go down.It makes excellent family fare and will no doubt continue to be shown every Christmas--quite a tribute to a film that was not even a box-office hit when first released but did receive glowing reviews for James Stewart's performance in his and Capra's first post-war film. Despite its flaws, it has won the genuine love and respect of fans everywhere so let's leave it at that.I can't end this review without mentioning Henry Travers. His scenes with Stewart are the warmest, gentlest and wittiest ones in the whole movie. His Clarence, the Angel, makes the film the Christmas delight it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bailey v. Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An acquaintance of mine recently commented that she thought there was an interesting correlation between this film and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.George Bailey was the man that Charles Foster Kane would have liked to have been. Kane's tragedy was that like a hereditary king, he was thrust into the center of momentous events, and expected to live up to the duties. Unlike George Bailey, though, he had no real nemesis whose punches he had to block. Bailey was trying to better the lives of those around him, by foiling the actions of Potter.Also, while Kane became a more complex Mr. Potter, he never gave up the longing for a more simple life. This, of course, was personified by Rosebud; it was his Persian Flaw, but one which he never revealed to anyone lest they discover a chink in his armor. By contrast, Mr. Potter had no real longing for simplicity. He saw money and power as the only real gains in his life, and didn't care what anyone thought of him. Witness his speech in his attempt to woo Bailey to his side, "...you know I own almost everything in this town and most people hate my guts...". Potter, although powerful, like Kane, didn't have the same goals. He is very much the spider that Bailey says he is.Conversely, Bailey probably could do the job that Charles Foster Kane did. He was capable of handling a stressful job, and once warmed to it, did a good job. Unlike Kane, however, he would use the power of the Press for the common good, since that is his ultimate goal. That's a thought I find most amusing, actually: imagine Jimmy Stewart in the Welles production!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Beautiful Movies of the Cinema History Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the Christmas Eve of Bedford Falls, the guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is assigned to convince the desperate George Bailey (James Stewart) to not commit suicide. George is a good man, that sacrificed his dreams and his youth on behalf of the citizens of his small town. He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive. When Clarence sees that he is not able to persuade George to give up his intention, he decides to show the life in town if George had never existed. George concludes that life is wonderful."It's a Wonderful Life" is certainly one of the most beautiful movies of the cinema history ever. This masterpiece has a touching and moralist story, showing that the famous sentence that a man can make the difference is true. Everything works perfectly in this movie. The original screenplay develops the situation and the characters accurately, using flashbacks and magnificent lines. The direction of Frank Capra is outstanding as usual. The cinematography in black &amp; white and using shadows and lights is fantastic. James Stewart leads an amazing cast, showing a perfect chemistry with the gorgeous Donna Reed, in the role of a compassionate and enlightened good man. Lionel Barrymore is also amazing in the role of the despicable banker. I do not recall how many times I have already seen this film, but last time was 16 Dec 2000. This is the type of movie that a lover of cinema will never get tired of watching many times. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "A Felicidade n?o se Compra" ("The Happiness Is not Bought")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This and "The Wizard of Oz"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thinks of only two films, out of the 100-year history of cinema from its earliest days, that so joyfully embrace audiences' hearts from cradle to grave, as "The Wizard of Oz" and "It's a Wonderful Life." Ironically, it took television, that trust-busting nemesis of the studio system, to permanently embed these two films in the national -- even global -- psyche.Neither film was a financial success upon its initial release. "Oz," because it cost so much to produce, and sold so many tickets to children (at 25 cents a ticket!) . . . and "Wonderful Life" because it was so dark and complex."Oz" got largely terrific reviews at its release. "Wonderful Life" received more mixed reviews.Only with the advent of annual repeated showings on television did "Oz" begin showing a real profit, and "Wonderful Life" become recognized for the multi-faceted perfect rarity that it is.The primal emotional appeal of both these films is so fundamental to the human condition -- and so brilliantly realized in both -- that it's clear why these two works are nearly as much a part of human lives -- not just in America -- as are some of the world's major religious stories."Oz" and "Wonderful Life" are as much a part of our lives as Santa Claus. And our relationship to that jolly old elf changes as we grow year to year, reflecting as much about our own life adventures as those of Dorothy or George.In both films, the archetype is the same: "I want to get home again, but look what's happening to me!" Same theme worked for the ancient Greek dramatists. The theme ALWAYS works, because it's everybody's theme.But look at the difference in treatment, from "Oz" to "Wonderful Life" (which was made five years later, near the conclusion of WWII)."Oz," though dark and frightening enough (thanks to Margaret Hamilton's witch) that the UK required adults to accompany their children to screenings, bounces along on the songs and music and spectacle -- and primarily 16 year old Judy Garland's uncanny performance."Wonderful Life" is something altogether different, more complex and unsettling. Audiences of 1944 weren't prepared for nor did they expect any of this from Frank Capra, Jimmy Stewart (nor newcomer Donna Reed).Exploring the notion of the enormous impact of one's "little" life on so many others' -- through the device of revisiting that life as if one had committed suicide -- is audacious and brilliant! A magnitude beyond the origins of the children's story that was Frank L. Baum's original intent in "Oz."Just as Judy Garland's performance is the heart of "Oz," so is James Stewart's achievement in "Wonderful Life." Then again, one can't remember a false moment from Jimmy, in any film.But Bedford Falls is not over the rainbow. "Wonderful Life" rather rapidly builds from young love to marriage and children to financial problems to ruin in the community to suicide.Huh? Wasn't this supposed to be a feel-good Capra film? Henry Travers miraculously shows up as everybody's favorite personification of an Angel. A Good Guy, obviously, but he has to earn his wings by diverting George from suicide and helping him realize his own tremendous value as an ordinary human being.So we enter the nightmare world of Bedford Falls as it would have been had George not gone on living.And it really IS a nightmare. None of this extended sequence is made "nice" nor glossed over. It touches on the exploitation of the poor, the corruption of power, the triumph of greed and avarice over the Golden Rule and Love, hate, fear, mistrust, alcoholism, prostitution . . .What? In a Frank Capra movie from 1944? All so economically scripted and impeccably designed, lit, photographed, acted, edited and DIRECTED . . . that the film itself becomes the REAL miracle behind the one it depicts on screen.As of this writing, you can still watch the last ten minutes on YouTube.Film-making doesn't get any better.</fullReview>

I'm not sure if it's the themes of the movie(i.e.no man's life is a waste if he has love/friends,everybody has an impact on someone else whether they know it or not,etc.),the innocence of this movie and the era,the sincere,haunting acting or even the swelling(some might say saccharine-sweet)music score. Perhaps it's all of those elements! I'm not really sure and I don't think I really care. All I can say to this is this movie is effective and universal and well worthy of the kind of replay it gets every year(albeit before NBC bought up nearly all the rights of domestic broadcast about fifteen years years ago,this show got MASSIVE OVERPLAY on countless local affiliates and independent stations,which might test the last statement).The life of hardworking,dutiful Savings and LOan manager George Bailey(JAmes Stewart,pretty fresh off a tour or two of duty during WWII;in arguably the more moving performances of his long and storied career)seems to amount to nothing as his work and home-life seem to be crumbling around him. Contemplating the abyss,he is rescued by a dim but lovable apprentice angel named Clarence(Henry Travers)shows him what the world around him would be like without him in it.Memorable and effective supporting performances from Lionel Barrymore(vital and irreplaceable as mean old Mr.Potter),Donna Reed(As George's wife Mary)and various lesser roles that add to the pastiche augment director Frank Capra's most identifiable opus. As mentioned in a previous review I wrote(as well as the summary line),this movie falls very squarely in my category of films that don't fail to make me well-up with tears,and while that might say more about me than the movie itself,I happen to believe that if you take any of the messages or morals of this story to heart,you'll be moved by it,too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie Ever, Ever, Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bless Frank Capra for this most excellent, hopeful, hope-filled film! The themes are eternal: "Don't give up 5 minutes before the miracle," and "suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem," and even, "yes, in fact, miracles do happen." I agree with another contributor's comments in that it is not Christmas until we've watched "It's A Wonderful Life!" Because, in fact, it is a wonderful life, corny as that may sound in such a cynical and treacherous time as we live in. The only part that is still so very difficult for me to watch is the scene with the druggist (when George has yet to deliver those pills). I won't spoil it for anyone who's not yet seen it, but it speaks volumes of a different time that has thankfully, for a lot of folks (sadly, not everyone), passed.This film also cemented Jimmy Stewart as my all time favorite actor (yes, I cried when he passed). He and Donna Reed were just about perfectly cast, at least I can't think of a better pairing. And I cry every single time I see this amazing work of art. It is truly a must-see, one-of-a-kind quaintly classic movie and a priceless gem. And a real Christmas miracle kind of film. Everyone should see it, at least once, even if you must watch it chopped up by commercial interruptions on a major network (yes, I'll go even that far!!!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiration or horror film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This piece of Capra-corn certainly inspires a lot of thought. many of us watch it over and over every single year. It's an institution.But, there are rumblings that it really is a horror film.George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) tells his fiancé Mary (Donna Reed), "I'm shaking' the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world, Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then, I'm comin' back here to go to college and see what they know. And then I'm gonna build things. I'm gonna build airfields, I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high, I'm gonna build bridges a mile long." Mary wishes that he would stay, and he ends up in the Building and Loan with Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) trying to hold off Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Why didn't he just run off with Violet (Gloria Grahame) and have some fun? Maybe if he had traveled like Harry (Todd Karns) and Sam (Frank Albertson), he might have learned some things that would have helped the whole country instead of just Bedford Falls.Oh, well, that wouldn't have worked for Frank Capra, but it's fun to dream. While I'm dreaming I just sit back and watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is now my all time favorite movie. I just finished watching this and I just wanted to say that this is exactly what a movie should be about. Story. While watching this I could tell that this came first. As the story progresses it becomes more then a movie about a man learning to appreciate "God's greatest gift", but you realize that this isn't just a life lesson for the protagonist. It teaches us all that everyone matters in some way or another.All the elements in this film are so well done. The performances really allow you to get in touch with each character. James Stewart was perfect as George. I could feel everything he was going through.No other movie I've seen before has affected me in such a way. "It's a Wonderful Life" is absolutely brilliant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life is my favourite movie. Every aspect of this movie is brilliant, from the script to the acting. It's the ultimate feel good movie, an absolute classic. It has the best ending of any film I've ever seen, which always brings tears of joy to my eye. No wonder this movie was prescribed by psychiatrists for depression. There is something magical about this movie which has never been recreated.I recognised lots or parts from The Simpsons, especially the scene in the bank. I also recognised the Christmas scenes from other movies, such as Die Hard where McClean's daughter is watching It's a Wonderful Life. By no means is this movie only to be watched at Christmas time. I saw it for the first time this year, and then a second time because it was so good. And I've never seen snow in my life and it wasn't anywhere near Christmas time.I've seen the majority of movies that are consistently voted the greatest of all time, and It's a Wonderful is my favourite. It has my full recommendation to EVERYONE, no matter what time of year, and especially if your feeling down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's a Wonderful Life" (1946): It's a wonderful film, and story, with wonderful acting, gorgeous black &amp; white photography, important philosophies... it has everything. Jimmy Stewart was at his best. Donna Reed? What a girl-next-door-babe! Clarence the Angel? Perfectly innocent and effective. Bert &amp; Ernie? I suppose they are a major realization for Sesame Street fans!! The children - fragile and pure. Sam Wainwright - the goofy, life-time friend, no matter how rich he became. Evil Mister Potter? The man we love to hate (hissss!), played by Lionel Barrymore (Drew's grandfather). The rejected kid at the dance, who opens the dance floor for George &amp; Mary to fall in? Remember "Alfalfa" in "The Little Rascals"/"Our Gang"? That's him. You KNOW what "Potter's Field" is slang for, right? It's the generic name given to graveyards for people who died alone, broke, and unclaimed. Uncle Billy? His memory problem is easy for me to relate to, and I've always wished I had a CROW as a bird-pal. Violet? We ALL knew (or know) a Violet...the good hearted gal who relied too heavily on appearances. One of the prettiest photographic scenes is early in the film, when George and Mary are just leaving town in the taxi after their wedding - it's raining, and they stop to look back at what appears to be a "run" on the Savings and Loan. As they peer out the back window of the taxi, THAT is pure beauty. Do I still get misty with a film that I've easily seen 50 times? Yes. When Mr. Gower realizes that young George caught his prescription mistake. When adult George comes home that night shattered, and SNAPS. This film's heart is in the RIGHT place SO often for SO many reasons. I've always shaken my head in amazement at people who saw it as schmaltzy. Yes, it has those moments, but they're at a minimum (and are needed as RELIEF!) compared to the overwhelming amount of loss, frustration, fragility, anger, near &amp; true violence, nasty characters, and shocking realizations. I see it as a TRUE spiritual journey along a suddenly frightening road. It STILL nearly brings me to tears at points, along with amazement at the story, and how it was done. This, and "Wings of Desire" are my Top Two Films of All Time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Better Than This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so few films, contemporary or Golden Age, so rich with morality and spiritualism as this film. Sure, it's based in Christian ideology, particularly Clarence's angelic status; but more than that, it's the journey of a man at the edge of the abyss, seeing his soul and his life, and making up his own mind. It's the ultimate challenge and the ultimate reward.A lot of people criticize Frank Capra films for their cornball style and antiquated FDR leftwing-ery. However, no film better illustrates the basic tenets of human decency and value than this film. Its a perennial favorite at Christmas not only for its holiday-timed narrative, but its affirmation of the inviolable essence of friends and family. George Bailey, in his darkest hour, retreats joyously to the family and friends he at times was convinced had stifled his lifelong ambitions.Some films stay with you for your entire life - this is one of them.</fullReview>

As much as I love Christmas Vacation, Miracle On 34th Street, and A Christmas Story, my personal favorite movie is It's A Wonderful Life. This movie was perfectly acted by Jimmy Stewart. He did a wicked awesome job! In fact, the entire cast was phenomenal! Henry Travers was simply quite funny and grabbed my attention as the lovable guardian angel, Clarence. I certainly wouldn't mind having a guardian angel like him. Lionel Barrymore did a super job as "The Grinch" of Bedford Falls. The movie is exactly as it's titled, WONDERFUL!

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie ever filmed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was all of 31 when I first saw the movie, when my ladyfriend found out I hadn't yet seen it, and incredulously sat me down on her couch, whipped a VHS tape out, and made me watch it on the spot.It's become an annual ritual since; my wife and I watch it during Christmas season, and I still feel warm from seeing it again just a few nights ago.So many other commentators have lavished remarks on this film that saying much of anything else would be gilding the lily, yet two elements stand out in my mind. First off, how many actors were ever the equal of Jimmy Stewart for the depth and quality of his expressions when he *wasn't* speaking? Possibly the dramatic high point of the movie is when Ruth tells George about his brother's career possibilities, and in the moment after she leaves him you can see better than any actor has ever done the wave of bitterness, disgust, the realization that he always has been and would always *be* trapped in the stultifying small town he hates.Secondly, I'm sorry, but any man who sees this movie who wouldn't have married Donna Reed on the spot is either gay or crazy. Her performance radiated charm in torrents.10/10; this movie is the unsurpassable standard by which all others are judged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are going to recommend, give as a gift, watch with your family a movie...this is the film that never disappoints. I've seen this film once a year for forty years and it stirs me to tears every year. If your going to see one movie in all your life this is it. Frank Capra's films are all positive and wholesome (something we've lost in film today). James Stewart gives one of the greatest performances by any actor in any film. Playing the tortured George Bailey in his darkest moments then showing Bailey in the greatest revelation a film character has ever achieved, Stewart creates a three dimensional everyman. He is us. Our failures and triumphs all summed up in one very common man. There should be an exception made in IMDb's rating system. This is the only film I would ever consider an 11.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an outstanding achievement all around. By far James Stewarts best performance ever! Frank Capra has directed a true classic for the ages. All of the performances in this movie were great, especially from Stewart and Henry Travers. His character of Clarence was a total delight to watch, but the true triumph in this movie is Stewart. He is extremely convincing as a distressed small-town man. His performance, like many of his others, should have gotten him the academy award, and so should the movie, but it was beat in both categories by "The Best Years of Our Lives". I have yet to see this, but I doubt that it can even come close to Its a Wonderful Life.What can I say? It truly is a wonderful life! 10/10!</fullReview>

What a Wonderful Life has touched people. Of this I am sure because I am counted among one those it has touched. It is still meaningful to people today and on an ongoing basis.

		<shortDescription>He's a wonderful actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart was in my opinion the first method actor. The range of emotions he encompasses within the film elevates the film from "corny" to an outstanding study of emotions that is true today of middle America as it was when the film was made. The scene when Harry returns with the surprise wife is outstanding. You only see Stewart's face but within that shot you see the realisation that he is stuck in Bedford Falls and all his dreams of travel and adventure have gone. Only Stewart could have done that scene. the only other comment I am going to make on this film is Stewart's own theory of acting. The ability to make the small things believable; to do the things you would do yourself in the same circumstances. A good example of this is when Clarence announces to him that he is an angel. A small laugh and a knowing gesture at the bridge keeper is totally believable - the best tribute that we can pay the man. Often copied but never emulated this film remains one of the all time classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Wonderful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heartwarming, uplifting, and entertaining...quite a combination for a film and that is what It's A Wonderful Life delivers. It's a terrific story, performed wonderfully by a terrific cast. It is easy to see why It's A Wonderful Life has become a Christmas staple and one of the most beloved films of all time.Following the life of George Bailey of small-town Bedford Falls, It's A Wonderful Life actually begins at the end with George contemplating suicide. The angel Clarence is to be sent to persuade George to go on living but first Clarence must understand exactly who George Bailey is. So he, and we the viewers, are shown the life story of George Bailey. We see that young George was a man with big dreams, planning to go off to college and see the world. Then we see the twists of fate which will leave George forever trapped in Bedford Falls and finally we see what has led him to the darkest moment of his life. Through it all, James Stewart is brilliant in the role of George. This is a character who really evolved over time and Stewart's performance is terrific in conveying all the necessary emotions in tracing George's journey. And even when George is at his most desperate and not acting particularly nicely Stewart has been so charming, so likable, so seemingly good-at-heart, you can't help but root for him and that is key to the film's success. When George opines to the angel Clarence that the world would have been better off had he never been born we know how wrong he is before Clarence even gets the chance to try to convince him of just that.While Stewart's George is obviously the key figure the supporting cast is also top-notch, led by Donna Reed as Mary, the love of George's life. Wholesome yet positively radiant and endlessly charming, Reed makes it very easy for the audience to fall in love with her just as George has. Lionel Barrymore gives a memorable performance as the film's one true villain, the rich and rather obnoxious Mr. Potter. Barrymore proves the perfect foil to go up against the basic goodness we see in Stewart's character. Thomas Mitchell as the bumbling Uncle Billy and Henry Travers as the angel Clarence also do fine work. Bringing it all together, director Frank Capra really tugs at the heartstrings and ultimately delivers one of the most uplifting films of all time. Some of the situations and dialogue in the film may seem a little dated, perhaps even a little corny, by our modern standards. And some may feel It's A Wonderful Life is a little over-the-top in its goodness, almost too good to be true. If those are the worst things that can be said about a film then it must be quite a good film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>common bond between '40s movies and '80s songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "It's a Wonderful Life" is one of my favorite holiday movies,despite realizing that it was popular twenty-nine years before I was even born. That can also be a movie to think about any other time of the year besides Christmas. I'm saying that because recently, I've been doing some personal research on a bond between that movie and the lyrics from a song from 1985 by Corey Hart entitled "Never Surrender". I know it seems strange to think that there's a common link between an old holiday movie and a song that won't be heard on the radio for nearly forty years after that film's popularity, but I think there is something symbolic between them. I tell you how some of the lyrics goes:Just a little more time is all we're asking forCause just a little more time could open closing doorsJust a little uncertainty can bring you downAnd nobody wants to know you nowAnd nobody wants to show you howSo if you're lost and on your ownYou can never surrenderAnd if your path won't lead you homeYou can never surrenderAnd when the night is cold and darkYou can see you can see lightCause no can take away your rightTo fight and to never surrenderIf anyone reading this knows that song, you might find the reason why I think it's symbolic for other George Baileys out there.Edward G.

This film is really something of a miracle in that every obstacle - many of the original choices not taking the respective parts - was somehow turned into such a believable film. How amazing also that the film won no awards when it was released, and was only catapulted to stardom by virtue of a clerical copyright error which allowed TV stations to show it for free. The only sad aspect of this film for me is that, even by the time it was made, this was a world that had gone forever.

		<shortDescription>The finest American movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart doesn't merely act this role, as a sad, yet monumentally blessed man of the people. He almost SINGS it, due to his gift for vocal histrionics. This story of one man against the planetary tides of fate is an absolutely thrilling exposition of film excellence. Each centimeter of this movie is filled with Life. That is the sly double-meaning of this movie. I command you to find another movie its equal. This is a movie even the great philosopher Aristotle, and his Poetics, would love. All film-makers, and all film-lovers should fill their souls with this great achievement. It is the archetypal story of grandeur in plainness. But not too plain. It is a Deus Ex Machina, where a little itty bitty man, struggling against evil, is suddenly and magically healed, and yet, finds himself pushing the same rock up the same hill. The Gods have transformed his struggle into a spiritual triumph. Same Old Sisyphus, same old rock. This movie collapses and conflates a monumental struggle into a warm, and sappy and beautiful Christmas card. There will be a long time, if ever, that a movie ever accomplishes as much. I approach this movie the way a grasshopper appreciates a spider's web, once his leg is fatally caught. I cannot escape it. I marvel at the art it displays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful and charming classic movie that makes you feel good to the very end.The story is based a great deal on A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, only in this case it's a guardian angel and not 3 ghosts and it's a good man he comes to visit. The guardian angel shows our hero George Bailey how life would have been without him. When George realises how much he has and how much he's done for others and on Christmas Eve no less, he understands what's really important again. It's inspiring to see George swimming most of his life against the current but always in the pursuit of doing what's right. His selflessness and understanding of others is something in modern society we don't seem to even aspire to emulate any more.If you haven't seen this film you will find scenes you've come across in other movies and never knew where they came from. The film contains so many memorable scenes and wonderful moments that I really can't do it justice. You simply have to see it for yourself.Make sure you have a full 2.5 hours free to watch it because it's a long movie. In fact leave 5 hours free so you can watch it again straight after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think that I can say much more about this all-time classic than the others here have said. I remember when "It's a Wonderful Life" would be listed in TV Guide on several channels at the same time, with the same description. The casting is inspired, from Jimmy Stewart, wonderful Thomas Mitchell, nasty Lionel Barrymore, "Violet" (what a hot number!), down to the smallest roles. However, and I hope this is not a spoiler, the shared telephone segment with Donna Reed and Jimmy Stewart is one of the most erotic scenes I have ever seen in all my years of motion picture viewing. Nothing is happening, but EVERYTHING is happening! Back then they didn't have to hit you over the head with a club to get the point! Jimmy Stewart has never been a special favorite of mine, as Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power, Rudolph Valentino, and James Cagney have been, but at the very end of "It's a Wonderful Life" I suddenly noticed something--God, Jimmy Stewart was so good-looking! That million megawatt smile! Yes, IaWL is corny, mawkish at times, but it delivers a powerful lesson, for Christmas and any time. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life makes us think about our own life and how we shouldn't take it for granted. It makes us realize what the important things are around the holidays. The movie is about George Bailey (Jimmy Stuart), a business man who takes over a bank after his father, the previous owner dies. What he really wanted to do with his life was get out of Bedford Falls, the small town he grew up in, and make a name for himself. After misplacing an $8,000 loan, he contemplates about committing suicide, but instead saves his guardian angel when he falls into a river. Gabriel, the angel, gives George a look at what life would be like if he had never been born. I thought that this was a great movie. The acting was great, and the love story wasn't corny. Stuart could portray so many different types of emotions that made the story seem real. You see his character develop from being an optimist, wanting to get out and see the world, to a desperate business man confused about what the real meaning of life is. Donna Reid played her character well also. She was Mary Bailey and always was by her husband's side being very supportive. At the beginning of the movie she was portrayed as a young girl in love with George and as the movie progressed she matured and became a loving wife and a mother. Reid and Stuart together made the movie as memorable as it is. They had great chemistry onscreen, which made the movie real and not corny. I liked how it was still in black and white and not colored and taken away from its original form. The colored versions of black and white movies just don't look as good as the originals. I would recommend this movie to almost anyone, especially those who think that they don't have anything to be grateful for or who can't seem to get into the Christmas spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's A Wonderful Life is definitely one of the best movies ever made. It is all around a great film, with great acting, great directing by Frank Capra and a very well written plot. This is what a great movie is.The movie is about a businessman named George Bailey whose life and business isn't going so well, just as he is about to give up on things, an angel comes and shows him what life would really be like without him.They couldn't have picked a better cast for this film. James Stewart who played George Bailey gave an amazing performance. He is a well-rounded actor, not only could he do comedy but he also does dramatic very well, and that is not easy to find in actors. Donna Reed who played Mary Bailey ( George Bailey's wife) also did a great job playing her character. Stewart and Reed had very good on-screen chemistry and worked well together. All the acting throughout the whole movie was excellent. Not only did the acting make it a great film, the story also did. The story will make you laugh, cry and definitely think. It's nice to have a film out there that after you are done watching it, you will still think about it.The film started a lot of trends for other films and famous phrases. For example ` Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings`. Even though this film wasn't a huge hit in the box office, it is now a legend and always will be. It is now a tradition for many of people to watch this movie during the Christmas season. You can watch this movie over and over again and not get sick of it. It is definitely a classic everyone should see.This movie deserves 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fabulous. Stewart and Reed come across as a couple that was meant to be together and the "what if I was never born?" question proves this point poignantly when the Angel reveals what happened to Mary without George.Great characters abound outside of these two however. George's Uncle (Billy) is as a promoter &amp; cheerleader for everything good but seems to be good for nothing else. Ernie the cab driver and Bert the cop are the ultimate friends (even if George's trip to the world without him). Sam Wainwright, the boy done good, who needs to be forever reminded where he came from (a point often missed by even those who have watched the film ad nauseam is that George Bailey is responsible for getting virtually every man in town a job by chiding Sam to build his new factory in town ) But Lionel Barrymore steals this picture (other than the final scene) as a man so filled with hate that he willingly does everything to ruin George Bailey. EVERYONE OUGHT TO WATCH THIS PICTURE ONCE EVERY CHRISTMAS - in black and white</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank You Frank Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After nearly sixty years since this movie was made we still have far too many Mr.Potters in the world and not enough George Bailey's. A fairy tail? Yup, maybe but where would we be without them. It's a Wonderful Life is such a great story about good vs.evil and the simplicity of family life. Jimmy Stewart who died a few years back will never be forgotten for many generations going forward and Donna Reed playing his wife couldn't have been done better by anyone else. People who don't just love thismovie are probably decedents of Mr. Potter's As for me,well I am a great George Bailey fan.Directed by Frank Capra&gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily in my favorite top 10 list. I liked Rear Window but I didn't think Jimmy Stewart was very good. However, in Wonderful Life, he was purely magical. No one else could have done better. The 1990's- have produced so many pathetic movies. I get sick of them. The director of It's a Wonderful Life must have amazing ability because no one since the 90's has come close with the exception of Dances with Wolves and Braveheart. I don't know if there is a movie out there that can re-direct my attitude for a long period of time, but this one is the closest. This movie is the ultimate example of "good depression."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Feel-Good Movie of them all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest 'Feel-good' movie ever made and so much more beside. James Stewart gives the performance of his career in Capra's ode to the despair and triumph of humanity.This film is actually prescribed by Doctors to treat depression in certain areas and with good reason too. Bailey's descent into despair is a perfect analogy of modern depression and well, when he finally triumphs, the rush we as the audience receive is almost too much to take.I absolutely refuse anyone to sit and watch this without feeling emotionally overwhelmed by the end - not a dry eye in the house.Don't just think of this as some soppy Christmas movie to flick on TV, treat it as it should be treated, a serious film, with serious and powerful messages. Really a must for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this film once a year since I was about 7 years old, and I swear it's just as good every time I see it. I love Jimmy Stewart. I mean LOVE HIM. His character in this film is so true to life that you feel his tension, his happiness, his pain, his hysteria, and his laughter. Donna Reed is glamorous and lovable. His children are kind of nutty and hilarious; just like most children in life.This film truly illustrates that unanswered prayers are sometimes best, and that the life you live may not be as bad as you once thought.See this movie at least once in your life, it is very much worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one for watching black &amp; white movies. In face, I specifically turn off when one is on. So when I saw the tail-end of It's A Wonderful Life I quite liked it and thought I'd give it the chance when it came on at Christmas a year later. By the end I could only say it was one of the finest feel-good movies ever, and one of the finest movies ever - period. It's a simple tail of a man called George who's reached his wits end with life and feels everything is going wrong. The story is told in flashback from the point of view of an angel, Clarence, who's been sent by God to make George realise certain things, and gives him the chance to see things from a different perspective - of a world in which he doesn't exist. The story is extremely well-told, and the ending will have you cheering. It's heartwarming and was recently rated as one of the top 10 movies ever made by Channel 4 viewers in UK. As rated by the whole of society and not just older people this shows the broad appeal. Your life is not complete if you haven't seen this.A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just love this movie. I've seen it so many times I've got the lines and voices memorized. it just ain't Christmas unless I've seen this movie, although I still have to see it once or twice over the rest of the year. The story is sort of "A Christmas Carol" in reverse as a good man experiences a paranormal event within an alternate reality in order to make him want to live. Frank Capra once said that of all his movies that this one is his favorite and it obviously shows because of the time and effort used to bring it to life. I give this movie ten stars even if every tv series does a variance of this plot for a Christmas special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May be the best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where does one begin to comment on a movie that many people say wonderful things about?I heard about the story that when Frank Capra was asked whether "It's A Wonderful Life" was the best movie that he ever made,he said that it was the greatest movie that anyone ever made.I first saw this movie in college after my classes were over for one day and I went to the movie theater there to see it.I immediately fell in love with this movie and have seen it many times since then.I will say that when Frank Capra said that he felt that this movie was the greatest movie that anybody ever made-HE MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT!Jimmy Stewart was one actor who fully deserves to be called "great".He carried off playing the many things about George Bailey's life in this movie almost effortlessly.George Bailey was a very interesting character in the movies with doing things for many people and making good in his home town of Bedford Falls and not thinking of himself first.Although Jimmy Stewart won the Best Actor Oscar for "The Philadelphia Story","It's A Wonderful Life" was the movie that he SHOULD have won it for.Donna Reed was nothing short of ANGELIC as George's wife Mary.3 of my favorite scenes with she and Jimmy Stewart in this movie are:1) The sequence at the dance at the school where 2 guys open up theswimming pool with the key to it and George and Mary fall into the water as the dance contest is winding down and others jump in the pool after that, 2) The scenes where Mary plays the record,"Buffalo Gals" and she and George are later in a romantically charged embrace by the telephone after Mary talks to Sam Wainright. 3) The scene where,after George deals with the panic involving the run at the building and loan and still has afew dollar bills left over,George sees Mary after both that time and their wedding while chicken is spinning on arotisserie in the room.One would have to be made of stone not to be emotionally moved by the last part of the movie where,after George's uncle Billy unwittingly puts $8000 into the hands of Mr. Potter (wonderful turns by Thomas Mitchell and Lionel Barrymore, respectively)that should have been deposited into the bank, George despairs,thinking that he has failed in his life and wants to end his own life.It is INCREDIBLY TOUCHING in the sequence where George's guardian angel, Clarence(a great performance by Henry Travers),after finding out about George Bailey's life up to that point,comes to show George what Bedford Falls and the people there would have been like had George not been born.It is certainly an indication of how one person's life affects the lives of many others and if that person was not there,it would leave a big hole in the lives of those other people.This part of "It's A Wonderful Life" moves me to tears and can help many people look at their own lives in a new light,especially when one is in despair and feels that their life is worthless.And the icing on that part of the cake is where,after George finds that he has his daughter Zuzu's petals in his coat and runs home to his family to find how much they love him,many of his friends come to his aid to help him in replacing the $8000 that went into Mr.Potter's hands before.The last beautiful touch with this movie is where George,when hearing bells ring(when it is mentioned that an angel gets his wings)sees the message written in the Bible by Clarence saying that "No man is a failure who has friends." Very true and very touching indeed! "It's A Wonderful Life" was a movie where an outstanding cast,a great director,and an absolutely brilliant story came together seemingly like magic to make one movie that fully deserves the description,"classic". This movie might be THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE. I give it a rating of 10 out of 10(and could give it 10 plus signs after that 10 if there was such a rating on the IMDB).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw "It's a Wonderful Life" when baby sitting at my cousin'shouse on New Year's eve of 1962-1963. For almost 20 years after that,whenever asked what my favorite movie was, I responded, "It's aWonderful Life" and saw blank faces which said, "Never heard of it." Later in 1963 I saw a special hour-long interview with James Stewart ontelevision in which he was asked which of his movies was his favorite. He drawled, "Well you know, until recently I didn't have one. But nowwhen I look back on it, I do. And it is a little embarrassing tomention it because it is a film nobody saw. It is called, 'It's aWonderful Life.' It is what we called in those days a fivehandkerchief picture. And there is a scene in it that I now think ofas my favorite scene. It's when I say a kind of prayer."  I started living in Japan in 1971. During the Christmas season of1984 I was in Hawaii for a business convention and was quite surprisedto turn on the hotel television and see not only the film but a reporton the advent of "It's a Wonderful Life" as an American classic.  Now, both the title "It's a Wonderful Life" and the character name ofGeorge Bailey are metaphors for family values and the scene of GeorgeBailey cheerfully running down the street of Bedford Falls seems to popup in other movies whenever there is a scene of a housewife watchingtelevision at Christmas time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every December, I watch a good number of Christmas movies, and this film is no exception. It's a Wonderful Life is a wonderful movie.It tells the story of a man named George Bailey (played by the late great Jimmy Stewart). After all that he goes through, including a financial problem, he becomes despondent to the point where he wishes that he had never been born. Clarence, who reveals himself to be George's guardian angel, sends George to a hypothetical world to show him what the town of Bedford Falls would be like if he had never existed. Needless to say, this hypothetical world is far worse than the real world. Fortunately, George comes to his senses, and retracts his grim wish.When he is brought back to the real world, he is a happy man again. He returns to his family, only to find a lot of townspeople contributing money to help get him out of a monetary crisis.It's a Wonderful Life is one of the most wonderful films of all time. Watch this Christmas classic every December.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gives a Heart to the Heartless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Bailey has become an archetypal hero. He is the every day man, with every day struggles, loves, losses and desires. He wants the world and is given Bedford Falls. "It's a Wonderful Life," has little to do with how wonderful the life you aspire to have, but more about how wonderful the everyday is.George Bailey's journey through the narrative, from that of a young boy saving people in their crucial times of need, up until the deciding factors that lead him to that bridge on the cold and snowy night, exhibit the basic human nature.Everyone has felt at one point or another in their lives that they have hit rock bottom, what this story exemplifies is every little action has a reaction. George may have felt that what he was doing wasn't important, he was miserable to a degree and gave up much of his hopes and dreams. What he didn't realize, and what audiences have embraced for decades, is that he didn't get the dreams he thought he desired, he got the reality which made the dreams pale and weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perennial favorite has worn well with time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and remains one of the few film classics that absolutely, in my mind, should never, ever be remade. The reader may wonder why I don't rate it higher than "8" if I feel that way, but I have reasons.One, the story relies on various conceits to make its point about George's importance to the people around him. Take, for instance, the opening sequence in which George saves his little brother, Harry, from drowning. Later, we learn that Harry grows up to become a WWII hero, winning the Congressional Medal of Honor by saving a troop transport from a kamikaze attack. In Pottersville, however, George's non-existence translates to an unsaved Harry and a transport load of troops sent to Davey Jones' locker. All well and good, but this scenario ignores two things: someone else might well have saved Harry's life, and even more significantly, without George, Harry might well have never fallen into the icy pond in the first place. Similar arguments can be made for virtually every other character whose future in Pottersville is radically altered by George's non-being.Two, the film is rife with a certain nostalgic myopia, painting a vision of American life that really never existed outside of a Norman Rockwell painting.Three, it overtly reinforces supernaturalism and irrationality, depending on heavenly intervention to remedy human error. This is, however, no surprise given the tenor of the times in which it was produced, as well as the very human tendency toward superstition that has been with us since longer than we've been able to write, let alone make movies.However, none of these flaws can overly tarnish what Frank Capra himself identified as his favorite movie that he made. "It's a Wonderful Life" remains a rare gem in the treasury of American film-making, an unabashedly sentimental fable about the worth of the individual and the value of hearth and home, family and friends. It is a fairy tale meant for adults, yet accessible to children. Its language is sweet and simple, based primarily on the vocabulary of love and friendship. Its technical aspects are noteworthy (the fake snow, the elaborate Bedford Falls set, the superb use of Dmitri Tiomkin's score and other music, the fine camera-work), the casting is impeccable (can you possibly imagine anyone besides Jimmy Stewart playing George Bailey?), and of course, the direction is top grade.Scene after scene burns itself into the viewer's consciousness: Mr. Gower's gut-wrenching realization that George has saved him from poisoning an innocent; a grown-up Violet sashaying past George and the boys; George and Mary's first date, and a number of years later, their first kiss (perhaps one of the greatest screen kisses ever consummated); George's breakdown, both at home and at Martini's pub; a callous Nick in Pottersville, banging on the cash register and cackling, "Get me, I'm handing out wings!" The list goes on and on, and no doubt every viewer has his or her own favorites. Myself, I'm still partial to "Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?" followed by "Ah, youth is wasted on the wrong people!" It's incredibly rare to see such a film rated highly by the IMDb crowd, young and male as it is. 50k+ voters and a 42% "10" rating. Astounding! Even the usual gang of pessimists, cynics, and naysayers couldn't rack up better than 5% poor ("1," "2," or "3") votes. Amazing! The one anomaly that intrigues me is the relatively low vote of the sub-18 female cohort. I can only speculate that they had a hard time identifying with Mary, the one character they perhaps recognize as having had more direct impact on George's "failures" than any other. Could it be they are somewhat embarrassed by the machinations of their own gender? All in all, "It's a Wonderful Life" works because we want it to work. It embodies a timeless appeal to humankind's better side, the side that wants to do the right thing regardless of the cost. For that it will always remain a top-rank film to be enjoyed year after year.One small side note: I recently completed a two-month stint in a musical version of "It's a Wonderful Life" in which Clarence getting his wings takes on far too much import. The cast almost unanimously disliked the script we had to perform, primarily because the songs, although pretty enough, failed by and large to advance the plot, reducing the story to its bare bones, discarding or horribly distorting scene after favorite scene, and reducing many characters to barely recognizable caricatures. I won't say which musical version it is (there are several), but I will advise you to avoid it at all costs if you are any sort of purist about the film. You won't be glad you saw it, no matter how well it's performed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, often overlooked, film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People think of Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, Oz, Godfather, Patton, Sound of Music, even Duck Soup - whatever. They forget this.This is a witty, sharply written drama, the antithesis of socialism to answer others here, about the triumph of good over evil, of conservative stability and justice over corruption. The entire town, the whole world, has more soul, is better off, with George around to help counter gross misunderstanding and greedy manipulations of the 'the system'.Potter doesn't believe in people. He doesn't ultimately believe his own rhetoric. But George shares his father's belief that people can better themselves, through hard work, diligence, but with the corruption of 'Potter's rules' removed as a barrier. George represents the American Dream, as always understood. Potter is the oppressive evil that imagines itself to be 'more equal' than everyone else, whether represented as the self-satisfied oligarch or the 'Barbary Coast' decadence of Potterville, with its 'workers slums'. George represents the spirit of self-sacrifice, putting his own dreams aside so that others might thrive, so that 'the system' works for people, and not against them. It's the will of the middle class aspiring not just to home additions, and third cars, but to long-lasting, just and peaceful stability and appreciation of others, shown in so many ways.But there is bitterness. George does the right thing, but still bears a burden. And when his 'silly Billy' literally hands Potter the bank's cash, George is furious and begins to forget that he is loved and admired for putting his faith in others. The irony is that he succumbs to a host of misunderstandings, himself, which is precisely what his role in the community has tended to cure when it comes to others. At his lowest, he loses faith in them by losing faith in himself. And in that confusion, enter the angel.Here's the twist on Dicken's A Christmas Carol. And the angel shows how people suffer, not because of a man's life, Scrooge, but if that man never lived, George Bailey. Without the need to retell A Christmas Carol in that way, they could have cut immediately to the party at the house, and the cash, all the credit, but no angel would have 'gotten its wings'.The Christmas Carol angle is there not just so that George sees that he is loved but so that we see the same in our friends and relatives. The lesson is that even in little things, like the boring life of running some small town savings and loan (cause they still had those), not only might he be better off, but so is everyone who has benefited from being associated with him.It's no coincidence that such a film, and such a message, is associated with Christmastime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many messages come out of this brilliant film. The one that shouts loudest to me is that our minds are so powerful. Clarence's visit changes NOTHING apart from George Bailey's mindset. He still owes $8,000 and he believes he is destined to go to jail. However, he is happy not suicidal because he appreciates he loves, and is loved by, his friends and family...and he thought he'd lost that love forever. George Bailey's paradigm shift is so powerful. There are so many memorable moments. The telephone scene (has there been a more romantic scene in the history of the movies?), George Bailey's desperate prayer in Nick's bar, 'Buffalo Gals' being sung in the leafy street of Bedford Falls following the prom and the closing shot of the film as his friends and family come to rescue George from financial ruin. If you do not cry at this film, you could not have not been concentrating or else you have no heart.</fullReview>

Jimmy Stewart stars as George Bailey, a simple man who has had many setbacks in his life that would crush the normal person, but Mr. Bailey just keeps chugging along making the best of his situation, and then when life seriously has got him down, contemplates suicide. But luckily, the angels have been watching him! As much as I really don't care for Frank Capra's work, I have to say I was won over by this. Jimmy Stewart is of course, nothing but brilliant, and adds so many layers of character to George Bailey. This is a movie for all people down and out, and just don't care anymore, just think of George Bailey, and how useless he thought he was, until angels showed him what a different world it would have been if he wasn't around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George saved his younger brother when he was a child. The incident led to the loss of hearing for his left ear. When he grew up, he planed to leave the town but failed. He inherited the job in bank from his father. He turned down the attractive offer from the local tycoon and served for the poor. One day his bank lost 8000 dollars. That was a big number of money at that time. He was in despair. Everything changed.Although George was talkative and quick-tempered, he was a kind and generous person. He did not realize his worth until an angel helped him. The most touching scene was his reunion with his family. The following donation from the people transformed my tears into laughs.Sometimes we cannot see clearly ourselves. If we can change the angle and think, the situation will be different.A touching comedian classic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man, this works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is absolutely top class story telling at a magnificent level.I get the impression that the attitude in the 20s-50s wasn't that much different that the general attitude today. People were rather cynical about cute fantasy, were out trying to earn a quick dollar, and pined for the simpler times of "the good old days", without quite knowing how to achieve it.There's an old public speaker saying that a good communicator need to "reach people where they're at in order to lead them to where he wants them to go". Frank Capra seems to have developed this knack to an admirable degree. His style of so-called "Capracorn", has this amazing ability to present a strong emotional idea without going **too** over-the-top. Just when you think that a film is starting to get very sentimental, maudlin or "corny"; then up pops a good comic relief moment, or a bit of sharp drama - just to ease the schmaltz back to an acceptable level. It's a real shame that most film directors haven't managed to quite get the knack of knowing when to say an idea, and knowing when to NOT say an idea. When to state the theme, and when to infer it.This technique really works to best example in Capra's top three masterpieces; MEET JOHN DOE, MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, and this movie - IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Anyone who dismisses this story as pure cornball holiday sentimentality really needs to play close attention to how the story actually operates.Lionel Barrymore has for a long time been one of my favorite character actors from the classic Hollywood period, and here he plays the main antagonist with just the right mixture of spite and comedy. And quite frankly, the scene where James Stewart's George Bailey loses it in front of his family is actually quite gut-wrenching stuff; almost on par with the standard hard-hitting scenes of modern dramas. It's just the right amount of dramatic force to stop the story from getting "too cute".Of course there is also the scenes that have now become classics, which occur mainly in the climactic third act. George losing his identity, seeing a new and different Bedford Falls - or "Pottersville" - then regaining his identity and finally wishing everyone a "Merry Xmas". (I was actually quite amazed that most of the film is actually a narrative back story, leading up to the memorable classic moments; and it does in fact work very well in that way.) Combine this with the great fun gym/pool dance sequence and the subsequent bush scene, and you've got the makings of a top-notch storyline; that totally deserves its current status as a perennial classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other side to this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from an era of post World War the world was happy. People needed a `positive' reminder to love themselves. Around comes a flick to inspire this intrinsically need for happiness. Directed by Frank Capra is a movie focused to tough the heart at the average white Christian American.The film in retrospect is about a man George Bailey (James Stewart) going through a really bad time, and chances of going south arise. In the opening scene their was a panel shots of houses with people saying a pray for George. Resulting from this was a shot of two cluster of stars representing two biblical characters, who call for an angel without wings Clarence (Henry Travers). From here most of the movie is shown about George's life and what led him to the now.I felt the movie was great on the acting, sound, and directing. However, I detest the subliminal propaganda conveyed in the story. The movie was definitely intended for the Christian audience by all the good that it brings, when times are hard. The message was good in the interpretation of that one person can effect a great number of people in life, and should be humble, when times get you down. The bad message was that if not for Christianity people in hard times would just die and have no guidance.Now comes my decent. Most people would quickly say this film is the best; I would have to disagree. On the sense that the directing was down rather well. I can't get over how exaggerated it was imposing on Christianity being good. There was no truth except for the simple message purposely link together to mislead the common people. I would never watch this film again, and hope that whomever reads my review sees another side to not just this movie, but the U.S. society. The U.S. has two parts: The majorities opinion on what it should be like, and the minorities opinion on the realities. Though, I will admit that the world is not black and white. There is a lot of shades of gray on both sides, and the majority wins out in the end.</fullReview>

James Stewart could dovery little wrong, but this performance is simply compelling as thesmall town guy with a worldly outlook. The film tests the strength ofthe human spirit, and revels in sentimentality, that is not at all outof place. Barrymore is excellent as the cold-hearted Potter, oozingcontempt and bitterness. Travers is faultless as the heavenlyscene-stealer Clarence. This is not a film about religion, it is a filmabout hope, truth and the depth of the human heart. Expect a straytear to blur the sight.

After an hour or so, I started mentally making notes to classify this as the latter. It was good but sort of plodded along with no great direction. Suddenly, the last third of the film arrives, and everything that went on before fell into place brilliantly. I've never before come across a film where the ending added so many extra marks on, thus making the whole film amazing. Only this &amp; the Great Escape I can truly say have evoked every emotion possible in me from high to low, and I dare I say don't even like James Stewart that much either, but he's brilliant &amp; suited here unlike Vertigo.Everyone in the World should watch this film.Not quite a 10/10 but a very very high 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What bothers me about Capra is that seemingly all his movies have the same vague political message, vehemently delivered, a kind of New Deal digest: thin cats of the world unite! The fat cats are giving you a bad case of Great Depression. That's too simplistic! Think about it: if the powerful are invariably evil, maybe there's something wrong with the system. This movie could be seen as nothing but political allegory disguised as sentimentality. But it succeeds despite itself. The cinematography is stunning, the acting inspired, and it has one of the most wrenching scenes on film: when Stewart meets his wife in the street, a spinster who never met him and who runs away in horror. Overwrought? Perhaps. But also effective. At least two Capra films mention suicide, a most unusual topic in films. The unrealistic happy ending isn't really unwelcome. Who cares about realism? Movies tell us how things should be, not only how they are. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, not sure what Becca37's problem is but she has some issues that need to be dealt with - by a professional.With that said,this movie is perfect for Christmas. What made it so unique was during the 80's when the copyright to the movie expired and it was shown 24/7 by every channel in the area. Now NBC shows it once a year but even then, I will sit and watch it. We'll often just throw the tape into the VCR and have it playing in the background.I can only echo the positive comments made by other viewers. No matter how many times I watch it, I still get teary-eyed when Harry toasts his brother - the richest man in town. Also, I can't sing "Hark the Harold Angels" without first saying "Mr. Martini, how 'bout some wine?" That raises a few eyebrows in church.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I was finally able to watch this classic. Haven't been able to find it on video anywhere (not even at the library!) but just a couple of weeks ago a Swedish TV channel aired it and I taped it mainly because I have almost heard as much about this film as "Casablanca" and other classics. Also, I really like James Stewart and always appreciate him in a film."It's a Wonderful Life" is certainly a wonderful film! It's cleverly made and the acting is brilliant. A pure joy to watch. However, it is no masterpiece according to me because the ending is just too much, the film would have been perfect if they hadn't added so much sugar in the end. Also, I do feel that despite the fact that Stewart's character should find joy in his friends, that he does have the right to feel somewhat disappointed about his life. I mean, he has the right to wish that his dreams could come true. I hope I don't sound too cynical, but the thing about "everything is wonderful as long as you have friends" is kind of true, but not the truth, why couldn't he have friends *and* a nice career? Oh well... A brilliant film nevertheless. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Warning!!! Spoilers are ahead!!!! Do not read if you have not seen this movie!!!*** James Stewart plays a banker named George Bailey. The main part of the movie is a flashback, where we see the main part of his early life. We see him grow up from a small boy of 12 to when he's in his 40's. James Stewart is the best actor who has ever lived. This is my opinion, and you can have yours, but I still LOVE this movie, even though I only watch it 2 times a year at the most. I would watch it every day if I could. If you love Jimmy Stewart, you will love this movie. SHAME on all those who don't like this movie. It has zero profanity, zero inappropriate scenes, and ZERO violence. This kind of movie is appropriate for ALL ages. It is pretty sad that this kind of movie can rarely be found being made today.

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film With A Christian Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was first drawn to this film after reading about it in one of Norman Vincent Peale's books. One can see the influence of previous Christmas stories like "A Christmas Carol" on it and one can also see its influence on more recent films like "Jumanji" (the cut lip and the family get together singing "Hark The Herald Angels Sing"). In his book Dr Peale mentions how critics were divided over on it on its release- some loved it others said it was "too Pollyannaish". However it was released into a world cynicised by the Second World War and the subsequent austerity. It shows that if we care about people, people will care about us. George Bailey is a great guy but not without his faults. He will seek comfort in alcohol when things get very bad and he reduces his children's teacher to tears with an angry phone call (so much that her husband punches him in the bar giving him the aforementioned cut lip). Still, nevertheless his values remain unaltered. He is willing to give up opportunities he has wished for all his life to help others. From an early age he has known right from wrong. This film also shows that as well as people caring for us God also cares for us no matter what our faults and will help us in our deepest moments of despair. Although it was made in the 1940s its message will be contemporary for all time, like that of the Bible. It was James Stewart's favourite of all the films he made and one can see why.</fullReview>

Many questions linger such as the possibility that the poor half-wits of this dinky town would have the funds or the desire to put together a pot of $8,000 cash to help their delinquent friend in his time of stupidity -- I mean, need. It was all for nothing anyway, since Sam Wainwright wires to George three times more money than he owes.... awww, a good Jew saves the day again.

		<shortDescription>One of those quintessential Christmas movies....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

He does it out of guilt since "the meanest man in town", Mr. Potter, will take over if George leaves the city. It's also hard to believe in blundering George after he makes bone-headed mistakes like letting his goofy uncle transport $8,000 cash to the bank. This is clearly George's screw-up, but he yells at his uncle, "Somebody's going to jail - well, it's not going to be me!". It should be you, George.Not nearly as 'magical' a movie as claimed by its many fans. See it, wallow in it, then decide if you want to embrace it, or dump it..... I dumped it.</fullReview>

It was not the feel-good film I was expecting.I admit the ending was terrific and brings a tear to one's eye with an inspiring message but much of the film deals with tough breaks that "George Bailey" (Jimmy Stewart) had to face and also featured a very mean, despicable dishonest man in "Mr. Potter" (Lionel Barrymore). A lot of those scenes were not fun to watch; more frustrating than anything else. The movie has several scenes in which Bailey isn't the best person, either, but it could be argued that everyone has their moments, so why not him, too? Since this is so beloved a film, and such a Christmas favorite, I just expected more of a nice, lighthearted, good-natured story. Instead, I got a very dramatic movie with a number of unpleasant scenes.Interesting that this would be a Christmas favorite when Stewart's character admits he doesn't know if God answers prayer, or if He's even there. All of this coming from a guy who's attended church for years? Well, at least he found out, and it was a good message.The "message" was that everyone's life counts for something, that life is important and what you do with it especially important because it effects not just you but a number of other people many times in ways you could never imagine.To its credit, the story is an involving one. I will have check this out again and perhaps, with a different outlook going into it, will learn to like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes You Glad To Be Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year was 1946 and soldiers were just returning to the states from the war. Among them was James Stewart, an actor who had delivered a knockout performance in 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' and won an Oscar for 'The Philadelphia Story.' But after 5 years, Stewart planned to take a break because he thought he was rusty, and Lionel Barrymore convinced him to do this film. Thank God he did.This was the first older film that I watched back in December and now I have seen well over fifty classic films. This movie is amazing. As you watch the movie, you will begin to truly embrace Bailey. You feel for him in his highs and lows. Stewart gives the ultimate performance, he greatest of his career. Henry Travers and Barrymore are also phenomenal. Frank Capra created a true masterpiece here filled with emotion that will truly get to you. After you have watched this film, you will be glad you're alive, and don't be surprised if you're in tears as well.A true gem of cinema that you do not see often, filled with heart and emotion that is just as rare. I love watching the film at Christmastime, but there is no question in my mind that this movie can work magic any time of the year. So if you're feeling down, or just want to watch one of the greatest movies ever filmed, watch 'It's a Wonderful Life.' An easy 10/10, higher if possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie, entertaining, endearing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my favorite of all time! It's reflects on what this LIFE here on Earth should be... Full of true love - in all types, shapes, and sizes... Shows kindness in every sense of the word... from young children being true forever friends... to grown men doing without to help their fellow man out... Demonstates unselfishness, perseverance, dedication, loyalty, never giving up even in the midst of evil (Mr. Potter, life itself &amp; hard luck)... It shows us all that our lives are so very valuable - even tho we may not see it, hear it, feel it... it shows we all are a most important piece of many lives/many puzzles... and if we always try &amp; keep on trying - no matter what... Goodness will prevail... It's shows us to forgive, not sweating 'the small stuff', really appreciating &amp; loving those who are near &amp; dear to us... see Life thru GOD's eyes... All our lives are truly an incredible journey... so, let's all Enjoy our Journey's... amen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart's It's a Wonderful Life is my all-time favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I first saw this classic in 1981, I've seen an episode of Laverne and Shirly with this premise (it's Laverne who imagines this scenario), a musical version on stage with Ernie the taxi driver-not Martini-owning a bar, and last year a Baton Rouge Little Theater presentation with dialogue almost taken verbatim from the movie. Nothing however compares to the original film interpretation. How can one not laugh when George (Jimmy Stewart) and Mary (Donna Reed) accidentally fall into the high school gym swimming pool after Mary ditched a potential suitor (Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer)? Or not get touched by George's speech defending his late father to Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore)? Certainly the last hour as George feels the world tumbling before him and his eventual appreciation of his life are some of the most tear-and-laugh inducing scenes I've ever seen in the movies or television. It's a Wonderful Life has always been my favorite movie and nothing I've ever seen has even come close. Kudos to Stewart and director Frank Capra for such a life-affirming project. Thanks also to Barrymore, Reed, Switzer, Samuel S. Hinds (George's father Peter), Beulah Bondi (George's mom), Thomas Mitchell (Uncle Billy), H.B. Warner (Gower the druggist), Gloria Grahame (Violet Bick), Lilian Randolph (Annie the maid), Sheldon Leonard (Nick the bartender), Ward Bond (Bert the cop), Frank Faylen (Ernie the taxi driver), Bill Edmunds (Martini), and Charles Lane in his role as the guy who tells Potter about George's Bailey Park plans for filling the picture with, in Nick's words "a little atmosphere". Add to that all the various kid and adult actors I can't remember right now. And finally, special thanks to Henry Travers (Clarence) for making us all believe in angels. No truer words have ever been written as the one in Clarence's book gift (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) to George: No man is a failure who has friends. Though one may quibble about Harry not being saved without George despite other friends near him or Mary becoming an old maid, It's a Wonderful Life is a flawless masterpiece that has stood the test of time for the last 60 years. May it stand forevermore. P.S. Look for the Blondie movie series' kid stars Larry "Baby Dumpling/Alexander Bumstead" Simms (George's son Pete) and Danny "Alvin Fuddle" Mummert (Little Marty Hatch). And Ellen "Grandma Walton" Corby as the woman George kisses in the run-on-the-bank sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best Christmas film ever made from Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Frank Capra. The film begins with seeing most of the past of George Bailey (Oscar nominated James Stewart), before going to the present day, Christmas Eve, where he, as a businessman is losing the plot of life, including living with his wife Mary Bailey (Donna Reed) and his kids. Also, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is threatening George with asking for money and trying to tempt George into buying the Baileys business. When money goes missing, Potter won't help him (for being rude) and he has a fit with his wife and kids, he soon thinks about ending his life. Until he meets Clarence (Henry Travers), who calls himself an angel without wings, he can only earn them by helping George. To prove himself, Clarence grants George the wish that he never existed. When George goes back to town everything has changed, the twon is called Pottersville instead of Bedford Fals, members of his family are no longer around, and nobody recognises him, not even his wife. When George discovers how much of a difference he makes to the city he wishes to be back again. It is heart-warming when he is so happy to be back to normal and he ends up as a millionaire, and Clarence got his wings. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture. James Stewart number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, George Bailey was number 9 (Hero) and Mr. Potter was number 6 (Villain) on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, it was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Films.

		<fullReview>What a Wonderful Life: A movie about a man, George Baily(Stuart)who grows up with big dreams but when his father dies, he is pressured into taking over his company, 'Building and Loans'. While doing this he meets up with an old friend Mary Hatch(Reed) and marries her... still not being able to do what he has always wanted to do, leave Bedford Falls and invent things and become rich. The story goes on with a beautiful ending. I thought this movie was truly amazing! I'm only 13 years of age but I love the movie to bits, I just watch it over and over again! The chemistry between James Stuart and Donna Reed is spine tingling... it's like they were made for each other. They both do incredible performances and make the movie even better. A wonderful story and a wonderful cast create a wonderful movie! I recommend this to everyone, both young and old! Maz</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless American Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly cannot conceive how anyone who possesses a heart, mind, and soul can detract from this wonderful, brilliant, classic piece of American cinema. Aside from being THE movie to view over and over every Christmas season on television, "It's A Wonderful Life" is a fantastic celebration of the human soul, and sends volumes of universal hope: that when we find ourselves at the brink of disaster, it is crucial to realize that miracles can definitely befall us, as George Bailey discovers with his guardian angel Clarence. This is a whimsical, endearing, and somewhat somber story about life in America, and how accumulating enough fame and friends can salvage you from any financial or personal burden which troubles you. George Bailey is a timeless American icon: ascetic, gregarious, and pompous- a character we can all relate to. His inherent responsibility is to retain his father's banking business and to ensure that his life-long nemesis, the squalid, sinister Mr. Potter, does not succeed in taking over the business and eventually the town of Bedford Falls. We soon learn that a critical error has been committed which has plunged George's bank into potential bankruptcy and what's worse, has possibly landed him some serious jail time. All of this despair and turmoil befall the typically fortunate Bailey and dangerously consumes him to the extent that he silences his daughter's playing on the piano, relinquishes his distress upon his loving wife and children, and storms out of the house to get dazed at a bar, and eventually finds himself at the edge of a bridge, contemplating suicide. The story is atmospheric of George Bailey, following him through times of good and times of despair, so that we get the sincere impression that suicide was once the very last intention on Bailey's animated and ambitious mind. At an early age, he proclaims to his lover and future wife, Mary, "I'm shaking' the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm gonna see the world", and woos Mary with such romantic and cocky gestures as "You want the moon? I'll throw a lasso around it for you". We learn that he has had quite a fortunate and prosperous life, and up until his recent downfall, could be said to be the happiest, most important man in Bedford Falls. Hardly a blessing in disguise, it takes a whimsical guardian angel named Clarence to really remind George of his wonderful and important existence, as in reflection, he not only prospered in bliss in his personal affairs, yet also impacted the lives of countless acquaintances throughout the time, some of whom wouldn't have even existed without him, if that is too marvelous to conceive! This is the quintessential, seminal American classic, most enjoyed around the cheery, reflective holiday season, that reminds us about the riches we enjoy in life, how we can easily be bereaved of them, and how taking a good, hard look in the scope of reality, we can realize the true importance of our wonderful existence. George Bailey eventually learns that it is not the present, mundane, or discouraging details which define our lives, but the whole of our existence: our contributions, successes, fortunes, possessions, and impressions we achieve throughout our time upon the earth, and to simply enjoy everything we are so very blessed to receive. This is a beautiful, timeless film, featuring wonderful direction, superb acting by James Stewart as the protagonist George Bailey, Donna Reed as the love of his life, and Lionel Barrymore as the emblematic "scrooge" antagonist. It's one of the most endearing, poignant, and important films you will ever have the privilege to experience, particularly around the holiday season, when you are reflecting upon what you should be thankful for, and forgetting as best you can any negative details which may diminish your joy. George Bailey: "Isn't this wonderful, I'm going to jail!" This is the kind of happy, fearless spirit we should all aspire to become! "It's A Wonderful Life" is a truly wonderful movie. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This rates up with my top 5 favorite movies of all time. I grew up on the Donna Reed show and remember that this was the movie I always saw her in and she was a lot more beautiful then. James Stewart is great as George Baily, the guy who wanted to help everybody and sacrificed his own financial success.The idea that one doesn't realize one's worth until you are removed from the equation has been copied hundreds of times since but never as well as this movie.Clarence is probably the most enjoyable bumbling character that I have ever seen. There is a cameo by an adult Alfalfa Sweitzer (for the Our Gang series) and the characters of Bert and Ernie later were immortalized by Sesame Street.The ending of this movie is the "feel good" ending of all-time!</fullReview>

I could not help an emotional outburst on this movie. It is clearly one of the best movies that I have ever seen.The very fact that each one of us at every point of time feels dejected over some of the events that occur in our lives and begin to take this priceless life lightly has been struck upon with amazing skill and that is the USP of of the movie...It surely deserves a 10/10 from every sensible and mentally sane clear headed guy on this earth !!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The role of alcoholism in this great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies of all time. The story is one that answers the age-old question, "Why are we here?" by offering a tour of an alternate history of a world in which we were never born, in this case a visit to George Bailey's Bedford Falls without Bailey. Upon seeing the calamities befalling his town without his efforts at protecting the drunk pharmacist from filling a prescription with poison, saving his brother from drowning, and defending the town against the evil Mr. Potter, a humble George Bailey slowly begins to realize his own self worth. The observation by the tour guide, Angel Clarence, that "each man's life touches so many other lives" was a poignant precursor to the barely six degrees of separation we have between us.For the alcoholism-aware, this movie may seem a bit confusing. Alcoholism appears in the very beginning, when Mr. Gower, the pharmacist, is shown drinking behind a door as 12-year old George comes to work. While young George merrily whistles away, Gower, who is so drunk he's almost slurring, yells, "You're not paid to be a canary," in classic nasty alcoholic style. But George shows understanding as he reads the text of a recently delivered telegraph bearing news that Gower's son has died of influenza.Although Gower is a sympathetic drunk, death is just another excuse to drink for the alcoholic, while it is a time for sober reflection and mourning for the non-alcoholic. It is also a time when errors are more likely to occur. Gower slaps George's ears for failing to deliver a prescription, but shows genuine remorse when he realizes he had accidentally filled those particular pills with poison. But even an alcoholic might apologize to an employee for saving his hide. Gower's addiction becomes obvious when, in the alternate universe of a world without George Bailey, he is portrayed as a panhandling street drunk, having served 20 years in prison for involuntary manslaughter.The real alcoholic story, however, is one unrecognized in the movie. Crusty old Mr. Potter, played by Lionel Barrymore (ironically, one of many actors in the Barrymore family, which included a long line of alcoholics), is never once shown drinking. Yet he engages in power-seeking behaviors, doing anything to gain control over everything in Bedford Falls (which, in the alternate universe, becomes Pottersville, complete with sleazy bars, strip clubs and pawnbrokers). Conniving to keep $8,000 that was intended for George Bailey's building and loan company is just the culmination of a number of nefarious misbehaviors in which Potter engages. Because alcoholism best explains the conduct, the only flaw in this great movie is the omission of even one scene showing Potter drinking heavily, or one in which he might be shown hiding his stash. Perhaps such a scene ended up on the cutting room floor, edited out by a real-life alcoholic.</fullReview>

Then in school my teacher showed it to the class just before Christmas and I have loved it ever since. I could watch this classic over and over again.Even thought its black and white its still perfect.If it was in color it would not have near the same affect on me.The things that happen to George Bailey after he wishes he was never born are horrible and he is some lucky he's got Clarence.</fullReview>

The only thing about Christmas in this movie is that Jimmy Stewart's revelation about his life happened at Christmas time. What I think I like most about this movie, besides the awesome plot and acting, is the banter between everyone in it, even the silent banter. If you haven't seen this movie yet, even though you've lived this long, you need to rent it or just buy it because I know you will love it.

His hopes and dreams, his aspirations, even the way he hates his small town existence. You really get to fall in love with this character and root for him to succeed. It reaffirms to us that one life can make a difference. It is a must have for anyone who calls themselves a film buff.

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic holiday movie starring two of the biggest names in Hollywood: Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed! Besides A Miracle on 34th Street, this movie has to be the best Christmas film of the 40's! The most famous scene in this movie is when George(Stewart) wishes he doesn't want to live anymore, and his wish is granted, when everyone doesn't know who he is. That scene is the most famous because it has been made fun of a couple of times. Also, this movie is the inspiration for two of the most famous Muppet characters: Bert and Ernie! I recommend this movie to everyone! When it's Christmas time and you don't know what to watch, watch this movie! It's a classic and very entertaining.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is a great movie that touches on a question that everyone has asked themselves at one time or another. This question is "what would the world be like with out me?" The answer for this question is explored through the main character that because of his lack of achevements in his life feels that he has done more harm then good. This movie could be divided up into three parts the first part is when he is a child the second part is when he is an adult but a younger adult and the last part is when he is an older adult.This movie is about a man who thinks that because he didn't do any thing he wanted to do when he was a kid that his life is a failed one. This movie follows him from when he was just a child up until he wants to commits suicide in when he is about thirty or forty years old. The movie does this in a rather clever way by an angel telling the story of his life to another angel that is to protect George Baily from himself. The viewers first introduction to George is when he is just a child and is sleding in this scene George's brother falls through the ice, George jumps in after him and save his life. This scene was done to introduce something the George that was good and that at the end of the movie would be brought up. The next scene is George a little older and he is at work talking to two girls about what he wants to do when he is older. It apears from this scene that George has a great imagination and also at this early age he relises that he doesn't want to stay in his home town. This scene also is one that ties in to the end for in this scene George prevents his boss from delivering pills that were inadvertently poisoned. Scene continue like this for a little while showing good things that he did and expanding on his dreams.When he s a younger adult he is confronted with a problem, either he goes off and lives his dream and fathers life work and the last chance most of the people in his town to live a decent life goes down the drain or he can stay and work a job that he hates in a town he has wanted out of since he was just a young boy and help those people in his town who need it and further his fathers work. This decision does not come easily to him though he makes it time and again. He ends up helping hundreds of people in his town start business and build houses much to the dissatisfaction of the villain of this movie who is a greedy stubborn old man who would not give loans to any of the people that George and even if he did the people would not be able to afford them. George is given several opportunities to get out of his town and to leave his job but chooses to help his family and friends instead.The third part of this movie is when George is on the verge of committing suicide and is saved by his gaurdian angel and is shown how the world would be with out him. The scene of the world without him is not a pretty one all his friends are poor and have horrible lives and his brother whom he saved as a young boy is dead drowned at the age of eight. George is greatly affected by this vision and changes his out look on life. He is now happy about the choices that he has made and acts as if he wouldn't change them even if he could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy Christmas classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to Christmas classics, "It's A Wonderful Life" is probably at the top of the list, and with good reason. Rising above the clichés of the Christmas genre, the movie stands on its own two feet as a good film, through and through. It's director Frank Capra at his best, and Jimmy Stewart in one of his best roles as George Bailey.The story is this: George Bailey is in trouble. Years upon years of dashed hopes and abandoned dreams have slowly weakened his spirits, and the threat of closing the Bailey Building and Loan ? the institution he's sacrificed everything to save -- finally breaks him down. He contemplates suicide to save the Building and Loan once again with his life insurance policy. Providence intervenes, however, and uses an angel (Henry Travers) to show George just how much of a difference he's made when he declares "I wish I was never born"."It's A Wonderful Life" is much more than just a Christmas movie; it's a movie that's ultimately about everyday life. Not everyone may lose $8000 and worry about bank foreclosure every day, but everyone can probably point to a time when they felt like George Bailey. The movie shows George's transformation from a hopeful young man who dreams of seeing faraway lands into a pragmatic adult who has been forced so sacrifice his dreams so that others might follow theirs. He sacrifices his honeymoon time and money to save the Building and Loan from closing. George works for years to pay his brother's way through college n hopes that later he will be able to attend himself ? only to have his brother return married with a job and a good future already lined up. Time and again, George willingly steps into the background, shelving his dreams, in order to serve others.George is finally able to see how much his sacrifices have meant when the angel Clarence shows him how the world would be different had he never been born. His brother would have died as a child, because George wasn't there to save him from drowning. Mr. Potter, the local land tycoon, would have taken over the town after the Building and Loan shut down when George's father died. When he realizes the impact his life has made, he returns to the world he knows only to find the people who he's helped through the years come back to save him and the Building and Loan."It's A Wonderful Life" is one of the few Christmas films to hold more than simple holiday cheer: it seeks to enlighten the viewer to appreciate the impact their sacrifices have made. This message would have been especially relevant when the movie was released in the post-WWII United States, where so many had sacrificed time, resources or their lives to help the war effort."It's A Wonderful Life" remains relevant today by virtue of its thoughtful message and skillful crafting in directing, writing, and acting, that all lend its message all the more weight. This movie is one that truly deserves to be thought of as "classic".Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just had to give this movie a 10. Could it have been better? Of course it could. The acting was campy, the plot was ridiculous, and the storyline is full of holes.But still ... what would the holidays be without watching Bill Bailey fight the evil forces and ultimately winning our hearts over and over again?This is what movies are all about - touching our emotions so deep and so firmly that we can never let go. We all cry when he cries, laugh when he laughs, and cheer at the end of the movie. It's the quintessential feel-good movie of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really is a wonderful lifeMost Christmas movies we see can be recognized around the world, especially those secular, seasonal films relating to the adventures of annual jolly gift-givers, magical beings made of snow befriending children, and peculiar deer who have the gift of a shiny nasal cavity... But this movie showed the reality of the holidays and life in general. It's a wonderful life is a genuinely good film that show's that even the most simple of people can make such large differences.Good spirited George Bailey is the man we pay attention to, as we watch him grow up as a boy and meeting the special people in his life. As he grows older, we see an impetuous person with high standards in life and plans for the future, but a flexible and labored person in the same when such adverse events such as *SPOILER* when his father dies and leaves the bank to him, and his brother serve in the war in Europe. We see our impetuous George go through life as a banker with his uncle, when somehow all the money that the bank owned dissapears, meaning the destruction of Bailey's career, and his familiy's well being. Suddenly, we watched the young, happy man slip into anger and fear, and the only way he believes to counter it is to end his life. Here is where the immature angel, Clarence Oddbody enters, and grants Bailey's wish of never being born. We follow the two through the town of Bedford Falls in a journey to see the many lives he touched in his real life, and how his absence afflicted with what he knew. Bailey changes his perception and returns home to live out his days happily with his wife and children.This movie shows how the real world and the holiday season conflict with each other, and how one person can make a difference in the lives of everyone around him. It truly is an inspiring film, and encourages the mind to believe that it can also do great good to the people and things that it cherishes most in life.I believe that this film deserves a place as one of the most influential and best films of our time. If only we could take the time out of our lives to imagine what good we do unto both ourselves and others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just looked back at comments made by Becca37. I think she is completely off the mark. If this film can be criticised it is for espousing material values, ie owning your own house. Playing the sex and race cards misses the point completely, and bearing in mind that the main character is driven to the point of suicide, and is forced to realise that his brother would be dead without him should be enough to show that this is not a sappy film.This is one of my favourite films of all time, and the ending is worth all the pain of getting there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never met anyone who does not treasure this film, and if I ever do, I will truly feel extremely sorry for them. I believe that this is the greatest movie ever made. It stands head and shoulders above anything else I've ever seen. It's not simply the best movie, but also an amazing lesson in what life is all about, especially for those of us who sometimes have to ask ourselves that question. Although the entire cast is strong, it is James Stewart's finest hour. I remember an interview with him some years ago, in which he said that, to him, a good movie was all about 'moments'. He recalled the scene, in Martini's bar, where he says a prayer. This is my favourite scene in the movie, and is just one of the many such 'moments'. If ever I'm not sure whether I really liked a film or not, I can usually work out the answer by this 'moments' theory. Unfortunately, few movies can deliver the goods, and none match Frank Capra's masterpiece. 10 out of 10 does not tell the whole story. My advice to anyone who has not seen this film, is make sure you do see it before you die - it may even prolong your life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with all things in life, movies are to be observed and reacted upon by the human mind. This movie goes beyond that and touches the human soul. If it doesn't do that, at least take one thing from the movie. Since you can not chose to be unborn at this stage in your life, the next time you have to make a decision in life, (without getting on the right/wrong soap box) YOU decide if hurting someone for your own gain is who you really are about, or if sharing or helping or even not involving someone if it has potential for hurting them, is more about who you are. Something as simply and basic as that is the message this movie sends and yet we all tend to forget it. My favorite movie of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never expected to love this movie as much as I did! I basically bought the movie because I found it real cheap and was curious, and because I'm trying to get every movie on the Top 250. I didn't expect to get much out of it, since it didn't really seem like my kind of movie. After watching it, I realised how wrong I was. It was an absolutely beautiful movie, and really pulled at my heartstrings (although, as I've said in one of my other reviews, I'm an absolute sucker for emotional stuff like this). I won't go into too much detail about the plot, in case you don't know what it is, since it's a great experience going in not knowing about the plot. I'll simply say that it is a great portrayal of what one man can do without even realising it. Jimmy Stewart is in the starring role as the lovable George Bailey, a role that he is charming in. Some of the movie may seem a little corny by today's standards, but don't let that turn you off! It is also probably one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen as well. After watching it, I found myself thinking of what effect my own life has had on others, whether I could make a difference in anyone's life. It's the sort of movie that makes you want to be a better person. The movie is brilliant, and I'm glad I gave it a chance. It currently tops my Top 50 movies list, which is funny, considering how it doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of them. I've even been accused of faking my love for the movie! This is definitely a movie that needs to be seen. I've never seen anything else like it.</fullReview>

It gets a standing ovation every single time. Enough said.This year I took my dad with me. This year, like every year, I left the theatre walking on air. But this year I wandered to a pub near Trafalgar Square, had a drink with my dad and looked around at the other punters, wondering how many would be facing financial problems in the coming recession - and if I would be one of them.This film is not far-fetched.

		<shortDescription>The original feelgood Christmas film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be fairly clear here. This is a good film which unashamedly aims to lift the spirits at Christmas in the manner of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. It is a rather unconventional film though. The story is of a man whose fortunes force him to consider the possibility of doing away with himself, until salvation comes in the form of an angel who shows him his self-worth. Yet Capra spends more than half the two-hour running time simply showing us this life - and a wonderful one it certainly is.The point here is that Capra has clearly set out to make the film that so many have come to love, even if they don't remember it particularly well... there's really no need for the third act, as Clarence drags Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey around a sour, alternative world in which he hasn't featured. Capra is determined to hammer the point home though.He also takes the opportunity to leaven even this most desperate sequence with the easy humour than runs through the whole film. It's a Wonderful Life is a hectic film that careers past with episodes, exchanges and asides that builds up a mountain of character rather like the mountain of cash that crowns the denouement. Jimmy Stewart is the progenitor of all this, driving the pace of the film with his mercurial repartee and Michael J Fox-like perpetual motion acting. All the other parts, well-taken in this film, may be said to be reflected glory as this must be Stewart's defining film - he is the hero by virtue of his recurring averageness and the role sits with him very well.An unusual movie then, familiar and lovable both despite and by itself - rather like having the relatives round at Christmas, in fact! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's A Wonderful LIfe" has to be one of the best movies ever made! In fact, it could be the best. Some teenagers say that it is a boringmovie, that it's too long, or that they just don't like it, but not thisteenager! This teenager loves this movie! This is one of thosemovies that can and should be watched over and over again. Every time it is seen it gives the viewer the feeling of christmas andhopefully, it helps them to realize that they should be thankful forwhat they have and just be happy with their life. The acting in this movie is actually really good considering thetime when it was made. It doesn't come off as cheesy or corny atall. It's believable and it's like you almost can't tell that it's justacting. The casting director picked some great actors/actressesfor this movie. Jimmy Stewart is absolutely great as George Bailey. "It's AWonderful Life" wouldn't be as good as it is without Stewart playingthe main character. Stewart can portray all kinds of emotions andactually make the viewer believe that that is what he is feeling. Hecan be enthusiastic, sad, happy, or really mad and the viewer won'teven know he is acting.  Donna Reed made a wonderful Mary Bailey. She plays one ofthose wives that sticks by her man no matter what. And shemakes a really believable mother. Stewart and Reed together make a great acting pair and they arepart of the reason that "It's A Wonderful Life" is as great as it is.The setting in this movie was all the little town of Bedford Falls. There was no fake backgrounds, everything was real, realbuildings, real cars, real trees etc. The only wierd thing that wasn'treal was at the beginning of the movie when the angels are likegalaxies up in the sky. That whole scene wasn't very realistic andit was kind of odd, but despite it's oddness this movie is still great!The music was all background except for when the characters inthe movie sing. The music was nice and it really adds to themovie. "It's A Wonderful Life" is a great film and this reviewer will never beconvinced that it isn't. It is a classic and it is one that should neverbe forgotten.</fullReview>

Maybe the source of his turnaround is a little cheesy, but he turns it around anyway.If you don't get a little choked up while watching this, then you have NO CLUE what life is about. Life is about these moments.When I was younger, I didn't like this movie because I thought it was stupid. An old black and white movie with old-fashioned ideals and values.

		<fullReview>I love this movie and it's a Christmas tradition to watch it with as many of my five kids as I can get together. It has helped me through some pretty tough times.As a young boy in the 50s and 60s I grew up watching old movies on television with my mother. Jimmy Stewart has always been my favorite actor, not in any small measure because of this movie. It was my mother's fondness for him that initially led me to this great discovery. Having my own roots in a small community of western Pennsylvania, only 60 miles from Jimmy's hometown, helped to cement my affinity for him as well. I'm such a big fan of both him and this work that a copy of an original poster for this film hangs in my living room.One of my greatest regrets is that, despite my exposure to what were even then "old" movies during my youth, I hadn't yet seen "It's a Wonderful Life" when I had the opportunity of meeting both director Frank Capra AND actor Jimmy Stewart on separate occasions while in college. I would have liked to have told them how much the movie meant to me. (As if they hadn't heard that before!) I found great pleasure in later learning that both Capra and Stewart said of all their movies, this one was their favorite.Moving and inspiring the film is a human drama that touches my funny bone and my innermost senses in ways few movies ever do. It's an all-American classic with a message of personal struggle and hope. In all it's simplicity it is simply great entertainment while at the same time leaving us no doubt as to the essential truth of what's *really* important in life.Yes it's a bit sappy, certainly sentimental. Yes it's in black and white (unless you happen to see the "colorized " version) and granted it's an "oldie," but if you don't like this movie I can only have pity for you.We all matter. We all have purpose. Despite what we might think at times, it IS a wonderful life and we have much to be thankful for."Each man's life touches so many other lives. If he wasn't around, it would leave an awful hole." -- ClarenceAt least that's the way we should all live and hope it shall be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been one of my best-loved films for years. It never fails to move me, I'm never tired of it, I want to watch it every Christmas (and oftener)! For the first time I saw the film (only the part of it) by mere accident: I just switched on TV, and there was some old black-and-white movie. I always was unusually fond of black-and-white cinematography, so I became interested. At the moment George was about jumping into the water, but Clarence jumped in advance, and George came to rescue instead of committing suicide. The twist intrigued me. And when Clarence explained that he was a `second-class angel', who haven't got the wings, I actually lost my breath. The very idea of that absurd guardian angel seemed amazing. By the end of the film I absolutely loved it (and James Stewart)! Later I saw (and not once, of course) the whole movie and appreciated it better. It's so fascinating, nice and charming! The plot is very clever, combining drama and humour, tension and fun, reality and fairy-tale. Cinematography and music are beautiful. The cast is splendid. Everyone is convincing, but James Stuart is best of all. I can't help considering him and Gregory Peck as the GREATEST American actors EVER (sorry, all the other?). I'm really grateful to Frank Capra for the film. It teaches us true values without being preachy, boring or sentimental. It makes us understand and admire what is really good and worthy. After all, it explains that ordinary everyday Life Is WONDERFUL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life (1946)**** (out of 4) This timeless classic has James Stewart playing George Bailey, a frustrated businessman who gets the chance to see what the world would have been like had he never been born. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this film over the years but it keeps getting better with each new viewing and I can't help but notice new things each time I watch it. There's really nothing I could add that hasn't already been said about this movie but it's certainly one of my all time favorites and I'd argue that it's one of the greatest ever made. This movie has been called timeless by many people but I really can't think of too many movies where this is more true. I can't possibly see how this movie would ever grow old fashioned or out of touch because there's always going to be people who feel like the main character here. The most amazing thing to me is that the film perfectly captures how someone might begin to feel that they're worthless and I can't help but think that anyone who watches this movie will have a better look on life or themselves after watching it. I really can't think of too many movies that contain as much power as this one but I'd say that's why new fans are gained each and every passing year. The greatness of the film is certainly its heart but Stewart also deserves a lot of credit for his marvelous performance, which is certainly one of the best of his career. There are countless scenes in this movie where Stewart just nails it and I'm sure everyone knows the praying in the bar scene but there are many other great ones as well. On this viewing the scene on the bridge when Stewart begs for his life back hit me unlike any other time. There's also the scene in the bank where George has to bargain with the people not to take all of their money. Lionel Barrymore was always great playing bad guys and I can't help but think he's one of the greatest villains in movie history. The evilness that Barrymore is able to get through this character makes it among the actors best work. Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Travers also add great support. Every inch of this movie works flawlessly and that includes the sequences where George gets to see things as if he were never born. I think these moments contain Capra's greatest work as a director as the darkness and atmosphere he creates is so think and depression that it perfectly puts you in the mind frame of George. Then you've got that priceless ending, which ranks right up there with City Lights and Psycho as being the greatest for any movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...if God himself (!) helps you in your tough moments.SPOILERS ALL OVER THE PLACE. READ AFTER YOU'VE WATCHED THE MOVIE.This is a movie with an excellent idea and terrible execution. Instead of profound soul searching story we get a tearjerker filled with crowd-pleaser, cheap (in depth and in realism) sentiments and soapiness.This is also the evidence of how a sentiment can make a movie "classic".How would you measure importance of your life for your surrounding if not to see the world in which you never existed.George has all the similarities to an Angel on Earth. He is beyond good, although it's never cleared is this because he is good in heart, or just can't say no. Like an Angel he (apparently) has no free will and takes the roles, others (or God) give him. Therefore he has a lot of dreams he never got to accomplish, although it seems to him that everyone else did. Clarence is an Angel who waits to get his wings. George is an Angel that doesn't understand that that's his role. When in the end he does (by accepting his old life), he gets the debt settled, and Clarence gets his wings (for accomplishing his job). This could explain why would God himself influence George's life directly (through Clarence).George's town is a Heaven on Earth. A place where everyone live their lives in content. Where there is no evil people. There are few who are weak and therefore do wrong. They are helped and looked at with compassion. The only really bad man is nothing more then cartoons money-hungry villain who will (as is implied) get his in the afterlife.In the first 78% of the movie we see whole George's life until the point he decided to end it. Then the real plot comes in front.This movie is too serious for the children (directing, not the screenplay), and it's too cartoons for actual adult (screenplay, not directing). That's why this is a fairytale for adults (NOT adult fairytale like for instance Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World). It's a fairytale because of unrealistic depiction of George's life, not because of Angels.When George starts to think, about the world in witch he was never born, Clarence takes him to this world. This is another fault for the movie. Instead of an objective view, that George would get, by being a part of this world, he is thrown in it, and has a shock after shock while finding out about his friends, family and job in this world. He becomes a rat in a labyrinth, instead of getting a chance to stand on the outside, like Clarence. This way he could see all the crossroads that changes in his life would make. Somewhat like Scrooge from "A Christmass Carol", a far better developed and made Christmas (and life) story classic.This Georgeless world is Hell, where are no George (Angel(s)) to make it better. People here are wicked, angry, lustful, envious, cruel and hateful. It seems George got a small shot of the real world.The main reason why George wants out of it is not because he hated it (he was there just a couple of minutes), but because of rat in the maze shock. He suddenly has no past, friends, family, job or I.D. Offcourse he wants home. Clarence tells him of the people's fates made by his absence, but the shock for George is too big to objectively see the whole situation and he wants home by default.Donna Reed in this world is a lonely unmarried old librarian... This is ridicules. Donna Reed is NOT a lonely unmarried old librarian in ANY town, world, or universe...Finally George goes back to his old life and is finally satisfied with it. So the point is that if you save people's lives, leave your dreams, so you can live your dad's dream by running the firm, and not fire your employees with alcohol problems you'll get what's most important in life, and then you'll get the knowledge of what is most important. OK. Everyone, raise your hands if you fit this common life description. Ah... Anyone?Anyone who thinks this movie or it's writers have anything to do with socialism, should read their Byble again. Religion and fate in this movie are all over the place, symbolically and openly, however they have a subjective tendency and are used very simplistically.George and his town represent Good, and town without him is next to a cradle of sin. There, talk about angels means you're insane, and compassion is weakness.There is a strange feeling of flock philosophy somewhere along the movie. George is "at home" with his people, where his smile reflects in others and "out of home" without them, where George is nothing but a rambling lunatic. If he goes after his dreams, he'll end up disappointed, and "his people" "at home" will suffer. His town represents the good old days, and the own without him stands for the bad new days (cabarets and striptease in theaters for example).Everyone who likes fairy tales, feels like a child at heart or just likes to see what Heaven on Earth could look like, try this movie, and you'll probably be satisfied.Cast and director are well known and they do their job accordingly. That doesn't change the undeveloped plot. The movie is more interesting for analyzing then watching.Maybe once the new generations of movie makers will make a grownup story (not remake) out of this excellent idea for soul searching movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a Christmas movie; the best movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read some of the comments on this movie and I can't believe that anyone can watch this and not be emotionally moved. They need to see a shrink and to stay the hell as far away from me as possible. About 20 years ago I watched IAWL with a girl I was dating and she had no emotional response at all-- I dumped her immediately. It always makes me cry even after several dozen viewings. I don't wait until the end like apparently a lot of folks, I'm already into it in the scene where Mr. Gower hits George on his bad ear. This movie has been #1 on my personal list for as long as I can remember. Unbelievable that the critics panned it and Jimmy Stewart did not win the Oscar. Another reason I always avoid that annual Hollywood farce.This is absolutely the best movie ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect Christmas Film that reinforces core values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't shown at Christmas time in Australia on free to air anymore. This film is underrated by those who feel it is very good.Jimmy Stewart's distinctive, whimsical voice conveys the emotions that hit viewer buttons on many levels. Loss, love and worth are examined for the viewer. Capra has told this story simply and well, and one doesn't need to be an adult to appreciate what drives the characters.The community is comprised of people who are basically good.The special effects were very special for the time, and convey much that is lost by a drop of ink in milk.I've seen angels. They come to life in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Walk On The Wild Side With Frank Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A glance at the calendar tells me that we are now safely into February - Christmas and New Years have retreated back to wherever it is that they go to.... and the large balance of the year lies before us until they will intrude again. The smell of holiday ham and homemade pumpkin pie has been extinguished like a used up candle and the strains of Yule melodies have fled the air. Just the perfect time to take a look at "It's A Wonderful Life' from a different perspective and at an angle which is free from the traditional Christmas messages of redemption and human charity that the movie is usually seen to offer. What I am talking about here is...lechery.....lechery and lasciviousness pure and simple. I am referring to sexual degradation not only in the speculative chimera of Pottersville but also in that great American expository small-town oasis of Bedford Falls. If Frank Capra bothered to read the reviews of "It's A Wonderful Life" at the time the picture was first released at Christmastime in 1946--there is little doubt in my mind that he would have been at least slightly disturbed by the assessments made that his new movie was nothing more than just a slight variation from his past efforts. His penchant for fashioning heartwarming films that championed the individualism and strong character of the "little man" against the vagaries and injustice of the "system" had, after all, given rise to the pejorative term "Capra-corn". By 1946, however, it appears that Capra was working hard, if not to change his modus operandi, then to at least "spice it up a bit". That is part of the reason he gave us a view into the "dark side" of American society by highlighting the filth and sordidness of Pottersville. What few people remark on, however, is that dribs and drabbles of the parallel universe represented by the cesspool of Pottersville can be whiffed every now and then in Bedford Falls itself. You don't believe me? Well let me give you an example.Do you remember the scene in the movie where George Bailey is standing on a street corner shooting the breeze with his pals, Ernie the cab driver and Bert the cop? Yes --another nice sunny day in Bedford Falls. Then Violet Bick strolls by. She is accosted by George who has the impertinence to remark: "Say Vi that is some dress you got on there." Violet puts her hand on hip and protests: "This old thing--I only wear this when I don't care what I look like." She then shimmies across the street.... the camera following her receding wiggle for almost a good half block. Capra provides some cover for this ogling by having a middle aged bank clerk type pass by and then crank his head around to closely inspect her saunter. He, in turn, is almost flattened by an automobile that is crossing the intersection in the other direction (the sex as death ethos). But this exercise in venality is not finished. The camera then switches back to George and the boys still staring at Violet....... who at this point must be nearing the edge of the horizon. Ernie pipes up: "How would you like to.....?" George cuts him off by blurting, "Yes!" The trance is broken and Bert stumbles away commenting that he has to go home and see what his wife is doing. Sly and sick Ernie then sarcastically cracks "family man". This is a scene fraught with sexual tension, voyeurism with masochistic tendencies and it is occurring in real time in broad daylight on a street corner in Bedford Falls. O.K.--want another example? One without that sexpot Violet Bick---who some reviewers have painted as the "Mary Magdalene" to George Bailey's suffering "Jesus". Well how about that virgins of virgins--little eighteen year old Mary Hatch? Everyone has witnessed the famous high school dance/pool scene where George and Mary end up soaking wet. The next scene shows them walking home in the dark--George is wearing an over-sized football uniform in lieu of his wet duds and Mary sports nothing more than a robe. This sweet couple gets right down to business by breaking out the windows in a neighborhood house. Then George tries to put a move on Mary at the instigation of a peeping-tom yelling from a nearby porch. Mary jumps out of her robe in the ensuing m?lée and is left shaking and naked in a nearby hydrangea bush. The use of the hydrangea represents, of course, only the most demented form of erotic symbolism. I always send my kids out of the room in anticipation of this scene.I could go on and give more examples --but I think you get the point. Even "old Annie" the house-maid is not immune from this carnival of lust and immorality.Please don't misunderstand me- here. I am not condemning the whole picture. I do indeed accept that "It's A Wonderful Life" is the "American Christmas Carol". It echoes the central idea of the Dicken's tale that we are all responsible for each other and it also adds to that idea the very American conception that "no man is a failure who has friends." Wonderful stuff really. But be aware when admiring the glitter of this holiday gold that it also contains the base alloy of sex and sin. Or put another way--it's o.k. to enjoy the rustic pleasures of walking across a beautiful, green farm pasture ----- just be careful to hold your nose and watch your step along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly made film about a truly disgusting character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The James Stewart character is self-centred, obsessed with money, rude, short tempered, and regretfully drawn into his father's business, a housing and loan company favouring working class people by giving them mortgages they can manage, only because he feels obliged to do what his dead father wanted him to do (instead of racing off to Europe to play the university game). He does not manage things well, and is financially wounded (accidentally) by the villain (played by Lionel Barrymore: the dynamics are a lot like You Can't Take it With You, in that sense.)Failing at everything, he goes to jump off a bridge, is saved from suicide by an angel (not at all clear why heaven wd want to save this dreadful person), continues insanely, declares he wishes he'd never been born, is then thrust into a sort of non-identity existence by the angelic intervenor, finally does his one good deed and is returned to humanity (gratefully, God knows why). Capra! Awful, though very well made. Gets huge approval from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. I just don't get it. Patrick Watson, Toronto.</fullReview>

Ugly Sam Wainwright. Clarence the gay guardian angel. "I want to live again!" Oh please. Donna Reed's big blank Stepford smile. "Teacher says that every time a bell rings, (a brat needs to shut the hell up)." Those are just some the things that I hate about Frank Crapra's boring and schmaltzy It's A Wonderful Life. The film did so-so business in the winter of 1946-47, and was thusly shoved down the throats of later generations and people were brainwashed into thinking that this was somehow a "bona-fide holiday classic." Pfft! Puh-leez! Die, George Bailey, DIE! Your ears get boxed in hell! Damn you, NBC, for showing it too much!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Socialist Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be no doubt a lone negative voice regarding this film, for which the best thing I can say is that it is an excellent piece of propaganda.The movie appeals to the socialist nature of one's sense of life, and was an anti-capitalist propaganda film on the virtue of altruism. For instance, people who wanted their money at the beginning of the "run" on the savings and loan were negatively painted selfish. Old Man Potter was painted as the evil banker, when in fact a much more interesting and accurate spin would be to look at the lives positively affected because Potter managed his bank so well (he had the liquidity to handle his depositor's claims). Good ol' George, presented as the epitome of the virtuous man, possesses in fact an ethics of self sacrifice. Incompetent Uncle Billy, having "lost" the banks capital in a brown paper bag, is nevertheless sympathetically presented as Potter's victim, when in fact he is merely the price of George's immoral (and anti-capitalist) practice of sacrificial nepotism.The nonsense goes on and on until towards the end we are struck over the head with what a "lucky man" George Baily is, as he mooches upon his friends and neighbors. The audience, especially women, tear up pondering the alleged "romance" portrayed, all the while the movie advances the philosophical principles of socialism farther than Karl Marx could have ever dreamed. Capra was essentially the Dickens of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw it on the big screen. I was ill in bed when it first came out but like thousands of others picked up on it much later via television, which had transformed a half-forgotten curio into a Christmastime classic. A good man, worn down by vicissitudes, is rescued from the abyss and restored to self-worth when the community he's supported rallies round to bail him out of his troubles. Capra's orchestration of human joys and sorrows, of frailties, frustrations, dilemmas and temptations is extraordinarily, dazzlingly, powerfully good. But his tacked-on fantasy elements become irrelevant to a point of annoyance.His 'hereafter' is a cosy extension of Bedford Falls, just dial a prayer to the Chief who can preside with perfect equanimity over World War II and so on but moves heaven and earth to reclaim one random individual from the (pertinently Catholic) sin of trying to do away with himself. This goes directly to the heart of all that's wrong with organised religion. It's partisan and self-serving. The world-without-George would have been better dramatised as a straightforward nightmare from which he awakes with relief to be saved by his friends. Same story, but without the guardian angel who belongs in a lighter-based film. This alternate world is like a scripting equivalent of trick-photography, a leaf through the family album from which all images of George have been carefully snipped while leaving the space around him intact. He still exists along with his memories and he can interact with other people but he's no longer RECOGNISED by his peers, even his loving mother doesn't accept him. In effect he's been blackballed from the club, his achievements stricken from the record. His ultimate oblivion is that of social exclusion, possibly reflecting the deep-seated fear of a good loyal assimilated immigrant like Capra, the American Dream turning to dust.This fear induces conformity, the need to stand with the crowd and to view with prejudice the stranger, the outsider, those who don't fit the frame, young girls who become old maids, wear glasses and work in libraries. It's not enough for a man to be heroic he needs a medal to confirm it like little brother Harry who gets to meet the President. Everyone must shape up and show their credentials (even Clarence the trainee angel). Bert the cop and Ernie the cab-driver also went to war, we're hurriedly told, though when we see them at the end they don't really appear to have gone anyplace. The point is well taken - hilariously by some posters - that Pottersville seems more fun (dancing girls and sinful jazz music !)- a welcome relief for many from all that overbearing apple-pie surveillance (guardian angels and nosy neighbours). Paradise, like perfection, is relative. And personal. But the truly great Jim Stewart (not Jimmy, he hated that) triumphantly transcends the naffness and the gimmickry to give us an Everyman for the ages. He's the real classic here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If 'It's a Wonderful Life' were released today, it would surely be targeted for being overly cheesy and schmaltzy. And there really is no arguing with that. It is a movie rife with sentimentality and a sugary touch by the great Frank Capra. But if that's a crime, so be it. If this holiday classic doesn't pull at your heartstrings, I can't help but feel a little sorry for you. For if you let it, 'It's a Wonderful Life' will whisk you away on an unforgettable journey.This perennial classic is often immortalized every year with an annual television special. It takes us through the life of George Bailey, from seemingly unimportant childhood events to a family man struggling in the midst of the Great Depression. It's a world where the universe is alive with angels watching over us, and each of us has their very own guardian angel. All of this will become of dire use to Bailey after his father's death leaves him in charge of a business he never intended to work for. A life full of dreams and aspirations have, quite suddenly, been extinguished.It really is Jimmy Stewart's wonderful portrayal as Bailey that lifts this entire film. He is a respected man, a character we come to care deeply about. Bailey is compassionate, selfless, uncorrupt. But despite a beautiful wife and loving children, he is never completely satisfied with the life he's made for himself. 'It's a Wonderful Life' revolves around the historically tumultuous times of the Depression and World War II. During these troublesome years, Capra conveys the thought that it is our loved ones who remain the most important and stable part of our lives.It runs a little long, but 'It's a Wonderful Life' builds to an ending that's as cheesy as it is powerful. When Bailey sees a world without him, and the true impact he had on the lives of others. These are touching scenes, not only for this season of giving, but it's a film we can embrace any time of the year. George Bailey was no exception to the rule, because as a certain angel tells Bailey during a highly emotional conclusion, "no man is a failure who has friends." This is a great film, one that has lived on through the years to represent a belief in hope and the power of one man's impact.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Wonderful Stewart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of three Christmas time classics, with the other two, The Bishop's Wife and Miracle on 34th Street. James Stewart is at his best in showing to us a life of happiness and great desperation. As George Bailey, a man that had many dreams but sacrificed them for his many friends and family by staying in a small town. Finally, reaching a point of asking "WHY" am I even alive? Henry Travers is truly gifted as Clarence the angel that is sent to help George and appears at times so human. Poor George gets his wish, of never having been born and is given a gift of seeing just how a world "without" him would have developed. Such pain is seen in George as he sees that in life he "DID" make a difference to others. Many people were influenced in the positive because of his life and sacrifice. This is what sets this film above so many, how many of us when in a deep depression wish that we could just disappear also. Maybe an angel named Clarence could visit us also?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This world needs this measly, one-horse film if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to jaded, cynical hard-heartedness and despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By Stephen ThanabalanIn a George Bailey-esquire manner of speech, I say: "This world needs this measly, one-horse film if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to jaded, cynical hard-heartedness and despair." And that's not sentimental hogwash.Frank Capra's 1946 initial RKO Pictures box office flop really has become a must see film, might well change one's outlook on how valuable a man's life really is, and is a wonderful story about how important our lives can be, with the blend of human tribulations, angels, and God- bringing faith, and an endearingly effervescent message of putting others beyond oneself that still resonates after exactly 60 years. Polished as a both moving character study of one man's life story (like Citizen Kane), as well an overwhelming combination of emotional reality that will gently tug at your heartstrings, what makes this film stand the test of time and remain uplifting is that it celebrates triumphantly that 'NO MAN is a failure who has friends.' It then wraps this in a most touchingly dramatic story that at times veers into borderline 'noir' about the trials and unrequited dreams of a common man's life, with believable main characters instead of outlandish heroes, dealing with the harsh realities of giving up Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles for commitment and love, and exploring the psyche of a human's grasp of the meaning of life.Yet, the greatest aspect of this plot about George Bailey (played by James Stewart with relish, sincerity and an emotional range of characterization that will enthrall), is that it does not drivel to get to its climax- of Heaven sending a guardian angel, Clarence (it helped that Travers seemed like a Disney fantasy character) to goad him to appreciate on reflection, his wonderful life as a result of being given the chance of looking at an alternate universe if he didn't exist (in a fantastic sci-fi twist). Instead, it takes the viewer on an enchanting journey of the protagonist's life in order to allow one to feel his pains (father's stroke, Building &amp; Loan payouts, Mr Potter's insults); romance (with beautiful wife Donna Reed complete with Charleston dances and a humble dilapidated house); share his disappointments (contrasts with Sam Wainwright and Harry); and understand why eventually having to come to the crossroads in facing the insecurities and issues of having believed he had wasted potential, he was willing to choose oblivion rather than existence. Most effective of all, whilst weaving the tale in lovely cinematography, it crosses the various eras that audiences all identify with (Depression, War), helping it strike chords all over. Stewart's and Capra's favorite, this film boasts some incredibly emotional scenes that linger in film history, including the best one-take embrace scene by the telephone (Rob Reiner cries watching it every time!). The Casting (even Billy &amp; the Raven) was magnificent: the otherwise unknown Reed has a chemistry with Stewart that conveyed a love of the purest kind that really epitomized that George didn't need to build airfields to have been a hero to the ones who mattered in his life, that he'd, albeit unwontedly, already lassoed the moon. The main qualms with the show lie mostly with people upset at its moral/religious tones due to unrescinding belief that no such good character exists, exacerbated by the fact that its rerun prior to Christmas engenders a huge misconception that it is a festive movie per se (giving it some innuendoes that are as boring to hear as the perpetrators claiming the very film supposedly is). It is cynical ignorance neither to contextualize this film nor to even bother to understand the purpose, approach and point of this film without even the slightest vestige of educating oneself about what this film stands for. Some critics have not even watched it in its entirety! A cyclical corollary of finding it boring in the first place- disconcertingly hypocritical! Now, critiques of its kitsch over the top 'Capra-Corn' Americana or even its 'subversive' political agendas bearing the peasant class and their feudal overlords may find their cases warranted to some degree. Even so, in the end, these critics are actually forgetting the deal. Who cares if Stewart's character reeks of being a democrat? That's missing the dish!! Why? Well, to find out you've got to discover the film's purpose. Capra wanted to blaze positivity when he released this right after traumatic WWII (using his new soul-searching company aptly called 'Liberty Films') in an upheaval climate of fear and anxiety to discuss life and meaning out of hardship. Themes of commitment, hope, ambition, depression, loneliness, loyalty, sacrifice, love, pain, despair, insecurities, hurts, and forgiveness and ultimately, redemption are the under girding basis for its purpose. The very point was to prove that life was not about mercenary gain, worldly status achievements or success by anyone's standards- it was and is about the true joys of life if we open our hearts and minds to realize what we have: contentment, and simple childlike love. It's about the greater purposes beyond our own. As for the film being depressing, only those who fail to believe in its very message will find it as such. Plus, it was not meant to be a quintessential 'feel good' Christmas movie, it was only as such because years later a network aired it seasonally- cruelly ironic in that that very gesture was a complete and injudicious affront and lack of appraisal for the film. However, again, the film doesn't need anyone's approval, ratings, or Oscars to prove its value. Anyone who can breach the cynical ignorance and enjoy its message can enjoy it because the film, albeit non-esoteric or 'film school technically gifted', was nonetheless intended for that very lot of people who got it, who understood its magic- people who could appreciate its true meaning of being a crescendo of an affirmation of life, for auld lang syne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers -- ending discussed in vague, general termsThis movie is a moralistic one with a lot of important messages, but, dominantly, that it is important to learn to take satisfaction in a life that may not seem as glamorous or as exciting as the lives that others lead. In this movie, George Bailey (James Stewart)learns that lesson. He isn't as wealthy as some. He's never gotten to travel, BUT he has done a lot of good. He has a home. He has a family. He has lots of friends. And he has helped many, many people to live better lives. He comes to appreciate himself and appreciate what he has.This was not a fun movie for me. My husband is in the process of suing me for divorce and breaking up our family, precisely because he has failed to learn the lesson that this movie shows George Bailey learning, the lesson that life is not perfect, but it is still a blessing, and you can learn to take joy in something that is not everything you dreamed of. I don't think this movie is going to shake him out of his dogged determination to break up our family, either. As a result, the movie seemed pretty empty to me. There is no angel coming down here to set things right. There aren't hundreds of eager friends rushing in and trying to help. Moreover, it's a little hard to imagine a real person who has had as much positive effect on the world as George Bailey did. I mean his character is a real angel. How many people saved the lives of two others when they were just children? This just isn't very realistic.On another topic, my son, who is 10, had a really hard time with the part of the movie where George Bailey is shown how horrible his hometown would be without him. My son found this part too upsetting and demanded that we fast forward through it to get to the happy ending. People had told me that this was a suitable movie for children, but I don't agree, based on my son's reactions. This movie lacks sex (the bedroom scenes are filmed in PJs) and has very little violence, but that doesn't mean that it is suitable for children. It's really an adult movie. It shows real, adult suffering. The period of suspense is too long for a child.Moreover, the kinds of social interactions that are shown are much too sophisticated for a child to understand. My son just couldn't follow it without a lot of questions answered -- and that was a problem because the sound quality on the video we rented was really lousy, so we couldn't hear even with the volume turned up on max, especially when my son asked questions.Now for some triviaI can't help noticing in these old movies that people talk with an odd lilt. The only person who seems to talk normally is James Stewart. Does anyone know, do the other actors talk the way they do because American English has changed with time? Or do they speak the way some Hollywood acting coach taught them to speak to meet studio expectations?Another thing that I notice about this film is that they have Jimmy Stewart playing George Bailey from high school up through middle age -- and also Donna Reed playing the same range of ages. They just don't do the very young ages convincingly. Another thing I notice about these older films is that there are a lot more roles for older actors. More modern films don't seem to show very many people with grey hair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stewart plays the saintly George Bailey who, on the brink of committing suicide, gets sent an angel to sort things out in order for the angel to earn his wings. Hilariously parodied by more contemporary films and series, not excluding Married With Children, the idea and execution, let's be honest here, is trite and cloying. Stagy performances and a dragging screenplay is really all that there is for the viewer to mercilessly swallow while the lengthy running time of the film brutally tests one's patience. Had the director shaved off 30 minutes or so from the excruciatingly melodramatic and repetitive second act, the movie would have been far less exhausting, though the silly what-ifs the story puts forth wouldn't have been any less clunky and witless. Despite the technical achievement, which is impressive for its day and age, this is one of those classics the popularity of which simply lacks credibility. Perhaps Grandma and Gramps are still able to look kindly on this overblown, saccharine monstrosity, but anyone under 60 shouldn't be subjected to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the male stars of Hollywood's studio-dominated 'classic' era, James Stewart was the hammiest. He almost always shouts when a whisper would do; instead of striking an impressive pose, he's always squirming about, arms flailing. He's the melodramatic version of Jerry Lewis.His way-over-the-top performance in "It's a Wonderful Life" lingers like the taste of lettuce fried in lard atop a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich on a moldy McDonalds burger roll.But then there's the story itself. It's notable that Capra waited until the Depression was largely over before putting together this dreadful lie about it (which is what this film is really about). Apparently the banks didn't spend years foreclosing homes and farms? No one was displaced, we all held together in the small towns we grew up in? Family's weren't shattered and careers not ruined? It's wonderful baloney to serve with peanut-butter and fried lettuce.It's deplorable that American's think of this as a "Christmas classic." Christmas should be about joy, not self-centered delusion. The truth is, the world would have been the stronger is Stewart's character had never been born. The people in it need to find real reasons for living, not Capra's pandering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a wonderful film, or is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, I read observations from a fan of this movie that tried to explain the on-going appeal of it for audiences. The idea was that director Frank Capra had successfully blended lighthearted and observant touches about the human condition. Also, that Capra had skillfully used lead characters and supporting characters, many played by classic performers from 1940s Hollywood. So far, so good...but...There are plenty of films with light and observant touches featuring great actors that are not as well loved or appreciated by audiences. I really think the reason this film resonates so much is that it is expertly made when it comes to manipulating emotion. It taps into viewers' fears that the lives they've been living are insignificant and not good enough. Once that is overcome through a most contrived narrative, the viewer can fall back on a happy sappy holiday ending. The idea is certainly not original. It's clear that Capra is combining the suicide plot of MEET JOHN DOE with Dickens' Ghost of Christmas Future from A Christmas Carol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Wonderful Life is another one of those films that has had so many good things said of it that it leaves you not knowing where to begin a review of your own.I won't spend a lot of time pointing out this film's good qualities because you have either seen it for yourself or you have heard it countless times.I will just say that if you have not seen it,you need to.Not only because it's a great film,but it's one of the best,if not the best acting performance Jimmy Stewart ever gave.He literally took his character from one aspect of life to another with an unbelievable deftness,from the typical guy next door charm that we already knew him for to the look of horror in his eyes when none of his family,friends,or neighbors knew him or recognized him.It was one of the first,if not the first time he ever showed his amazing versatility as an actor,and this could be the one film that made Alfred Hitchcock want to work with this man so much in the years that followed.And it has a happy ending!That's something we don't see often anymore in this "Shades of gray" age we live in now.See it already!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever, Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said ill of this lovely movie? This is one of my all time favorites. I love seeing all of the old things that people used to be able to do, before political correctness, and before parents threatened to sue anyone who owned a tree, or a curb, or lived on a street, if God forbid little Johnnie got hurt by not watching what he was doing. Remember the pool scene in this movie? That is such a great part, and shows old fashioned American high spirits, and fun. Nowadays, everyone would be wearing helmets, life jackets, and the pool would have barbed wire, laser beam censors around it. ( not that I'm against pool safety for children, I am completely for it! but remember this is a "high school" dance here, in the movie ). Also, the little dog barking in the house when George and his brother are all rowdy; the good humored teasing between friends throughout the movie; little touches like these remind us of what it used to be like, to live in America.I love the Christian message, most of all. I love the scene in the graveyard, when the angel tells George, "Harry Bailey died because YOU weren't there to save Harry!" So many tearjerking, beautiful scenes like that really run this movie's message home, and it's an all around winner, for the holidays. I'm not quite so sure it's appropriate for little kids though; George's anger on Christmas Eve could be a little scary, or disturbing, for some youngsters. Frank Capra deserves to get several jewels in his crown for this one, for bringing the spirit of Christmas, and a reminder of the importance of life long friendships, to so many of us at what can be a lonely, and stressful time of year. If we watch "It's a Wonderful Life" and wish that we were part of a community like that, then we can go out and start to build that kind of life for ourselves. It's a good ideal to live up to. Basic, good people working hard, and finding the treasures of life along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people love the happy ending of the movie. When I watched it, I did too. Yeah, when Harry says "A toast to my big brother George: The richest man in town," I cried. I'm tearing up right now just thinking about it. But, darn it, all the happiness of the last few minutes of the movie doesn't cancel out all the misery contained in the rest of the movie. Another reviewer here called the movie "nauseating" and that is exactly what I would call it. This movie was so depressing that I was literally nauseated by it. At the end of the movie, I just wished George Bailey had followed his dreams and traveled around the world (and, if I remember right, become an architect). So what if Bedford Falls becomes Pottersville? Also, correct me if I'm wrong but I thought life insurance policies didn't cover suicide. George Bailey would never have been worth more dead than alive. I know this is a classic but I strongly dislike it. It's okay for a drama to be sad but I hate movies that are depressing. I had the same problem with Fritz Lang's SCARLET STREET. And I'd say IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is worse because SCARLET STREET is a film noir. You expect films noir to be depressing. But I heard so much about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE's happy ending and I just wasn't prepared for so much misery.I think I should add that I didn't write this review to agitate or incense anyone. And I'm not denying that this movie deserves its classic status. But this is honestly how I felt about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Count me among the proud minority who think this movie is drek.I love old movies. And I like Jimmy Stewart a whole lot. But this thing is just awful. And the fact that we are barraged incessantly with it, and that people rush to gush over it, just makes it all the more unbearable.My big problem with the whole thing is that I vociferously *reject* the movie's main premise, the moral premise that it is somehow good and right and wonderful to live only for others. George Bailey is a *doormat*; he never pursues the life he really wants, instead suppressing his desires in order to serve every other yahoo in town. He's a fool, and the only ending I would consider truly happy for him would be if he were to decide to close his pitiful, practically non-profit business, and go off and make something of his life. I'm sorry, but having a lot of people be grateful to you for being a willing doormat is just not making something of your life.I'm sorry, I just can't like a movie that takes altruism so far as to say that the only value of your life is how you helped others.</fullReview>

I saw it myself first on TV knowing very little about it other than the names Stewart, Capra, etc and I was totally blown away. I bought the DVD two or three years ago but didn't get around to watching it until now, and you know what, it STILL blew me away, me who likes to think he's streetwise and has a healthy does of cynicism in his make up and objects to being manipulated but with quality like this you just have to roll over and play dead.

		<shortDescription>socialism gift wrapped in holiday cheer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though only modestly received in its initial release, as "It's a Wonderful Life" has aged the film has shown itself to be one of Frank Capra's crowning achievements. It follows the life of the good natured and highly philanthropic George Bailey, who yearns for what the world offers outside the boundaries of his small town of Bedford Falls. It's a sad tale of a middle-aged man full of regret, jaded by years of disappointment and dreams that never took shape.Told mostly through back story, much of the narrative takes place between the two world wars, and exhibits a full emotional range, as it tells its highly moralistic tale of a dreamer beat down by the demands of reality. Shot in brilliant black and white, often with film noir style lighting and composition, Capra presents a story mostly about the plight of the working class, as they struggle against the repressive forces of capitalism. The fact that such a dark human drama can succeed at being simultaneously realistic and uplifting has made "It's a Wonderful Life" such an enduring film around the winter holidays, but it's far from being just a mere holiday morsel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie. Period. A "classic", I don't think so. This is a movie whose actual quality has been exceeded by its hype--though NOT because the producers or actors hyped it (like the typical overblown and over-hyped Hollywood film). In fact, when it was released it was not particularly successful (especially compared to other Frank Capra flicks).No, instead it reached legendary status for TWO reasons alone. It was a public domain video (hence NO ROYALTIES REQUIRED FOR SHOWING IT) AND its setting for the movie's conclusion was the holiday season. These two factors worked together to BLITZ the American public from the 1980s to the late 90s (until its copyright status was restored). I remember these dark days, when It's A Wonderful Life was literally shown on half a dozen channels at the same time!! Not even GREAT movies should be shown that much! As a result, many began proclaiming it a classic while some others got awfully tired of seeing it--which is a shame because it's a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like a lot of director Capra's films - but not this one.This is among one of the most vile floods of slush ever to be photographed. The characters are simpering when they aren't whining. James Stewart give us the worst, most over-wrought performance of his career - high-school student do better. The camera work looks expensive - and dull. The editing is perfunctory. There's no effort to use film to tell the story.The story itself is a banal rip-off from "The Christmas Carol" - but the worst part of it is that Stewart's character spends his every moment visiting the 'alternate universe' (that would have happened had he never been born) trying to convince everyone that he really was born, and there is no 'alternate universe' - which makes no sense whatsoever, and completely blows any chance at insightful or revelatory alternate character development, and reduces his final submission to fate to a rather cheap, histrionic "gee, I'm sorry; let's try it again, OK?" The raw cynicism that went into the making of this film - kept alive by generations of movie-reviewers as a kind of shared in-joke ("hey, let's face it, most Amereicans are just dumb" - would be frightening if it hadn't sold so well - which is the really scaring thing about it.</fullReview>

The guy is an idiot and cannot seem to get the picture that it was the idiotic Uncle Billy who has (insert appropriate word)ed up so why does George want to kill himself? How happy I'd be if Mrs. Bailey had, as his widow, run away with the banker and lived happily ever after. Add to this the caricature of the greedy banker and you get such a bucket of swill that the DVD should come with a barf warning. This should have been an embarrassment to Donna Reed -- she did so much better on TV. I'd like to point out that the "Vomit" comment and other negative reviews unfairly blame their relatives for the urge to puke during this movie. It's the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like a good slushy feel good film as next as the next man, but this takes it one stage too far. The original concept is an intriguing one and needs to be more fully explored in another film, as it isn't done justice in this movie.How often do people just give money away purely out of the goodness of their own hearts? If a bank ran out of money, or had it 'stolen' by some ridiculously over-the-top pantomime villain, people would not react in a cheery manner. EXCEPT that this is Christmas, and everybody loves each other.The set is impressive, some of the acting is good, the children are only marginally annoying but the fairy tale ending pushes the boundaries of reality too far. You may argue that in a movie with angels and genuinely nice Americans reality has been pretty much thrown out of the window, but the fantastical plot elements detract from a story that otherwise could have been thought-provoking and morally uplifting.Starts off good, turns bad and then gets very ugly in the final scenes. 3 out of 10.

		<shortDescription>Where to begin? (Mildly spoilerish)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously: Where to begin on all the problems with this movie? Doesn't matter. Let's start with the fact that you get to see God. No mortals get to see God! Not even the prophets and the disciples, with the exception of Moses. But Moses only saw him from behind, in one of the most beautiful stories in the entire bible. What's more, why is God a matte painting of a galaxy with a flash light blinking behind it with every syllable of his white male 30-year old voice? It's even stupider than Celcil B. Demille's flame throwing spiral in "The Ten Commandments". Then there's the characters. George Bailey, no matter how well acted, is the most annoying person I have ever had the displeasure of watching. His screaming and voice are enough to make anyone jump for the earplugs. His stupidity isn't all that sympathetic either. Mary isn't well-developed, and as for Mr. Potter? Since when do brilliant Christmas stories have more cartoonish villains than Dr. Doom or "Silence of the Lamb"'s Buffalo Bill? Then there are a lot of fundamentally disturbing messages in the film. I do grant that, though obvious, the message that every person does something in their life is worth hearing, even though it was spectacularly over done here. (I've always wondered about the brother. There must have been ten other kids around when he started drowning. Why didn't any of them save him? And why didn't anyone marry the girl, dooming her to the worst fate possible of Old maid?). First, there is no doubt that Christianity is fundamentally real. There's no need for faith, because God exists as a galaxy, and he'll send down an angel if you're a good little boy. Also, suburbia is the best thing ever. There is nothing worse than a living urban city with, oh my god, Negroes. Capitalism is evil. It is more important to be nice to a bunch of people in some tiny town than to go out and do something in the world. Dumb people are more honest than educated ones. It is horrifyingly unthinkable to be annoyed by one Christmas carol played over and over and over. Comedic relief doesn't have to be funny. Two hour films don't have to have anything interesting.There are other things too. The writing just isn't that good. None of the stories are relevant to the plot, and even the timing is heavily off, all of the good stuff thrown into a few minutes at the very end. Face it. As heartwarming as this film is, it's not that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I'll admit it. I'm an action movie buff. Mostly I like it when things blow up, and typically dramas bore me. But I do like a movie with a point to make, and an intellectual theme if there's not too much melodrama."It's a Wonderful Life" has a passable plot, but it's showing its age and pretty boring and feels longer than its 2 hours. The plot is a straight arrow without much in the way of clever twists. The attempts at comedy with Charlie the angel are truly awful.Most disturbing is the religious theme. This isn't a movie about a person who happens to be very religious (such as The Big Kahuna, or Contact, both of which I enjoyed). Rather, this film makes the assumption that the viewing audience will be touched by Christian metaphors such as angels. You could get away with that in a mainstream film back in the white male Christian dominated society, but it doesn't work today.Who should see this film:-- film buffs who can't help themselves-- religious types looking for a Christmas storyI believe that movie ratings should reflect a movie's impact on today, not back when it came out. So although "It's a Wonderful Life" may have been a classic way back when, I am forced to give it only a 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

The first half of the film (where all the "bad stuff" happens) is MUCH too long; it goes on FOREVER. The part after his suicide attempt is much too short, and doesn't dispel the "depressing-ness" of the beginning. Plus, the scene where the clerk hits young Stewart on the ear is an extremely brutal (&amp; violent) scene for that era; it STILL bothers me!If you want to see GOOD Capra, check out "Arsenic &amp; Old Lace", "Lost Horizon", "Lady For a Day", "You can't take it with you".....in fact, any film BUT this one!It may be a "Wonderful Life".....but, it's a lousy movie!</fullReview>

Due to this films close association with Christmas I can only assume that people would feel guilty to call this film what it really is, BAD. Personally I feel that "It's a Wonderful life" has not stood up to the test of time and is a tacky film fit for the 40's and only the 40's. The acting is not incredibly impressive since the roles are practically made from character cookie cutters, the cinematography is simple and is not even creative for its time, and the plot is not creative or interesting since sci-fi had already covered time travel and "what if" situations by 1946. Therefore I feel that people should stop defending this garbage called a movie, in the name of religion and tradition. Due to situations like this not enough pressure is put on the movie industry to create decent films. This is why movies like Home alone, and the ring become large grossing movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that there is approximately four other people on the planet who think like I do and can agree that this film is terrible. Everybody loves it for some reason, but I have absolutely hated it ever since I watched it for the first time.'It's a Wonderful Life' is so boring. Now I've sat through some pretty dull films before, but this is unheard of. The thing is, I can usually get into the older movies. I just can't get into this one. I first saw this film a couple of years ago in school, and have unfortunately, been forced to watch it a few more times just because everybody in the entire world thinks that it is wonderful. I wouldn't normally comment on a film that is so bad, but being that it IS bad and entirely overrated, I am forced to voice my opinion.The cast is terrible. I've never seen James Stewart in anything else and I don't plan to. He starts off good, everything's fine, but as time progresses, he becomes so annoying that I want to jump up and turn the TV off. What can I say about Donna Reed except that she is a horrible actress who manages to contribute very little to this horrible picture. Well, that's about it for the cast, I suppose. Minor role players such as Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, and Henry Travers are equally unimpressive.The writing and the script itself are mind-numbingly stupid. 'It's a Wonderful Life' is supposedly the tale of a depressed man who gets the chance to see what life would have been like if he had never been born. Okay, so how long exactly is it supposed to take to get to the damn point? The movie drags on and on and finally after about four hours (it seemed like that long to me), George Bailey meets Clarence, his angel, and is whisked away to the life where he doesn't exist. So, basically the film tries to make a point and, I guess, finally does. There's a couple of people out there who think that 'It's a Wonderful Life' is NOT a Christmas movie. Well, they're right. Why is everyone under the impression that this movie is a Christmas movie? It's clearly not.'It's a Wonderful Life', a terrible movie if there ever was one, currently appears on the Top 250 list. It's also managed to jump onto just about everyone else's favorites list, but I don't know how. Its nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director, among others, is unbelievable and ridiculous. The film is boring, slow-paced, and has no point to it for about the whole 130 minutes. Frank Capra and this movie are overrated and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Avoid at all cause.</fullReview>

His guardian takes him on a journey through the duration of the film and grants him his wish. He begins to see the way things would be if he never existed. He had attempted suicide in the past, and the Angel begins to show him that the world would be different with out this man. The only really good part about this movie is that the Angel gets his wings for doing such a great job on his mission to show the man his value. Overall this movie is just not that great. Christmas movies were meant to bring holiday cheer and this film does the exact opposite! I give this movie a 1 and I don't recommend that anyone watch it? ever!!! Also, it takes on stressed out person to ever question their existence, and an insecure one at that, and how is this supposed to get you into the holiday mood? It definitely doesn't cheer me up; its kin of makes me depressed actually. So don't waist your time with lame and un-happy movies such as this. Just so drink some cocoa and sit by the tree to get into the holiday spirit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although my opinion is not the general consensus, I think this is a horrible film. Clarence taunts Bailey, rather than providing a supportive ear (for instance, when Clarence is in the water crying, "help, help"), and when he is in the bar also. I sat through this film once, because somebody else wanted me to watch it with them. I slept through a good portion of it as well, and it was probably better that I did. I don't feel that I missed much, by not watching the film in it's entirety. This could have been a great film if Clarence had been more empathic with Bailey, rather than mocking, laughing at, and talking moralistically to him.</fullReview>
