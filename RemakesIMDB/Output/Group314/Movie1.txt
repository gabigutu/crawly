		<shortDescription>Very poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to watch an hour of this film before turning it off. Remakes of 80's horror films are a dime a dozen nowadays. Some go straight to DVD, some to the theatres, some with big budgets, some with small.Although well versed in cinema and movies, the original 'Night of the Demons' has evaded my radar and so I had no memories of the original 80's film (soon to be watched though).Regardless of whether the original was a good film or not, this updated version is a waste of time. Shannon Elizabeth should have words with her agent, as I don't think her career has derailed to the point that she needs to be doing cheap horror films. Edward Furlong is clearly in it for the money and you can sense that he knows he has yet again signed up to appear in something cheap and crap.The film premise is simple...party goers at an old abandoned house discover skeletons in the basement. One gets bit and possessed by a demon who in turn ends up getting others possessed. Blood and death follow. We've seen it many times before done a lot better.The acting is poor, the script is basic and flawed. The direction is standard with nothing inventive thrown in.I used to say to my friends that you'd never get away with making some of the horrors of the 80's in this day and age. The 80's was a glorious time for cheap, cheesy, silly films which are fun and enjoyable with ridiculous stories and ideas which would not pass as well on modern audiences....but it seems we are getting a new wave of these films. Problem is, they aren't as entertaining and magical. It doesn't work for the modern era. Instead, films like this just come off as cheap, careless and crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Halloween night to forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Uh okay. So, they're demons."Lots of pretty, B-level actresses in slutty Halloween costumes being killed. Lots of dumb guys. A decent amount of gore. A paper-thin plot about some demons haunting a house in New Orleans on Halloween. Not very scary. Ample amounts of chessiness and campiness. Some okay monster designs. An amateurish script. Late-night TV quality production values. Some really terrible Halloween-themed rock music. A powerful urge on my part to fast-forward a lot. &nbsp; &nbsp;That's basically my experience with Night of the Demons, in a nutshell. I can't compare this to the original movie, as I haven't seen it. But on its own merits, it's not funny or scary enough to really be worthwhile. But hey, boobs. Check the cast list and see if that makes this pretty mediocre flick worth watching for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bearable enough but overall kinda weak stab at trashy remake fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached this one with a little trepidation, but equally a fair degree of straightforward interest. I'm something of a fan of the original, which delivers a fine freight of cheese, gore and nudity, along with witty writing and inspired direction. It was still a decidedly mindless film though, no heavy plotting or unique insights into the human condition, a workable template therefore for a remake or re-visiting, not the sort of thing that would be too hard to do well with, at least on a mindless fun trash level. Moreover this is the second outing from genre hopeful couple Adam Gierasch and Jace Anderson, after last years Autopsy, a decent but flawed affair that mostly delivered some nasty gore and splashes of sure handed direction. This film sadly is a bit of a step down, not as accomplished or effective as Autopsy, which was already weighted with problems, and certainly no match for the original. On the good side of things, this one does mount well, nicely paced, likeably written and easy moving, it has a certain grasp of how to build up into events satisfactorily and a pleasing feel to it, backed up by serviceable performances and a cool and mildly creepy location. Castwise, Edward Furlong does well, looking a bit tired and frazzled but still bearing ample charisma, whilst Shannon Elizabeth does nicely as Angela, sizzlingly macabre and seductive when needed to be. Otherwise, all do pretty well, though without stand outs. I hadn't heard of many of the cast before watching, I presume a fair few were teen film alumni or folk from US TV, no one is bad as such but no one really distinguished. Chuckles are provided by a little turn from Tiffany Shepis and a brief spot for Linnea Quigley. In the general course of the film there are some moments of imagination, some of flair and a general light dusting of fun, in fact it almost seems churlish to come down hard on such a thing, but much as the film seeks to be likable and I even wanted to like it, it slips up too much. There is never any real tension and though the film is cheesy, laughs are few. Once inside the house and even when things get going, the direction is perfunctory, without any notable flair or real excitement, with some of the action even marred by lame rapid fire editing. There is also unfortunate use of CGI and an over-tame feel to things, there is a smidgen of kinkiness to a few scenes, but the film shies away from nudity or anything really sleazy or steamy, far from the enthusiastic trash of the original. The famed lipstick scene is revisited and beefed up, but to lesser effect, the film generally feels like its pretending to be sexier and trashier than it really is, ultimately coming off a little lame in its efforts. Also, there is an unfortunate lack of gore, with the grisliest moments all too brief and not looking especially effective. Put simply, a few sparkles aside this is surprisingly weak, half baked stuff, it may be mindless entertainment for some but it was very much lacking in potency for me. Approach with care, I'd say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It wasn't scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching the original "Night of the Demons" back in the late 80's, so I had somewhat mixed feelings about this movie. Initially I thought something in the lines of "why does the world need a re-told version of this movie?" When the movie started, I was pleasantly surprised with the intro, at least, because it had that certain unique Lovecraftian touch to it. But I also thought, if this is how the movie is going to be all the way through, it will be too much, too unbearable. Luckily, the movie did change over to become an ordinary-styled movie.Well, the storyline is pretty straight forward, and no twists or turns to the events that unfolded. The movie was also somewhat true to the original 1988 movie, but of course with some major changes, which was actually good to see. But overall, the story was predictable and somewhat stale, even if you haven't seen the original movie.The effects and the setting was quite alright, and the demons did looks alright, I will give them that much.There was a sex scene in the movie that made me almost still my coffee. That was just too ridiculous, trust me, you will know what I am talking about when you see the movie, or if you have already seen it. I am not giving away details, but that was just downright stupid.As for the cast. Well, there were some known faces, no major stars though. I am not a fan of Edward Furlong, but he actually did a good job in the role here. I had to look twice when I first saw Edward Furlong, but yeah, that was him alright. And another familiar face is Shannon Elizabeth, though her performance in the movie seemed more like it was some project she just wanted to get over with.I suppose for people who haven't seen the original "Night of the Demons", this movie will be quite a blast. It has enough action and suspense to keep you interested. There is also a good amount of gore and effects in the movie. So that is a plus. But for us who have seen the original version, then this action-packed remake is a hollow attempt at bringing something old back to life. Don't get me wrong, the movie is good in itself, it should just have been made as something else, not a remake of that old movie.For me, this movie was the type that you watch once and never again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can someone give this film a clue?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film 4 frightfest premiere 'Night of the demons' is all over the place as a film. Unfortunately it tries to be a teen comedy and a scary horror. It fails spectacularly at both. The gore despite being brutal is quick and can barely be seen and the scares unoriginal. Everything that happened in the film felt like the director was constantly winking at the audience. If this film was so self-knowing then why did the characters descend into parody. This film was all over the place. It wanted to be Scream and Friday the 13th. There is the worst exposition you'll ever see when the demons are explained. But I think the director thought he was being funny. I just thought it was stupid. The bad taste was totally misjudged, there were some scenes which were so over-the-top, yet everything else seemed restrained.'Night of the demons' is a very odd film. See it only as a curio of why modern horror has gone badly wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost the fun of the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason this is getting a 2 is because the creature effects were actually pretty good. The movie took too long to get to the gore. I was looking forward to the new plot points, change of location, reason for demons. But none of the saved this terrible movie. Edward Furlong looks like a bloated Jodie Foster and Shannon Elizabeth was sadly under used in the sexy department. It makes no sense that the survivors could figure out all of the details of the demons' plans in like 5 min and sit in a room until dawn to be protected. Barely a chase and the demons took over too quickly. The original and even the sequel are just good B horror movie fun, and this was just garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if this was intended on being a remake of the 1980's version of the same title, but they are most certainly not one in the same. This movie is just another case of fluff horror. Cheesy gore, generic demons, and the token occasional boob shot. The acting in this movie was terrible as well, I've seen better performances in a grammar school play than this movie contained. Not that I expected a masterpiece out of this movie, but some entertainment would have been nice. I could not have imagined a bigger insult to the original movie than this movie. The next time, if you are going to call something a remake with the same title as another movie, you may want to use some of the original plot lines from the older version. This movie has nothing going for it, skip this one at all costs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demonic fun eventually burns itself out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this surprisingly enjoyable with pretty decent directing and cinematography. As an example, notice how the flashback hanging scene was filmed. Notice also the peculiar angles chosen and the transitions between characters at the party. This was not just standard-TV movie quality with minimal effort. The acting was nothing to write home about but I found Edward Furlong (the kid from Terminator 2) really looking and acting the part of the messed up, desperate, drug dealer-addict (how much acting was involved is another question ;) The girl playing Maddie was fine and I found the goth hostess of the party, Shannon Elizabeth, pretty appealing and seductive. I even felt a bit sorry for her.The plot itself involving demons having to corrupt and possess several people on Halloween night in an enclosed manor was serviceable, and had a few nice twists, and a few bad ones near the end as well. I found the make-up effects on the demons rather good, especially for the girls. I can't say I was ever really scared, but there was suspense. Pretty fun B-movie fare with above-average directing, yet once the survivors got in a room protected by spells, things started going badly. Badly as in illogical or very convenient things happening that shattered my sense of disbelief. I kept asking myself how could this happen (demon hands through walls), why the demons acted this way or just didn't do anything (when someone climbs down a rope), why this character did these stupid, unnecessary things (going out to shoot demons and what comes afterwards). Seems to me the writers painted themselves in a corner with that protected room and had to start "cheating" so the rest of the film wouldn't just be boring waiting. I would have given a 6 (good), perhaps more, for the movie until that room and 4 (poor) for that part after. I suppose it averages to 5.Rating: 5 out of 10 (average)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's play "hide the lipstick"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, perhaps if all remakes were as unpretentious and amusing as "Night of the Demons", people wouldn't complain so much about the deterioration of the horror genre in general? This one is several hundred miles away from being a good or even semi-memorable horror movie, but it's entertaining while it lasts and offers plentiful of adequate make-up effects, a suitably light-headed atmosphere and a whole lot of yummy voluptuous actresses in revealing Halloween costumes! In all fairness, I also have to admit that it was pretty impossible to mess up a remake of the modest 1988 cult-favorite. The original "Night of the Demons", as well as both of its sequels released during the 1990's, was a very simplistic and unpretentious little flick also and it's rather easy to accomplish a present day update for the post-2000 horror audiences by making just a few minor changes left and right. The titular night still refers to the Halloween celebration, but instead of an abandoned funeral home like in the original, the party mansion is now a sinister family estate where once ? in the roaring 20's ? a horrible tragedy occurred when a desperate woman tried to win the love of a man trough a séance, but she ended up awakening seven demons that were even exiled from hell for being too bloodthirsty. To reign again, the demons require seven human bodies to possess, and let this just happen to be the exact number of idiots that remain loafing around the house after the police rudely interrupted the party. Hostess Angela is the first victim to mutate, and through seductive games and lesbianism she gradually causes the rest to go demon too. The mansion's history records may have altered slightly, but director/co-writer Adam Gierasch nevertheless blatantly copies the main trumps and highlight sequences of the 1988 original. Most notably the infamous sequence with the lipstick receives an update and furthermore the movie revolves on luscious twenty-something people that flirt, drink and cannot keep their hormones under control. The kills and make-up effects are well-handled, but nowhere near as imaginative as in the old installments and there's zilch tension, logic or sympathy for the characters. I presume that supporting actresses Diora Baird ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre: New Beginning") and Bobbi Sue Luther ("Laid to Rest") were exclusively cast for their large bra-sizes and their willingness to share their beautiful boobs with the rest of the world, whereas Monica Keena ("Freddy Vs. Jason") has the tough responsibility to depict an amiable and more or less intellectual heroine. "Night of the Demons" also features two relatively washed up stars of the 90's in the shape of Shannon Elizabeth and Edward Furlong. The former hasn't appeared in anything significant since she went topless in "American Pie" and the latter will probably always remain the kid from "Terminator II" and "American History X". But seriously, Edward Furlong looks terrible these days? Pretty much like he's consuming nothing but drugs and alcohol since the year 2000. Oops, I just quickly checked his biography here on the site, and it actually appears to be true. Sorry, Edward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had decent hopes for this one, being a fan of the cheesy and fun original, but alas, was disappointed yet again. First off, other than demons, in a house and the title, nothing else is similar to the original. Calling this an update not a remake would seem more apt.I was surprised to see a few decent B-actors in this film, as when I first heard about it, figured it'd be a bunch of no names with maybe a brief cameo or two. There is one brief cameo I noticed, Linnea Quigley answering the door for trick or treater's.To the actors, Shannon Elizabeth looks about mid 40s in this film. Definitely not the hottie "Nadia" in the first 2 American Pie films, or sexy like her Maxim Days or for that matter, Scary Movie. Doira Baird looks good, real good if you like your women with breasts the size of pumpkins. Monica Keena, looked amazing. What a body! Not that you get to see anything under those clothes. And Edward Furlong. Not sure what his story has been the past 15 years, but he looks like a bloated drug addict. Not just this movie either. As far as the acting goes, its serviceable, but don't expect major thespian work here.The directing was all over the map. I think the best parts were in the beginning with the whole silent film tactic used for the back story. It was well done, and although re-used throughout parts of the film, could have been nicer to see more of.The demon effects were well done, but the gore was hammy. And although there is loads of blood on screen, there isn't much gory deaths. Basically total cheese fight encounters that make you groan in disbelief than getting pumped up for. Seriously, watching a couple young kids playfight in the backyard would seem to have more choreography.In closing, the film could have had a lot more. Better kills, cleaner fights, more nudity (why just show a quick peak?), cleaner direction, better story. It plays like a comedy with horror undertones, which if the tables were flipped into a horror with some comedy, would have been much more entertaining. Not the worst thing I've seen this year, but far, far, far from the best or even mediocre. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So awful that it manages to give a worse name to terrible remakes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, the plot of this film slightly differs from the NIGHT OF THE DEMONS from 1987 that we all know and love. There are new elements introduced that explain the backstory of the possessed house where teens get turned into demons. But explaining evil is fruitless, it can't be done without sounding generic, and that's the way it sounds in this movie.The writing, directing, and acting are all horrid. Edward Furlong looks and sounds like he is still on the same hard drugs that cost him his role in TERMINATOR 3. The others are no better, as the characters get on your nerves less than five minutes into the movie and things never improve from there.The writing consists mainly of clichéd "chick" dialogue, as well as nonstop blatant profanities. The direction is clichéd MTV style, with swooping, rapid-fire camera-work at every turn, and production values that are far too glossy. Any chances at scares are ruined by the terrible direction and gratingly abrasive heavy metal music.Since there is no suspense or mood built whatsoever, the gore scenes are rendered incredibly boring, so gore cannot be recommended as a reason to watch this mess. Despite having an obviously higher budget than the original, the makeup effects in the original are far superior to this film! The filmmakers were obviously too inept to take advantage of the money and new technology they had.The nudity cannot be recommended, as the girls have ridiculous (and quite disgusting) fake breasts. Even the sex scenes and gratuitous girl-on-girl kissing scenes are as unsexy as they can be.Speaking of disgusting, the famous lipstick scene is reenacted in a much more repulsive manner, which (like everything else in the film) seems to be done for the sake of being disgusting.ZERO stars, NOTHING to recommend, not even of a "so bad it's fun" level -- a crappy movie you'll regret paying for. My faith in Screamfest definitely went down for showing this drivel in its 2010 lineup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shannon Elizabeth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to say much about this movie itself. I never actually bought it. Hell, it started with Cally Harper Ewing in DALLAS, I was nuts about Cathy Podewell, so, when RavenGlamDVDCollector got his electronic gun, I Googled her, went Wikipedia, and found she was, besides EARTH ANGEL and an episode of BEVERLY HILLS 90210, in titles I didn't know about. NIGHT OF THE DEMONS. Research on that one showed (a) it's total junk! (b) it's a very active franchise. I finally got a great deal, and ordered NIGHT OF THE DEMONS for next to nothing, a giveaway price, hell, I thought I could smile at the offal heads as they terrorized the little screamer. Sh...ucks! When it came, it was the 2009 remake. No, readers, it hadn't been my mistake, the seller posted the wrong picture, and when informed nicely by me, they apologized, and immediately rectified, the same thing happened with BLACK Christmas as well. But I kept my purchase, it was Shannon American PIE Elizabeth after all, I noticed. Gee, I knew I'd possibly rant against it in many ways. That's the break when you collect with the actresses in mind, it's way often not your kind of fun, but you're insisting on that girl, and that one, and that one...Somewhere here, in a review or a board post, I read somebody commenting on Shannon's performance, putting her down, as basically a half-hearted participant in this movie, looking like she doesn't want to be a part of it. That's a serious allegation. Come on! "Poster" might be referring to the character in the early part of the movie, so is confusing what is necessitated by the script. Let me just say that Shannon is quite the "Mistress of the Dark" dollybird in here, loved the fringe, and that 'come hither' dance midway in the movie. I think, in my own opinion, she did damn well!As far as horrors go, sh** there is one super- scary jump-out-of-your-seat moment, I'm sure those who have watched knows where it is! but all in all, there are so many low points... And the male lead, that Edward Furlong whatever bloke, gee, there's somebody just coasting along for the pay-check. Doesn't play the part with a hint of conviction. Just ploughs through the lines. Pain.Gross-out overdone scenes just make for a silly experience. The much-mentioned 'lipstick scene' is certainly a new low point in 'sexy adult' movie history. That 'ripped-off face' was poxy, very, very poxy. As for all the maggoty gore, sick joys to the sickos out there. And, as for Miss Wonderbra, that just doesn't cut it as glamorous, dear, too (two?) trashy, Suzanne. Though I liked luscious Lily with the cat whiskers, meow!!Not that bad, but far from good. Excess is never a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing much going on here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't watched the original NIGHT OF THE DEMONS yet so I can't comment on this film's status as a remake, but what I can say is that it's a pretty poor and entirely ordinary horror movie. The storyline is a predictable one, with guests at a party finding themselves possessed one by one by demons, so that means the execution is going to have to be pretty spectacular for this film to be a success.Well, it isn't. The directorial style is a disappointment, the film made in such a way that it already feels more dated than many an '80s production. Half the running time seems to be made up of bimbo characters running around in next to nothing, and the other half sees characters in cheesy demon masks attempting to menace the viewer. There isn't as much gore as you'll expect, and virtually nothing to remember the film by.I admit that I got a kick out of seeing Edward Furlong in this movie. He's clearly a guy who's suffered hardship in real life, but I found his performance a surprisingly sensitive one. He's the best thing in it. Bobbi Sue Luther and Shannon Elizabeth are entirely convincing as the bimbo characters although I'm not sure whether that's really a compliment. Linnea Quigley's cameo is just wrong although the actress playing the main girl (sorry, not sure of her name) isn't too bad. Still, NIGHT OF THE DEMONS is a bland remake, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This horror film is certainly adult entertainment and children should be shielded from much of its imagery. However, for adults it is a superb motion picture experience and the entire production is nothing less than outstanding. Bobbie Sue Luther and Shannon Elizabeth give wonderful performances and are highlights within a fine ensemble cast. It is, though, Ms. Elizabeth that really lights up the screen and she is an utter delight throughout. The script is leaps and bounds superior to most horror film offerings, both witty and horrifying, and the direction is taut and imaginative. Also, the make-up and special effects are quite extraordinary, with some very memorable sequences. The cinematography deserves special recognition for creating the hauntingly disturbing environment and frightening atmosphere required buy the proceedings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Enough A Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Night of the Demons - the original trilogy, which except for the last movie, was fun, scary and consistent. I've would have loved to have created a remake with a much broader, wider vision and elaboration of the original story, but this movie did not go there. This movie is not a remake; it's an update. It's nearly stuck on the original script, but it does include some references to the previous NOTD sequels: the demons turn to smoke, a girl's breasts turn into something... but it also wastes time trying to explain itself. The flashback isn't needed. The first movie was basically a work of art with proper amounts of music, sexuality, but in this update, those aspects are force fed. They're way over the top. Another thing, the house and set are boring; unlike the old Adams Boulevard structure (knocked down after the second movie) in the original which had a personality and character of its own. One charming factor is the use of Shannon Elizabeth (13 Ghosts) and Monica Keena (Jason vs. Freddie) as would-be modern horror stars. Plot wise, it's not believable. Monica's character just happens to find the things she needs and when the "survivors" are trapped upstairs, they never consider going out the freaking window. Bottom line: an overall C- on the whole movie. It has so much potential that is never reached.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fun than the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Night of the Demons (1988) was a trashy, low budget B-movie horror in which a coherent plot and decent direction proved far less important than its cheapo monsters, gore, and titillation courtesy of scream queen Linnea Quigley, and babes Jill Terashita and Cathy Podewell. This remake opts for the same lowbrow approach, but manages to be much more fun thanks to slicker (and sicker) special effects, a decent pace, better performances, a willingness to get nice 'n' twisted, and even hotter women (Diora Baird, dressed in a basque and fishnets as a sexy cat, is stunning, while Bobbi Sue Luther's breasts steal every scene they are in).The film starts off in cracking form with a sepia-toned flashback in which Evangeline Broussard, the owner of a New Orleans mansion, gives herself a bit too much rope to hang herself, her head popping off as a result. The action then shoots forward 85 years to the present day, where hottie Angela (Shannon Elizabeth) has organised a debauched Halloween party in the Broussard house. After the police raid the place, Angela and a few of her friends are left trapped in the house where, one by one, they become possessed by seven hideous demons: cue face ripping, breast tearing, doggie-style demon sex, disembowelment, tentacled titties, an outrageous new take on the original's 'lipstick in the breast' gag, and rusty nail/shotgun carnage.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a terrible remake of the 80's classic. I suppose the original is classic in terms of it not being too serious.Anyway, the plot is essentially the same. Angela decides to host a party in an old house on Halloween to "raise cash" for some unknown reason...its never explained why her life depends on getting money from a party which really can't be all that much.We also are introduced to several other characters who are largely forgettable. Eddie Furlough shows up...for the first time since Terminator 2, haha, and plays a drug dealer who owes someone else a lot of money and goes to the party to deal in order to make that money.The rest of the cast are girls one step away from being in straight-up porn.The effects are decent and the setting is good. The plot leave something to be desired.A few holes here:Apparently rust will keep demons at bay...yeah, because demons are made up of ancient elements like iron and rust "corrupts" iron. So anything rusty will hurt a demon. Yeah I didn't buy it either.Also, in the original film, they couldn't escape because the brick wall surrounding the house was very high and smooth i.e. no climbing out...that and the gate vanished. In this version, the wall is never shown to be all that high and its covered in vines...plus the gate is right there. Pretty sure they could have climbed over.Anyway, its worth watching but its not anywhere near close to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film,good effects good acting good plot,of course the first one was better but get over it already, we need to see some new stuff,when i saw the new nightmare on elm street without Robert England i almost had a heart attack...then i got over it...So if you want to see a good horror flick watch this and you wont regret it,i didn't and neither did my friends,it was fun it was funny it was a bit scary it was good!Furlong was pretty good,Monika was better before her lip surgery,Bobby Sue was a bomb and Diora was pretty and i think that she is way better with the blonde hair not the brown.I really liked the Jason character because he was calm and innocent,Shannon was okay but i prefer her without all that Gothic dark bad look,i really liked the original Angela from the original movie,now that was one hell of a costume and really scary,where did that actress go?She wasn't in the second movie and that was a shame because she was a great Angela!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice homage to the original. The writers apparently decided to 'fix' a few things with the original plot, but in the end they deliver a comfortably typical horror movie.In the original, there was no reason why the demons should have failed to kill/possess all the kids. The demons seemed to just show up randomly and chase them around. Here, the writers spent some effort to lay down some rules, so the demons can try to work around them. The kids (young adults, really - they're all apparently over 21) even get a means to fight back. So there's a real battle going on, and just maybe, some of them will walk out alive. Or not. From the early mirror scene, I could tell that the director knew that he was making a cliché demon/slasher/horror movie, and it's a remake to boot. So while he plays a little bit with our expectations, he ultimately delivers the conventional horror movie that the audience is expecting.No, its not terribly inventive. No, there's very little here that's new. But it has sex, it has gore, it's got a few jolts and some wry jokes, and a nice little surprise at the end. This is a movie that wears a smirk and a wink, and hopes you enjoy the show. I love the little touches, like the glimpse of a party guest wearing an "Alice in Wonderland" outfit. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Punk rock demon flick remake with rocking soundtrack, just OK.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'NIGHT OF THE DEMONS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Low budget Halloween horror film from director Adam Gierasch, co-written by Gierasch and Jace Anderson. The same team also co-wrote the Tobe Hooper film 'TOOLBOX MURDERS' and Gierasch directed the 2008 after-dark-horror fest entry 'AUTOPSY' (both entertaining 'B' horror films). This is a remake of the cult classic of the same name from 1988 which spawned two sequels. It stars an assortment of B movie stars and has-beens (like Shannon Elizabeth and Edward Furlong). The film tells the story of a trio of girls (Monica Keena ,of 'FREDDY VS. JASON' fame, Diora Baird and Bobbie Sue Luther) who attend a Halloween party thrown by their friend (Elizabeth) at a notorious mansion where six people disappeared eight years earlier and the owner hung herself. Two of the girls run into their ex-boyfriends (Furlong and Michael Copon) and their friend (John F. Beach) and the seven get locked in the mansion after the party's shut down by the cops. They find the skeletons of the six missing people in the basement and soon learn they're being picked off by demons. The film has a great carefree punk attitude and the soundtrack rocks. It's a little reminiscent of the 'EVIL DEAD' films and Gierasch's directing is more than adequate for this type of film. A lot of the acting is pretty bad though, the dialog is weak and many scenes are kind of pointless. I haven't seen the original film or it's sequels so I don't know how this remake compares but as far as other B horror films go I'd say it's pretty average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the remakes, it's clear it's the 2000s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Adam Gierasch gives a mediocre to decent view on the remake of the 1986 film Night of the Demons. The release of this film has been tied up for a while due to the debate whether it should earn a theatrical or direct to DVD run. It finally settled on premiering at the London FrightFest Film Festival back in Halloween 2009 and finally was released on DVD this year. The film falls in the category of unnecessary remakes and as a film itself it just isn't that grade. Not only did the word "remake" turn me off but so did the word "demons".When demons enter the picture trouble follows. Demons require a lot of pointless backstory. Unfortunately you need the backstory to understand the damn movie itself. It's like Final Destination, only it's much more easier to understand whats going on because, while not logical, is a strangely effective way for you to keep watching to show how odd these people die. Demons are fictional creatures and they involve spells, writings, and a history. It gets worse when people try to explain whats going on and it's like "just give it up" you can explain it twelve more times and it doesn't make an ounce of sense. In one scene they are in a room where supposedly the demons cant enter because of the writings on the wall. We never know what these writings mean or let what they even say.Since I haven't seen the original film, I can't judge it in any way, shape, or form. I'm not even positive if both movies share the same plot. This version revolves around the sexy Angela Feld who is holding a party at the Broussard mansion, which is reportedly haunted by demons and other mythical beings. The party is filled with sex crazed, hormonal kids who just want a piece of the sex pie when suddenly the police come an invade the party, scolding the teens, and forcing them to vacate the area.A group of teens neglect to leave and then realize that now the gates won't opened and they are subjected to seclusion inside the creepy mansion. Though after an encounter with corpses in the basement, Angela and many others turn into blood thirsty demons that now feed on the lives of the innocent teenagers. As Roger Ebert would say, "a dead teenager movie".While this remake is probably not as recognized as the 2009 reboot of Friday the 13th, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. The original NOTD was popular during the 80's, but it is definitely overshadowed by slasher classics like Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street. This remake does have something going for it though; insanely catchy metal soundtrack, some cute teenage girls, no CGI, no Michael Bay, and Eddie Furlong.If Eddie Furlong wasn't in this film it wouldn't have been wouldn't have been half as good as it was. Reminds me of how Giuseppe Andrews made Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever and if he was absent the film would have been less than what it already is. Sly and sexy Shannon Elizabeth of American Pie and Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back too plays a good role in this film. It is quite fun to see her strut her stuff on set, even when she is a blood thirsty demon.In no means does Night of the Demons qualify as a passable remake. I highly doubt the original film is like this. For what it is, it's definitely a remake in 2009 and nothing less. This is something Ill watch once and never touch again. This is the kind of film that sits on the shelf for weeks until the stock boy picks it up and says "Who would leave this out?" and throw it in the back where it would sit for years to come. That's a bit harsh, but Gierasch does little to impress with this mediocre remake of another 80's film. But Monica Keena gets my sympathy; first she is caught in the dueling duo of Freddy and Jason, now she's victim to demons? Someone take this girl FAR away from teen parties.Starring: Shannon Elizabeth, Monica Keena, Bobbi Sue Luther, John F. Beach, Edward Furlong, Michael Copon, Diora Baird, and Linnea Quigley. Directed by: Adam Gierasch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie in the spirit of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angela to raise some funds organizes a huge party. Attending the party are 3 female friends of hers, a guy who's interested in one of the girls and his buddy, and a drug dealer who used to be the ex of one of the girls. The cops eventually arrive and shut down the party. When our group of kids try to leave, they find the gate locked. In looking for alternate exit they go the basement, where they find a bunch of skeletons. One bites Angela's finger.Now Angela turns into a demon who's after her friends. During spin the bottle she makes out with one of the guys who becomes a demon as well. He ends up having sex with one of the girls and that turns her into a demon. Angela literally chews of the face of another girl who now is a demon. That leaves 2 guys and a girl who have to deal with the 4 demons. One of the guys is played by an unrecognizable Edward Furlong. The girl is played by Monica Keena, who still doesn't show any skin but at least makes out with another girl. Keena should seriously consider suing her cosmetic butcher, who has ruined her face.The kids find shelter in a room that has protective writing scribbled on the walls. The house has some dark demonic history. 7 demons are needed but they only have before sunrise to achieve their goals. It's only a couple of hours more but Angela and her minions have some tricks up their sleeve as well.Night of the Demons is just what you expect and want from a remake of the classic 80s movie. It's sexy, funny, entertaining, gory, fun. Although more nudity wouldn't have hurt. It's good to see the lovely Shannon Elizabeth. The other girls are also attractive and very voluptuous. I'm glad to say that Gierasch has improved his direction over the years and in this movie he does an excellent job. His writing together with Jace Anderson is great, the dialog is natural for kids and the script overall is smart and fun. The special effects though aren't very convincing. Perhaps it's the lighting but there's no doubt that a mask is a mask. Still, a worthy and honorable remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It's a remake of a "classic" movie from '88. I saw this one first and everything for me worked. Cheesy horror premise; check. Half naked babes; check. Demons a plenty; check check. And now that I have watched the original I think this version is far superior in both acting and script. Not gonna spoil anything major but the premise is the same, teenagers in a haunted house getting possessed by sneaky demons is the main thing . This movie is far superior both in dialog and the script departments. The 2009 version has some twists and spooky moments, the old one just had soap opera wannabe dialog and the whole story followed in that line. I think that the two versions are really different all and all and you should check both of them out. I'm also a sucker for Shannon Elizabeth so it's an 8 from me. I think I have seen the majority of both a and b horror stuff from 2009 and I really thought this was a good one and in no way is this worth a 4. It really improves on the original in every way.</fullReview>

Wrong. (Extra spaces for emphasis) If you have seen the original and like it at all, please do not even attempt to watch this travesty. Nothing even remotely like the original Night of the Demons, the film just seems clumsy and uninspired. I actually watched Dead Silence after this and was more entertained.

		<fullReview>Night of the Demons (2009) * 1/2 (out of 4) Remake of the 1987 cult classic has a group of people throwing a party in a mysterious house where decades earlier a Halloween party was thrown and six people disappeared. Flash forward to the present day and the party takes a turn for the worse when one person gets transformed into a demon and starts killing the others. A lot of people are going to hate this movie because they're fans of the original. A lot of people are going to hate this film because it's a remake. And even more people are going to hate this movie because it's unoriginal and not very inspired and it's this group that I fall into. I wasn't overly crazy about the original film but this remake is a complete mess from the word go and by the fifteen-minute mark the thing is out of gas and it was rather painful to make it through to the end. The biggest problem is that the screenplay really doesn't offer us anything fresh, original or worth watching. The characters are all poorly written and I think they're all rather unlikeable. It doesn't help that the performances aren't that good but this is a horror movie so that shouldn't matter too much. I'm not sure what it is but it seems a lot of current horror movies are forgetting to include characters that you either like or care about. Instead we have to watch people we don't care for get killed. It's just boring when there's nothing extra to connect you with the characters. Another major problem is that there isn't a drop of atmosphere and there are certainly no scares. The film is certainly lazy because it's yet another that tries to scare you by cranking the soundtrack up high and having loud noises go off to make you jump. Hopefully future films will get over this cheap trick because it doesn't work and it's simply lazy and boring. Edward Furlong of TERMINATOR 2 fame gets to play the lead here but he doesn't seem very into it. The violence in the film is rather graphic but the CGI effects are rather cheap and silly looking. NIGHT OF THE DEMONS was meant for a theatrical release but it ended up only playing a few dates before its eventually DVD release. The film isn't the worst ever made but the laziness and lack of imagination really seals its fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just about the same kind of drivel you get as an insomniac with the horror channel. At least those movies are often at least hilarious, this is just confusing. The only feeling this film will evoke is a vague sense of embarrassment for Edward Furlong, even he doesn't deserve to be associated with this.The original is just a rehash of Evil Dead only with 200% more 80's, but was good fun. This remake falls short. The characters range from cardboard to annoying cardboard but this seems to be mostly to do with the poor script and direction, there are hints that these people are actually actors and not random people they found on the street.If you haven't seen it, watch the original.

		<fullReview>You know, it's really weird how much Hollywood is running out of ideas, nothing clever or original is being made. It seems that we are on a trend on re-making the great slasher flicks of the 80's. Night of the Demons is a fun cult classic, I remember back when I saw the VHS copy of it in Blockbuster, the cover was so scary I just had to see it. It was a genuinely scary movie. It was kind of in the spirit of The Evil Dead and Friday the 13th with it's gore, sex and humor. It was a lot of fun and turned into a great cult classic followed by two sequels. So instead of continuing the franchise Hollywood called for a re-make for some reason. In my opinion, I don't mind some re-makes, I can understand the reasoning for them. Newer generations may not have heard of the title and it's a different way of getting into the story, in some cases a re-make can succeed the predecessor. I don't think that Night of the Demons needed a re-make, however I think I was a little more than welcoming to the idea and pretty much ended up with a sloppy movie.Maddi is preparing to go to a party held by Angela. Along with her friends, Lily and Suzanne, Maddie arrives at the party. She realizes her ex-boyfriend, Colin is there, dealing drugs; Lily's ex-boyfriend Dex and his friend Jason. As the party progresses, Angela prompts everyone to go wild, as she must make money off the party or she will have to live on the streets. Soon after, the police break up the party, stating Angela neglected to get a party permit. After a while, the group returns. They enter a room and find six skeletons. Joined by the rest of the group, Angela assumes that the skeletons are the remains of the missing party guests of Evangeline Broussard who threw the party from hell 100 years previously. Angela enters a bathroom where she turns into a demon. She returns to the group and has plans to make this a party they'll never forget.Is the movie bad? It's not too bad, there are a couple of good moments, the make up effects are still pretty scary. Though I preferred Angela's old make up to this new one, it seemed a little off to me with being too white and predictable. However the skeleton face was pretty gruesome and fun. The actors actually seemed to really enjoy themselves and had a good time making the film. Even Eddie Furlong made a decent comeback with this movie, though he does look like he's had a little bit too much fun in his days. There are also some decent scares, though I didn't feel the same suspense as I did with the original, this had some good jumps, especially when the demons try breaking into the one room they are not allowed in. However, would I recommend the movie to anyone? I don't know, it's hard to say, if you are a fan of the franchise, I would say to go for it. There are some good moments here and there, but they did definitely put in a good effort, I give them credit for that. But was it needed or a good addition? Nah, not really. But Shannon Elizabeth did make for a great Angela and makes her scenes sizzling with sexuality and horror. I think I will be fair with the rating, like I said, just depending on if you're curious, I'd say it's worth checking out, but don't expect anything too great.5/10</fullReview>

Edward Furlong has some fun with it; I'll give him credit for that. I'm just not a fan of his, aside from a couple pieces of his work. Shannon Elizabeth is one hot Angela, and gives a great impression, definitely one of the highlights of the movie for me. Linnea Quigley has a cool cameo. Monica Keena is OK but again, not a fan of hers Bottom line. Not horrible but certainly mediocre in all aspects. They should have left well enough alone. The ending was a nice touch, but that's not enough to get this across the Mendoza Line. Give it a pass, unless you are left with nothing else to watch.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put it in simple terms; I really liked this film. For once, the casting was spot on, and the filmmakers did NOT try to re-invent the original film. I could talk about how much I loved the main cast here, but that would seem like glad-handing. Too Late. Monica Keena is a genre favorite and makes a believable heroine. Eddie Furlong was great in his role seeming like he didn't want to be there, but joining in when the action called for it. Bobbi Sue Luther and Diora Baird were good eye candy along with Shannon Elizabeth (&amp; its always interesting to watch her go wild here). Beach and Copon were good too, despite not having much to do in the way of plot. The plot seemed coherent, and if I didn't here the cast talk about it on the commentary I wouldn't have noticed the few goofs. Excellent make up work here as well. I appreciated that the ending hearkens back to the Final Girl formula. In short, All is well with Night of the Demons (2009). Happy Halloween, Mother******s.</fullReview>

Everything here is without one bit of originality or organic substance of any sort. OK there is ONE scene that is noteworthy but not that it amounts to much.The makeup of the Demons, the neo-whore outfits, the buckets of blood, the music, and of course the plot, have all been done before. Not only done before, but done to death. Nothing is terrifying or suspenseful, horrific or humorous, and it seems to be more interested in showing soft-core porn outfits and soft-core sexual behavior, rather than trying to create any kind of absorbing atmosphere."Demons...not too smart"...she says.........Movie...not too smart!

Demons, what can you do? What could have been a camp 'house on haunted hill' type movie, is spoilt by the awfulness of it all.Hands jump out of the mirrors, the demons are too sex driven an the cast look bored as anything. Add a sub plot involving Furlong and a drug dealer is silly and uncalled for.Having never seen the original movie, I cannot comment on how worse or better this movie is, but i feel it's the former.Only Elizabeth puts any real effort into her role, and she is looking a little too old to be in these sort of movies.The rest of the cast are horror fodder, and are picked off one by one in ever predictable ways.I don't know whether the film is trying to be funny, or is that bad it's laughable, but at some point you cannot decide whether it's going all out horror or tongue in cheek.And a little plot twist, pulled off by the demons, just goes to show that the group are stupid, when on earth does it light at six in the morning on the 1st of November? Plot holes like this make the film more unbearable and the final scene is silly, the girl walking off smiling despite just losing all of her friends.And she even locks in the removal men.A horrible movie.</fullReview>

Flash an occasional booby, deliver a few uninspired gore effects and by-the-books make-up, slather the whole thing with generic rock music, and ship it off straight to video after anyone and everyone with good sense refuses to distribute the sad mess to theaters.

		<fullReview>The 2009 remake of the 1988 cult classic "Night of the Demons" is definitely a must see. It stars an older, not very well aged, Edward Furlong. While his acting hasn't improved much since the Terminator 2 days, he only adds to the awesomeness of this movie. It also stars American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth as the hedonistic hostess, Angela, 2 other overly boobieful chicks, a fairly level headed and sensible girl (she is by far the most doable) and 2 overly horny guys (one named Jason whom ironically reminds me of Jason Lee). With that combination of sluttery and demons, how can you go wrong? It's one of those movies that makes you laugh and can't help but add your own funny running commentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well...what exactly did you expect from a remake of an 80s horror flick? Even when it was made, the original was less than fresh. Don't get me wrong, the original (and it's sequels) were some of my favorite movies to rent as a kid. But let's not pretend the original movie was some mind-blowing feat of originality. So since everyone is apparently out of ideas for stuff and remakes/reboots are all the rage, why not remake a movie that, while loved by many, wasn't exactly setting box offices on fire? This isn't exactly a true remake, nor is it a reboot. It falls somewhere in between. It doesn't exactly follow the original story...it varies on some key elements. The parts that got changed don't really effect the overall story, though. The film does take a bit long to get going for my tastes. It tries to focus a bit too much on being sexy in the first half rather than being a horror movie. But once it gets going, it's fun and the practical effects are actually quite well done. The CGI effects, while sparse, are actually pretty bad. Then the casting. I'm not sure who thought it'd be a good idea to use Edward "remember, I was John Connor. No, seriously" Furlong, but I would question their motives. He's fine in his role, but he just seems like he's there for the paycheck. And Shannon Elizabeth as Angela? Again, she does fine with the role, but I don't see her potential as a villain in a horror flick. She's always going to be that hot girl who got naked in American Pie. But whatever...it is what it is. All in all it's a fun popcorn movie. If you're a die-hard fan of the original you'll probably find a lot to nitpick over. Otherwise, just open a six pack and enjoy it for what it is...a fun, fairly gory horror movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a remake I actually enjoyed more than the original. Granted though, that's not saying much since the original was nothing special.This film doesn't take itself too seriously. The humor comes not necessarily from the dialogue (although there are a few funny lines) but from the absurdity of the situation. The demons don't really follow any rules, they seem to be intent only on forcing the survivors into one laughably bizarre predicament to the next. But that's not saying it feels fake. The actors do a good job of keeping the dialogue light but still conveying the sense that they really are in mortal danger.The effects and costumes are well done. There's a few scenes of sudden gore and brutality that caught even me off guard, and I consider myself a horror veteran. MAJOR kudos to the director for not using a hint of CGI, the gore is all "real" here.The only scene that I really remember from the original is the infamous "lipstick" scene. And apparently I'm not the only one that it made an impression on, because the director has recreated that scene here and even taken it one step further....that's all I can say. The line of dialogue after that scene had me busting out laughing.In summary, don't expect a deep plot and don't take it too seriously. Come for the non-CG gore effects, gratuitous nudity, and a good laugh or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Halloween party in a notorious mansion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a not so stellar remake of Kevin S. Tenney's influential 1988 original. Everyone in New Orleans knows better than to step foot on the grounds of the old Broussard Mansion that is associated with a dark and demonic past. Angela Field(Shannon Elizabeth)decides to have the grandest Halloween bash in memory by gathering friends and anyone with the price of admission to the Broussard Mansion. No one throws a party like Angela, so any fear takes a back seat to thoughts of a drunken, drugged, lascivious wild night. The party is packed, the music blasting, the bodies bumping and grinding...then the police show up spoiling the party. The night gets darker and the mansion is believed to be cleared out and locked down; but Angela and six of her friends not ready to call it a night come out of hiding and realize they are locked inside. The Broussard Mansion soon takes on a demonic atmosphere and the trapped teens are forced to protect their very lives and souls from the ancient demons that live inside the dark. Some gruesome scenes of satanic slaughter. Others in the cast: Monica Keena, Tiffany Shepis, Michael Copon, John F. Beach, Bobbi Sue Luther and Edward Furlong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary like the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Night of the Demons was one of my favorite movies growing up. I remember walking through Blockbuster (remember those?) and seeing the VHS box with the demon and the lollipop on the cover. Scared the crap out of me. That is why I was pumped going into this one. Edward Furlong and Monica Keena were actually pretty good. Doing everything they could to keep this stink fest afloat... but god no not Bobbie sue what's her name again!! See my review of Laid to Rest but to put her acting into two words..she sucks dick. Sorry that was three words But hey at least you get to see her tits, albeit briefly, something that lacked in Laid. Shannon Elizabeth also stinks and her acting was only viewable in American Pie where she had one of the greatest nude scenes of all time. But now what. She's too good to get naked? What the fu*k. all cheesy horror movies need 3 things other than the cheese. Good kill scenes, suspenseful moments, and NUDITY. This movie had one of three. a 1 second tit shot (prolly a body double but I didn't want to look online to verify. I'm holding the fantasy they were Bobbie Joe Sucks-a-lot-of-dicks-at-acting's). But i gave it a 4 for nostalgic reasons only. Take my advice. Watch the original demon movies they are sweet and the demons are much scarier than in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never was really into the hype of the original Night Of The Demons but once it came clear that a remake was going to be made I immediately thought, well what could they do better. Adam Gierasch, the director is one who knows his way in the horror genre but here it failed for me. It's so weird, all ingredients are in it, nudity, sexy, gore, one heroin but still, it just didn't worked out the way I wanted it. Guess what, technology let us down again, too much CGI. Some demons appear just out of CGI and not of the usual old school effects. Sadly, the actors were never believable for me too. It's sad to see that Monica Keena was great in Freddy vs Jason but here she could not deliver it. Funny thing was that I more looked at her teeth and was thinking, they are new or what. Says enough I guess. Okay, they have put the famous lipstick scene in it but still, it was too late. Too much CGI and bad make up for the demons, They just looked like some kiddie demon flick. And I said nudity, it's maybe for 1 minute so the creeps out there doesn't have to watch it for that neither. Another remake that fails...does Hollywood get it know to stop doing remakes, I guess not, they are out to remake Hellraiser (without Bradley as Pinhead) and The Thing and even A American Werewolf In London, sigh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All you people trashing this movie need to stop. This movie was awesome. While its not exactly my favorite film, i enjoyed it quite bit. True, there could have been a bit more gore, and i don't know,exactly what the worms ere about, i still found it to at least make sense when they were talking about the demons and,the origins. I was alittle bummed about Furlongs character as ihad just started to like him. I was also bummed about the other guy that made it to the safe room as he was kind of cool. I also like the fact that there seemed to be throwbacks to the first two originals (i haven't seen the third yet), i thought that was pretty cool. As for the acting, I'm glad it wasn't Oscar stuff as it would've ruined Tue spirit of it. The only thing i have to say criticism wise is there could've been a bit e gore.. I personally would love to see a follow up. Id love to see more of Shannon Elizabeth as Angela. I think every home in America should own this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal remake effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a canceled Halloween party in a supposedly haunted mansion, a group of stranded revelers find a race of deadly demons have possessed their friends and looking doing the same to them, forcing them to fight off the beings in order to get away alive.This is an absolutely fun and enjoyable entry, so there's a ton of things going for it and barely any flaws. Taking place in a creepy Gothic mansion, the atmosphere here is incredible and makes great use of secret passageways, hidden markings along the rooms, and the decorations for a Halloween party strung up all over the house all make for some fantastic scenery, which is a lot of fun and really gives the film a lot of tension during the chase scenes. The chases themselves are a big reason why this works, as the continuous series of confrontations by the deformed, grotesque beings in a creepy location makes for a great time, and with the overflowing gore also makes for a great time in addition to all the nudity and sexiness featured throughout are certainly worthy additions. While it spills enough about the particular demons in here, a flaw that it comes so late into the proceedings might be something for some to take, but it's not too serious of a flaw that the other good stuff overcomes it.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and sexual content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angela (Shannon Elizabeth) is throwing an party at the old abandoned mansion, where it was rumour there was Evil in the house. Maddie (Monica Kenna), her friends Lily (Doria Baird) and Suzanne (Bobbie Sue Luther) are going to that mansion for a big Halloween party. The girls meets their old friends (John F. Beach and Michael Copon) and as well Maddie's ex drug-dealing boyfriend (Edward Furlong). The party seems to be going well... until it was stopped by the police. When Maddie and her friends wants to leave, they find the mansion gates mysterious locked. They are stuck there for the night until the next morning. The group discovers a nest of skeletons and unknowingly the gang has awaking the demonic evil spirits. Now it is going to be one of hell of a night to stay alive instead of the great party, they thought it was going to be.Directed by Adam Gierasch made an amusing, trashy, horror movie with an sense of humour. This movie has an game cast, good special effects Make-Up designs and it is hard to hate an feature like this. This is a remake of the infamous 1988 picture of the same name. Which the original movie has an cult following and it was followed by two sequels. It is nice to see Furlong work but his character looks tired at times. Elizabeth seems to be having an great time and it is nice to see Keena playing the hero for once.DVD has an sharp if grainy anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an brief Comic Con introduction, an entertaining featurette and an very amusing commentary track by Co-Writer/Director:Gierasch, Co-Writer:Jace Anderson, and Actors:Keena, Luther and Beach. Which Gierasch and Anderson are best known for writing Horror B Movies for filmmaker Tobe Hooper like "Crocodile", "Mortuary" and "The Toolbox Murders-2004". Although i am not an fan of Gierasch and Anderson's writing work. I thought, they wrote an good script on this remake. Die-Hard fans of the original might love it or hate this remake. To keep the original 1988 movie fans happy, there is a fun cameo by Linnea Quigley. It is certainly worth watching. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent 80's horror tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Night of the Demons, when I first saw it, I thought it was terrible. It had some interesting things happening in it, but for the most part, it was a lot of babbling about nothing, a lot of teens being stupid and what not.....in keeping with the original, the remake is actually really good at that.The teens all wind up at the mansion for a party that angela has thrown, and in a reversal from the original, she's not some crazy goth chick that nobody likes, instead, she's actually got the mansion completely full of people and throwing a hell of a party.Now....had they kept the mansion full of people to allow for a hell of a lot more killings, there would at least be entertainment value there. Instead, the police show up, bust the party, and through very stupid reasons, the main people all end up back inside, and the gate somehow locks them in.This movie is infamous, much like old 80's horror films, for the constantly changing outside of the house. The gate itself is different when you see it every time, the outside of the house is made out to be insanely huge, yet shots showing the whole exterior, you know it's not that big. Ironically, the inside, for the most part, stays the same (keep an eye out later in the movie though, when they leave a room covered in spells on the wall....very bad continuity shot at one point) The demon effects are meh. The only actually good looking one was Suzanne imo. The rest were pretty generic, and even Angela wasn't anything special, which was very disappointing. Almost NO demon talk whatsoever, and very little actual gore. They did the lipstick scene though, which was nice to see, and unfortunately, was about the only neat scene in the whole movie. You see very little of Angela.This one does try to give reasoning and a story behind everything happening, and why the demons are there....when it does come out, of course, it feels like cliché crap, although Furlong has some very good lines about stuff like that.Overall, it was made much like the movies of the 80's were, just more polished and neat looking, but still shitty. Quite a big budget for straight to DVD though, and it's worth a rental at least.</fullReview>

I can't make that comparison, but I can warn people, "DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE!" Night of the Demons 2009 is a total waste of time from browsing the shelves, to grabbing something in a hurry to get home, to fast-forwarding through the movie after viewing less than five minutes.Night of the Demons 2009 attempts to be scary and funny, but fails on both counts. From my fast-forward view, the movie seems to be nothing but blood and boobs.There are many good scary funny movies that people could watch; one recommendation is Dark Harvest from 2004.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what can happen when a remake of a really fun B movie falls into the hands of mediocre film-makers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NIGHT OF THE DEMONS 09' is a very poor, very loose remake of the 1988 scarefest. The problem with the film is that it boasts almost no characterization (or fun characters), scares, comedy, suspense, tension or atmosphere or excellent monster make-up, all the things that helped the original film along in becoming a huge success amongst horror fans. I should have knew something would go wrong with the remake, when I learnt ADAM GIERASCH &amp; his writing partner JACE ANDERSON were going to be writing &amp; directing the movie, pretty much any film they have ever been involved with borders on mediocre to bad &amp; I can't understand why with their poor track record of films, they keep getting jobs in the genre, since it's clear they have no talent in the genre. The duo ditch the creepy, crumbling, dust &amp; cob webbed spooky funeral parlour in the middle of nowhere setting &amp; instead set the action at a large plain old mansion located in the middle of town. Said mansion was supposed to be closed down for 50 some odd years, but despite some chipped paint on the walls, the windows are clean, the floors are clean &amp; the place clearly had a nice shiny paint job in area's &amp; there is no boards on the windows or doors either! The duo also shows a lack of knowledge on how to set up shock sequences, since many moments that could have rivalled the first, are shot down by poor set ups &amp; executions, mainly when Monica Keena's character is grabbed by a demonic entity through a bathroom mirror early in the film, the sequence comes off as lame &amp; none of the characters show any kind of fear when facing the demons, despite the vicious onslaught of murders &amp; possessions on their friends. I just wasn't buying the fact they could see all of this gory carnage &amp; not be affected by it. The part of the film where the kids are safe from the demonic onslaught by being a room with spells written on the walls &amp; the reason the demons can't get in &amp; where the came from, is just laughable, even by B movie standards, The special effects are also nowhere near as good as those in the first three films.It's clear that the entire budget went to pay for the few names they got to be in this film, such as former A-lister/American Pie star SHANNON ELIZABETH is cast as Angela, sadly the film-makers have opted out Angela's goth girl like lifestyles &amp; dabbling in black arts to a popular sex pot, she does pretty good in the role though. MONICA KEENA turns up in the film as the lead heroine, clearly having surgical work done on her face, since she looks quiet different from FREDDY VS. JASON &amp; does okay, but her character annoyed me just as much as everyone else's did &amp; sadly the Alice In Wonderland costume the film-makers chose for the lead heroine to wear in the original, has been ditched. EDWARD FURLONG is looking pudgier from his TERMINATOR 2 days &amp; merely phones in his role as a drug dealer. BOBBI SUE LUTHER &amp; DIORA BIRD not only wear the same costumes almost &amp; have the same hair style, but play characters so paper thin, that at time I could hardly tell one from the other, their really here only for name value &amp; eye candy purposes &amp; expose their clearly surgically enhanced chests. Relocating the action to New Orleans also fails to add anything to the film &amp; the CGI effects look &amp; feel painfully cheap. B movie scream queen TIFFANY SHEPIS turns up in a small role, making one wonder why the film-makers opted for Elizabeth to play Angela, since Shepis is far more popular amongst the horror movie crowds &amp; would have been perfection as Angela, since she is also a die hard horror movie fan.I will give the film some props, the acting is really good, plus the film-makers pays tribute to some of horror most current horror franchises, as we see a couple of guests dressed like Billy The Puppet from SAW &amp; Victor Crowley from HATCHET. Plus I also liked the fact that the film gives us some flashback to what happened on that opening night many years ago, when a group of house guests get possessed by demons &amp; attack the other members, all done in the style of a silent film from the early twenties, which I thought was a nice touch. One of the characters is dressed like a doctor like in the first, the exit disappearing &amp; the wall surrounding the building plot point is also brought back &amp; the gore was also pretty good, including a re-interpretation of the infamous LINNEA QUIGLEY (Who also turns up in a cameo at the beginning) lipstick through the nipple scene, gone the extra mile when the possessed girl performing it, then pulls it out between her legs spewing a huge puddle of blood on the floor.In the end, there's a very good reason this never got a huge theatrical release, was shelved for two years &amp; then dumped quietly onto DVD, with very little fanfare &amp; without the studio announcing it's release. Had it not been for the talent in front of the camera &amp; the title, which would attract fans of the first &amp; at least make some profit, I honestly believe this film wouldn't have been released at all. For dedicated series fans only. Produced KEVIN S. TENNEY, who in fact he should have been the one to remake this, since it would have turned out way better than what we got.**1/2 stars</fullReview>

Night of the Demons is not as much scary as gory and on occasion outright gross (might want to not be eating during the bathroom scene, which goes one step further then the 1988 version).If you're looking for a scare, Oscar-worthy acting, or a plot that makes sense, look elsewhere, if you're looking for cheesy indulgence and a throw back to 80's B horror flicks with gratuitous violence, sex, and more violence , this movie is a dead on(no pun intended).</fullReview>

I can't really explain why, but he doesn't seem to feel comfortable when he is on screen. Which is a shame really, because he could've carried this Remake.It's a long time since I last saw the Original, which wasn't the greatest Horror movie ever, but still pretty decent (especially for the money it did cost). The Remake does have the money, does have a few good ideas (one of them being of the sexual kind) and does have a killer soundtrack (no pun intended). If that's enough for a Rock'N'Roll experience for you, then ho ahead and watch. If you need more to enjoy a movie, you will be disappointed (not that much gore, not that much story, characters not really likable etc.).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think the original on steroids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The majority of the recent Horror remakes have been done with the backing of major studios. They're no fools and know that this is a big money maker and it looks like it will be for some time. The upside to this is that some of them turned out to be good films in their own right. But there are those few that are made for TV or independently, the latter of which are more likely to be a labor of love. With most of the classics having been redone, filmmakers have now turned to more underground cult Horror films and it was only a matter of time before Kevin S. Tenney's 1988 flick about demons in a house on Halloween was updated. The good news is, it's one of the best of the recent remakes.Pros: Director/co-writer Adam Gierasch puts on an impressive show here, with some stylish touches and tons of energy. The cast is game and really get into their roles. A pretty good score and fun punk rock soundtrack. Made with tongue planted firmly in cheek. Excellent make-up and visual effects. Well-paced. A few neat ideas. Some great gore gags.Cons: Like the original it takes quite a while to get to the pandemonium. Not that the characters in the original had much more dimension, but most of the ones here are way underdeveloped and so how can we get attached? The very end is a bit of a head scratcher.Final thoughts: The wait for this film to be released was a long one and when that happens you hope it'll be worth it. Personally, I think it was and was very impressed by this update of the cult classic. Has much more to offer than a lot of remakes, which are little more than exercises in greed. The people behind this set out to make a fun popcorn Horror flick perfect for watching at Halloween time and succeeded. Here's to hoping there's at least one sequel.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Fresh take in an era repleted w overdone zombie &amp; vampire flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A saucy bloody beginning to one, if not, the best horror film festival in north America, this years screamfest opens by bringing back some classic horror themes and putting them at the forefront. A contemporary take on the 1988 classic, this latest version albeit a remake, is a breath of fresh air from the all so common vampire and zombie pictures we've been forced to endure as of lately. There is nothing new in the concept but the execution is affirmatively clever in many ways. The usual party kids join forces at an old rented house where demons tend to dwell, trick and cause chaos to its rather clueless guests. Once connected to the reality of why they are really there, all hell breaks loose...no pun intended. Actress Shannon Elizabeth struts her stuff for all she's worth for a performance that should satisfy her followers and gain her a new crop of younger teenage male fans. A fresh addition to the cast is John F. Beach who's effectively charming performance forces the viewer to keep a watchful eye on him until his time is up. Maddie, played practically and intelligently by Monica Keenna's from Freddy vs Jason's saves the day with many unexpected turns towards the climactic finale. All in all, this is a pop corn movie for generation "X" ers who'd like to reminisce of horror from the good old days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake That Blows the Original Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Halloween night, 85 years after a terrible tragedy, a party is hosted in the allegedly haunted Broussard Mansion. The party is busted, but a few friends remain, discovering bodies in the basement. Things only get worse from there.The film really knows how to catch your attention, as it starts with an intense, creepy, sepia flashback with silent movie titles. The ADHD style would be annoying had it continued throughout the film, but made a fine way to suck in the audience.There is a rocking soundtrack featuring Type O Negative, and sexy women galore (both the lead actresses and a notable strip club scene). There's a demonic sex scene that is brief but memorable. Let's just say demons like it rough.Writer-director Adam Gierasch made sure not to step on the original, working more in the spirit than doing a direct remake. As he explained to me, the original wasn't as good as people recall, and if they prefer it, they are still able to rent it. (And actually, doing a remake probably brought more attention to the original than it's seen in years.) The film is great by remake standards, probably outdoing the first, in my opinion, while still making references to the original (like the lipstick scene).The film is packed with genre and cult favorites: Tiffany Shepis, Edward Furlong ("Brainscan"), Linnea Quigley (who appeared in the original) and more. Modern horror fans should eat this right up.I felt that this movie was filmed very much in the style of Adam Green's "Hatchet", which I mean in the nicest way possible. Coincidentally, both take place in New Orleans. Green is considered by some to be the current big name in horror, but I think Gierasch could be giving hi ma run for his money... I cannot wait to see his next project.</fullReview>
