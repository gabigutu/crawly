		<shortDescription>Great mindless 80s Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 80s were overrun by all those HALLOWEEN/Friday THE 13TH slasher-style horror movies, so this is something of a relief.Ten unbelievably annoying teenagers (would you want to hang out with these jerks?!) decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral parlor called "Hull House". During a "past life séance" a demon is accidentally released, and each person becomes possessed and kills off the others.This all sounds very EVIL DEAD/DEMONS-ish, but Tenney lends some directorial style to the proceedings, there are some good one-liners, the music is excellent, the Steve Johnson prosthetic make-up FX are scary and Linnea Quigley is quite fun as a boy-crazy bimbo who pokes out eyeballs with her fingers and does an amazing new thing with a tube of lipstick!Great fun on a no-brainer level! After checking out the breakdown of the voting and the other posted reviews, I don't understand how this only received 4 out of 10 (?!)I give it, 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic 80's horror picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Demons is by far one of my favorite horror films to date. You really cannot go wrong with this picture. It's directed by the master Kevin (Witchboard) Tenney and based on a Joe Augustyn script.The film is based on a rowdy group of high school teens who decide to throw a party in an old abandoned funeral parlor. Both Angela (Amelia Kinkade) and and Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) are the ones responsible for throwing this party together. They invite a small group of personal friends together and host this party on none other than Halloween Night. The party starts off as a real smash. However, throughout the course of the night, Angela and Suzanne transform into demonic characters and infect the rest of the guests.There are some real classics deaths in this one. Jill (Sleepaway Camp III) Terashita and her beau Philip Tanzini meet their untimely death, while they are "working it out," in a casket of all places. Stooge, who happens to be one of the highlights of the party, crushes them both in the coffin. This death here, is one of my all time favorites. Also, check out the lipstick scene with Linnea Quigley. This movie has it all, the house, the booze, naked chicks, violence and demons. If you are into real bad movies, like myself, then go ahead and check out this masterpiece.I am also pleased to report that Anchor Bay has received the rights to be able to release this fine movie finally on a DVD release. Boy, I cannot wait. The street date is slated for an August 24th 2004 release date.If you haven't seen nor hear of this movie then I advise you to go ahead and check it out. If you have seen this then hopefully you'll pick it up on DVD once its released. 10/10 for a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good low-budget can be. Sure, much of it is fairly predictable, but somehow it's still much more enjoyable than the crap we see these days being passed off as "Horror". I give the gore a solid 9, and the Demons' one-liners are actually funny. I'm still creeped out by "Stop looking at me!" The soundtrack is well done, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from Bauhaus! There is also some very nice T&amp;A on display, as well as some hella good make-up effects. The second film in the series is pretty good too, but avoid the inferior third one. Night of the Demons may be dated, dark, and low-rent, but it still has a lot of potential. It's definitely worth a rental at least. Give it a chance tonight, just stay away from any old makeup! (you'll understand when you see it!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great horror film for people who don't want all that vomit-retching gore and sensationalism. This movie has equal amounts of horror, suspense, humor, and even a little light nudity, but nothing big. Linnea Quigley isn't over the top as she was in "Return of the Living Dead" where she danced naked on a crypt, but she is still essentially the same slutty character. Cathy Podewell is a virginal and chaste character before going on to "Dallas," and we are also introduced to Amelia [soon Mimi] Kinkade,the sexy and sinister would-be dark matron of the house. As she and Linnea are possessed and take over the house, they reanimate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the limits out of the survivors. I've heard a lot of people compare this movie to "The Evil Dead," but if anything, this movie is a rival to that one the same way Freddie rivaled Jason.This movie series though is far superior to that one !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun with plenty of great points about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Demons" is an enjoyable and entertaining example of the 80s cheese-fest.**SPOILERS**Getting dressed for a party, friends Judy Cassidy, (Cathy Podewell) Helen, (Allison Barron) Rodger, (Alvin Alexis) Jay Jansen, (Lance Fenton) Max, (Phillip Tanzini) Frannie, (Jill Terashita) and Stooge, (Hal Havins) decide to throw a party held by Angela Franklin, (Amelia Kinkade) and her friend Suzanne, (Linnea Quigley) at a local abandoned cemetery house. Starting up a giant dance party, they learn that the house they've chosen was known as Hull House which was the site of a brutal massacre years ago and is rumored to be haunted by the spirits of those who died there. Conducting a séance during the proceedings, they end up unwittingly releasing a horde of demons that were trapped in the building and they end up possessing the group and kill them off one-by-one, forcing the remaining ones to try to find a way to survive the onslaught of the creatures and get out alive.The Good News: This was a really impressive and entertaining film when it tried. One of the main ones is that the film is really creepy and has a great air of suspense. The building where everything is done is just highly creepy, with the completely dust-covered furniture, long hallways and darkened rooms, as well as the decorations added to the place for the party, with the giant candles, Halloween set-ups and much more added to the place to make it even more creepy. They're all added together in a fantastic ability to creep out because of the location. Then, when the floating heads, demon-eyed POV shots and demonic voices from beyond are thrown in, it's just even creepier. The gore in here works nicely, not being too graphic but good enough to satisfy with a tongue ripped out, eyes squished, an arm lopped off from closing a coffin-lid on it, an impaling in the back with a wooden stake, a crushed head and several being set on fire to add to the fun. That these, along with the film's ability to throw in a lot of 80s-era fashions, ideas and action give it a really healthy cheese factor as well and are a great part to help it become all the more watchable during it's early moments. The pace is great, since the film is really simple and straightforward with it's plot, which is always a good thing. There's also a couple of really great scenes that show the film's creativity. There is a very interesting shot as the group discusses things. We see the pieces of the broken mirror scattered on the floor. The gang stands over them and each person can be seen in a different shard of glass. Another big scene occurs when one of them is sitting down and takes their lipstick and slowly runs it down between her breasts, starting at her neck and then looping around her left boob. As they makes a slow circular pattern, drawing ever closer to the areola and the nipple, the camera slowly zooms in, and with the tip of her lipstick touching her nipple, she pushes it straight into her breast and it disappears without a single drop of blood. When she pulls her hand away, we see that her breast still looks normal, and it's perfectly done in a seamless shot which makes it all the better. As well, the last good part here is that there's plenty of nudity on display here, from one of them fully shows off her behind, another fully shows off her boobs and a third shows off everything for the camera on the front, which here is all done in great manner and is really appreciated. All of these are a grand part of making this one really enjoyable.The Bad News: There wasn't a whole lot to this one that didn't work. The fact that there's a ways to go in here before anything really exciting happens is one of the biggest things working against it, since it does have a tendency to really wander a lot with what's going on during the early part of the film. Because it has to include the failed party and move on from there to the resurrection of the spirits and then them going crazy, it takes a while but it's good from then on. The slow pace at the beginning is helped out with the suspenseful location and the frequent nudity, but as far as action goes it's a really long time for it to get anything going. The other part wrong here is the cheese-factor, which might be a little much for some who aren't accustomed to these kinds of films or simply don't care for that quality. It's pretty loaded and can turn some off who aren't big on it, but these are all that's really wrong with it.The Final Verdict: A really enjoyable, if somewhat slow-burning example of prime-80s cheese, this one here is a decent enough watch overall. Give it a shot if you're into the genre or the style or are in the mood for something harmless and fun, while those who aren't that high up on the style won't be much impressed with it.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity and a mild sex scene</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old school 80's classick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After much pondering, I finally popped this flick in recently and I have to say, I was surprised at how good it was. "Night of the Demons" is a classic 80's fright flick, complete with good scares, decent gore, and freaky chicks dancing to bad music.A group of punks go to an old, run down house to party it up and they soon find out that the place is haunted by an evil presence. One by one they are possessed and turn to the dark side, mauling and killing each other off. It's pretty rad.The special effects are good in this one. When the punks turn into demons, they are pretty damn hideous.Recommended for the 80's horror fan.7 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action Horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film in the theater and liking it. I happened to stumble upon it on fear net last month and watched it again and found it better with age. First of all for those of you who describe this as 80s cheese if you objectively compare it with the horror flicks of the past 2 decades it compares quite well if stacked up against films in its unique horror sub genre which I would term action/horror as opposed to psychological horror such as "The Shining" or "the exorcist".Furthermore for its budget this film really delivers the goods (or in this instance bad). The film actually has some character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door. The film also has several hilarious one liners and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horror flick should have. If you compare NOD to contemporary big budget horror films such as "I am legend" (The Vincent Price version was much better) this film really stands out. Modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no plot or character devel at all and are completely predictable. The special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic. If this is 80s horror cheese I'll take it over 95% of current entries in the genre.On a closing note seeing NOD again made me remember the beautiful Jill Terashita and wonder why I have not seen her in more films horror or otherwise. Jill on the odd chance that you read this- I think you are gorgeous and should have been in more films. Lastly, if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally saw this movie in a movie theater on Times Square in the late eighties. Who would have thought this film would spawn two sequels and have this cult following.Night of the Demons was like most other films that came out at the time.A group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated local and then are killed off one at a time in various gruesome ways.Come to think of it the formula still is used and still seems to work as evidenced by Saw II that I recently saw.I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention about six years ago and she was so gentle hearted!I guess that makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed woman in all these horror flicks.Anyway, I just this film again on VHS cassette and this movie still holds up.A little slow at the beginning as I remembered when I first saw it but then it quickly picks up pace. One of the eighties horror classics and worth a look!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly fun AUTHENTICALLY SCARY horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie took me by surprise. The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. After that, we're plunged into a semi-cheesy production, betraying its low budget. The characters, typical American teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this. By the time the shlitz hits the fan, we know each one of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. It's a slow uphill set-up, kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. Thankfully, once the action kicks in, it's full blown old school HORROR! Steve Johnson's make-up effects are awesome. Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. And the scares are jolting. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heart-stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set-ups. The tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor marks this film as pure 80s horror, as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like "Night of the Living Dead" or "Hills Have Eyes." But for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of "House on the Haunted Hill." The set-up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be terrible...but...its not...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very low budget, low quality special effects, terrible acting, and not very probable...these all should spell "Bad Movie". But, for Night of the Demons, I'll make an exception. This movie isn't "so bad its good". I hate that philosophy, and I will never use that for a movie. If its "so bad" then it really is "so bad", not "good". This movie was NOT strong on storyline. The storyline does not make much sense at all, I mean, its consistent for the most part, but very improbable. The acting was the worst quality of the movie. The acting was horrid. Most of the actors were probably poor college kids looking for extra money. But, the scares were GREAT! The characters were better acting when possessed than as normal people. I liked Rodger, the main character. He was realistic and different. Judy wasn't all that bad, she played a good "screamer". Angela was alright as well. I did like Sal Romero, his accent was actually funny. He was one of the 3 people (Rodger and Judy) to actually have a brain. The old man was funny as hell also. Reminds me of my neighbor but 10x worse. ANother good thing was that all the actors were no-name, so you couldn't tell who was next, who would make it out and whatnot. I rate this a 6.5/10, but since 6.5 cant be chosen, I'll round it up to 7/10. Watch if your in the mood for a mindless B-horror movie.</fullReview>

Great addition to my movie collection.The buildup was great, sets up the scares for the rest of the movie. Loved the GORE and the T&amp;A. I never thought eyeballs being gouged out would look like popping boils, the color of the eye splatter was gross!

		<fullReview>Two sequels and a lame remake doesn't do anything to diminish the fun of this original film wherein a diverse group of high school seniors attend a Halloween party being thrown by 'weird' Angela at the deserted supposedly haunted Hull House. After staging an impromptu séance, demons come out to show these boys and girls how to really party.I'm surprised with how well this movies has held up. Yea there's a bit of dated 80's humor but for the most part it still works surprisingly well. Plus they just don't make Scream Queens like Linnea anymore, she's awesome in both this and 'Return of the Living Dead"Eye Candy: Cathy Podewell shows her butt; Jill Terashita goes topless; and scream queen Linnea Quigley goes full frontal</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say. This is easily one of my FAVORITE movies to watch on Halloween. The halloween party, the horrid acting, the guy dressed like and extra from Miami Vice. GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!*********************SPOILERS***************************I have a huge place in my heart for random 80's horror flicks and this one reached out and tugged at my heart strings. I always passes this flick at Blockbuster and always laughed at the cover of the box. Now every weekend I would grab a random movie I had never seen before...one weekend it was Angelas turn. She seemed to have been taunting me for months. So I took it home put it in and spent most of the movie underneath the blanket.For me, it was terrifying and gross. And not just the acting! Some of the things they came up with for this movie was AMAZING. I can honestly say the best part for me was watching Suzanne (played by a fellow iowan) stick a tube of lipstick through her nipple. It was random and I loved it. Watching creepy Angela FLOAT through the hallways and hearing her creepy demon voice was enough to have me awake ALL NIGHT LONG! It isn't one of the most clever or best acted horror movies. But its 80's cheese and its got all the elements you need. Creepy Goth Kid, Virgin, Slut, Naked Girls, Scary House, Bad Acting, oh and did I mention Naked Girls? All the elements were there and were put together in such a way that made for one of my fave movies. Kudos to the filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A randy and splatter-filled Halloween party that I still attend at least once a year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though Kevin S. Tenney's bawdy bloodbath Night Of The Demons is a much different sort of celebration than John Carpenter's eponymous ode to my favorite Pagan holiday, it has likewise become a vital part of my festive preparation every year and I still return to it with the same frequency of of my visits to Haddonfield.Night is assuredly a B-flick, but the creative production and wealth of delightfully gross gore effects elevate this outing well above its peers. There are enough great ideas here to fill out several like-minded offerings, and Tenney's demented funhouse approach serves the film incredibly well. Once the plot's demonic possession angle takes center stage, the action hums along with a series of dazzling and surreal set-pieces that announce Night's ambition to present itself as the most enjoyable supernatural slasher ever made. I'm not sure if it quite gets there, but it certainly isn't for lack of trying, and even if this joyously gruesome romp misses that mark, it isn't by much.The story is centered around a group of charmingly crass and obnoxious teens who gather for a Halloween party at the imposing and infamous Hull House, a site with a murderous past and a slew of dark legends surrounding it. When one of their party games inadvertently summons forth a demonic entity that takes possession of a member of the group, the remainder of the horny bunch begins meeting increasingly grisly ends. According to the film's logic, being killed by a creature turns the victim into one as well, so as the ribald cohort's numbers are whittled down, the unlucky survivors find themselves stalked at every turn by a growing horde of their demonized former friends.It takes a full half of the movie for Night to really get cooking, but despite the judicious pace, since this is one of the most likable collectives of unlikeable kids ever assembled in the genre, even their banal gonna-get-me-some hijinks and juvenile one-liners are genuinely entertaining. The extended introduction also allows plenty of time to immerse us into the dwelling itself, and since the film-makers chose a fantastic location for this fiesta, the intimate familiarity with Hull House's expansive grounds and myriad corridors fostered during the first act adds to the proceedings immeasurably.When Steve Johnson's FX finally take control of Night Of The Demons, the results are uniformly exhilarating and utterly relentless. The demon make-up is magnificent, elaborate and grotesque enough to impress without relying on distracting rubbery prosthetics, and all of the high-impact splatter sequences are delivered with gusto. However, the most unforgettable effect here doesn't feature even a drop of blood, and if you only remember one thing about Night, it will assuredly be the moment when scream queen goddess Linnea Quigley shoves a tube of lipstick into her nipple for no apparent reason other than because she's a demon and she can do things like shove tubes of lipstick into her nipple for no apparent reason.Though Quigley handily steals the movie, it was Amelia Kinkade's party hostess Angela who was ultimately flagged as the franchise player for the Night Of The Demons series, and deservedly so. Kinkade is simply awesome here, delegating the nudity and sex scenes to the other ladies in the cast to thrust herself into the role of the black-clad centerpiece for the stygian slaughter. Angela looks creepy even before she's transformed into a toothy temptress, but when Steve Johnson turns her loose, she becomes a fearsome and foul creature whose methodical lurking down the shadow-swept hallways in the decaying mansion provide the film with some of its most unsettling moments. If the image of Kinkade on the original theatrical poster alone isn't enough to convince you that you need to investigate Night Of The Demons, I don't know why you're even bothering with this review.Elsewhere, there are touches of brilliance all over Night that demonstrate Tenney's artistic flair and his penchant for crafting unique experiences out of familiar material. The animated opening credit sequence deserves special notice simply because it's so freaking cool and establishes right off that bat that this is going to be an engrossing ride. Angela's morbid and wickedly sensual strobe-lit dance scene is a definite high-point, and the choice of "Stigmata Martyr" by Bauhaus as her impetus is particularly inspired (on a related note, I should further mention that the unconventional score by the director's brother Dennis Michael Tenney is also excellent). Additionally, the atmosphere inside the house is utilized for maximum effect, and the film boasts some truly chilling images and a few well-telegraphed scares.Even if you aren't interested in exploring the subtleties, Night Of The Demons has an abundance of the visceral ingredients any discerning fan of cheesy horror will be looking for, especially when it comes to the graphic bloodshed and ample allotment of gratuitous nudity. Sure, there are a few clunky aspects, as you'd expect given the budget and era. But overall this is a seriously fun movie that delivers the goods on all fronts, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. Do with that information what you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retarded but Fun Horror Junk Food</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun. Sometimes, there were some definite brains behind it all ("Evil Dead II", "Night of the Creeps" and "Return of the Living Dead" for example) and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends. Movies like "Pieces" and "Blood Diner" stacked rental shelves in the 80's and 90's, offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment. Kevin Tenney's 1988 movie "Night of the Demons" is a part of this tradition-stupid, poorly acted and not an original bone in it's body, but dammit if you don't have a good time.The plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80's: a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20's decide to go to a party at Hull House thrown by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Scream Queen legend Linnea Quigley.) Well, Angela and co. decide to throw a séance. This turns out to be as Will Arnett's "Arrested Development" character Gob would call it, a "Huge Mistake," because a demonic force soon possesses Angela, and starts to get to the others as well.Take "The Evil Dead", "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and your average dumb dead teen flick, throw them in a blender, and "Night of the Demons" is what you get. The movie is anything but original, and really, it's not a good movie. The whole thing is insanely derivative, the acting is terrible, the jokes often fall flat, the characters are annoying (especially the character of Stooge) and the plot holes are numerous. That out of the way, it's still a lot of fun. So why? Well for one thing, the make up and gore effects are top notch, with some really memorable moments (especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick) that really stick out. It also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously, yet with the exception of some terrible puns, plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness. Plus, there's a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that's almost impossible to resist. Yeah, it's nothing special, but it knows that, and it couldn't be more proud of that fact. It's a goofy party horror movie, and it never pretends to be anything more.It might not be a classic, but "Night of the Demons" is a good example of horror junk food done right. It might not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you don't want a fancy beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite Halloween piece for the squeamish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I own the video to "Night of the Demons" and usually watch it in the autumn part of the season. I thought it had its moments with some of the demons possessing the party-goers. The house which appears like an old funeral home or closed down mansion, gives off a cold, mean-spirited aura. This of course adds to the dread that the movie heaves. The acting I might add is at times atrocious, but redeems itself by slick use of make-up and the claustrophobia of being closed in and around the darkened climate. There are quite a few eerie sequences going on, and you never know who may pop out, or who might be possessed. Its not the greatest horror spoof, but it works in ways than other cheap attempts. I would recommend this feature for those who want that Halloween spirit added to their thrills. Rated **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of doing things for kitsch value, and I usually cringe when people claim that something is so bad that it's good. But this movie really is. The imdb quotes page for Night of the Demons cites a couple of real gems, but there are literally dozens of groan-inducing one-liners in this flick. What more can you say when a screenwriter's idea of snappy banter is, "Shut up and drive, b****"? The gore is cornier, the doomed couples are hornier, the bit players are stupider and the cliches are funnier than the rest of the genre. I can't in good conscience recommend that you pay money to see this movie, but I really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fun to watch with a bunch of friends. It's silly, and the acting is over the top, but it's fun. The story is simple with ten teens throwing a party in a demon infested mortuary. Quigley was so funny. I wasn't at all sorry for most of the people who died. There were so annoying, that's the whole point of this film to get a few scares, have fun, and see some alright nudity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahh, a classic eighties horror movie with one exception. This has perhaps one of the greatest endings I've seen in any horror movie. I'm really tired of watching a horror movie and at the end having the hero make a little joke and smile and everythings okay. Oh no, this has less of a stereotypical ending and my admiration for it is never ending. Watch it, you'll agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Angela decides to throw a party, and what a party it is! A group of teens get together at "Hull House", an old funeral home, on Halloween night for a party. In the first part of the night they manage to summon a demon, which possesses the teens one by one. Quite a chilling little flick. Stars B-movie queen Linnea Quigley (who does something VERY interesting with a tube of lipstick). There is some great camera work in this film (Angela in possessed form, floating through the hallways), and a nice "happy" ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie! Evil Dead has NOTHING on this film! Night of the Demons 2 and 3 are a total bore fest, but this one is a classic. It's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best, but what more could you want from an 80's horror movie? Stooge has some of the best one-liners to ever hit the screen in this one. (he's my favorite character) A lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the ending, sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man eats his left over Halloween apples in a pie, and his throat is mangled from the inside out. The sound track is awesome. The scene with Angela dancing is totally creepy, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that's playing. The make-up effects in this movie are pretty sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a kid. If you're the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience, you might want to give this one a pass. But, if you're like me, and you really dig the whole Halloween, haunted house with the demons cliché, than this one is definitely a must own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And you know why? Because they thought (or at least made horror fans think) that a bunch of obnoxious, foul-mouthed, screaming teenagers, some stupid demons (Where do they come from? What is their purpose? Who knows?) and a dark mansion are all you need to make a horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong. You also need a script, some logic, some rules, and some invention. This flick DOES have one scene that lives up to its reputation (the lipstick scene, of course), and a couple of funny moments (the kid brother's description of his mother's cookies, Linnea Quigley's "don't look at me" scene). It also has more profanity than any movie I've watched since I last saw "Reservoir Dogs". Literally every fourth or fifth word is a "f***" or a "b****". Then again, when a movie begins with FOUR false scares in its first 5 minutes, you know not to expect anything resembling good filmmaking. (*1/2)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie just rocks. It has everything, Halloween, the costumes, the big house, demon possession, great 80s cheese music, even creepiness through-out. The demons are actually creepy. Director Tenney is obviously skilled at creating a creepy mood and the film is pretty stylish as well. Once the demon action kicks in, its fun. If you r a horror movie fan you owe it to yourself to check this out. I remember seeing Night of the Demons back in the late 80s on a rented VHS. Its directed by Kevin Tenney (witchboard 1 n 2, witchtrap, 2007-brain dead). It has Linnea Quigley ( Silent Night, Deadly Night, Return of the living dead, Nightmare on elm street-4, Night of the demons remake). Looking forward for more projects from the director Kevin tenney. Saw the sequel of this in the mid 90s on a VHS, which was OK. Saw the third part in the late 90s on a vcd, which was a bad movie. Saw the 2009 remake starring Edward furlong on a DVD, which I dint enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'80s horror flick about a group of teenagers having a séance at an abandoned funeral parlor and becoming trapped inside with an evil force hell-bent on killing them. It's a fun movie of its type, helped by a lot of humor and a nice cast. Cathy Podewell is a good 'final girl' but Amelia Kinkade and scream queen Linnea Quigley are the real stars. Some decent gore, nudity, and many funny scenes (fudge log, sour balls, and "maybe I'm in the mood for pork tonight" to name just a few). It's one of those movies you'll either get the appeal of instantly or you never will. It's an entertaining movie that's about as deep as a puddle and that's just fine with me. Best scenes are Kinkade's sexy dance number and Quigley's inventive use of lipstick. Followed by two sequels in the '90s and a really crappy remake in 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun at the Funeral Parlour.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting asked by a US-based friend if there were any guests at a Horror film fest that he was to attend that I would a signed photo from,I noticed that along with Brad Dourf,legendary "scream queen" Linnea Quigley was to attend the event.With another friend being a collector of signed film stars photos,I decided to sort out a signed photo of Quigley for him.Despite having heard of her for years,I have not got round to seeing any Quigley Horrors! With the photo being a still of the famous "lipstick" scene ,I felt that it was time that I finally spent a night out with the demons.The plot:Planning to attend their high-school Halloween dance,a gang suddenly receive an invitation to attend a party being held at a disused funeral home,which legend has it is built on Indian burial ground.Enetering the building,the gang find nothing but disused coffins in the building.Opening their cans of beer &amp; partying,one member of the gang decides that it would be fun to hold a séance.Finding a large mirror,the group begin to take part in the séance,which will lead to them discovering the "fun" hidden within the walls of the funeral parlour.View on the film:Entering the movie bent over a shopping aisle, (which the camera stays focused on for a good while) Linnea Quigley gives a delicious performance as high-school rebel Suzanne,with Quigley giving Suzanne perfect shots of flirty sass,and a lip-curling grin,as Suzanne reveals her demon bite.Backed by a creepy score from his brother Dennis Michael Tenney,director Kevin Tenney and cinematographer David Lewis splash every penny of the titles low budget across the screen,with Tenney and Lewis using rapid,well- handled floating shots to show the closed-in corners of the funeral parlour,and also create a tense atmosphere of a deadly evil being in the air.Spreading eye-gauging's and mucus-spewing demons across the movie,Tenney and Lewis show an excellent amount of focus in using a long lens,which allows for the superbly designed demons to slowly creep up on the viewer.Whilst Tenney and Lewis do well in attempting to give the film a fast-pace feel,the screenplay by Joe Augustyn sadly slows their sprint down,due to Augustyn spending far too long on releasing the simple set-up,which leads to the demons flames burning out before they have had a chance to really burn.</fullReview>

I got really attached to the character Stooge. His death had me in tears. The sound technician made a great job. One time a door closed and the music stopped. So dramatic! The soundtrack is still up to date. I listen to it when I go to work. Perfect cure for the case of the mondays. Nice with the acoustic sound. Better than the modern CGB (computer generated baloney). I wish someone would have showed me this movie during the most difficult times of my life. The ending was bittersweet, sweet because i learnt about morals and bitter because it was over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Awesome Camera Angles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The animated opening sequence to the film is a general idea of what you're getting yourself into. It provides the spooky '80s synthesizer used in most, if not all, horror movies during that time period. If the music hasn't got you sold, then the animated demons definitely will. It sets the stage of the Hull House, and how this is going to be a lot smarter of a movie than most viewers would think.The cinematography deserves an award for some of the most brilliant scenes that were crafted. With a title like, Night of the Demons, you'd expect a lot of cheap thrills, sexploitation, and gore. The best part of that assumption is that it's all true, except it's done so in a way that plays with the plot. Every scene serves a purpose, and it's clearly showcased after finishing the film.Night of the Demons was so smart, that it made some scenes look really dumb. In specific, the scene where Angela (Amelia Kinkade) is flopping around on the floor, doing the fan-favorite "Angela Dance". She looks so ridiculous while engaging in the routine, that it can be easily looked passed that she is showing early signs of being possessed by the demons.A scene that made the movie better than it probably was, happens when the mirror from the seance breaks. The party-goers are shown in the broken shards of glass that are strategically sprawled on the floor. Each character can be spotted, and it was just such a brilliant way of using some extra footage. The movie would not be getting such a high rating if it weren't for the ending, which can be seen as iconic as the conclusion to Sleepaway Camp. In the final scene to Night of the Demons, the old man that had been harassing the teenagers at the beginning of the film is seen collecting his morning paper. Prior to the party, the old man was shown with apples and razor blades, implying the oldest trick in the book. After making a nasty comment to Roger and Judy, he goes inside to be greeted with a freshly baked apple pie from his wife. He eats the pie, and after just asking where the apples came from, his throat rips open, covering the freshly baked apple pie in blood. His wife ends the movie with a kiss on his head, and by saying, "Happy Halloween, dear.". The legendary quote is followed by an '80s power ballad, and the rolling credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Halloween party to end all Halloween parties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Demons" has a group of ten teenagers throwing a Halloween party in an abandoned funeral parlor; led by prankster Angela (Amelia Kinlade), the party starts out in good spirits, but it's not long before spirits of the dead start possessing each of the kids, turning them into ravenous monsters with an appetite.I remember seeing the VHS cover for this film at the video store as a child, and it haunted my dreams for years. Every time I went into the video store, I'd avoid the horror section at all costs just so I wouldn't have to see that awful monstrosity on the VHS slip. Now, as an adult who has seen the film, it seems rather silly given the minutely comical tone of the movie, but no less, it is a testimony to the effective makeup work and special effects employed in this film. Plot-wise, what we really have here is essentially a hybrid of "The Evil Dead" and "Hell Night," but the film is still wildly enjoyable despite the derivations. Kids running amok in a dusty funeral parlor where each of their friends are transforming into monsters, while meanwhile, Angela, the "queen bee" of the party is perhaps the most horrific of all. The film has a slightly humorous edge to it at times, yet still has plenty of scares and splatters up its sleeve to keep the most jaded horror fans amused and entertained. Amelia Kinkade and Linnea Quigley are the highlights of the cast despite ostensibly being supporting characters, but the whole cast is much better than the material demands. "Night of the Demons" is, at the end of the day, a solid flick that doesn't demand serious viewing? in fact, I'd say it works against that? but it's still a remarkably well made film with impressive special effects and a hearty mix of gruesome violence and edgy humor. The Bauhaus dance sequence is just one of many party favors offered. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 80s Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the night of Halloween, ten teens decide to go to a party at an abandoned funeral parlor. Hull House, rumored to be built on an evil patch of land and underground stream, is the place. While starting the party, the teens gather around a big mirror to perform a séance... big mistake.This is pretty much one of those 1980s horror films that immediately achieved cult status, right along "Return of the Living Dead". That combination locked Linnea Quigley in as the scream queen of her generation, or at least her decade.Director Kevin Tenney, previously known for "Witchboard", really struck gold with this hit. The cheesy plot, terrible acting and more make it fun in the classic "so bad it's good" way -- something I mean with all due respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the 80s were bombarded with moody horror flicks loaded with gruesome blood and gratuitous nudity and while there are some better than others, Night of the Demons got plenty of rewatch value out of me during my teens and now, upon its blu-ray release, i can't help but rekindle my love of this excellent crap. the nostalgia alone keeps me longing for the days when horror was at its peak and not marred by a limp PG13 rating or the lame prospect of a remake. this was remade a few years ago to shoddy effect, which only raises the value of this fun original. a ghost story that sticks to an old-school formula that's seemingly extinct today, it's mixture of dark fun and blood thirst brings out the best in any horror fan. from its animated opening titles segueing into the spooky, yet serene atmosphere, landing right on top of its monkey pit variety of characters, it's got a little bit of everything that should help any viewer smile once or twice. it's Halloween night and at the invitation of goth fox Angela (Amelia Kinkade), a small group of teens have gathered to party the night away at the infamous Hull House, a long abandoned mortuary with a scary presence and an even scarier past. you'd think there would be safer and more productive ways to spend Halloween in the name of fun. but not these morons. the line-up of victims consists of your garden variety of misfits that have become routine for every standard horror flick: there's Judy (Cindy Podewell), your obligatory, adorable, blonde sweetheart; frightened Rodger (Alvin Alexis), who's the first to sense something's wrong; Stooge, (Hal Havins) the loud-mouthed jerk; Helen (Allison Barron), she who's easily bored by Stooge's abrasive attitude; Sal (William Gallo), the immature prankster/party crasher; Suzanne (Linnea Quigley), Angela's sexpot best friend; Jay (Lance Fenton), Judy's lecherous preppie date, and cute couple Max (Phillip Tanzini) and Frannie (Jill Terashita). some seem nice enough, some (like Stooge) are just asking for it. sure, there's drinking and partying and cavorting, but when Angela and the crowd participate in an amateur séance, they awake the evil scariness within the frightening structure and that's when things get nasty. one by one, the teens become demon-fleshed ghouls, either mauled or possessed by the demonic beasts, while the untouched aim to escape with their lives. delivering on all fronts, Night of the Demons was brought to life by 80s horror director Kevin Tenney (Witchboard), who could be the one guy who paid attention when taking in the calm chilling mood of John Carpenter's Halloween. alongside Halloween and Michael Dougherty's Trick R Treat, this is one movie that best captures the stillness of Halloween, the darkness enveloping you in autumn night feel. yeah, it maybe lightweight in the acting department, but some manage to add a little to their craft. Kinkade has an insane sexy dance number to Bauhaus's "Stigmata Martyr" and Quigley, in all her naked goodness, has fun creeping out the masses while locked in her seduction mode. but people don't watch horror movies for the performances. they go for the jumps and the carnage and Night of the Demons effortlessly provides both. even if you get that "been-there/done-that" feeling, you'll at least enjoy the ride. by no means is it the best of anything and the ending's a little simple, but it's definitely one for autumn season. that's right, loyal horror fans, this is a blast.</fullReview>

And needless to say, scary stuff starts happening. As I said, the acting ain't bringing in Oscars, but when the horrors make their appearance, stuff gets pretty good. Effects and makeup is good, the demons are cool and kinda scary, there a little swearing, and some boobs. Pretty much what all you could wish for!

		<fullReview>Night of the Demons is an example of 80s campy horror at its best. It features enthusiastic performances, a decent amount of gore, and a great soundtrack to boot. Although the film features a standard horror movie plot, with a group of teenagers going into a possessed house, it stands above many similar movies.The performances of Linnea Quigley and Amelia Kinkade play a large part in making the film so successful. Quigley, by this point, was already becoming a genre vet, and knew how to make her character amusing. Kinkade also brings a certain charisma to demonic Angela, with her dance scene midway through the film being a particular standout.The film, of course, is a B-movie, and at times suffers some of the limitations thereof. For instance, a few of the special effects are wonky, with the torso in the infamous "lipstick scene" being noticeably fake. Nevertheless, this film should go to the top of every horror fan's rental list.</fullReview>

The possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) who floats and talks in a really deep voice. The remaining teens that haven't been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house.This is a very fun horror film with great special effects which include Linnea Quigley (who has a couple nude scenes as usual) gouging out a guy's eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipple. There's also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out. This is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza. You can expect the usual terrible acting and atrocious dialog that often comes with this type of film but it doesn't take away from how enjoyable it is to watch. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night Of The Demons is definitely one the definitive cheesy 80's demons horror flick in the same vein as the brilliant Evil Dead and Demons movies. This movie combines boozy sexually active teens and demons into one hell of a fun movie. A definite welcome addition after the 80's were overrun by slasher flicks, it was nice to see something a little different.The plot follows a group of teens who all meet up for a Halloween party at hull house which used to be funeral parlour, hosted by Angela. About 40-minutes of boozing and sexing eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the furnace and possessing each and every one of the teens. Add some snazzy make-up effects, lots of gore, and cool-looking demons and you've got yourself a sweet 80's cheese-fest that would be ranked as one of the best demon-related films in many horror fans' lists.Firstly I loved the setting for this movie, "Hull House" is really creepy and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the Demons emerge, that's when the action really kicks in and it becomes a night of terror and fear. This movie spawned 2 sequels, the first one in 1994 which was okay but nothing come pared to this and the third one titled Demon House was absolutely horrendous. This is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to come.All in all a fun cheesy flick with Demons that's definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Party of all parties is about to get a little "demonized"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Demons," the 1988 low-budget cult classic horror flick has everything you want in it: nudity, gore and funny dialogue. The plot is so basic that even a two year old could understand it. While a good movie, it still has it's flaws that cannot be easily overlooked. The problem does not lie within the story because if you actually look at it, the story was simple yet creative and effective but it lies with the performances of the actors.First off, lets talk about the plot. The plot is basic, as I have already stated. It centers on a group of teens, that throw a party at an abandoned funeral parlor on Halloween(go figure) which is hosted by their freakishly weird classmate Angela. During a séance, weird things began to happen which opens the portal to, you guessed it, demons being unleashed. It is not long until the demons take possession of the teenagers, causing havoc for the rest of the movie.Don't get me wrong. "Night of the Demons" isn't a bad flick, for it's heart is in the right place. However it sorely lacked in the acting department. The performances were so terrible that it wasn't even good for horror movie standards. The lead actress' performance was so bad, that it just seemed the casting director just randomly picked her off the street and said "you're going to be in horror movie, we need as many people as we can get." The film's strength however lies within it's wild frenetic cinematography(Evil Dead anyone) and gory F/X. If this film's cinematography had not of been that great and the effects would've been less than stellar, this film would've got a less than stellar review from me."Night of the Demons" is a good image of reminding us of the good old fashioned days of horror, back when everything was so simple and directors actually still had a lot of creativity, but is sorely brought down because of it's bad acting. Still it's a good film but the acting is what keeps it from being raised from "barely" average 80's horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite 80s gems! Demons, nudity, and splatter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Demons is one of my absolutely favorite creature features from the 1980s. From its animated title sequence, that completely sets an opposite mood than the finished film, to its over the top gore - the film delivers in a way only quirky b-movies from this bygone era truly can.The plot concerns a group of friends who decide to have a Halloween party at an abandoned funeral home on the edge of town. Little do they know, "Hull House" is filled to the brim with roaring, drooling demons, just waiting for Halloween so they can sneak into our world and possess the living. Of course, that's exactly what happens, with half the cast quickly becoming monsters and the other half becoming their fodder.The acting is uniformly weak, yet charming. From a Linnea Quickly fan's perspective, its saying a lot when she blows away almost everyone in the cast. Of course, the hammy acting you're forced to swallow only adds to the film's b-movie charm. It feels as though everyone has their tongue firmly planted in-cheek, even as the blood begins to spray.And spray it does! The unrated version of Night of the Demons, which was not screened theatrically but is now widely available on VHS and DVD, has more gore than ten movies from this era combined. Its over-the-top, nasty, and wonderfully demented. Gorehounds who have yet to uncover this gem will definitely rejoice.There's no reason anyone should LOVE Night of the Demons, yet the film has a charm all its own. With legions of fans and two sequels under its belt, this modern classic somehow defies convention by becoming a wonderful 90 minutes of filmgoing.If you haven't checked it out yet, do yourself a favor and pick this one up. As the poster artwork says, you'll have a Hell of a time.</fullReview>

Cheesy animation of haunted houses, some guy playing a synthesizer (which is the entire soundtrack for the film)...I mean what's not to like. These are the types of horror films that people of my age grew up on.The plot is pretty simple; high school kids get invited by the loner girl who practices the occult to a special Halloween party at this old house way out in the middle of nowhere. All the stereotypes are here; the obnoxious big guy who just wants to party, the somewhat sleazy Italian grease ball, the horny Mr. Popular boyfriend, the innocent pretty girl that Mr. Popular wants to have sex with, etc.So all our party goers arrive at the old place which we learn from the dialog was once a funeral home owned by a family until one of the family members murdered everyone else and then committed suicide. Well wouldn't you know it, the house is actually possessed by a demon which promptly enters the body of one of the girls and thats when all the fun starts.This movie has all the classical components of an 80's horror film: Bare breasts? Check Full frontal female nudity? Check Sex? Check Lots of blood? CheckThere is a subplot that revolves around an old cranky man and an urban legend revolving around razorblades and apples which is really kinda funny.Overall, you'll enjoy this film. The special effects and acting aren't anything to write home about but it's entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the old, old story : kids have a party in an old house, demons are unleashed, death and gratuitous nudity ensues. You all know it, it's still a lot of fun.Many people (okay, many horror fans, to be specific) have fond memories of this movie and it's always with slight trepidation that you revisit an old movie to see if it's still as good as you used to think it was. Luckily, this is.It has something for everyone (well, everyone who happens to be male, I suppose). From a fun title sequence to a shoplifting scam involving cunning use of Linnea Quigley's ass to the "mirror" scene to the full on demonic fun, this is a blast from start to finish.The girls are cute, the guys are . . . . male, the death scenes are well done with some good gore effects and, unlike some horrors from the era, this actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even tension throughout. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun first and foremost but it offers some nice, freaky moments that should please most genre fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb teenagers + funeral parlor + demons = Can't miss...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometime back in the summer of 1988, some friends and I were tipping a few back one afternoon at a local bar &amp; grille. We became bored and decided to catch a matinée. Hum, decisions, decisions, what should we see? Well, there's a chick flick, the latest Bruce Willis flop, something by Walt Disney (who are we kidding?) What's this? A demon flick with hot looking women? Bingo! Kevin Tenney directed this meaty chunk of 80's horror to full and joyous effect. A bunch of rowdy teenagers (no-name actors) hold a Halloween party in an abandoned funeral parlor, which is supposed to be haunted (what could go wrong?). Needless to say, things go terribly wrong (see: title) and the kids are pursued by a group of blood thirsty demons led by the wonderfully creepy Angela (Amelia Kinkade). I went in thinking it would be a waste of my $2.50, but found I loved it and encouraged others to see it. Chalk full of 80's gore and gratuitous nudity, including a great trick with a tube of lipstick. Rent the unrated version if you can, the film still holds it's own in today's mindless (so called) horror fluff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kicks off a decent b-movie trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Hallowe'en! You know what that means. It's time to gather some teenagers together for some drinking and partying. There's no better place than a "haunted house" for these shenanigans. And this movie offers shenanigans a-plenty.The teens in this film go to Hull House. This is a haunted funeral home in the middle of nowhere. Demons attack and several teens are possessed and/or killed. The end.What matters in these movies is how we get from the teens' bad idea to finale. This movie gets us there with some flair. For a b-movie, the effects are good, the setting is cool-looking and the story is decent.It's not as good as number 2, but much better than number 3. Worth a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Demons is a must see for hardcore horror fans. It's real freaky and actually pretty damn scary, with some intense suspense at the end. Most of all it's just plain entertaining. It's also well written and includes some fairly funny material. Scream Queen Linea Quigley is in it, but for the most part the acting is poor. Overall, the film is at least average. And even if your not interested in these types of films, see it for some hot asses and titties. Also has well-designed sets and good make-up effects, along with a kool soundtrack. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NIGHT OF THE DEMONS is beyond a shadow of a doubt, one of the most fun, over the top horror/comedy films you're ever likely to see! Seriously I have seen this movie tons of times over the years &amp; it never once gets boring, it always remains funny, suspenseful &amp; scary which is not something that one can say about a lot of horror films. I think what makes NIGHT OF THE DEMONS so special &amp; still very popular today with horror fans &amp; newcomers to the genre, is the fact that it was made for horror fans, by horror fans &amp; not some studio heads out to make a quick buck. The films acting is surprisingly good, especially LINNEA QUIGLEY'S unforgettable role as Suzanne &amp; AMELIA KINCADE'S portrayal of goth girl Angela. The direction by KEVIN S. TENNEY is some of the best I have ever seen in a horror movie, with many cool shots, twists &amp; pans that could definitely rival SAM RAIMI'S work on any instalment of the EVIL DEAD trilogy. Kevin is able to use his low budget well &amp; makes sure every penny, nickle &amp; dime is on screen. The Hull House set is a great piece of work, all dirty, dark, dusty, dilapidated, rotting &amp; grungy &amp; very eerie, it honestly looks like a real abandon house!. The score works surprisingly well, it manages to be both scary &amp; at times very humorous &amp; the rock song DOWN TO THE LAST MAN will always be a personal favourite of mine. The demon &amp; zombie make-up done by special effects wizard STEVE JOHNSTON is some of the best I have ever seen to ever grace a horror film &amp; the film has so many eerie, suspenseful &amp; tension filled moments, to give even the most strongest of willed horror fans a jolt. Despite it's subject matter, NIGHT OF THE DEMONS also functions well as a comedy, especially in the first half, where numerous hijinks, wise cracks &amp; situations cause nothing but sheer laughter. Speaking of the first half, NIGHT OF THE DEMONS opens up with virtually nothing going on, minus the hijinks &amp; such, no kills no eerie epilogue, no monsters, in fact the film really doesn't start to come alive till close to the forty minute mark &amp; even then we have to wait for the full on scary gore fest to happen ten minutes after that. While this could have spelled disaster for any horror film, thankfully it's not so here, because the characters are so much fun, there are so many false scares, tension &amp; eerie build up's &amp; plenty of laugh out loud moments, that one doesn't really recognize it, plus what is here, is well worth the wait, minus the possessions &amp; excellent monster make-up, we get charred hands, a corpse with a mouth full of blood, a chewed out tongue, an impaling, a cut off arm, a twisted neck, a vicious eye gouging &amp; in the films most memorable sequence, leave it up to the always fun horror fan favourite, LINNEA QUIGLEY, who pulls off another show stopping, best remembered moment in horror film history (as if her nude dance in RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD wasn't enough) &amp; shoves a lip stick tube right into her nipple! add to this, we also get a truly fun wrap around story, that sees a spitefully sadistic, miserable, evil old man who stuffs children's apples with razor blades on Halloween night, getting his grisly comeuppance, when his fed up elderly wife bakes him an apple pie from the left over razor blade infused apples that literally tear themselves out of his throat, spewing torn flesh &amp; blood all over the place, true this kill asks one to accept a lot (how is it that he wouldn't feel himself chewing &amp; swallowing up razor blades?) but it's all done in the spirit of good fun &amp; NIGHT OF THE DEMONS winds up a winner. I will say though, I can't help but notice the plot point in the film, of how the only exit out of the mansion has disappeared, when the carnage takes place. This plot point was also used in 1985's DEMONS, in which patrons at a movie theatre were trapped inside, allowing the demonic onslaught that has taken place, even the creatures in this film bared a similar look to the creatures in that movie. The realistic painting still (standing in for the fictional Hull House in the long shot, where the kids are in the car staring out at it) was really cool &amp; eerie &amp; I loved the animation sequences done during the opening credits &amp; the lead heroine's costume was a clever take on ALICE IN WONDERLAND, which found that girl in a strange land, something the character of Judy finds herself in, only in a land far more terrifying. I also liked the twist done to the climax which sees the heroine saving the day, when the supposed "hero" is to scared out of his mind to think straight, on how to destroy the vicious monsters. It's a huge change from the norm where the heroine is scared &amp; helpless &amp; the male is heroic &amp; strong. A fun monster movie all around! An absolute must see! The character of SAL's last name is ROMERO is a reference to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD director GEORGE ROMERO. Written &amp; Produced by JOE AUGUSTYN. Known outside the U.S. &amp; Canada as HALLOWEEN PARTY. Remade in 2008. Followed by two sequels, starting with NIGHT OF THE DEMONS 2**** stars</fullReview>

This movie had great laughs and wonderful seen. It featured the weird gothic girls and so forth. The styles did allow me to reminisce on the 80s. Though other than the jeans jacket, the miami vice look, and terashita's pants, all the rest of them were wearing costumes.

		<shortDescription>Fun, entertaining, and scary horror flick with lots of gore and good-looking women.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** out of ****I enjoy horror films quite a bit and Night of the Demons is a good reason. No, it's not a masterpiece, but it delivers an hour-and-a-half of fun entertainment, which is more than can be said of many other so-called "scary" movies. I believe critics sometimes view horror films in the wrong manner, looking at only how often illogical they are. Sometimes (actually, most of the time), that can be a valid complaint, but Night of the Demons is too much fun for any sort of nitpicking analysis (though they can still be fun to point out).Bad girl Angela (Mimi Kincade) and her equally rowdy best friend Suzanne (Linnea Quigley, starring in pretty much nothing but B-movies) have invited 8 others to their Halloween party, in the deserted Hull House, a place which has had stories developed around it, legends of how the land there is possessed by evil. Story has it that the previous tenants went crazy and killed each other, but the teens pass it off as nothing serious.The partying groups arrive, with Jay and her girlfriend Judy (Cathy Podewell), as well as her old boyfriend Sal (Billy Gallo) along for the night. Also present are Judy's two friends, as well as Rodger (Alvin Alexis), a semi-religious and scared young man, and his friends Stooge and Helen. Eventually, the 10 teens begin to fool around with superstition, and they foolishly ignore all the stories they've heard about the place.A demon awakens in the bowels of the house, and it possesses one of the girls, and the process eventually passes around until only 3 of them remain human. Their attempts to escape become futile, as all the doors mysteriously lock themselves and all the exits are blocked. They find themselves trapped inside the large, old house, and must find a way out before the demons get to them.Night of the Demons is basically a fun horror flick that has no pretensions at all. The plot is a re-hash of The Evil Dead set inside a much larger house and the movie offers nothing particularly original, but it's certainly the kind of movie to watch on a late-night for some good spooky thrills and chills.Director Kevin Tenney is a crucial reason to making the film work. His style is definitely reminiscent of Sam Raimi's, and most horror buffs will get a sense of deja vu from the "demon" POV, but it's done just as impressively here, particularly in the first long tracking shot, which also conveys the immense size of the house as the camera pans over several hallways. Tenney's direction may not be incredibly original, but there's no doubt that he knows what angles to shoot and he keeps the proceedings entertaining the whole way.The movie builds up nicely, and it's all paid off in the last 45 minutes, which work as quite a rollercoaster ride of scares and chills. The second half plays like a chase film as the demons hunt down their human prey. Tenney's direction is all over the place, making the house seem like a large, complex maze with dead ends all over the place. There are some good shocks and suspense throughout, and you're also never really certain if anybody will even make it out alive at all.Also working to the movie's appeal is the gratuitous gore and make-up effects (courtesy of Steve Johnson), whichh are well done; and the excessive nudity. Let's face it, without these, the movie probably wouldn't be quite as fun. The gore effects include eye gougings, hideous demon transformations, and a real gruesome scene where a guy gets his tongue bitten off. Most of the nudity is supplied by Linnea Quigley, no surprise there. Ah, speaking of Quigley, there's the infamous lipstick scene (spoiler here), where she runs the lipstick in a circle around her breast until jams the whole thing inside her nipple. Pointless and illogical, yes, but undeniably odd and amusing.The script obviously doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Early on, it's shown that the demons like fire, but the humans later use flames to repel them, and it works. There are a lot of odd, dynamic changes in the characters, as if though writer Joe Augusty attempted to add twists in there, but isn't very effective because these characters aren't very well-developed in the first place. The good guy boyfriend turns out to be a loser, the wild guy is actually pretty nice, and the "dumb" and "scaredy-cat" blonde holds her own fairly well (to be fair, the transition for the blonde, Cathy Podewell, works pretty well).I'd say the acting's a bit subpar, but I suppose no one would really care. Cathy Podewell is quite a sexy actress, which is probably the reason she was given the lead role, but she can still act. Her biggest problem is that sugary-sweet voice of hers, which sounds completely out of place and makes her seem like too much of a nice girl. She and Rodger are probably the film's only likable characters, simply because they're the only ones who seem to show intelligence (though Podewell's dumb, big-breasted blonde routine at the beginning hinders that just a bit). Mimi Kincade has a lot of fun as Angela, the girl who eventually gets possessed and leads the other demons. Linnea Quigley similarly overdoes her performance, but is also equally fun to watch. Seeing her in several films, though, I have to wonder what all the clamor is about. She's not that good-looking and looks quite hideous here (probably due to the fact she wears make-up the entire movie). The only other performer who really registers is Alvin Alexis, who plays the scared Rodger fairly well.Night of the Demons is only for those who don't mind a bit of violence and nudity without much originality. Those looking for a superbly brilliant film should steer away, but the movie has "fun" spelled all over it. It's never dull and should keep its intended viewers entertained. Plus, it looks even better when placed in comparison to Lamberto Bava's awful "Demons."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin S. Tenney's "Night of the Demons" has enough lost-in-the-funhouse atmosphere and style to make it a good deal of fun. Its characters are Typical Teenagers all, a bunch of party lovers who choose for their Halloween bash the infamous Hull House, one of those ominous, run down locales to be found so frequently in horror films. Of course, the place is possessed (here, a distinction is made between "haunted" and "possessed") and soon some of the kids turn into demons that taunt and torment the others.Tenney has this begin on an awfully irresistible note, as his opening credits are accompanied by some nifty animation and very cool electronic music composed by his brother Dennis. The Hull House locations are just perfect for this story, with one dirty and decrepit room after another. The makeup effects are by Steve Johnson, and are very good, especially in the movies' most memorable sequence, involving a tube of lipstick and a breast. (Johnson would go on to marry co-star Linnea Quigley.)And speaking of Ms. Quigley, the scream queen creates another iconic role here as the boy-crazy Suzanne, who has a hell of an introduction, one that many of us definitely appreciate. Amelia Kinkade is a total hoot as the morbid Angela, and has one very impressive dance scene enhanced by use of strobe lighting. Hal Havins is hilarious as party animal Stooge, Billy Gallo likewise amusing as swaggering jerk Sal, Cathy Podewell appealing as female lead Judy, and Alvin Alexis energetic as Rodger, one of the few characters in the movie with any brains at all.The pacing is a little inconsistent as some scenes tend to drag, but eventually things do really kick into gear for a finale when all the creeps crawl out of the woodwork. Adding to the entertainment is the humour in the sequences with the grumpy old man (Harold Ayer) and Judy's bratty younger brother, played to perfection by Donnie Jeffcoat. And the resolution to this thing is simply brilliant, coming up with a gory payoff for the old urban legend of razorblades inside apples.A generally enjoyable movie overall, this deserves to take its place as one of the quintessential viewings of the Halloween season.Followed by two sequels and a remake.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, my eighties cheese!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the first "horror" movies I ever saw, and I still think it stands apart from other "genre" films of my high-school years. The only other "horror" movies from that era that now have a place in my heart and my DVD collection are pretty much every vampire film (Lost Boys, Near Dark, both Fright Nights). I think what got me were two things - the striking animation in the opening titles - excellent work - and Angela's (Mimi Kinkade)dance to the Bauhaus song "Stigmata Martyr". I loved her overall look in the black wedding dress, and when I saw that dance, she became one of the "I want to BE her" figures of my teenage years. (Yes, I'm a bit of a freak; my fantasy image of myself then was always "scary-sexy").Anyway, to paraphrase a book I read on horror movies, we like to think we want gourmet food, but sometimes all we can get is Cheeze Doodles - and, let's be honest, sometimes we LIKE Cheeze Doodles! Keep this one in mind when you're having one of those nights, especially if it happens to be Halloween night. Recommended by this child of eighties' horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a B horror movie should be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Demons is the perfect Halloween rental. Actually it's a perfect purchase if you are a fan of B-movies since Anchor Bay has put out a great unrated DVD with some very nice extras. Well I just love this film! It starts with some really cool animated opening credits and then follows the exploits of a group of teenagers planning to go to a party hosted by weird-o goth chick Angela (Mimi Kinkade). Well Angela's chosen the perfect spot for her little shindig; Hull House, a reputedly haunted former funeral parlor. During a séance, the teens unleash a demon that possesses airhead bimbo Suzanne (Linnea Quigley, campy and hilarious!) who then goes on to give a soul stealing smooch to Angela and so on and so on until the house is bursting at the rafters will bloody murders and the resurrected dead. The film is very entertaining all around, moves pretty quickly, has plenty of bloodshed and special effects to keep you entertained and director Kevin S. Tenney makes the most of his locations. There's also a subplot involving an elderly couple that doesn't have much to do with the rest of the movie, but is entertaining nonetheless. Kinkade and Quigley both turn in memorable performances and the cast is nicely rounded out with Hal Havins (who co-starred with Linnea in Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama), Lance Fenton (from Heathers), Cathy Podewell (who played JR's hillbilly wife on the last season of Dallas), Jill Terashita (who some may know from Sleepaway Camp 3), William Gallo and Alvin Alexis as Roger.Apparently this film was a surprise box office hit as pointed out on the extras of the DVD, which may explain why two sequels were eventually made. Another good extra is My Demon Nights, an informative interview with Quigley about the production. Other extras are trailers and radio spots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film has the best that 80's horror had to offer without none of the crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could never remember if the film was actually any good because a lot of films back then I have fond memories of but now in recent viewing I see that they're not actually that good. But my fears were quickly put to rest when I saw this bad boy of an 80's classic. How hard does it rock? It rocks all kinds of ass. It owns the 80's movie. It is what I think about good 80's horror.Script wise...it's perfect. It's tightly written, funny as hell, has great characters,a great plot and an interesting take on the haunted house set up. But best of all this film isn't just a horror movie... it's a freaking comedy for the first act set in the world of a horror movie. The humor comes naturally and isn't forced and is never too cute for it's own good. The writer knew what kind of film he was making and so he kept everything to make it fit in it's own tone. But best of all the film has a timeless and never feels dated. This film came out about 18 years ago and it's still freaking fun as hell. The jokes still keep me laughing and I've seen it a bunch of times since. I laugh out loud ever single time. Hell, the lines in this film are so damn catchy and the actors deliver them with such life that I can't help but to love them. Man, the script is so well done that I actually know them by heart. I can repeat every catchy line from the film out of the blue and they still make me laugh. I love it. What makes it so great it has a perfect mix of laughs and pure horror. This film is for fans of the genre and they give the fans what they want... but better then that they actually deliver a great film along with the gore and blood. This film captures an era where horror was fun and wasn't scared to try new things while still delivering a good film. It's a classic.Cast wise...everyone is spot on. They all know how to deliver their lines and they know how to keep their characters alive and fun. First let's start off with our lead... Cathy Podewell as Judy" the good girl virgin". You know what...I love her performance. That's it. I love her in this film. She's really sweet and I love her acting... or non of there of.lol. You know what I know what I mean. She's not really a great actress but she's on that boarder line of being wonderfully bad. A lot of people won't like her but I love her. She's adorable and cute. Then there's Billy Gallo as Sal and Hal Havins as Stooge. They both are funny as hell have some of the best lines in the film. They are a blast. That's it. I love both their characters. But it's their acting and personalities which makes us like their "jerk" characters in the film. They're both jerks but fun jerks. Everyone else is great to in our group of teens. Directing wise... I love director Keven S. Tenney. I love his directing on this film. I adore it, I study it and marvel at it. It's amazing. For the first 40 minutes it's mostly a comedy but he shoots it in a very interesting way. He has kick ass angles, camera moves and I just dug everything he brought to the table. The man knows how to make a cool looking film. I love his shots. I can't start to even tell you. This film not might be the most original type of 80's horror movie but it is very original looking. You watch this film and you know you aren't getting some low budget horror movie. No, the style here makes this film feel bigger then what it was meant to be. I loved how the camera seemed to just follow and move. Man, I just trip out on this film because every time I see I catch something new about the directing. There's always something new to spot. There's always some cool shot... or cool camera move that you never noticed before. So I love this film for that too. Not only that but Kevin doesn't let his style speak for him... he also crafts a great horror film. He knows how to bring real terror and fright into this film. But still it fits perfectly with the first part of the film. But I was also happy to see that even in the horror part of the film he never lost his flair for style. I love the floor shot looking up at Demonic Angela as she seems to float above the air... and if you watch the film with the insightful commentary then you've get a bigger treat when you find out just how they did it. Okay, so you got a clever script,fun cast and an amazing director... so what else do you need? Well, how about an even better score. I love the music for this film. It was done by Dennis Tenny, the director's brother, and he creates some of the most unforgettable music for a horror film ever. I love his score. It's got balls and is original. I never heard a score like that before and haven't heard one since. I also loved the music they used in this film. They didn't just use the latest popular songs(like today's horror movies) or songs from a current popular bands or rappers(like they did in the 80's). Nope, they used music that they picked for the film and would fit in. The music is great and what I loved more is the songs that Dennis Tenny wrote for the film. I love "Computer Date".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun way to kill an hour and a half. *** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I really liked those animated opening credits and what a cool theme too.The first third of the film is indeed a little slow. It takes awhile to get going, but once it does it's pretty much non-stop.The make-up and special effects are pretty darn good. The demonic faces are slightly reminiscent of that seen in the Italian 'Demons' films.There are some decent gore effects here as well. Fingers through the eye-sockets are always a plus and the lip-stick tube in the nipple was truly bizarre.Admittedly, the lead actress was nothing short of absolutely annoying. There's a scene towards the end where I was almost certain she was going to actually die. I couldn't believe it! But alas, she makes it by the skin of her teeth. Oh well.Also, this film is further proof that not every black man has to die in a horror film. I'm glad he didn't. He was the most likable character in the entire flick other than Angela in demonic form.There are a couple of great moments where the kids are partying and they bring a big strobe light. And if you watch this film at night with all the lights off, you can party with them and dance to the Gothic grooves of Bauhaus as the light flashes like wild demons in your very own living room.Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slight, derivative, but still somewhat entertaining; I'm surprised there were sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people really seem to like this movie; I thought it was just OK.A grumpy man damns all the kids going by to hell on Halloween night. A woman gets ready for a date for a Halloween party thrown by a weird girl; she doesn't want to go, but her boyfriend does. Her younger brother makes all kinds of smart-aleck remarks and rather inappropriate sexual remarks about her. A tough guy shows up wanting to see her.At the party, rather a small one, they meet at an abandoned mortuary and crematorium surrounded by a high fence that is built over an underground river. The idea of a fence built over a (presumably circular?) underground river is a weird one, but unfortunately the river idea isn't explored. They balk at the idea of having a séance, and decide to have a "past life séance" in which they all together stare at a full-length mirror, until it goes black and they see the past life appearance of the one person they are concentrating on. I don't know if that type of séance is an invention of this movie, or if it predates it. They do this, but I guess it goes wrong since a demon appears in the mirror, and someone is thereafter possessed. Anyone the demon-possessed person breathes into becomes similarly possessed, and anyone the demon kills comes back as a demon or zombie of some kind.For the most part, it's certainly not terribly original. There are the occasional shots that are nicely done. A medium-long shot of a goth girl dancing in a strobe light-lit largely empty room. A woman who has put her makeup on the wrong way. It's also unafraid to kill off characters you might have expected to live, as well as to make seemingly good characters bad and vice versa.There's a fair amount of female nudity in the movie. Putting the most on show was Linnea Quigley, who perhaps felt it necessary to secure the role, since the part was much younger than she was - what she says, more or less, in one of the special features.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love your horror to be raw, gritty and entertaining then do yourself a favour and watch this movie.Its great to see a bunch of teens actually behaving as teens would with the glossy often politically correct element that is present in so many horror films absent from this gem.You wont be disappointed with the gore and the atmosphere created by the environment the cast are in and the strength of these characters makes for a realistic and often funny movie.Watch out for a great performance from Hal Havins and a great goth in Angela. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the scariest movie I've ever seen. I saw it alone in the middle of the night. The story is a weird girl invites other school teens to an abandoned funeral parlor outside of town for a Halloween party. When the demons take over, all hell breaks loose. It's scary because the teens are literally trapped in a possessed house. Also because it's not about a killer, but of evil spirits you don't know how to stop. This movie takes place at night and the thrills and chills don't seem to stop.The suspense level is high, probably one of the most suspenseful horror movies I've ever seen. It has a creepy soundtrack and the demon voices really set the mood. I've never seen anything like it. You're almost guaranteed to be scared if you watch it alone, but if you watch it with someone, it would probably be more fun. Don't watch it during the day, that would spoil it. Watch it at night with the lights off. There is a lot of teen humor in the beginning, but don't think this is a comedy/horror, its not. If you haven't seen this, rent it, and you'll be in for a surprise! Horrific plot, good acting, all around well done. **** out of *****.</fullReview>

Night of the Demons is a joyless scare-free Evil Dead knock-off that has absolutely zero redeeming qualities if your not a teenage boy living in the 1980's. Still I love Scream Factory &amp; in 2013 my library increased with more of the movies they released &amp; I'm looking forward to future titles to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sex, Death, and Linnea Quigley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is what an '80s slasher is supposed to be. Horny teenagers, creepy setting, unstoppable monsters, plenty of gore, ample nudity, an anyone-anytime attitude towards character death, and, of course, Scream Queens with dance scenes. How can you go wrong, with all of that? Night of the Demons opens with several groups of teenagers headed for a Halloween party at the local haunted mansion, Hull House. Their trip out to the party site and initial explorations of Hull House provide plenty of opportunity for a number of innocent scares which lull the viewer into a false complacency. Then, after the teens unwittingly unleash the house's evil presence, things get ugly fast, as one after another, our cast becomes possessed by demonic spirits and are transformed into nightmarish killing machines.Everything about this production is top-notch (at least, by slasher standards); particularly outstanding are the makeup effects and individual quirks of the main demons. Angela is awesome, terrifying, and surprisingly sexy as the leader of the demonic pack. Suzanne (portrayed by the always-welcome Linnea Quigley), a wild girl obsessed with her appearance, paints her face and body haphazardly with her makeup and stalks the guys seductively. And Stooge, the obnoxious geek, becomes a powerful, undead beast who leaves a trail of destruction in his wake.Night of the Demons ranks among the best of all the '80s slashers, on par with films like A Nightmare on Elm Street, Return of the Living Dead, and Child's Play. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cheesy 80's horror gore fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bunch of mostly obnoxious and grossly unappealing teens go to a creepy, remote, rundown old mortuary located nearby a cemetery to attend an anything-goes all-out Halloween party being hosted by freaky occult-obsessed oddball Mimi Kinkade and her vacuous, boy-hungry bimbette friend Linnea Quigley. The loutish, profane, beer-guzzling, sex-happy dipstick dimwits hold a séance as a joke (very bad idea, 'cause the desolate old dive is naturally said to be haunted by demonic spirits). Of course, that ill-advised séance awakens those decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits, who gruesomely kill and possess a majority of the kids, turning them into ugly, fanged, clawed, boil-faced murderous ghouls who wreak the usual grisly havoc throughout the duration of an especially long, dark and harrowing night of pure terror.Yep, this is essentially your umpteenth vigorously graphic and unrelenting wall-to-wall cheap shock-ridden "Evil Dead" rehash, replete with closed-off, there's no easy way out claustrophobic single self-confined setting, outrageously excessive splatter set pieces, an incessantly pounding hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, a total sense of gloom'n'doom-laden grim nightmarishness, and vibrantly in-your-face manic careening cinematography (the expected headlong rush-inducing hyperactive hand-held camera-work, smooth, sinuous tracking shots, crazily tittled camera angles, even the camera on a dolly doing a gracefully gliding 180 degree figure eight). Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenney's slick, assured, stylish direction keeps the extremely threadbare and derivative proceedings thundering along at a speedy clip; moreover, Tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a certain crudely energetic and enthusiastically grotesque spooky ooga-booga carnival funhouse atmosphere.However, Steve Johnson's marvelously gory and imaginative make-up effects are the true star of the show. Bloodthirsty highlights include disgusting fat slob Hal Havins (who played a similarly irritating obese a**hole role in the immortal "Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama" around the same time) having his tongue bitten off, Quigley shoving a whole tube of lipstick in one of her breasts (yow!) and gouging a guy's eyes out while she's making love to him (double yow!), a libidinous teen couple getting offed while doing exactly what you think in a coffin (the chick has her neck snapped while the dude has his arm chopped off), Kinkade setting her hands on fire, and, in the film's single most nasty scene, a mean old man has his throat slit from the inside out after eating an apple piece laced with razor blades. The trashy'n'thrashy rock score likewise smokes. And then there's Kinkade's incredibly wild, sexy and uninhibited demon dance, a sizzling number accompanied by a flickering strobe light and startling jump cuts that Kinkade choreographed herself. Okay, so this overall doesn't amount to anything more than a completely mindless and pointless, albeit quite nicely mounted and enjoyably vulgar hunk of blithely sleazy fright flick junk, but if you're in the mood for entertainingly brain-dead lowbrow horror scuzziness this cheerfully crass and juvenile dross does the trick just fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Demons (1988) was another in a long line of "teen" horror films that were released on video and pay-t.v. during that mecca of film making the eighties. But unlike most of the crap that was being peddled around, this one was actually a decent watch. A group of bored "teenagers" decide to party Halloween night away with a pair of bizarre sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley) at the infamous Hull House. Your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers are invited to the party. But an average teenage bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive Halloween night when they undead residents of Hull House decide to crash the party. Who'll survive this night of bloodshed and horror?A nice horror film that is best seen in the unrated version. If you watch the R-Rated cut then you'll miss all of the splatter effects and nudity. Stay tune for the amusing epilogue! A gory film that was followed by an equally entertaining sequel. For horror fans only!Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear friends, I've never seen such a trash movie as NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that the director Kevin Tenney had the intention to copy classics like THE EVIL DEAD by Sam Raimi (1978) or George A. Romero's RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD from the same year. The cinematography was lousy, the movie was very dark, so I had to turn the brightness control to the maximum. Indeed, horror pictures have to be dark, but not the way like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS. The entire movie was ridiculous, no suspense, worse actors except Alvin Alexis in the role of Rodger, and horrible make-up effects. An average vote of 5 stars for that movie? I can't believe this. Perhaps the users were pleased about the tits, asses and pussies of the actresses, they were indeed worth 5 stars. Regards, Hans-Dieter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people don't appreciate dated or lower budget horror, but in my opinion you cannot be a true horror fan without at least a respect for the B-movie. This movie is enjoyable in only that way that 80's campy horror can be enjoyable. It doesn't take itself too seriously and you really shouldn't either. Often overshadowed by the slasher movies of the 80's, this one is a classic. Amelia Kinkade plays Angela. Watch for her creepy dance sequence. It's pretty memorable and what happens right after elevates Amelia's character, Angela from B Movie character to a horror powerhouse like Freddy and Jason. But unfortunately the 2 sequels that followed are inferior and wound up botching her character. Linnea Quigley does something very interesting with a tube of lipstick. And the gore effects are pretty cool.This movie is by no means a thought provoking kind of horror movie, where you are supposed to question the existence of humanity or anything like that. This is a horror movie with lots of drinking, sex, and drugs, and many many moments of "oh my god did she just?! Did they just do?!" Honestly as a shock value horror flick very few movies surpass this one. I'm probably a bit nostalgic for it, but only slightly I think a lot of the shock moments in this movie will get more people than most of the ones in "Saw" or "Hostel". The director had a really good feel on what would appeal to an 80's teen (and 90's teen in the near future.) Hull House is by far the best environment for a movie like this. The music is the greatest horror movie music ever! Far surpassing that of "Nightmare on Elm Street's". It throws a lot into the atmosphere of the movie.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most notable for its misuse of a tube of lipstick, Night of the Demons is classic 80s B horror material. It's director Kevin Tenney's most polished film and he shows some nice visual flair and manic energy, before his career sadly hit the skids with direct to video junk. Night of the Demons sputters a bit in the character department, as we're dealing with purely archetypal characters in these types of movies, but there's much entertainment in watching these one dimensional dim bulbs meet a horrible demise - or run amok as a demon. Tenney also makes the most of his low budget and majority of the film taking place in one location, with stellar makeup effects and a wonderful bathed in horror atmosphere aided by some better than expected cinematography. Night of the Demons has a nice sense of humor throughout and it's one of the better 80s genre entries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1988 horror film stars Cathy Podewell, Amelia Kinkade, Linnea Quigley, Alvin Alexis, Allison Barron, Lance Fenton, Bill Gallo, Hal Havins, Philip Tanzini and Jill Terashita. This takes place on Halloween night where teenage girl, Jill (Podewell) and her friends, Roger (Alexis), Helen (Barron), Jay (Fenton), Sal (Gallo), Stooge (Havins), Max (Tanzini) and Frannie (Terashita) have a private party at an abandoned mortuary, "Hull House." Kinkade plays Angela and Quigley (Return of the Living Dead) plays Suzanne who throw the party for them. Soon, they summon a demonic spirit which possesses them one by one. This isn't a bad 80's horror flick that sort of pays tribute to "The Evil Dead" &amp; "The Legend of Hell House" with an eerie score and good make-up effects. If you enjoy 80's horror, I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Weirdo party girl Angela (Amelia Kinkade) invites a group of school friends to a Halloween party at the secluded Hull House. It's the perfect place to host the get-together, considering it was once a funeral home with a mysterious past rooted in the occult. It doesn't take long before the good times go bad, as each attendee becomes possessed by demons or killed by them.I remember seeing "Night of the Demons" back in the early 1990s and thinking it was absolutely awful in every way. I thought the acting was bad. I thought the special effects were unbelievably cheesy. Watching it again now, I realized that the acting really WAS bad? really bad. However, I would categorize it as "so bad, it's good." I was completely wrong about the special effects. Every severed limb and gory sequence is handled with care and efficiency.There certainly is a lot of blood dripping and oozing out of people. There's also some full-frontal nudity and these characters curse like sailors. It's pretty standard stuff for a 1980s horror film.The movie might have demons, but don't expect anything remotely theologically sound from a religious standpoint. That's not the point of "Night of the Demons." Nothing is to be taken seriously in this fun and entertaining grade-B flick. I guess you could say the message of the movie is don't conjure demons or mess with the occult."Night of the Demons" is a near-perfect example of schlock 1980s comedy/horror with parts that will have you laughing out loud. It also reminds the viewer how much fun movies were when there were practical effects versus everything being CGI the way it is today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ten teens decide to have a party at an abandoned funeral parlour. Hull House is on a strip of land rumoured to be unfit for human inhabitance. The house has a history to it including all the Hull family being murdered. After the teens enter the house they decide to have a séance, causing a demon that lives in the basement to awaken. It possesses one of the girls, then one by one, others become possessed and killed by demons that inhabit the land....This is another one of those cult horror movies from the eighties that I missed on initial release, due to age, and never really thought about since. And this is probably why I felt sorely underwhelmed, and the fact that I saw the awful remake before didn't help either.But it's still fun and cheesy in a way that only the best decade ever could make it. Costumes and music are hilariously brilliant, and the first act, before the kids go into the house, is really funny, especially the young brother, who should have been in it more.The film is very gratuitous in that slasher/girl in peril kind of way, and effects are okay, but very obvious.So all in all, it's not a bad movie, but I doubt i'd ever watch it again, or the sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of Catholic High School students decide to abscond to an abandoned funeral parlour "Hull House" for Halloween. What they don't count on is that the parlour is infested with blood thirsty demons which are unleashed upon the unsuspecting party goers during a séance. The demons inhabit the bodies of their victims, resulting in about 90 minutes of utterly hilarious, gore-infused fun.Night of the Demons is a classic for sure. Along with Evil Dead, it sits at the top of the food chain in terms of demon-possession related movies and stands out above the seemingly endless plethora of cheese-ball 1980's horror flicks. It has a fun soundtrack, and a whole lot of weird and wonderful scenes. What is up with that lipstick? It's got some characters you want to see shredded by demons, and some that you can root for to. It spawned two amazing sequels and in September 2010 a remake will be released much to the excitement of horror fans who know what they are talking about everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cheesy Movie From The 80s , What Could Possibley Go Wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like cheesy movies,and Night of the Demons is a classic example of this.It's cheesy,but it's not half bad. We have a group of people going to a Halloween party at a place called Hull House,hosted by a weird girl named Angela. Hull House is an abandoned funeral parlor where years ago the family who owned it were brutally killed.They say the demons can't cross the stream by the place.During a séance at the party,dark forces are unleashed and demons of the house kill them one by one.It's up to the survivors to get out of the house before it's too late.This movie bleeds 80s cheesy-ness.Cheesy acting all around and cheesy characters. Well,at least the demons have a sense of humor and crack an occasional joke or two. The gore effects arn't half bad. For example,there is a scene involving eye gouging and and a nose or a tongue being ripped off/out.The characters are a bit stereotypical. The virgin protagonist, the protagonist's love interest,the loud-mouth party animal,the badass, the weirdo, the token black guy,the token Asian chick and the typical slut.I don't mind the movie,or the sequels. If you like cheesy 80s movies,especially the horror ones,you might enjoy this as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this movie I be honest dislike the movie quite a bit. There was parts of the movie I have to say were enjoyable. The cheesy acting being a strong point of the film. You really don't care about the characters. There is a mini story in the movie I found clever. In the movie you see a old man getting ready to put razors in apples. That is the beginning I guess you want to know more see the film.The demons in the film look decent. The death scenes aren't special really. The black guy actually lives even though you think he be the first one like the stereotype in all other horror movies. The female lead was suppose to be strong but she didn't pull it off for me.Least favorite parts: The lighting, the actingFavorite part: apple razor urban myth sub story, and convince store scene entertainingRecommendation: If you enjoy cheesy horror movies, then this one would actually be a good movie to see. Not worth your time otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't the video nasty Night of the Demon as there are more than one. Actually, there is only one, but it multiplies.After it inhabits Suzanne (Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), she passes it on to goth girl Angela (Amelia Kinkade) through a nice long kiss.Next, we see Linnea showing us her quigleys in the bathroom. She shows a lot more as Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks he is in for some fun.Soon, everything literally goes to hell as bodies drop one by one and are possessed. Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two trying to escape. Max isn't much help, leaving it to Judy to figure a way out.The makeup was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that kept this from being even better was the extremely long build up to the action.The old man (Harold Ayer) who appears in the beginning will be back and get his just desserts.Linnea Quigley may be the Scream Queen, but Cathy Podewell definitely showed the greatest lungs in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest Halloween movie I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many "Halloween movies" that you can see, but I never find another so scary, funny, gory yet so classic! The plot is nothing new: a couple of girls and boys decide to party-all-night and, as it's Halloween, they decide to do it in a "hunted house". Obviously the house is really hunted ("possessed" as they will acknowledge...) and the demon will possess of the girls, "transmitting" possession to the others every time one of them dies. Nothing special, you may say, but what makes this movie great in my advice is the clear and very good directing of Kevin Tenney together with a great crew! Special effects are great all the times (you should have heard about Steve Johnson...) putting on screen very good demons and murders, and actors are very good, creating very realistic situations. There are also funny characters to put some laugh between the screams ("Stooge" has something of the porky's movies....)! For all those reasons, even if it's an old movie, I suggest to put it on the DVD player on a Halloween night, sure that it will create the right atmosphere!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate Halloween party...from hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outside of most of the 'Halloween' film series there aren't too many great horror films set on that beloved October holiday. Some examples are 'The Midnight Hour,' 'Trick or Treat,' and this film. Though it's theatrical run was short, 'Night of the Demons' was never forgotten and has gone on to become a cult favorite, perfect to show to friends at a Halloween party. I've done this a couple times myself. Though it does borrow bits here and there from other horror films, it does have a life of it's own. After all it spawned two sequels and an upcoming remake so it can't be all bad, right? Pros: A really cool animated opening credits sequence. Decent performances. The old house is one dark and scary place. A good score, especially that main theme. A generous helping of humor. Goes along at a good pace. Really good make-up, prosthetic, and visual effects. Some memorable moments of weirdness. Not much gore, but plenty blood. One hell of an ending.Cons: Every character is a walking stereotype. Takes a while to really get going. Not too original and has some slasher and haunted house movie clichés.Final thoughts: Don't know if I'd want to be invited to this party, but watching it sure makes for good times. In the 80s there was no short supply of low budget horror films at the video stores, but that didn't mean you'd always be going home with a gem. This film is an exception and if you've yet to see it then see it for yourself, especially on Halloween.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical 80's Horror! Cheesy and fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now we all know horror films are not for everyone, so thats why this review is solely for horror fans who love the classic 80's cheese movies. This movie reminds me very much of Lamberto Bava's 'Demons'. A bunch of stupid teens get trapped in a building and they end up at the mercy of a bunch of evil Demons! You get what you hope for here. You get bad acting, nudity and gore. It moves along at a fast pace and you never get bored. A great movie to stick on at an Halloween party. Its a blast.I very much liked the music score in the movie, Its very creepy and plus you get your dose of heavy metal music. Awesome.My fellow horror fans, you will have a great time with this flick. Go out and buy it. Actually , i think i might watch it again so i can see Linnea Quigley breasts again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Night of the Demons" is a cheesy extravaganza, with a story that could be much better that the same movie offers, but it seems that don't have any story at all, and too with and illogical ending. But what i was praying for, it was an 80 film.The story is about a group of teenagers who want to join in the party of a strange girl named Angela. Until here is okay, actually i found it very interesting at the beginning. Just before the curse of the haunted house begin to possessed the teenagers, one by one. After this, become to be so repetitive that even the lead actress Cathy Podewell fall asleep in one scene.Maybe one of the approach of this film is the performance of three girls: The lead, Cathy Podewell, who made the sweet Judy, the weir and bad, Amelia Kinkade, and the sexy, lover of lipstick, the scream queen Linnea Quigley. For the rest, i don't know if was because of the Anchor Bay DVD release, but the photography was marvelous, as one scene that i love that is when the possessed Angela dances a good Bauhaus song to Sal (By the way, this is one of the characters who should be saved), the game with the lights is really scary. I think that could be much better, but after all, i think that is one of my guilty pleasures. Is a great Halloween film after all. Don't forget that, don't expect the best in scares of plot, just a movie for pass good time, and more if you are in loved with sweet 80s. *Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hull Of A 80's Classic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Demons is one of my all-time favorite 80's flicks. Classic 80's horror/comedy demonic possession! The characters are great (even if the acting isn't the greatest). Angela makes an awesome demon! Sal and Stooge are my favorite characters. They are a riot...Halloween night. Creepy Angela is hosting a Halloween party at the old abandoned funeral parlor, Hull House. So a group of teens get together and head out. There are some pretty funny scenes before they arrive at the "possessed" house. One of favorite scenes is when Helen, Rodger, and Stooge are in Stooge's car on their way to the house. Helen comes off with "Stooge, did you become an a**hole of your own free will or were you born that way?" (Rodger laughs) Stooge: "Did you hear something funny? I don't know why I'm hangin' out with you two wipes. Give me that damn map," and he rips the map out of Rodger's hands. Rodger: "Hey! Great Stooge, now look what you've done." Helen: "Typical." Stooge: "Typical (mocking). Shut up and drive b*tch!" LMFAO We are filled in with some history of the land and stream that are part of Hull House. The wall that surrounds the house is built on top of an underground stream. It is said that the demons are kept inside the land because they can't cross running water. An old Indian legend.OK. Once everyone arrives, Angela decides she wants to hold a séance. A "past life" séance is held and a demon is accidentally released. It possesses one of the teens and from there on out more and more end up dead and then come back to life as demons.Night of the Demons is a highly entertaining, cheesy, b-horror 80's classic! Definitely one to seek out and find for your collection. I also liked what they did with the old man at the end. Must See!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is another one of those novelty Halloween flicks that are about as funny as a kick to the groin at any other time of year. Right off the bat we're introduced to a bunch of 80's music, designs and story lines so unless you're an 80's fan...stop right now.The main storyline is the class weirdo throws a party inside of a mortuary that is supposedly possessed by demons from hell. The people she invites however aren't your typical weirdos. No, the people she invites is are the stereotypical 80's cast. We got the class clown (Stooge), the class act, (Jay), the goodytwoshoes, (Judy), the token black guy (Rodger), the ditzy blonde, (Suzanne), the class jerk (Sal) and rounding out the cast are 3 regular people (Max, Frannie and Helen). The party starts off with the usual beer guzzling and dancing but when Angela decides to do a seance..all hell breaks loose, literally! All in all it wasn't such a bad movie. I mean a bunch of demons running around for ONE LOUSY FREAKING NIGHT out of 365 doesn't seem that imposing. I swear Linnea Quigley loves shaking her ass, cause she does that in about 3 different scenes. Either that or the director is a pervert.Highlight of the movie is when Stooge says "Let's eat a bowl of f*ck!" ....whatever that means5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's on thing Kevin Tenney knows, it's horror movies. He makes great ones and this is no exception. If there's one thing Dennis Tenney knows it's music. You put the two together and you have a great horror film with an awesome soundtrack. NOTD is about a group of teenagers who decide to throw a party at an abandoned funeral home where some murders took place. One thing leads to another (they run out of party games) and they manage to conjure up a demon who possesses everyone, leading to some gruesome deaths. Linnea Quigley provides a healthy amount of T&amp;A as well as one wacky lipstick scene that has to be seen to be believed. Unlike a lot of horror films of the 80s, this movie has a good script and good acting. Add to it a great soundtrack and it makes this film a true joy to watch.

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent, despite the fact that it was made over a decade ago, it still outstands all of the new crap that is being released up today, supposedly under the category "horror". Todays "horror" movies rely more on those surprising musical "sounds" and too fake special effects to make a 21 century "horror movie". Todays movies have too much of that "gore" if thats the correct word which makes them just plain out funny or stupid. Night of Demons is a great movie because the actors at least seem more real, and the setting is realistic too, talk about Hull House at night, jaja, this movie has become like a tradition with my siblings and generation cousins, we come together and watch the movie remembering the old times back in 1993 when we had first seen the evil Angela, its cool, we have the 3 DVD's......its definitely worth the time and money.......in other words, ....at least more worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Demons is perhaps Kevin Tenney's best film, but it falls short of being an 80's classic. It's not scary, even though a serious tone is weakly attempted. As for the special effects, nothing special here. It varies from pretty good to absolute junk! I think the strength of the film is the diverse cast, despite poor acting, for the most part. The characters do work well with each other. The strength of the cast is definitely Hal Havins ("Stooge"). His character is the most memorable thing about this movie. He steals most scenes with his humor.The movie follows most generic 80's horror, but it is a step above a lot of horror movies that came out in that period. It is cheesy, but not over the top.6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

It has everything, Halloween, the costumes, the big house, demon posession, great 80's cheese music, even creepiness through-out! If you don't like it, YOU are the one missing out!

You will NEVER see a movie like this again, especially now that we're in the 2000's.I haven't seen some elements in this film equeled yet, in ANY other film! So, if you think you're too good for this movie, forget you!*The music rocks (A relative of the writer and director I'm assuming) especially 'The Beast Inside'!*The escape scene at the end is wonderful! SO 80's. Something about the demons pulling all over the girls Alice In Wonderland costume! Brilliant! And, when they try and get over the wall.*The demons are actually creepy. Unless you're one of those 'big shots' who says "OHH THAT'S STUPID, I'M TO BIG ON THE HORROR GENRE TO THINK THAT'S CREEPY! I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING!" Well, no, it's not scary, but the shots are creepy. Very greatIf you love 80's horror, or just a fun movie, then definately get this.

		<fullReview>Painfully bad acting is what seriously damages this otherwise well crafted horror tale. The atmosphere is beautifully set; a dark and dusty mansion houses the evil spirits of some really nasty demons who possess a bunch of teenagers who are out to party on Halloween night and bloody carnage ensues.Technical aspects are well handled and the make-up effects are terrific. Some scenes are genuinely creepy and there are a few gory highlights as well. But films like these really depend on solid performances as it takes it's time building tension and suspense. All of that is nearly wasted as the casting director assembled basically the worst ever cast who can't pull off a single scene convincingly and, on top of that, are insanely annoying as well.Director Tenney is obviously skilled at creating a creepy mood and the film is pretty stylish as well but he's clueless with actors and the script has really shitty dialog. Once the demon action kicks in the film has some interesting spots but it could have been so much more. Still, it's an OK way to kill an hour and a half if you're in the mood for a horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanna learn about ancient Greek literature and culture, O Alice in Horrorland?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could have easily predicted pretty much everything that was going to happen in Kevin Tenney's "Night of the Demons". The main purpose of the flick is of course to see scantily clad babes, and two scenes with Linnea Quigley* affirm that; I would have definitely done what the convenience store clerks did! Cathy Podewell as the main character also looks quite sexy as Alice (and this ain't gonna be no Wonderland for her!**), as does Mimi Kinkade as the leader of the Halloween party.Anyway, this is definitely one that probably influenced the logic of "Scream" (i.e., the rules for horror flick survival). Very much intended to appeal to teenage boys. And that's what makes these flicks so great. I certainly recommend it.Be careful the next time that you eat an apple.PS: Contrary to the explanation of demons in this movie, I learned the original definition a few years ago in a class about ancient Greek literature and culture. The word comes from the Greek "daimon" (divinity). But Christianity spread to Greece, and the proselytizers believed that anything non-Christian was evil. Therefore, when they heard that the Greeks worshiped "daimones", they decided that the latter were morally bad. Hence the modern connotation.*You may remember Linnea Quigley from "Return of the Living Dead" as the woman who dances nude...and then the zombies turn her into a snack.**I'll be eager to see what Tim Burton does with Lewis Carroll's story in his movie version to be released next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best of the 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is where low budget meets creative ingenuity and comes out looking like a champ. Budgets and computer effects can be easily overrated and one of the things I liked best here was the old fashioned approach of make-up and manual gags which I felt gave it a more "real" or at least better look and feel. As well, the house itself brings a certain weight to the movie. It was an excellent choice and beats a movie set any day (especially considering it's condition when they found it, it was perfect for this film's purpose). Choice of actors was great, acting skill itself, though good, took a backseat to how well I felt the interaction played out, they were pretty believable as friends and schoolmates. Admittedly, dialogue does seem planned here and there but all in all works out as pretty realistic under their circumstances. (How would anybody really act in the presence of a demon?) All around a 10 in my book, if a classically straightforward "B" movie is what you enjoy, this should hold it's weight in your library. I know it's a favorite of mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy and obnoxious, but picks up in the second half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A handful of horny teens having a Halloween party at an abandoned house accidentally conjure up a demon. This was entertaining and easy to make fun of, but the first half is really grating. The dialogue is almost unforgivable and the characters are obnoxious. The acting is mostly terrible--especially by the lead. Luckily, the movie really picks up in the second half. There are some surprisingly decent creepy and tense scenes in the house, great make-up jobs on the demons, some pretty cool SFX, and a lot of stuff that made me wince (the lipstick-in-the-boob scene, the barbed wire wall). Angela crawling around like a spider and then doing her trashy goth dance to Bauhaus--what's not to love about that? I have a feeling I'd like this more if I saw it in the 80s.My Rating: 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will make you appreciate Demons (Demoni) from Lamberto Bava.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow I was expecting something like Demons (Demoni)from Lambert Bava. Once you have seen that you just can't accept a movie like this. One reviewer even argued that "Night of the Demons" was better than Evil Dead. Well,that is just ignorance and sacrilege. "Evil Dead" is a horror classic. And almost everything that happens here is a direct copy from "Evil Dead". There is one scene where you will see the demon's viewpoint roaming through the house. The way the camera is used is the exact same way it is used in "Evil Dead" when deadites try to enter the cabin only not as impressive. But I don't mind if they use the same techniques,effects or even storyline as long as the movie manages to entertain you. And here starts the problem. "Night of the Demons" has a far to comedic approach to events. The acting is so bad (obviously) done on purpose that it removes all sympathy you might have for the characters. Also when something scary happens it just doesn't have the effect it should have. There are two or three scenes that really could have been scary if the acting at that time was truly serious. "Demons" from Bava showed a fine balance between,camp,humor,gore and thrills. "Night of the Demons" is more like a parody. I am sure that there is an audience for this movie. But if you are looking for thrills you are better off with classics like "Demons" or "Evil Dead". Do pay attention to the "twist" ending which is hilarious. It has nothing to do with the whole story but still makes more impact than the whole movie did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has its fans...but I'm not one of them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Night of the Demons' is a dodgy slice of 80s horror boasting a terrible script, some excruciatingly bad acting and lousy direction from horror hack Kevin Tenney.The derivative wafer-thin plot sees a bunch of obnoxious teens spending Halloween partying in a derelict spooky house; one-by-one they become possessed by the evil spirits that dwell there.Tenney tries desperately to emulate the visual style of The Evil Dead and the punk attitude of The Return of the Living Dead, but only manages to deliver a dull, tedious crap-fest that doesn't even manage to entertain on a 'so-bad-it-is-good' level. Tenney has nearly all of the ingredients necessary for a B-movie classic?monsters, naked chicks, and gore?but is missing the most vital one in order to make it all work: talent.The badly paced film takes an amazingly long time for anything noteworthy to happen and after 50 minutes of irritating 'crazy' shenanigans from the 'wacky' teens, I couldn't wait for them all to start dying.The special makeup effects from Steve Johnson are actually pretty good when they finally happen, but they are wasted on such a lousy film. Particularly impressive is a scene in which 80s scream queen Linnea Quigley pushes a lipstick into her breast and also rather good is a juicy double eye squish.Also worth mentioning are the lovely ladies who strip off during the course of the movie, making the experience slightly more bearable. The aforementioned Miss Quigley bares all for the camera (as usual) and lovely Jill Terashita gets her best attributes out for the lads. Gorgeous Cathy Podewell only manages a brief glimpse of her bare backside and a bra shot, but I'm not complaining?with such a dull movie, I was grateful for anything that might liven it up.'Night of the Demons' spawned two sequels, which are on my pile of DVDs-to-watch. Wish me luck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a connoisseur of bad horror movies from the 1980s, but this one is sadly lacking even by those standards. The dreary dialogue, made worse by appalling acting, with everyone grimacing and grinding out their lines by rote like automatons, were simply too much to bear. These performances are of the quality you might find in a high school drama production. Even worse, it lacked action, ignoring an unwritten rule for this sort of film: there simply must be a killing, maiming or supernatural occurrence during the first ten minutes. That doesn't happen here. The early scares are limited to silliness such as someone's little brother popping out of a closet shouting "Boo!" If you're 12 years old and willing to watch almost anything on TV while babysitting for your next door neighbors, you might find this acceptable. As for me, I tried to watch it but had to turn it off after 10 minutes. It was so stupid I couldn't stand any more.</fullReview>

After each character shows you what a complete asshole they are, some jerk suggests a séance. Soon after they start becoming slobbering demons and turn each other into demons. Director Kevin S. Tenney proved he can make a scary low budget horror film with "Witchboard" but this one keeps missing the mark despite having a decent set up. The elements are all present, Halloween night, a possessed ex funeral home and demons, how did they mess it up? Screenwriter Joe Augustyn delivers such annoying and unlikable characters you could care less what happens to them. The dialog is mostly pitiful and the movie never gets serious enough to be scary. Steve Johnson delivers some nice make up and gore but it is wasted on the lousy plotting. Not near enough is made of it being Halloween which could have really helped the atmosphere. The movie is lit very harshly with Director of Photography David Lewis just washing out the darkness with overflowing light that kills most of the outdoor scenes. The movie has a cult following which I can't figure out why?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this one after reading mostly positive reviews on this and other sites. It was said to have a little bit of Evil Dead mixed with Hell Night. If done right it could have been an excellent horror film. Unfortunately for me, it feel flat and was not nearly as good as I thought it would be.The story is about a group of rowdy teenagers on Halloween that decide to have a party in "Hull House", and old deserted funeral home where a few grisly murders took place years prior. Once they enter the property, two of the girls Suzanne and Angela become possessed. Whoever else they kill then turns into horrific looking demons. So on and so forth until there are only two teens remaining. The one good thing this movie has going for it is the gore/special effects. Really well done, especially the murder scenes which include tongue ripping and eye gouging.The acting is decent with Linnea Quigley leading the way. I did like the feel of the first twenty minutes or so of everyone trick or treating. It had a "Halloween" feel to it which was nice for a late eighties horror film. I think every horror fan should at least check this out. Some really like Night of the Demons, but I'm in the middle in terms of loving/hating it. It has it's creepy moments, especially when demon Angela stalks the teens through the dark corridors, but it really drags on a bit as well.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really depends on what you are looking for in a horror movie that will determine whether this movie is worth your while.If you are looking for a sleek, genuinely terrifying, atmospheric film with sophisticated suspense elements rather than cheap thrills, and an interesting and original plot complete with three dimensional characters whom we actually care about, then this movie is not for you. And this is the scale I used to rate the movie. Even Friday the 13th had an interesting back-story and a rather sophisticated bad-guy.But if you like campy, "a group of 80's teens spend the night in a haunted/deserted house", horror a la Evil Dead, then this movie is great! And on that scale, I would give it a 9/10.There are some genuinely creepy/kinky moments, and the flick is suitably atmospheric. And I thought the ghouls make-up was pretty great. I think my favorite part was that the one black guy didn't die and turned out to be pretty heroic even though he was the nerdiest/seemingly least courageous one in the bunch.

		<shortDescription>B-Grade fun &amp; actually pretty scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, don't watch this movie expecting a cinematic masterpiece. The movie is a low-budget, b-grade flick but really does a good job of actually coming across as scary. I first saw this movie late at night on Cinemax when I was in high school and it did a good job of making me jump more than once. Classic scenes include the bathroom death scene between the infamous Linnea Quigley, the Queen of Scream, and the guy from Heathers whose name escapes me at the moment and the final scene involving the old man and the apple pie.There were a few cheesy stereotypes, but what do you really expect from a movie of this grade? The stereotypical black kid running and hiding in terror like Buckwheat was the most obvious one. The "roll-in-the-hay" resulting in instant death was another one commonly seen in the Friday the 13th series. I was really glad that it broke other stereotypes though. Billy Gallo plays the arrogant ex-boyfriend, but winds up more the admired hero. The new love interest winds up being the jerk. Chalk one up for us heroic ex-boyfriends!I recognize Hal Havins, the guy who also appeared with Linnea Quigley in Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-Rama. He plays pretty much the same character in both flicks. I guess there aren't many roles for the heavy guy other than as an obnoxious deadmeat character.I have seen Night of the Demons 2, but can't recall having seen the third installment. This movie is worth the measly dollar or so you'll have to pay to rent it. A must see for fans of the genre. Non-horror fans will hate it, but hey... the movie wasn't made for them anyway, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing look at the slasher genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSI remember the first time I watched this movie; I was probably 14, sitting in my friends living room with a bunch of high school friends. Despite the witty quips that my fellow viewers made I was gripped by this movie from the beginning. I remember loving it, and being scared by it at the same time, but ultimately losing it in a sea of horror movies I watched that summer. Well a few years later i picked up the unrated version at a local video stores sell bin. Maybe it's just that I'm a big sucker for Halloween (the holiday, not the movies), but I think this movie has a lot of things going for it. The movie begins simply enough (after some great credit animation); a group of snotty arrogant, late 80's teens going to a creepy "haunted" ("I mean possessed!" slaps forehead) house to drink, dance and be teenagers. At this point I would like to stress the excellence of the house set. It is well made and feels authentically decrepit, musty and scary. The set's endless corridors, chilling parlor and barren grounds are easily half this movies atmosphere, and this movie would be much diminished if the sets were not as good as they are. From there the teens accidently let loose an ancient demon in the house that has haunted the land for a long time. One by one the teens die to said demon in appropriate fashions of blood and guts. Again i would like to stop here and praise the special effects, I wish they still made movies with effects like these, instead of what i consider to be inferior CG ones. It's movies like this that make the difference between the two obvious (as well as lending healthy ammo for Joe Liebermann's anti-violence in movies campaign). One of my few problems with this movie is the characters and their acting. The acting is a bit uneven, especially at the beginning, from Alice, the main heroine, and some of the peripheral characters. Luckily, most of the annoying ones are killed off in due time, and those left really begin to shine. This movie was very good at manipulating my emotions. At first i hated almost all the characters, but over time they metamorphisized. The sweet, protective boyfriend Jay was really nothing more than a sex-hungry jerk, the abrasive party animal becomes softer than he might have been thought as, and main character gets tough in the face of adversity. Two characters really shine, however. The first is Sal, a gangster talking Bronx kid who doesn't take any crap. At first he's rather annoying jerk of a character, but once the people start dying he steals the show. While trying to escape the house, he tries to warn the others left, and even tries to go head to head with the demons, all without losing his New York cool. His character is tough, competent and level headed, without seeming like a dumb stallone-type character and gives a lot to the movie. The other character I found myself cheering for was Roger, the obligatory skinny, religious African American of this horror movie. What Roger does is to distinguish himself here is (SPOILER) being one of the only smart horror movie characters ever. He chooses to leave the place before things begin to get really spooky, only getting trapped in place by bad luck. Throughout the movie he plays the scared young teen role to a T, playing it so well that at times you just want to step on the scream and hit the guy to make him snap out of the spook-induced hysteria. In the end this is a very low budget movie, that excels beautifully despite it's lack of budget, with several characters that are more compelling than many Hollywood productions and some really genuine scares. Definately worth a rent around Halloween if you're not too squeamish. -BDZ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I own the video to "Night of the Demons" and usually watch it in the autumn part of the season. I thought it had its moments with some of the demons possessing the party-goers. The house which appears like an old funeral home or closed down mansion, gives off an cold, mean-spirited aura. This of course adds to the dread that the movie heaves. The acting I might add is at times atrocious, but redeems itself by slick use of make-up and the claustrophobia of being closed in and around the darkened climate. There are quite a few eerie sequences going on, and you never know who may pop out, or who might be possessed. Its not the greatest horror spoof, but it works in ways than other cheap pile-ups. I would recommend this feature for those who want that Halloween spirit added to their thrills. Rated **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today, it looks pretty silly. But in 1988, NIGHT was scary enough to spark nightmares in many viewers. A group of young people break into an old house to party. The house has other ideas, and soon enough it is turning them into demons. The main demon is Angela, who does a hoochy coochy dance midway through (the actress was trained in ballet). The special effects are from hunger, but there's plenty of blood and gore. And atmosphere to spare. A fun and scary 1980s Halloween frighfest, although not on the same level as several other horror flicks of the period. If it were remade today, it would benefit from modern special effects but I doubt it would have the same impact. Horror movie queen Linnea Quigley is one of the possessed teens. While she can't act to save her life, she does some interesting things with a lipstick tube.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this after both sequels and thought it comfortably better than either, though still not amazing. The big problem, is that over half the movie passes before the gory shenanigans really kick in and this preceding half is full of 80's cheese rather than much suspense. The only upside of this is that it does make you really root for the demons in the second half, as the characters are unfunny and pretty pathetic The house is a good creepy place and the direction was quality, with some unusual angles and images. I think there's nudity from more or less all of the females in the cast, which is nice to see, especially from Linnea Quigley, whose use of a tube of lipstick is one of the most memorable moments. But like I said, the gore takes way too long to start and though it is very well done, as are all the effects, it's not too original and I certainly could have done with more of it. The acting and writing are as good as any other film of this type, as in not very good, apart from Amelia Kinkade as Angela (good dancing too), and Linnea Quigley, who is a classic horror actress. Gripes aside, this is still worth watching, probably best with beer and buddies. Its watchable and fun, less annoying than a lot of Eighties horror and the kills are sweet. I'd give it 6 out of ten if I didn't like the effects so much. So, worth a try for horror lovers, as it is something of a cult movie now just don't expect any wit or depth or scares.</fullReview>

Then of course they start to party and when they''re really in the mood they decide to have a séance which awakens a demon. The demon possesses Angela and she starts her gruesome slaughtering. Will they survive the Night of the Demons.The movie was overall great. The gore was fine but the nudity provided by Linnea Quigley (Trash from ROTLD) once again screws it.

		<fullReview>When I sat down to watch this I didn't expect a good movie, but judging from many reviews, I did expect an over-the-top gory cheese-fest. Unfortunately, this was not to be. The opening credits were awesome, I must say, by far one of my favourites. However, for the next forty minutes nothing interesting really happened. All the characters were introduced group by group, then they arrive at the funeral home and not much happens for awhile. The characters are not interesting, and the acting is appalling (although this is to be expected for an 80s demonic/slasher horror, these were exceptionally bad). When the teens start getting knocked off it gets slightly interesting, with some cool gore and a pretty kick-ass scene involving a tube of lipstick and Linnea Quigley's breast. And I must say the soundtrack was very good as well, but overall the movie was just average. The first half is filled with nothing interesting, and the last half has some good special effects and some creepy demon stalking scenes but it's not enough to make the movie worth recommending.2?/5</fullReview>

The Worst Acting I Have ever Seen, and It leaves us with a Big Question: Was this Supposed to be Scary, or Just Plain out Goofy? Still puzzles me, and always will. Worse than the Acting is the Obvious "Errors" (Watch Carefully what happens when the Mirror falls Down and you Will Laugh your Lungs out!) Terrible. I Give it 2 out of 10. People looking for Something Spooky should Try Renting "Bloody Murder".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to decide whether this movie suffers from crap dialogue or if it's just made to appear so by crap actors. In any case it suffers from storywriting which is mediocre at best.Although made in the late '80's, the first part of the movie plays like a 60's teenage screwball comedy (barring the absence of any actual humour), especially the part of the 'good girl', which is as annoying a Doris Day figure as you could hope/fear for, including the slightly whiny opposition to anything 'fun' her friends want to do. The net effect is, after a while you start to hope she'll bite it so you don't have to listen to her voice anymore.Some profanity and gratuitous nudity, plus some really 80's style clothing is your only clue that this movie was made in the 80's. Oh, and some pretty passable music, too.Storywise, it's pretty formulaic stuff. A bunch of horny (apart, obviously , from 'miss nice girl') teenagers decide to celebrate Halloween night by throwing a party in a haunted house. Partying and fornication ensues, along with an ill-advised 'seance' which kicks off the demonic possession spree which is the subject of the movie. After this, the only suspenseful part will be trying to guess in which order the characters will expire. You're sure not to care whether or not they will. The actors are so bad that becoming demons/zombies/dinner actually improves their performance somewhat, and the ridiculously cliché dialogue is so annoying that you squirm in your seat.Gorewise, this flick ain't nuthin' special, unless you think cheesy is kind of 'special'. For example, the demon head which occasionally appears is so screamingly fake that you wonder if it's a 5-year old trick-or-treating.This is not to say there's nothing enjoyable in the flick. Some of the music isn't half bad, and the first of our insipid Scooby gang to get possessed performs a marvelous and really sexy dance routine at one point, before she turns nasty.Also, and I don't know why, towards the very end of the flick, I actually managed to get somewhat involved. The suspense lacking in most of the movie made a late appearance, and I started to squirm out of unease instead of annoyance. Which is what a horror movie is supposed to do.Concequently, I cannot bring myself to give this movie a rock-bottom rating, since by some inexplicable miracle (I don't rule out being possessed by demons) I was actually a little creeped.Don't pay money to see it, though. It's hardly worth your time, yet alone hard cash. Watch it on YouTube while it's there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloodthirsty demons make for a great fun horror flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The eighties produced a lot of gory little horror flicks, most of them within the slasher sub genre - thus putting this film ahead of most of the rest of its ilk. Night of the Demons is something of a cross between the ultimate gore film, The Evil Dead; and haunted house-cum-slash flick Hell Night. Films like this usually feature a deranged/deformed madman as the lead bad guy; but here we have bloodthirsty demons, which is always more interesting than a lunatic if you ask me. There's also a lot of comedy in this film, and the first third of the movie could easily be the set up for a straight comedy film. But once the characters enter the central location; a sinister funeral home known as 'Hull House' - the film morphs into the horror film that you would expect given the title. The plot line is as simple as you'd expect it to be, and we follow a bunch of kids that decide to put on a Halloween party inside said funeral home. This turns out to be a bad idea, however, once it transpires that the house is possessed; and the demons start to inhabit the kids' bodies! Their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream...but finding the gate to the grounds isn't as easy as it sounds.The film's centrepiece is the Gothic mansion where the action takes place. This creaky old house makes for a great horror film location; the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this. Director Kevin Tenney shoots the house well, and a particularly good job is done of establishing the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and escape is difficult. The comedy towards the start of the film is generally very funny, and I was hoping it would keep up the laughs once the horror starts. The film does have its comedy moments when the kids enter Hull House, but it's never overly funny and it's obvious that horror is the film's main aim. Not that this is a problem; but the Night of the Demons could have been a lot better had it fused these elements properly. The characters are pretty much what you'd expect from this sort of film; but the acting suits the movie well, and it's clear that the young cast had a good time making this movie and it translates well to the screen. The effects are good in that they suit the film well, and as most of the death sequences are well executed; it's a good bet that most people won't get bored watching this. This isn't a classic or must see film; but I can highly recommend it as it offers a good time and will appeal to fans of silly horror fodder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This night is rather fun at times, but ruined by a couple of things too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part I enjoyed this film about a night spent in an old funeral home. There is a party there on Halloween night and a bunch of teens are invited. We are introduced to them, the usual horror style, though I did so thoroughly enjoy the introduction to the good girl, who bared her backside for the camera. She had a very lovely backside too, shame we only get to see it once, but I declare it the nicest one of the movie. Yes, you are going to see some nice nudity as all the females in this movie are very pretty and all of them show some skin with the exception of the one who freaks out the most and seems smart in that she wants to get the heck out of there. She is also the least established of the group and we hardly get to know her as she meets her demise off camera. Yes, people are going to die as a force erupts from the basement of this old funeral home and begins to take possession of the party goers and kill them! The two main problems now are for one thing the acting is horrible. Linnea Quigley is in this one, you may know her better as the gal who danced naked on a tombstone in "Return of the Living Dead" is probably the best actress on display here. That is not saying much though. Like I said the girls are all hot and now that I think about it Angela never got naked at all either, but she does do a very nice dance in the film. The second problem, it takes way to long for something to happen and there just is not enough kill fodder in this movie. It has ten people, but it needed more considering the possession angle. It is a lot like the film "Demons" the Italian film, but that one has this one beat in that it had a whole movie theater full of people to kill and once the demons mayhem began it was nonstop. This one is stop and go with to much lead up. Still, overall I enjoyed it, just needed a bit more people to kill and the killing should have happened quicker. Granted, more nudity would have been cool too. So it was an okay experience, I just think the film it seems to be copying a bit "Demons" is the better flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit too slow before the gore appears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Tenney, the director is a well known name in the genre. His second feature was this flick but he had fame already with Witchboard. But I know the man for his Brain Dead flick from 2007. That was a great independent flick. After Witchboard he gave us Night of the Demons. That movie was available here in our country for a while but somehow I wasn't attracted to the sleeve of the DVD. Years later when it became an OOP in Europe in his full uncut version it was time to search the full uncut version. Easy target, you go to the states and it's available in most shops. The movie is famous for one lead actress, Linnea Quickly. When she appears in a movie you know what you will get, boobies. First of all, it was a slow builder. It takes almost 1 hour before it all really starts. It's all about knowing each other and doing funny things. The usual stuff. Once they woke the evil spirits it all breaks loose. Before that we have Linnea showing her underwear, bend over, in a shop. The zoom is slowly so for the w**kers out there this is your shot. Second thing we have is a dance on Bauhaus' Stigmata Martyrs. It takes a bit too long, almost the whole song is used for the dance. Beautiful song, great band. But as said, once the demons arise Linnea has to paint her naked breasts with lipstick. This is one of those scene's that has been cut out in the European edition. Especially the moment the lipstick disappears in her nipple is famous in the genre. Only available in the uncut version. Further on Linnea is possessed by the evil spirit, and yes, she has to show her pubic hair full frontal. You see, I am talking about the gratuitous nudity instead of the horror. And that's a bit the problem with this movie. While it takes an hour before the eyeball gouging (cut out in Europe), tongue ripping and bloody dismemberment starts it's a bit too late. The last half hour is indeed a bit gory. If you are really into Linnea than here she shows all her...body but the movie fails a bit in delivering the blood. Still, for the real collectors it is one to have, the full uncut on Anchor Bay, like mine, before it really becomes an OOP as here in Europe.</fullReview>

It may not shake the genre to the foundations, but it is worth a watch and easy to see why a couple of sequels were made. This is one of my favorite Linnea Quigley movies as well. We are introduced to her a** as it sways back and forth, keeping two guys attentions away from her food stealing friend. Miss Quigley has several good scenes including: the "that's my bush" scene, the "see Judy run scene", and the super creepy lipstick in the nipple scene. Amelia Kinkade is creepy as well and a good dancer. The annoying fat guy is, well, annoying and fat. A fun Halloween movie with some memorable scenes of nudity and dismemberment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a party put together by the high school "scary girl." Per the illogic of these sorts of films, she gets permission to hold the party at a house which used to be a crematorium, a dubious place long shut down and locked up. Apparently the history of this piece of property is one of those town secrets best left unspoken of among proper folk though the legend does get whispered about among the young.Why was this crematorium really shut down? What actually happened there in the past?I like these kill-kill-kill films of a supernatural nature as long as there is something in them not copied from a hundred other films. The highlights of this film are a petty theft "7-11" robbery by distracting the clerk with a vivid view, the changing clothes scene by the "good girl" witnessed by her jerk younger brother, the eventual demise of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday, the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water being a barrier against the supernatural; the best part of this film is when the possessed party sponsor dances to BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace; that scene rocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>28 minutes. That's how long it takes for anything to happen here. Perhaps the demons were on strike. Socialist demons.If you're immune to cretinous dialogue and amateurish over-acting you will not be bothered by the extreme 80s cheese that seeps out of this movie's every hole. Take any random John Waters film ? that's how bad the dialogue and the facial contortions are.Worse yet, the cardinal horror-film sin is committed by wasting no less than the first 28 minutes on absolutely nothing. Exactly ZERO things happen in the first half hour. We have mind-yawningly dull introductions to characters that need as much explaining as the plot of a Roadrunner cartoon. It's endless moronic exchanges between the cardboard teens, lines that could have been used in a school play, if only even the worst of schools would lower their criteria that much.The demons sure took their sweet time in demonizing the film. Hence I would rename the movie to "One-Third Of A Night Of The Demons". The other parts of the night weren't theirs at all; they belong to the dilettante actors who had their 15 minutes of fame by appearing in this forgettable turkey. These sloppy demons could have claimed the whole night for themselves, hence making it more fun for the viewer, but the producers had budget restrains to consider ? not to mention those essential intros to the complex teen characters. So both we and the demons had to wait for our turn. It isn't easy being either a demon or a viewer when facing these teens.On the positive side, four of the five girls are cute or cute-ish. On the flip-side of THAT, all 4 of the 4 exposed breasts are siliconally-challenged, the first 2 being so awful to look at (a truly botched job, 80s beginners presumably) that I had to fast-forward. I am referring of course to the scene in which the red-head puts lipstick on her totally deformed, small, formless chemical balls. She calls them "breasts". I prefer to call them "mutated piles of asymetric flesh". Much more gruesome than any murder committed by the demons. Fittingly, she becomes a demon herself.Additionally, NOTD is visually surprisingly solid. Strange, given that nearly everything else sucks, and that the movie hails from the visually worst American film period, the late 80s. The special effects and make-up are quite good, too. But somehow it's all too little too late, not to mention seen-it-all-before (even in '88).Watch for the "Bonded By Blood" Exodus car-sticker. Speaking of which, I've always been against metal and hard rock being used in horror films; the two simply don't mesh well. A hard rock soundtrack, especially one as worthless as this, only serves to further sink the movie deeper into the B-movie mud from which it had sprung. The hard rock stuff is mostly early on. Later, when the demons FINALLY arise, the rock music is replaced by the typical dimestore-keyboard 80s "horror" music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much more than ANY other film from that period, Night of the Demons represents the brainless and hugely enjoyable horror pastiche. It's undemanding fun with loads of nasty make-up effects, gorgeous looking (and horny) teenagers and adorable cliché-elements. A group of party animals, led by the alternative Angela, goes to celebrate Halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an eerie urban legend. It all starts out typical and "innocent" with dancing, drinking and the occasional flirt between youngsters that can't keep their hormones under control, but pretty soon a bloodthirsty demon possesses the hostess. In the most ingenious ways you've ever seen, the rest of the cast gets slaughtered viciously only to return as hideous creatures prowling for blood. The thing that makes this film better than most cheesy 80's horror films is finds a good balance between light-headed camp and atmospheric horror. Some sequences really are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies Night of the Demons with an excellent tone. Director Tenney makes great use of the set pieces (coffins, a crematorium, endless dark hallways?) and his young, enthusiast cast obviously love what they're involved in. The terrific make-up effects by a whole team of artists and designers are of course the obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics will absolutely love the large amount of severed limbs, poked out eyes and crushed skulls! The ultimate highlight however is Linnea Quigley's trick with the disappearing lipstick! This nymphomaniac bimbo shoves an entire tube of lipstick in her nipple and continues her sexual murder spree! Terrific! Night of the Demons received two sequels during the 90's and, although they're still definitely worth checking out, they focus more on comedy than chills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this I thought bits of it were fairly scary. But the horror is a little undermined by the fact that the dozy teenagers are so irritating that you don't really care what happens to them. There are some genuinely good moments such as Angela's speech about demons, and the briefly-seen demon itself is effective. But this really doesn't stand up to repeated viewing or close analysis. It's all pretty tacky and cheap-looking and often downright silly, pornography and unfunny wisecracks all too often replacing horror. The music is excellent, however, and the epilogue is certainly amusing, but this film doesnt have much to recommend it, just comes across as another Jason-type stalk-and-slash fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen! 90 Minutes of excruciating film-making. All the ingredients to make this movie a true work of CRAP. Bad acting, bad directing, bad storytelling, bad makeup, bad dialogue, bad effects, and bad reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters. It also threw in a terrible naked shot of a dumb blond, and a breast shot of a stupid Asian girl, and both attempts were just scary, since these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies came out of the 80s, but this could never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in storytelling: he introduced characters at the end of the movie (an Old Man and Old Woman). I would vote for it below a 1 out of 10 but the voting system doesn't work that way apparently. Right from the title sequence I knew it would suck and I would return my DVD but Best Buy doesn't refund DVDs, or consumable products as they call it, or so my receipt says. I have "The Dunwich Horror" and that was truly god-awful, but I still feel that "Night of the Demons" (an obvious Evil Dead RIP-OFF) was far worse than "Dunwich Horror." This is just like "The Howling," how in the hell could sequels get milked out of this anorexic cow??? Save your money and get the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (just don't get any of its sequels though) or "The Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead." "Night of the Demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. Every second of it was just maddening, excruciating pain for the audience, because the whole movie all-around was horrible! Do yourself a favor, DON'T SEE IT!

It's an obvious low-budget one, that also didn't spend too much time on a good original script or try to get some decent actors for the parts. But once the horror finally kicks in you sort of tend to forget the movie its poor writing and acting, as well as its lacking directing and editing. It simply becomes more of an enjoyable movie to watch, with also some good looking make-up effects.But it really takes awhile for the movie to finally take off. The first half of the movie is slow but above all things completely uninteresting to watch. Guess it was to introduce it's characters and all (and it even does this very well at all) and to simply kill some time becomes the movie else wouldn't have enough material to make a full length movie out off.It's far from a great or impressive movie but at least I could still somewhat enjoy it, during its second half at least.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of kids decide to have a party in old Hall manor on Halloween which was the location of a massacre by the proprietor many years previous. They decide to turn it up a notch for the sake of holiday spirit and have a séance using a mirror which could hold everyone's reflection. What they don't know is that their little séance DOES unleash a demonic force of some kind that enters through the mouth of slutty Suzanne(Linnea Quigley who is scorching)who then spreads it to goth pal Angela(Amelia Kinkade who has a show-stopping "dance of the damned" sequence in the film). Soon the slaughter begins with various characters running for their lives through this frigid, ancient, decrepit manor trying to flee those taken over by demons. Rodger(Alvin Alexis)and Helen(Allison Barron)ultimately become the prey. Helen is the stereotypical pure and innocent virgin.In the vein of films like CHOPPING MALL, acting and dialogue this bad(..over-expressed, heightened emoting with extra emphasis on delivering corny dialogue loudly)had to be intentional and encouraged. You don't even know the meaning of obnoxious until you've seen Hal Havins' very annoying, boisterous character Stooge. I thought it was very reminiscent of THE EVIL DEAD, especially the creepy demonic make-up work and how the camera travels(the camera represents the demonic force which enters Quigley much the same way as that force which attacks Bruce Campbell at the end of THE EVIL DEAD)through doors and down halls. The manor, full of cobwebs, dust &amp; darkness with hints of dense light, makes up quite an effectively eerie place and there's enough gruesome bits to provide the thirst of starving gore-hounds.The film's saving grace is that it never takes itself seriously.</fullReview>

This movie attempts to be funny some of the time, but it's only in dialogue. It has its good points (very few), and the story keeps you interested only to see what dumb thing happens next. You won't believe how retarded this movie gets at times. Definitely not a film to take even REMOTELY serious there were, unfortunately, two sequels made, both of which are worse than the first. Despite all the negative points this movie has (I would say 78% cheese) I still found myself compelled to watch the whole thing. Do yourself a favor: Only watch this is you are EXTREMELY bored and want to watch something cheesy (or, to see the famous lipstick scene which IS truly amazing). It doesn't bore you, but it makes you wonder what the hell happened to such a cool idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Demons (1988) ** (out of 4) It's Halloween night so ten kids go to a creepy former funeral home to have a party but soon they unlock a wicked demon, which slowly kills each of them while transforming them into demons as well. This film has become a cult favorite over the past decade or so and while watching the movie I could see why people would love it. There's certainly an 80s feel to it. There some violence, blood and nudity. We get a wide range of stereotype characters. We've got a rock soundtrack. NIGHT OF THE DEMONS has just about everything you'd expect out of an 80s horror film so why didn't I like it? I think it just runs out of gas around the half way mark and I really struggled to make it to the end. I am curious to know how much Lamberto Bava's DEMONS served as an influence on this movie but I think that Italian film is a masterpiece and this one here falls well short. One of the problems is that the horror elements of the movie aren't nearly as strong as they should be. The first thirty-minutes of the movie features some pretty funny stuff including our "good girl" and her brother who is constantly talking about her big boobs. The introduction to the teens was pretty funny as well as they're all quite likable and we get to have some nice fun with them including Linnea Quigley's character in the grocery store bending over and showing her behind. The film doesn't shy away from the nudity, which is one good thing. Fans of cult favorite Quigley will see plenty of her including the now famous sequence between her lipstick and nipple. I saw a photo of this in a Fangoria issue when I was young so I was really looking forward to the sequence in the film and it more than lived up to its hype. Again, the young cast are good enough for their roles and they at least bring their characters to life. When the horror stuff does start it really bored me because there wasn't anything going on that we hadn't seen in countless other movies. There wasn't any suspense and even the gore wasn't all that impressive. This is certainly far from a bad movie but at the same time it certainly disappointed me so if you're looking for a movie with demons then check out the Bava flick.</fullReview>
