		<shortDescription>Magnificent adaptation of Bromfield</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredible special effects, a solid story, beautiful directing, and marvelous acting are the highlights of "The Rains Came," another movie from that famous year in film-making, 1939. Its stars are Tyrone Power, Myrna Loy, George Brent, Brenda Joyce, and Maria Ouspenskaya. A bored Loy and her disagreeable wealthy older husband, portrayed by Nigel Bruce, are in Ranchipur, India when the rains and an earthquake hit. Loy, whose husband keeps a list of her lovers, once had a fling with Brent. Then she gets a gander at Power who plays Major Rama Safti, a doctor highly regarded by the rulers of Ranchipur. One look at him, and there's no sense in treading over old territory. Despite Power's apparent lack of interest, Loy falls madly in love with him, even volunteering at the hospital after the disaster.I was completely captivated by this film, particularly in light of the recent Katrina horror. The flooding, the destroyed homes, demonstrated by brilliant special effects, the orphaned children, the need for volunteers, were all too familiar.Two love stories go on during the rains - one between Brent and the lovely Fern, portrayed by Brenda Joyce, and the other between Power and Loy. Both romances are unbelievably tender - with very little actual physical contact shown.Loy gives a compelling performance as a haughty, spoiled woman who is suddenly consumed by love. When I read the book, one thing I remember is that the character just screamed Lana Turner and sure enough, she did the role in the remake. But Loy makes it her own. The studios didn't like their leading men to do accents, so Power, in dark makeup as the "Copper Apollo" so described by Loy, has none. He is handsome as ever until one sees him without his turban. Then, in closeup, he describes to Loy how he came to love her, and his face is beyond breathtaking. His monologue is beautifully done, as is his essaying of the character's conflict of love versus responsibility. This is one of his finest performances, and no camera ever loved an actor like it did Tyrone Power. George Brent, usually not commanding enough, does fine under Brown's direction in his role as a man with no purpose in life who finally finds one. Tiny Maria Ouspenskaya gives a strong performance.The only thing I didn't like was that Loy had to pay for her sins (i.e., slutty behavior) and of course, Brent did not.Like the rains of Ranchipur, India, "The Rains Came" will sweep the viewer away. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Filmization of Bromfield Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this film over 20 times and never fail to be completely captivated by its power as film and the performances of the actors. The sets are opulent, yet capture the spirit and essence of colonial India in "transition". The photography and editing are excellent and create an exceptional tempo that carries all the interwoven emotional textures in the story. Myrna Loy as Lady Esketh gives what I consider to be the best performance of a actress. She completely captures the world-weary Lady Esketh and her re-discovery of spirit and soul she thought long lost. Her death scene is profound and touching. Tyrone Power is gorgeous as the "Copper Apollo" who brings Loy to "life". His conflict between loving Loy and the demands of his "duty" to Ranchipur India come across clearly in a subtle performance. The special effects won an oscar -- I believe the film was nominated for 7 oscars altogether. Why this film is over-looked is a mystery. 1939 was a big year and this film deserves more attention and acknowledgement. A wonderful score takes the emotions even deeper. I've read the book several times and this film definitely satisfies this reader.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the unique things about this film is that for once a British Raj story is told not from a British point of view. It should never be forgotten that John Bromfield was an American. You would never see a character like Nigel Bruce in any British screenplay about the Raj. Of all the supporting players, he comes off best in what has to be the most unusual part in his career. For those used to seeing him as the ineffectual Dr. Watson in those Sherlock Holmes movies, playing the bigoted Lord Esketh is quite a switch.Not until A Passage to India was filmed in the 80s was the Raj ever shown in a less than perfect light.Ty Power is his usual noble self, the rest of the cast plays well. Twentieth Century Fox borrowed two big names from other studios, Myrna Loy from MGM and George Brent from Warner Brothers to support Power. Loy is Lady Esketh, a woman of the world, left pretty much to her own devices by her husband, decides Power would be a perfect boy toy for her. The part is a throwback to Loy's earlier days of playing mostly bad girls before The Thin Man.Brent has a very nice role her as a man who's living a dissolute life himself in India, but really steps to the plate during the time of crisis when the flooding starts.H.B. Warner and Maria Ouspenskaya play the rulers of Ranchipur, you will not forget Ouspenskaya easily. Nor will you forget first the cultured, than the wailing Joseph Schildkraut as Bannerjee. Today no producer could ever get away with casting all these occidental types as Indians, but they all do a fine job. In the year of Gone With The Wind and all the Oscars it won, the one for Special Effects went to The Rains Came, beating out Gone With The Wind's burning of Atlanta. Judge for yourself if the Academy voters were right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Fox' better efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made the year of the really great movies of the Golden Years of Hollywood, "The Rains Came" was a quite remarkable achievement in 1939 - the photography and Special Effects (Flood and Earthquake) were extremely well done, and stand up quite well today. It was made in an era where Stars were the keys to a movie's success, and Fox brought together some big names for this Blockbuster. Heading the Cast is Tyrone Power as Major Safti, and he is perfect for the role, while Myrna Loy as Lady Esketh is well cast. George Brent had his best role ever, and the supporting cast included such gems as Maria Ouspenskaya, Nigel Bruce, Jane Darwell, Henry Travers and Joseph Shildkraut and believe me , these people do so much in adding to the quality of this film. The difference between Indian and Western cultures during the period of the Raj was well captured, and altogether moves along at a good pace, and makes for excellent entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Earthquake and Flood Scenes In a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think of the year - 1939. It was 'THE' year for Hollywood with all the great movies that came out. But the utmost highest quality of the special effects in this movie had me spellbound. You must watch it and try to absorb the enormity of the effects required while still being pulled into the story line. The actual story showcases the messy relationships and personalities experienced in real life. You see, the really great movies do not need showings of sex, cursing, or intentional violence from man against man. The really great movies are eloquently written and offered without defilement - so different from most of the movies of today.Enjoy every minute! Myrna Loy - in a dramatic role so different from the Thin Man jovial series! With aloha ~ KonaRose</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was eight years old when I saw this movie. It was the first movie I remember seeing. My mother says that initially I refused to go into the movie theater because it was a dark, and to me, forbidding place. Once inside, however, I didn't want to leave. I have never seen the movie since, but the images of flooding and sick people under mosquito nets are as vivid to me as if I had seen it yesterday. I also have memories of being put through an emotional wringer by the film, thinking it was "real" and crying at the death and destruction it portrayed. The total effect was to hook me on movies for good and I could hardly wait to get back into that dark, engrossing place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing redeems the reputation of a "fallen" woman like natural disaster or illness. Just ask Greta Garbo in "The Painted Veil", Elizabeth Taylor in "Elephant Walk" or Eleanor Parker in "The Naked Jungle" and "The Seventh Sin". Audiences love to see a woman who has slid slightly off the moral track win back approval by pitching in during the aftermath of a plague or an earthquake, even if, in some cases, she doesn't make it herself! Here Loy is the unfulfilled wife of a stodgy British lord who comes to India to buy horses and runs into a former lover (Brent.) Though she dallies briefly with him, it isn't long before a handsome Indian doctor (Power) catches her eye and so she sets her sights on that prize. This doesn't sit well with the Maharani (Ouspenskaya) who has high hopes for Power as a future leader of her country. Meanwhile, an antsy, curvy, teen (Joyce) has her eye on Brent, to the quasi-dismay of her missionary parents. As the social and romantic entanglements play out, the rains of the monsoon season begin to fall. Then an earthquake rips apart an ominously placed dam and the entire area is flooded. What the water doesn't kill, a plague threatens to. The formerly selfish and self-involved survivors volunteer their aid in the hopes of redemption. This works out better for some than for others. Loy isn't always lit as beautifully here as she was at her home studio of MGM, but manages to look quite lovely during most of her scenes. She gives a knowing and well thought out portrayal. One of her evening gowns (a chiffon number with a jewel-encrusted scarf) is a real knockout. It's a bit raunchier role than she was doing during the height of her fame and she handles it nicely. She has one striking scene as she relieves a collapsing hospital attendant and her final scene is memorable, too. Power has a surprisingly small role for most of the film. Covered in "brownface", he has a puzzling Clark Gable mustache and makes no attempt at an Indian accent, though that may be a good thing. He gives a solid, but unremarkable performance, though he does look handsome, especially near the end when his hair is revealed. Brent is enjoyable in his ne'er do well role with one particularly amusing line as he's about to escort Loy to a stuffy party. Never an earth-shattering actor, he does better than usual in this film. He does become rather unintentionally funny as he swims through the storm-tossed water, though. Joyce is attractive and alluring in her film debut, though obviously a bit unseasoned. The ever-impish Ouspenskaya effortlessly steals most of the scenes she appears in. A nice dose of fine character actors including Bruce, Schildkraut, Darwell, Rambeau, Warner and especially Hope Crews help to enliven the earlier part of the film. Sadly, most of these folks are scarcely or never seen after the big event. The credits for this film are inventive and striking, even now more than half a century later. The direction is sure-handed. The music, as is nearly always the case with Alfred Newman, is solid. The real attraction, though, is the chance to see some early special effects which still hold up reasonably well. Three or four decades later, the disaster would BE the point of the movie, but in this age, the story of the characters was still the attraction and the catastrophes were either a story point or a climactic event (see "San Francisco", "Green Dolphin Street", "In Old Chicago") causing changes in the characters' lives. This was remade rather glossily and in color with Lana Turner, Richard Burton and Fred MacMurray, but the original remains the one with the edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>High gloss drama with first class special effects. In fact the film was the winner of the first Oscar given for special effects. Myrna somewhat surprisingly plays at least in the beginning a selfish slut, a high class slut but a slut nonetheless, redeemed by love and hardship. Tyrone Power although not at all believable as an Indian is capable and sincere and almost supernaturally beautiful. Even the customarily stolid George Brent after some initial stiffness is better and more relaxed than usual. Excellent production values and a first rate supporting cast make this an entertaining winner. Another classy enterprise from that golden year of 1939.Remade in color, but with a lot of the guts cut out, as the Rains of Ranchipur with Lana Turner and Richard Burton. That version is an okay time filler but this one is superior in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, disaster, melodrama, colonial India in the rains!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rains Came (1939)At first I thought this was a post-war movie, which would make it a post-Independence movie for India from the British. And since the story starts in 1938, the events would seem to lead to that huge turnover, told Hollywood style. That was fine with me.But no, and even better. Instead we have a pure drama that happens to be set in troubled India. World War II isn't even a fact for the film or the filmmakers, so the colonial feeling is quite sincere, and easy to poke a little fun at. In fact, the movie begins by making clear the snobbery of the British ruling elite, the women who want only the finest friends and the men who want only their frivolous jobs. The natives, the Indians themselves, have only a small presence, and the two Indian leaders are played by non-Indians, as was unfortunately usual for Hollywood at the time.The drama starts slowly, and even when Myrna Loy finally appears (and she is terrific enough to make an instant difference) the actual story still winds its slow way along. George Brent as the leading man always colors a film because he's easy going and likable to the point of calmness, which can easily become dullness. Still, he's rock steady and I like him. And Tyrone Power, who as the devastating good looks to upend things, is kept in a reserved and steady role, too, playing an Indian doctor with clearly British training. There is a fourth main character, more of a cliché of sorts but important to the story, an overly young blonde and naive girl just over eighteen who wants Brent in every way. And seems by the middle flood scenes to get him where he is best got.Yes, this is a love melodrama set in steamy, rainy, exotic India. As a drama it's good, though lacking some kind of drive to make it chilling or weepy or whatever might send it over the top. But there are aspects here that are really exceptional. One of them is the stunning job on the earthquake and flood scenes. Special effects being completely physical back then, it's astonishing how realistic it all is. There is some back projection, but no retouching or double exposure that I could see, and no computer graphics of course, just elaborate models and slow motion to fool you about the scale of everything. But beyond the feat of pulling it off is just the aesthetic handling of movement and space as the world crumbles, literally.The scenes that follow the devastation are in flood stage with continuing rain, and it's pretty good stuff. And of course there's something of a metaphor to it all, the outsiders (mostly British, but some Americans, who of course don't have quite the same classist attitudes) feel just how outside they are. There is always, for them, the possibility to just leave, and a few no doubt do, but mostly people knuckle down and help with the disaster relief. Loy has been bored and spoiled until now, and she helps at the hospital, partly to be with the searing doctor. And Brent ends up helping, too (which we expect--he's a good guy) and his young hanger-on sticks to his side, maturing quickly."The English are an odd people," the Indian maharani says, and nothing is more true. There they are, these colonialists, sticking it out through really awful times, helping and and suffering equally. Yes, they have pampered lives compared to the common person there, but it's no picnic, the heat and disease and hardship. Toward the end Brent persuades Power to rise up from his sadness. You were "...born in the darkness and filth that was India. You are India. A new India!" This is a movie about rising up in general, being better, forgetting differences and also forgetting selfishness.The director Clarence Brown has a handful of really terrific films in his career, and this one shows why--it's subtle and beautiful and also a bit epic in its own way. It's also gorgeously filmed, from the devastation to the smallest intimacies, all under the eye of Arthur Miller, a legend in cinematography already, and with some classics to come as well. Although meant to be filmed without flashy distraction, it's handled with enormous grace and depth. It's classy and classic stuff. And the music is typically dramatic and scored to follow the action by another great, Alfred Newman.The chilling and beautiful opening titles that melt off each page in a dripping wash give a clue of what is to follow, with an ominousness latent throughout. Then, toward the end, after surviving catastrophe, a simple mistake, and a realization that time is short, and the drama becomes a weepy tragedy. It doesn't get any better than that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All that a wonderful movie should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only seen it for the first time but one can sense it's a great film and has everything one can look for in an excellent story. I settled into it instantly. Vaguely it reminded me of Somerset Maugham's exotic tales of the white man dwelling in far-flung, remote lands.At the beginning there is a lot of erratic misplaced feelings but eventually romance enters the lives of those who least expect it.When I saw the floods I too thought of the tsunami tragedy a few years ago, quite a reminder even though this movie dates back more than five decades, the realities of life's tragedies, both human and the natural disaster kind are much the same as ever.Most other viewer's comments have already given the details of the story so I needn't repeat everything here. It was a surprise to note how well George Brent did in his acting ability for this role, very well done, in my opinion.Have actually bought the book too and plan on reading it very soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way ahead of it's time, beautiful cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of what I have to say about this film has already been said, so I will not repeat it. Here are some (I think) original thoughts.If this film were released a year before or a year after 1939 I am guessing it would have swept the Oscars. Being released the same year as "Gone With The Wind" kept that from happening. The one Oscar it won (for best special effects) was richly deserved. In fact, the effects in GWTW during the burning of Atlanta are no where near as good. Way ahead of it's time. In fact, I think the entire film was ahead of it's time by at least 20 years. The black and white cinematography made a major contribution to the overall emotional impact. Very creative use of lighting, and each frame is like a painting. It should have gotten the Oscar for that. The direction and the acting was subtle and very layered. I was especially impressed by the staging of the Myrna Loy's character's death. Most of the Hollywood death scenes at that time involve the character closing his eyes and turning his head. Very heavy handed and not very realistic. I will not spoil it for you but watch how understated it is. Occasionally the acting is over the top, but as a whole it is restrained and totally right for the material.Music is used sparingly unlike GWTW where it is wall to wall. Don't get me wrong, I love the music in that film and it is just right for it. But in The Rains Came a lighter touch is called for. And it gets it.It seemed that everyone involved in this was aware that it would be released the same year as GWTW and knew that this film had to be on a par with it. GWTW was pretty much of it's time but The Rains Came was a preview of how great films would be made in the 1950's and 1960's. The only thing that did not ring true for me was the casting of Tyrone Power as an Indian native. Even with the dark make-up he is just plain wrong. Add to that that he does not even attempt an accent! Everyone else seems just right. Newcomer Brenda Joyce is particularly good and stunningly beautiful as well.The idea of casting a love story (2 love stories really) against significant events in history was not original even in 1939, but I can think of only a few films that did it better. One of those was A Passage to India, a film that echos the style and setting of The Rains Came.I wish someone would do a remake of this. I think the material begs for it.A very unusual production for it's time and well worth a look. I could even see it as being made in say 1963. Very modern and polished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old-Fashioned Exotic Melodrama with a Smoldering Loy and Special Effects That Still Impress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the same high-watermark year that saw the burning of Atlanta in "Gone With the Wind" and Dorothy's house spinning perilously in a tornado in "The Wizard of Oz", this little-seen 1939 romantic melodrama won the first Oscar ever awarded to a film for Best Special Effects. Seventy years later, the earthquake-to-flood sequence still holds up impressively, even in the age of CGI programming with a surprisingly seamless combination of models, mattes and huge dump tanks. The artistry of Fox effects whiz Fred Sersen's work is worth slogging through the first fifty minutes of archaic set-up. Directed by MGM veteran Clarence Brown ("The Yearling"), the story would appear to have the makings of a romantic triangle given the three leads, but it actually consists of two contrasting love stories.Set in colonial India at its most exotic (although filmed entirely on the studio back lot), one thread centers on Tom Ransome, an aging, alcoholic British playboy pursued by Fern Simon, the love-struck daughter of local missionaries. The other is the forbidden romance that develops between Lady Edwina Esketh, the adulterous British wife of a pompous horse breeder and Major Rama Safti, a Hindu doctor devoted to his homeland. The calamitous disaster obviously veers all four off course as they find themselves re-evaluating their feelings for one another until fate steps in and decides for them. The second love story is obviously a metaphor for the diminishing hold Britain had on India in the years prior to Mahatma Gandhi's rise as the leader of the burgeoning republic. However, the May-December romance between Ransome and Fern initially follows a "Lolita"-esque course that offsets the balance of the film. Course correction comes with the unusually well-cast principals.Usually playing warm-hearted wives both scrappy ("The Thin Man") and noble ("The Best Years of Our Lives"), Myrna Loy surprises with a sexy, assured performance as Lady Edwina. She cuts a diaphanous figure as a voracious temptress and transitions convincingly to a woman desperate for moral redemption. It's a shame Loy had so few opportunities to show this uncensored side of her talent. Ridiculously handsome, Tyrone Power doesn't look remotely Indian even with a turban and constant tan. During the matinée idol phase of his career, he lacked depth and nuance, for example, take note of his embarrassing bad breakdown scene late in the film. However, he is obviously here for eye candy, and Loy's lustful glances are well justified in this regard.Perhaps because he is not playing opposite the vivid fieriness of constant co-star Bette Davis ("Dark Victory"), the usually bland George Brent is terrifically engaging as Ransome. I have to admit his witty banter with Loy held my interest far more than the concealed passion between her and Power. For better or worse, Brenda Joyce brings a strangely off-kilter dimension to Fran. Several great recognizable character actors fill the supporting parts, a few playing purely Hollywood versions of exotics - Jane Darwell, Henry Travers, H.B. Warner, Marjorie Rambeau, Joseph Schildkraut ? though none makes a more vivid impression than Maria Ouspenskaya ("Dodsworth", "Love Affair") as the worldly wise Maharani with her dangling cigarette holder. The print transfer on the 2005 Fox Studios Classic DVD is impressively pristine. There is a chatty commentary track from film aficionados Anthony Slide and Robert S. Birchard, a gallery of stills, and the original theatrical trailer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great spectacle, weak drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rains Came is one of the less successful examples of the genius of the studio system. Part of the 30s vogue for disaster movies (San Francisco, In Old Chicago), the violence of the spectacle is truly impressive when the earthquakes and floods hit at the halfway point, but the human drama is less engaging, partially due to a plethora of weak characters that it's hard to care about in too many tired scenes that don't catch fire. Too much of the film is carried by George Brent's dissolute ex-pat fending off Brenda Joyce's advances, while an unflatteringly shot Myrna Loy is too self-centred to care for. Tyrone Power's noble Indian doctor almost seems an afterthought, getting surprisingly little screen time (presumably in case he kisses a white woman and gives the censors a coronary), although there is some novelty value in Nigel Bruce playing Loy's genuinely unpleasant husband (a match almost as unlikely as H.B. Warner and Maria Ouspenskaya's Maharajah and Maharani).The Region 1 DVD is extras-lite for a Fox Classics release - an enjoyable audio commentary, poor reissue trailer (that almost completely ignores the spectacle) and brief stills gallery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An extremely well photographed, edited and cast exotic romance,it holds your interest for the entire 103 minutes yet only certain facets, such as the urgency of the monsoon photography and some particularly compelling scenes for Myrna Loy and Maria Ospenskaya truly offer memorable movie going. The plot line of flawed characters arriving in an exotic land to then redeem themselves in grace may seem dated today,but was fairly popular in many melodramas of this Hollywood era. This aspect is done well but certainly no better than in other films of the time period. Definitely worth owning the DVD if this era of Hollywood is your bag, but is not the truly finest work of a Hollywood year spanning GONE WITH THE WIND and REBECCA.</fullReview>

To let you know HOW amazing the effects were, in this category, THE RAINS CAME beat out GONE WITH THE WIND and its amazing burning of Atlanta! It was THAT good and worth seeing just for this segment. As for the rest of the story, it's okay--not great. It reminds me a lot of the movie JEZEBEL--completed just a year earlier. Both feature a female lead who is spoiled but who eventually prove themselves and both end up with similar fates. George Brent is excellent though it's odd to see Tyrone Power in the role of an Indian--with no trace of an Indian accent! Mr. Power does NOT do a whole lot to impress the audience with his acting range, but he looks nice in a suit. All in all, the story seems a tad familiar and pretty ordinary, but certainly not bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rains Came - One of the absolutely top films of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this film on TV growing up in the 60's and was as impressed with it as my mother had been. Besides a marvelous cast, superb special effects and a haunting romance, the film ably entices the viewer.Today, many years later, I find myself really loving the movie more than I ever had. Somehow I had never really seen the depth of romance between Lady Esketh (Myrna Loy) and the handsome Major Safti (Tyrone Power) she comes to love. The story of that love is subtly expressed in music at first when Rama Safti brings her attention to an Indian love song and translates it for her. The song is sublimely beautiful and affects them both deeply. After that the aristocratic Edwina Esketh who is bored with her life and in a loveless marriage begins to admire the unselfish Indian doctor who works hard for his people. In turn, the stalwart physician is attracted by Edwina, but strives to conceal his feelings, as he is continuing to pursue his work per the wishes of the Maharajah and Maharani. When disaster strikes with heavy rains and a tidal wave following, Lady Esketh wins the doctor's approval and admiration by becoming a nurse at the hospital and working tirelessly to help the patients. In addition to flooding victims, there are also many perishing of cholera.Before the final personal tragedy strikes, Dr.Safti expresses his love and admiration for Lady Esketh.Many, many lives are lost in the wake of the disaster, and the Major finds himself back on course to help the Maharani (Maria Outspenskaya) who has lost her husband in the flooding. Ironically, Lady Esketh's brutish husband (played out of character by Nigel Bruce) drowns, along with the valet he had verbally abused.One of the final messages is the timeless quality of love given unselfishly.Not to spoil it for those that have not seen this wonderful film, I will go no further except to say that it withstands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** It was the amazing special effects, the first to win the Academy Award, that made "The Rains Came" worth watching far more then the schmaltzy and unconvincing romance in it that just about put the audience asleep trying to watch and absorb it. That between the straight as a arrow Major Rama Safti played by Tyrone Powers wearing a turban most of his time on the screen and an old flame of his the unhappily married Lady Edwina Esketh, Myrna Loy, who's bore of a husband Lord Albert,Nigel Bruce, is more interested in playing the horses then spending any time with her.For the first 20 or so minutes were tortured with the problems of the rich and well connected in 1938 British controlled India until the rains come and things start to get really wet and soggy for the entire cast. It's later when an earthquake hits the city of Ranchipur that what seems like the whole world is about to come to an end with the dam breaking and the water gushing out engulfing the entire city. With cholera breaking out it's only a matter of time when the entire population is to become extinct unless Major Rama, who's trained in medicine, can save the day as well as the people infected by it. With his now reunited girlfriend Lady Edina, who's husband Lord Albert was killed in building collapse, by his side first a scrub lady in the make shift hospital and then his assistant how could things go wrong! That's until Lady Edwina takes a drink of water from a glass that's been contaminated with Cholera and it's curtains for her.****SPOILERS**** With Major Rama doing everything possible to save his love Lady Edwina's life all he can do is just watch her go into a coma and slowly and peacefully expire along with all the other patients in the hospital that he's in charge of. With that out of his way in Major Dr. Rama planning to leave India with Lady Edwina for parts unknown like the Florida Everglades and the Grand Caynon all he can do now is take control of the battered and almost ghost town of Ranchipur and try to bring it back to life. Which the chain-smoking and soon to die, due to her excessive smoking habit, Maharani, Maria Ouspenskaya, appointed him mayor of so It would be his problem not hers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh, I'm soaked. That was some storm scene in "The Rains Came". Not only was there a rainstorm, it was compounded by an earthquake and subsequent flooding all over the place. Luckily it was only a movie and lucky for this movie, which was moving at a snail's pace until the storm. Beforehand, some of Hollywood's most dependable actors had been trying to move things along. There was Tyrone Power, George Brent, Myrna Loy, Henry Travers, Jane Darwell and the great Maria Ouspenskaya, just to name a few. I guess director Clarence Brown was trying to duplicate the pace of life in hot, stifling India, which necessarily must be slow.Then came the deluge. After some terrific flood footage, which earned the picture an Academy Award,the film becomes a soap opera, which normally turns me off. But this was different, it was absorbing and interesting, especially the dialogue between Power and Myrna Loy. The picture eventually becomes the property of Miss Loy, who gives one of her best performances while avoiding hysterics and descending into bathos.I thought this pulled the film out of the ordinary and eluded becoming another study in tedium and triviality. It was a good picture and I am glad I saw it. I never took a movie course, but I really appreciate watching professional actors acting their guts out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Special Effects &amp; Good Acting Give Film A Lift</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imperial India, 1938. The beautiful, bored wife of a bullying English lord arrives in the princely state of Ranchipur, during the Heat. There she is surprised to find a former lover living as an expatriate, but it is his friend, a handsome, high caste Hindu doctor, that catches her eye. Her plans for seduction begin to proceed, when, suddenly, THE RAINS CAME...Myrna Loy, Tyrone Power &amp; George Brent star in this slick soap opera, which boasts a fine supporting cast &amp; spectacular special effects. They all do a superior job with sometimes sudsy material and are never less than intriguing.Standing out in smaller roles are: Jane Darwell &amp; Henry Travers as loving missionary teachers; Nigel Bruce as the foul-tempered lord; H. B. Warner as the noble, aged Maharajah; Marjorie Rambeau as the petty, social climbing missionary wife; Harry Hayden as her ineffectual husband; Joseph Schildkraut as an Anglo Indian; Mary Nash as a suspicious head nurse; and Laura Hope Crews as a silly Englishwoman.Kudos should go to ancient, wizened Maria Ouspenskaya, nothing less than magnificent as the Maharani. Every inch a queen, she effortlessly steals her every scene &amp; provides the calm center around which the film revolves.The subplot with amorous young Brenda Joyce is ludicrous &amp; utterly negligible.The special effects are, indeed, wonderful - well worthy of the Oscar they earned. Monsoon, followed by earthquake, followed by flood explode across the screen, showing that 20th Century Fox spent its pennies well.Queries: Why does Tyrone Power neither look, sound or act Indian? And how does Myrna Loy come through the worst extremes of weather always looking like she just stepped out of a Hollywood make-up artist's chair? In films like this you aren't supposed to ask questions like that...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake done years later with Lana Turner and Richard Burton was far better than this 1939 film.Myrna Loy actually needed some life breathed into her as well as the production. Tyrone Power is ridiculous as the Indian doctor who found love with her, and Nigel Bruce was a complete joke as Loy's husband in this adventure.Maria Ouspenskaya has some scene stealing scenes in the film. As ugly as ever, with that veil over her head, Maria shows courage, fortitude and resiliency when her husband, the leader dies, and is resolute in taking over his duties in an area ravaged by torrential downpours and an earthquake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great "read" reduced to a so-so "view"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note the running time: 104 minutes. A richly-plotted, 600-page novel reduced to a mere 104 minutes? One fears that far too much of the novel has been condensed or even skipped entirely and alas, this fear proves to be well-grounded. Louis Bromfield's "The Rains Came" may not be great literature but it is a great "read," one of those larger than life sagas which sets a host of vibrant characters against a panoramic background of exotic richness. Hollywood, however, reduces this material to a movie which, despite its glamorous cast and handsome mounting, is barely a notch above the routine.Missing from the movie are (1) Miss Dirks and Miss Hodge, the British spinsters who run the Girls' High School (2) Fern Simon's younger sister, Hazel, (3) Maria Lishinskaya, companion to the Maharani, (4) Harry Bauer, the Swiss nurse loved by Maria Lishinskaya, (5) Harry Loder, who wants to marry Fern, (6) the annoying Miss Murgatroyd, (7) Bertha Smiley, whose role as Mr. Smiley's wife has been taken over by Aunt Phoebe, plus a host of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs who now, at most, are simply glimpsed in the background. Even those who are left, such as the redoubtable Mrs. Hoggert-Egburry and the social-climbing Mrs. Simon, are sometimes reduced to just a single scene. By severely reducing and simplifying the novel's impressive cast of characters, "The Rains Came" loses its "epic" quality and becomes a mere tale of two-sets of disparate lovers: Lady Edwina and the Hindu doctor, plus Tom Ransome and young Fern. Even these two romances lack resonance because so much of the characters' backgrounds has been left out. (Perhaps Fern Simon has lost the most in the transition from book to screen. Her yearning to be "Blythe Summerfield, The Pearl of the Orient," has been almost entirely ignored, and she seems curiously uncaring that her parents have apparently been killed in the flood.) Yes, the sets reflect the skill and opulence of Hollywood's Golden Age, and the special effects -- for 1939 -- are quite impressive, but the result still strikes one is being little more than a passable exercise in "escapism."Myrna Loy seems a bit miscast and while George Brent isn't a particularly good choice as Tom Ransome, he's better in the role than one might expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soggy story gets a lift from the special effects...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rather ironic that GEORGE BRENT manages to be the liveliest actor in the cast of THE RAINS CAME, as a dissolute man who changes his ways thanks to an earthquake and flood that destroys the fictional Ranchipur in Louis Bromfield's tale of India in 1938. Not much can be said for TYRONE POWER, who has a smaller role as a turbaned Indian doctor and MYRNA LOY as a bored socialite whose husband (NIGEL BRUCE) keeps a list of her infidelities. Loy takes one look at Power and decides he's going to be the love of her life.BRENDA JOYCE, in her film debut, is featured in a sub-plot involving a romance with Brent. It's a poorly developed role and she was probably fortunate that she later found more pleasant roles in several Tarzan films as a replacement for Maureen O'Sullivan in the role of Jane. She's clearly an ingénue here. Brent gets most of the footage and he's good, more relaxed and likable than usual under Clarence Brown's direction.The supporting players have little to do before the rains arrive but help set up the plot which is then bogged down in two separate romances. As the socialite, Loy is not the glamorous creature that Lana Turner played in the remake and has to contend with some unflattering photography away from her home studio, MGM.What really makes the film memorable are the astonishing special effects which rightfully earned an Oscar for the strikingly realistic floods, heavy rains and quakes.Summing up: Worth watching for the special effects alone, but don't expect too much from the sappy story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance gives way to special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Passion and disaster reign supreme in director Clarence Brown's 1939 film adaptation of Louis Bromfield's best-selling novel The Rains Came.The 20th Century Fox film was budgeted for an incredible (in 1939) $2.5 million and spared no expense at creating an exotic locale for the soap-opera histrionics of the story line. Set in the mythical Indian province of Ranchipur, the movie concentrates on two romances. The first is the forbidden but passionate romance between Lady Edwina Esketh (Myrna Loy), the bored, restless wife of a stuffy middle-aged British businessman (Nigel Bruce), and Maj. Rama Safti (Tyrone Power), a young surgeon who is destined to lead his people. The second romance deals with Tom Ransome (George Brent), a British wastrel, who was once Lady Esketh's lover, and Fern Simon (Brenda Joyce in her film debut), the flirtatious and naive daughter of American missionaries.Power is surprisingly convincing beneath his dark makeup, and Loy turns in a solid performance on her loan out to Fox by MGM, where she was a well-known fixture as Nick Charles' wife Nora in the successful Thin Man series.The studio employed technical advisers, including Maj. George Remington, Charles Whittaker and Hussain Nasri, all experts on India.One of their main jobs was to make sure that Power's clothing for his role was authentic, from the cut of his coat to the way his turban was wound to the decorations on it. It was a tedious job. For example, Power's coat, with its gold thread on the red cloth, took two months to make. Of course, it only shows up on the screen as black and white. Loy, by the way, beat out such notables as Marlene Dietrich, Rosalind Russell and Tallulah Bankhead for the role of Lady Esketh. Bankhead campaigned vigorously for the part. In supporting roles, H.B. Warner and Maria Ouspenskaya are suitable as the Maharajah and Maharani. However, one must overlook Ouspenskaya's heavy Yiddish accent, especially when the Maharani takes Lady Esketh (Loy) by the arm and says in Yiddish tones about the role of Maj. Safti (Power). "Listen, mine dear, dott is Ind-yuss most promising young doc-terr."Joyce was a relative newcomer among veterans. She was a 21-year-old Los Angeles resident working her way through college as a photographer's model when she was discovered by Fox. She was given a big buildup by the studio for her role in The Rains Came. The real stars of the film are the dazzling special effects engineered by Fred Sersen and Edmund H. Hansen. The effects include an earthquake, a bursting dam, rampaging floodwater's and collapsing buildings. Sersen and Hansen won Oscars for an effort that surpassed David O. Selznick's spectacular Gone With the Wind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made spectacular -- but in dire need of a solid script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may well be Clarence Brown's best picture. "The Rains Came" is a solid, fluid example of Hollywood filmmaking during the height of the studio era. Great production values, including a spectacular earthquake and the ensuing flood, a good performance by Myrna Loy as the adulterous wife and two excellent ones by Maria Ouspenskaya and Nigel Bruce add to the enjoyment of this melodrama set in India during the lengthy British rule.But despite its many qualities, "The Rains Came" suffers from quite a few shortcomings. Part of the problem is George Brent, a weak actor who is unable to carry a picture -- and despite Tyrone Power's presence, Brent is the focus of the film. Also, while both Brent and Loy are characters of "loose" morals, it is Loy who's made to suffer -- even though they both regenerate. While Loy pays for her Sins, Brent is turned into the moral center of the film, bestowing his wisdom on the myriad characters around him. Not a very commendable double standard.***SPOILER AHEAD***And isn't Myrna Loy the most gorgeous, moribund plague-victim on record? (Note: it is perfectly clear that Loy is drinking from an infected glass; Alfred Newman's ominous music and the camera setup make it as obvious as could be.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rains Came is one of several disaster movies that were made in the 1930's and I found this quite good.An aristocrat returns to India from America and he helps out some poor people in a village. He falls in love and then disaster strikes, first flooding after days of continuous heavy rain, an earthquake and then plague which kills many. He manages to survive all this though.The special effects are quite good for the time and one of the best sequences is the dam bursting.The cast includes Tyrone Power (The Mark of Zorro), George Brent (Dark Victory), Brenda Joyce (who went on to play Jane in some Tarzan movies), Myna Loy and a pre Dr Watson Nigel Bruce, who plays an ill tempered Lord.This movie is worth a look at if you get the chance.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big, corny Hollywood epic...strengthened by terrific star performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grand Hollywood melodrama! Love relationships in India hold tightly despite the country being ravaged by earthquakes and floods. Ostensibly a production molded around the advancement of special visual effects circa 1939, all kinds of state-of-the-art trickery is employed: buildings crumble and the earth splits apart in hair-raising fashion. Predictably, the characters offer less interest, although George Brent does excellent work as an older man accepting the affections of a dewy-eyed nymph (this is possibly the best performance I've seen from Brent) and Myrna Loy is decent and stalwart as a socialite in love with a native. Flawed overall, yet an entertaining show. Remade in 1955 as "The Rains of Ranchipur". *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soapy, has a few good moments (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some made-up Indian province in 1938 we have a dissolute artist (Brent, who couldn't carry a picture to save his life), an up-and-coming doctor (Tyrone Powers in normal slick mode; he was that era's Tom Cruise), Brenda Joyce as a naive missionary's daughter (pretty, but unremarkable) and Myrna Loy as what they used to call "an adventuress". They're all having soap opera style problems until the middle of the picture, when monsoon rains come and wreck the province.Big budget for the time, but mostly pretty sleepy. The acting is unremarkable throughout: Brent is stiff and awful and unfortunately the lead, Powers is not that convincing as an idealistic doctor -- he'd have made a good dissolute guy, though. And while Loy in general is fine, nobody wants to see her in hospital scrubs picking up operating room waste. The two best performances are supporting ones, Nigel Bruce as Loy's older pain of a husband, and Ouspensky as the queen of the province -- though you have to get past her Yiddish accent.The story's over-drawn out, with some really bad speeches here and there and some extraordinarily tedious moments. The best part of the movie, and what it's probably most remembered for nowadays, is the special effects halfway through, all of which are very impressive. The movie picks up dramatically in those sections, before settling back down to sleepiness.RAINS is sort of an early Hollywood disaster picture: it's interesting to see that while nowadays a disaster picture is conceived as a kind of action movie, in the thirties it was more a subset of the soap opera. If you happen to catch it on television, it's worth seeing for the special effects, but other than that I'd pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've read the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I probably should not be commenting on this movie, as I have not seen it yet. I have, however, read the novel on which the film is based, and I have downloaded and listened to the "Lux Presents Hollywood" radio version of the story. I will admit that does not make my comments acceptable until I see the film.Several people have commented that Tyrone Power does not have an Indian accent. But Major Safti went to college and studied medicine. To do that, at that time, he would have to leave India and study in England. Hence, his English would be much better than those who only learned their English in Ranchipor.About Lady Edwina drinking from the cholera glass: In the novel, she is working the night shift. She checks her patients, gives them water, covers them, etc. She sits down exhausted and pours herself a drink of water. After she drinks, she notices that a patient is staring at her horrified. It is then that she realizes that she has drunk from the glass reserved for the cholera patients. She brushes it aside, but a day or so later comes down with the disease. I see that TCM will be showing this film next week. I will watch it and make further comments.Spin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always expect this movie to be good, but it ends up being boring. [Spoilers ahead] The first half is the only good part, mostly because it has Bruce as Loy's evil husband. This is the only movie that I now of where he plays a villain. About 45 minutes into the movie, it starts raining and Bruce is screaming for his butler while his house is being flooded. His butler finds him and throws him down the stairs right before the dam breaks and buries most of the town under water. After that, the movie turns boring and it is time to push the "eject" button on your remote control.</fullReview>
