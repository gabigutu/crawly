		<shortDescription>A potential spellbinder and one of Hackman's best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of this dialogue-intensive film takes place in an office in a Puerto Rican Police Department with a top detective (Freeman) grilling a wealthy attorney (Hackman) about the rape/murders of young girls. Featuring outstanding performances by both principals and technical and artistic excellence, the film's story unfolds piecemeal as it scrutinizes the Hackman character with painful deliberation while holding out the "whodunnit" carrot until the very end. More mature audiences with an appetite for this type of film are likely to find "Under Suspicion" a spellbinding tour de force by Hackman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, Strange, Engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Under Suspicion,' a remake of the French film 'Garde a Vue,' is as compelling and engrossing a psychological thriller as I've seen in years. The drama is wonderfully tense and taut, and, best of all, the suspense holds out until near the very end of the film, lingering on afterward for hours in the viewer's mind.Gene Hackman plays Henry Hearst, a successful attorney in San Juan, Puerto Rico who lives an apparently blissful life of luxury--he's got money, respect, a gorgeous house on the coast, and, most of all, a stunningly beautiful young trophy wife, Chantal (Monica Belluci, the voluptuous heir-apparent to Sophia Loren, in one of her first US roles).On the eve of the feast of St. Sebastian, during which Hearst is set to deliver an address at a fundraiser for hurricane relief, he is called in to the police department by his longtime acquaintance Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) for additional questioning surrounding the death of a young girl. It seems that earlier that day, Hearst discovered the girl's body while jogging. It doesn't take long to discover that Hearst is a suspect, particularly when he is repeatedly threatened and insulted by the tactless Owens (Thomas Jane), a loose-cannon junior detective hot to make his first big bust. As the interrogation progresses--interspersed with stylish flashbacks combing memory and real-time--it becomes apparent that the case is far more complicated than it first appeared. It seems that the imminently respectable Henry Hearst has a fetish for young girls and a secret life involving internet pornography and prostitutes. Simultaneously revealed is Captain Benezet's longstanding jealousy of Hearst, whom he has watched gain wealth and prestige while Benezet has lost his wife to divorce and struggled to get by. As the intense intellectual combat continues, truth becomes more and more murky, to the point that the characters are not even sure of their own motives or actions.This movie really stuck with me. Without giving anything away, let me say that the film will force you to consider the complexity of truth and memory and the degree to which psychological trauma and coercion can influence what we know about ourselves. Hackman and Freeman are superb, and it's a pleasure to watch them stretching their skills and chewing up the excellent dialogue as their characters confront each other. Thomas Jane gives one of his better performances as the hot-tempered Owens, and Monica Belluci gives a subtle and convincing performance while simultaneously being so unbelievably gorgeous that you can't take your eyes off of her. The direction by Stephen Hopkins is superb--creepy and stylish, the cinemetography makes maximum use of San Juan's many settings.For some reason this one really flew below the radar when it was released. I highly recommend it as an excellent, memorable suspense thriller with meaning and substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ending doesn't work as well as it should but the idea is there and the performances carry the whole thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the middle of San Sebastian's Feast celebration in San Juan, tax attorney Henry Hearst is guest of honour at a fund raising event to help repair damage from a tropical storm. However, less than an hour before the event, Henry is called into the police station by friend Capt Victor Benezet to clarify some points on his statement. Henry had discovered a dead child on a local beach but the police doubt some of the things in his story. As the time ticks down, Victor comes under pressure to release Henry but at the same time his story begins to reveal lies. The situation is only made more revealing when Henry's wife comes into the station.Everyone loves a good thriller so it was a surprise to me how quickly this film with it's heavy-weight cast managed to slip through the UK cinemas almost unnoticed. There is nothing significantly wrong with it to justify the low box office it seemed to generate, so I'm not sure why it happened. The story is set, for unknown reasons, in San Juan, a fact that is only distracting as none of the principals are Puerto Rican and their presence there is never really settled. Anyway, the film is very much a play that is carried by the two main characters. The revelations and movement of the plot is engaging and it is great fun to watch. The ending is difficult though - we are taught to expect a certain type of ending in this sort of film and it is slightly disappointing when it doesn't come.I expected a big twist and, in a way, that happened but the fall out from it isn't well explained by the film and a lot is left for you to think about. In that respect it is difficult, again because we are not expecting that type of ending but also that it is quite hard to understand as it is very tied up in the emotions of complex characters - complexities that we having been watching because we've only been seeing them as `twists' and revelations. That said, I still enjoyed the ending and thought it was brave to be different - just a shame it was badly handled.The cast are roundly great and are a big reason that the film remains gripping. Hackman and Freeman are great actors and having them both in the same film was enough of a draw to get me watching. The vast majority of their scenes are shared and they interact together really, really well when it comes to the dramatics. What they don't do as well is convince that they really are old friends. Jane is good but his character is far too simplistic and brash. Bellucci is better than I have seen her, but she is a little too wound up emotionally. She is very good looking and I was glad that the film didn't just trade on that, but it didn't (or couldn't) get a great deal out of her.The director manages to add energy and style to what could have been a rather contain piece (like a play). Visually it is exciting but, looking back, it was more important to develop character than deliver a slick thriller - something he didn't do well at all. The ending is weak because it takes thought, as we have not been forced to look at the complex characters. It was Hopkins' job to make us do that but he can't manage it.Overall this is an enjoyable film that will frustrate many with the ending. Despite being a clever and different conclusion, it doesn't really work because of the director making the wrong sort of film to suit that ending. However for the vast majority it really works and the strength of the two lead performances mean that, for all it's flaws, this is never a dull film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ok here is my take on what the movie meant - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS ---- What amazes me is how many of you viewers are so quick to condemn this movie because you just don't get it. Do movies always have to wrap things up into tight little packages for them to be workthwile? Personally, I prefer movies that require you to think a little after it is over to allow you to come up with what you think is the real meaning to all of it. Under Suspicion is that kind of movie. It was pretty obvious to me that the movie wasn't as much a murder mystery as much as it was about a man struggling with his own personal demons, in particular, the loss of the love of his life and his obsession with young women. If you've ever been in a relationship that ends poorly but you still are in love with that person, you might understand. It is quite obvious to me that Hackman's character is in love with young (very young) beauty. That is his flaw. His stumbling during the investigations is a direct result of his attempt to hide that flaw and to reveal very personal things about his life and relationship with his wife. His obsession about young women is why he had the photographs of them and why he knew one of them. By telling the truth, he would have to reveal this obsession. His wife has her own problems, that is the green monster he was talking about - jealousy. She knows him too well that she fears that as she ages, she will lose him to younger girls. She allows this obsession of hers to take over her reason and let's it destroy her relationship with her husband. In the end, Hackman's character is a lost puppy, weak and pathetic, because he is unwilling to let go of a lost love as he still loves her deeply and is in denial of the fact that she won't come back to him. He is holding on to that shred of hope that she will realize the error of her ways and love him again. But she can't do that. In the end when he finally realizes that she actually believes in his guilt and helped to find the "evidence" against him, he finally realizes and accepts that she will never overcome her jealousy and come back. So, he has nothing to live for and he confesses, mostly to get back at her I think. By confessing, he will ruin her too as she will lose all social standing she has, etc. And I think there is some self-pugilizing too. I think he may also be trying to punish himself for being such a fool for her and for his obsession with young women. The interrogation may have convinced him that he was wrong for having this obsession, so his confessing accomplishes both - punishing her and himself. In the end, she realizes her mistake and even contemplates suicide, but decides to try to make up for it and come back to him. He, however, actually has made some progress by finally being able to let her go and rejects him. She ends up losing in the end and he gains some self respect. At least that is where I think the movie goes.A couple of small points that people are making. I am not sure why Puerto Rico was picked. Except maybe to add some irony by injecting an exotic locale. I don't think that choice is necessarily a good one, not necessarily a bad choice either. But it doesn't work well and it may have been the director's choice not to exploit that. Maybe the book got into it deeper. Also, the friendship between Freeman's character and Hackman's obviously took place much earlier in their lives. It appeared to me that they had really be estranged for a long time leading different lives, his in the wealthy, social world, Freeman in the working class world. They knew a little about each other, but not the details. I do think they could have expanded on this a little more for development though. Overall, I think this is a very good movie and worth seeing if not for Freeman and especially Hackman's performances. Hackman doesn't often do a movie where he plays a vulnerable character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending "explained" in detail (Obviously spoilers).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I commented on this movie once a few days ago, encouraging viewers to go and watch it and not try to learn too much before seeing it, so as not to tarnish their perceptions. So many are troubled by the ending and don't understand. No doubt, it makes you think and doesn't hand over instant satisfaction or relief from the conflict. Does life always. Well, here's the importance and brilliance of the ending. Henry is like many of us. Little parts of our lives taken out of context or thrown into the wrong context could leave us having to "explain." More than one part, public embarrassment, a mixture of betrayal and enough suspicion could put you in Henry's shoes. To highlight. The dog. The dog ran with him like most times. But he didn't meet the dog like usual, rather the dog met him on the trail. Even Henry first recalled it happened like always until he really remembered it hadn't. But the dog was there and the dog found the girl. The dog's owner says otherwise. Camille. Nothing really happened with Camille. But now, like the dog, it looks suspicious to investigators. His wife always thought so and made it part of Henry's nightly problem before this ever surfaced. Something so familiar to him, he blurted out a denial before his wife ever brought it to investigator's attention. Now they make it their business to discover all they can about this from her, and get her side naturally. Henry visited websites, innocently like many of us, but now the police see the pornsites he looked at while he believed things were private and now he must explain. He is a prolific photographer. As photographer's always do - he shot many rolls of indiscriminate film and not surprising (by itself) captured some of the victims at some point. The victims were public people (which is part of why they became victims) and Henry had an abundance of pictures related to these scenes around him. All this suspicion and pressure, and his wife and the "lengths she went to" as Henry said, when learning she dug through his darkroom and discovered photos he didn't even realize he owned. Then she gave them to the police. He stands as the only one saying aside from all this, he didn't do the murders. He looks at the mirror and tells his wife to "come in here and face me." Given all his thoughts and feelings, even he decides to go along with everyone. He gives up. Doesn't care. He's the last one to join the parade. It all played out and he tosses his hand. Begins his false confession which is fueled by facts he learned from listening to the interrogators over the last few hours. (He never suspected his wife did the murders as some have said). Then an undisputable circumstance rears it's head and suddenly everyone pulls the weight of suspicion away from Henry. For the first time they are on his side. He's "free" but really far worse off than he ever was because of all the things he realized about his life. He's has to accept who and where he is, whether deserved or undeserved. As viewer's we became an integral part of directing suspicion towards Henry, we too began thinking and agreeing about his guilt. We too, wanted to find the shred of evidence that made him "100% guilty." It isn't there, nor was it ever - just like Henry said. The character's in the film are deflated, confused and unhappy with the ending - just like you are!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling thriller stumbles before the finish line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman in the two main roles is a dream come true for anyone who loves the art of acting, and their performances here (especially Hackman's, who after all does have the more showy part) are stunning. Stephen Hopkins' direction is hip, inventive and unstagy (though it must be said that his "a person can physically visit someone else's flashbacks" trick had already been done three years earlier, in "The Ugly"), the dialogue is sharp, and the story is compelling. So what's wrong with this picture? You guessed it...the ending! Simply put, the ending is baffling and unbelievable, no matter how you try to "explain" it. This film closely resembles the 1994 French thriller "A Pure Formality", and the irony is that, although that was a much worse film overall, it had a genuine surprise at the end, while "Under Suspicion" has the kind of "surprise" that makes the whole film come off as one big red herring.

		<shortDescription>Puts me in mind of SE7EN...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like SE7EN there is weird (albeit appropriate) music. Like SE7EN there is a jumpy, ADD-inflected title sequence. Like SE7EN this film is dark and dreary, a vision of an ill-lit and illicit milieu, raising far more questions than it answers. And Morgan Freeman is playing yet another world-weary detective, swamped by serial killings. There is even a young, hot-headed cop involved, although Thomas Jane (Detective Owens) is certainly no Brad Pitt. He was so grating in his part that I kept wishing he would get off the screen so the two leads could get at it. And so they do. If in their last appearance together in UNFORGIVEN Hackman's character was tormenting Freeman's, then it is somehow fitting that here it is the latter's Capt. Victor Benezet who interrogates, berates, persecutes and ultimately breaks down the resistance of Hackman's Henry Hearst, an attorney who verily has a fool for a client. Capt. Benezet may position himself as the 'good' cop in the 'good cop/bad cop' scenarios he sets up with Detective Owens, and later, Detective Castillo (Pablo Cunqueiro); but he is ever questioning, ever probing, ever seeking in his interrogations the heart of this dark matter. He is even insinuated into his witnesses' recollections, through a cool cinematographic trick appearing and asking questions in situ in the midst of the film's flashbacks.In spite of interruptions from underlings, superiors, and ultimately Hearst's spouse Chantal (Monica Bellucci in a tight, controlled performance) , over the course of the film one by one the lies and half-truths are stripped away, leaving Hearst with only his moral turpitude and his pitifully sparse self-justifications intact. It is only another interruption from one of Benezet's people that jerks us away from the sleazy, soul-shorn sight. Yet the revelation that follows twists and tears, sending our belief in this story and its implications into a dizzying, perhaps fatal spin. In the ending sequence Chantal and Henry Hearst walk towards each other, but somehow do not connect. They end up sitting apart. In a way that relates to the way UNDER SUSPICION acts upon its viewers. Sorry, no neat, happy ending here. Not even a coherent one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>REMARKS RE A REMAKE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read some time ago that Morgan Freeman tried unsuccessfully for many years to produce a remake of the French movie, GARDE ? VUE ( Claude Miller, 1981) before getting Gene Hackman interested in the project; despite their notoriety, a few more years were required before the UNDER SUSPICION filming started, with the two players acting also as executive producers (Hackman's sole attempt to date, Freeman's second out of five ones). SPOILERS AHEAD SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES. Both movies have (of course) the same basic plot: a VIP, having found the corpse of a young girl, reports it and soon becomes the main suspect of two rapes and murders for the police, but also for his wife; the man, entangled in lies about his doings during the night of the first murder, and facing adverse testimonies in connection with the second one, is unable to reverse the growing inner conviction of the police; the last straw occurs when his wife supplies a piece of circumstantial evidence; he then gives it up and confesses crimes he is innocent of.. Both have four main protagonists: the suspect (Michel Serrault/Gene Hackman) and his wife (Romi Schneider/Monica Bellucci), two inspectors (Lino Ventura/Morgan Freeman and Guy Marchand/Thomas Jane). In both cases the marriage has previously crumbled. Not having read the "Brainwash" novel by John Wainwright, I do not know which movie is the closer to it. But the treatments of the films are very different. Claude Miller sets his story in a middle-sized country town of (presumably) the North of France, on a cold rainy night, and most of it takes place in the dreary ill-equipped defectively-lighted office shared by the two inspectors in charge of the inquest, thus establishing a grim depressive atmosphere; the necessary flashbacks are few and as short as possible. UNDER SUSPICION on the contrary is situated in hot and sunny Puerto-Rico, and the police office is large, clear, and apparently suitably fitted: hence we do not understand why Morgan Freeman, sole inhabitant of the room, complains about it; and the defective lamp, if it has its meaning in GARDE ? VUE, leads to nowhere in UNDER SUSPICION; the colourful Carnival has atmosphere, but unfortunately the police precinct has none; and there are many lengthy flashbacks, in which Freeman is inserted as a witness,- a gimmick which soon becomes rather tiring. CHARACTERS. The characters too are treated differently: in GARDE ? VUE Michel Serrault is bitterly ironic, rather uncouth, and on the whole unattractive; he never met before stern chief inspector Lino Ventura, who relentlessly strives to establish his guilt; the other inspector is a bully, who beats up Serrault when left alone with him. Romi Schneider comes from a family with a high social position but no money. She willingly admits to Ventura that she married Serrault in her mid-twenties for his money, after having been his mistress for some time and condoning with his sex fancies though she has no physical needs; nevertheless they were happy till the Camille incident (see hereafter), when she shut her door to him; divorce is out of the question, - for the husband because divorce is looked askance at in the town where he has his office, for the wife because she is totally dependent on him for money. Gene Hackman is a more genial suspect, but his rather special tastes regarding very young prostitutes reinforce (rightly or wrongly) suspicion; inspector Freeman shared his youth and has remained in speaking terms with him; however, if the policeman has grounds for suspicion, he is also strongly jealous of Hackman's huge fortune and beautiful wife; he is therefore biased in his judgement - which complicates matters to no avail; the second inspector behaves more in accordance with his chief's politics than in GARDE ? VUE, and is less important. Hackman has known his wife since she became an orphan, paid for her studies, and seduced her when she was 14. From the Camille incident on, their marriage has been just a front.THE CAMILLE INCIDENT UNDER SUSPICION uses some of the GARDE ? VUE dialogue - unfortunately, often not in situation; more, it is misused in connection with the Camille incident (Camille being the daughter of Serrault's sister in GARDE ? VUE, but that of Monica Bellucci's sister in UNDER SUSPICION): on a Xmas night at her niece's home, Schneider enters unexpectedly the dim-lighted dining-room, finds her husband and her niece gazing raptly in the other's eyes, and realizes that they share a universe of their own from which she is excluded and shall never be a part of. She develops an instant hate for her husband. She says later to Ventura "He had no right to have her gaze upon him like a woman "; there is no inkling of any improper behaviour. Monica Bellucci goes into Camille's room, finds her very excited, in the company of her rather drunk husband: as she is convinced that he behaved badly, with the girl's consent, uttering the same words as Schneider is nonsense. ABOUT REMAKES What with the number of movies and TV films, the shortage of original stories is unavoidable, and therefore you cannot object to remakes on principle, nor demand that they be carbon copies; but the changes brought must be as least as effective as the abrogated parts: in that respect, making Hackman a photography addict has a use; but other alterations are not so welcome. For instance, Serrault's wife does not want children, and her refusal can explain his unhappiness and attraction towards Camille. In UNDER SUSPICION, Gene Hackman loves children, (his speech leaves no doubt about it?), but he had been married for several years prior to the Camille incident, his wife says she is not sterile, and still they have no child ? no explanation is given hereof. Further, the discovery of the real culprit in UNDER SUSPICION is narrated (rather badly, what is more), not shown, and fails to attract your attention. And the discovery of a third victim, Ventura's admonishment, the ultimate suicide of Romi Schneider and Serrault's despair result in a far more impressive ending than Gene Hackman going back home alone and presumably leaving his wife for keeps.THE CASTS The characters in GARDE ? VUE are better delineated and more incisive than in UNDER SUSPICION, and give more opportunities to the actors: if Hackman is excellent, his character is less complex than Serrault's, who fits his to perfection; Freeman's performance is not one of his bests, while Ventura is outstanding as an inspector who fails to remain objective, and whose future accordingly is bleak; Romi Schneider's delicate features and calculating coldness are perhaps more suited to the story than Monica Bellucci's earthly beauty; Thomas Jane has not much to do, while Guy Marchand's sadistic impersonation earned him a Cesar, the French equivalent of Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The Puerto Rican bit-players are non-existent, where all the French ones are good (compare the native commissioner in UNDER SUSPICION, who has no substance and whose warning to Freeman to proceed carefully fall totally flat; on the contrary the French one is established in two scenes as a man of power, incisive and demanding).  END OF SPOILERS THE TECHNICAL TEAMS Many of the best directors love to lend a hand in the writing of their movies; such is the case for Claude Miller, co-writing a closely-knit script with Jean Herman prior to directing it, incisively and faultlessly; witty vitriolic dialogue by Michel Audiard and a perfectly suited musical score by François de Roubaix are priceless contributions. The result is a taut fascinating movie which never drifts from the trend of the story. Viewing UNDER SUSPICION, you have the feeling that the writers brought most alterations regardless of their impact, for the sole purpose of justifying their salaries. As to Stephen Hopkins's direction, it is uneven; together with the loose treatment of the plot and its superfluous complications, it fails to ensure the unity required for such a film. CONCLUSION. Those who have not seen GARDE ? VUE can be attracted by UNDER SUSPICION 's cast and may find it a slightly better than average thriller; most of the others will judge UNDER SUSPICION the unnecessary</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is he innocent or guilty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intense drama that takes place between Gene Hackman as the suspect, Henry Hearst, and Morgan Freeman as Capt. Victor B., mostly in the form of an interrogation at a police station in Puerto Rico.However, it has some interesting scenes that take place outside the police station, while the interrogation is on going - showing us what might have happened.Both Hackman and Freeman do excellent work in this film, as expected of these two pros. Thomas Jane, a good actor, has little to work with in this particular drama, which showcases Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman as the leads.Monica Bellucci plays Chantal, the beautiful young wife of Henry Hearst, however, in my opinion, her acting was only average except for one scene where she is crying. Mostly she is just delicious eye candy.As the interrogation continues, Henry's story keeps changing as Victor hammers away at him about the rape and murder of two young girls, until secret after secret is uncovered and fully revealed much to Henry's humiliation.Just prior to the ending, Henry goes completely out of character, in my opinion, and when we reach the conclusion to the case, it is somewhat disappointing. Other than the somewhat weak ending, however, the film is quite riveting and held my interest entirely, although perhaps it is just a bit overly long for a interrogation format, and does lead at times to some repetition, it is nonetheless a highly entertaining film.8 stars out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe so many viewers get the movie wrong. The two obvious facts the director attempted to convey to supposedly intelligent moviegoers who unfortunately had been doped by the typical main stream Hollywood plot. Contains SPOILERS First, Hackman confessed to the two murders, in which he's innocent, because he had nothing to live for.Let's face it. Hackman?s a pedophile. He's a `bad' guy in the movie. But he truly loved his wife; at least he thought so. She's his last salvation. Hackman couldn't help himself to attracted to young girls. He knew it's wrong. So he married Chantal to cure his disease.He put all his affection on her. Even she refused to sleep with him for two years. He still convinced that she loved him. When Chantal helped police to find evidence to put Hackman in harm's way, Hackman broke down. She backstabbed him.He couldn't love his wife anymore. He lost hope of recovery from pedophile. He knew he'd spend rest of his life to pang under-aged prostitutes and to seduce poor young girls. In a moment of self-righteousness, he committed suicide-confess to the murders he felt he would commit in the future.Second, Freeman is a `dirty' cop. He tried to get even with Hackman. He believed that he's as smart as Hackman and more normal. Hackman married with a young beautiful wife in a huge mansion. Freeman himself lived in a shabby apartment. His old ugly wife left him for better opportunity.Freeman's smart. He knew that Hackman wouldn't have phoned the police had he been the real killer. Nevertheless, it's a good chance to snoop into Hackman's life to discovery his dirty laundry. He hoped that he could do Hackman a favor to gain an upper hand on Hackman, to change the balance in their relationship.Freeman portrayed the role adequately. However his effort was lost due to his stereotype. People failed to see he's dirty motive to go after his life long friend. When he looked at Hackman and Chantal, the two people he'd just killed, from the police department balcony, you could tell the pain inside him. Then again, it's lost because of his subtle performance. People nowadays like cartoon characters better.The choice of an exotic island and carnival atmosphere were intended to contrast the loneliness of those three main characters. Of course our smart viewers do not pick it up.Hackman called the young detective O.b., a woman health paper product. Because Hackman was a rich arrogant b*****d.Hackman was brilliant in the movie. Freeman couldn't pull off the dirty detective role because of his good reputation. Chantal was a spoiled brat, and supposedly to be hated and pitied. Monica did a better job than Freeman at least.</fullReview>

Gene Hackman,(Henry Hearst),"The Replacements" 2000, was a very successful lawyer and well admired citizen of Puerto Rico along with his charming wife, Monica Bellucci,(Chantel Hearst),"Sheitan",'06. However, there was a very strange and dark side to their marriage and a long hallway and closed doors provided a very strange relationship for his couple. Morgan Freeman,(Captain Victor Beneget),"Edison",'05 is the chief of police and while he is investigating a homicide, he starts to question Henry Hearst and it is from this point in the film when all kinds of situations change and some of these very dark secrets come to light.

		<shortDescription>The ending ruined the initial enthusiasm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is almost entirely based on the verbal exchange between the two outstanding lead actors: Freeman and Hackman. Freeman plays an investigation officer, Victor who has invited wealthy tax attorney Henry (Hackman) for clearing up some doubts about his testimony about two brutal murders, in which he is also a suspect. Thanks to the dramatic screenplay and director Hopkins's interesting style of showing flashbacks, the movie builds the tension right from the beginning. The story also explores the complex relationship between Henry and his attractive young wife Chantal, played nicely by Monica Bellucci.To tell the truth, the whole interrogation procedure is made just magnificently enjoyable by the writer and performance of the actors. There's no point in comparison, but it must be said that Hackman's got the more complex and versatile role and he explored every bit of it with extreme passion. Apart from the two, same can be said about Bellucci. Some may complain that she should have expressed more emotion, I don't think so. The character herself is cold. And she captures that nicely. Thomas Jane played the 'young bad cop' role rather two-dimensionally. His character could be an interesting side point for the film but it doesn't seem so with him. Another question of mine: Why is the film set in Puerto Rico? None of the lead characters are from there. The story doesn't feature the country exclusively, so why?But all these speculations and remarks fail when you end the movie like that. Yes, we understand why it was necessary. But it could have been shown more slowly, the truth could get the time to grow. In this case, the ending is utterly average and seemed like the filmmakers were suddenly in a rush to end the film. And that ruined everything the film was building upon so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of a loss of identity (Note: possible Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right after seeing this movie, I was puzzled about the ending, the theme and at first it seemed to me to simply be a case of over-interrogation. But after pondering for awhile I began to see the depths of this portrayal of a man who has everything he thought he was, stripped away from him in one night. It was bad enough that his friend saw the raw truth behind his persona but the final blow seemed to come when he realized that his wife saw him that way also.For this is the story of a man who thought well of himself. Safe within his persona, he thought of himself as a good citizen, an upper class lawyer, someone who deserved the best and had it, a beautiful wife and a beautiful home and so forth. But like all men (including wo men) he had flaws that he kept hidden from sight and these disowned parts of him, as most disowned parts eventually do, came to light one day.Our sense of identity is one of our most precious possessions, one of our most honored treasures. Take this away and we are left bereft and confused. Strip away our persona too quickly and we are utterly lost. There seems to be nothing left of us, we no longer recognize our `self' for there is no familiar `self' left. There is only the shameful, disgraced and disowned self that we have always DIS-identified with. It feels exactly like a death, in fact it is a death. This stripping away of our persona can be life changing, but also it can be the end of life as we knew it.Hopefully, in time, and with the love and care of another, we can come to find a deeper and more real sense of self, an identity that includes all the shadow parts of ourself. Perhaps as these two former lovers sat on their separate benches they were beginning to make that long journey into truth and wholeness. I like to think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of the past ten years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Hackman has been in a number of really superb films, many of which are regarded as classics. Probably the best movie he was featured in was Bonnie and Clyde, but his incredible filmography includes The French Connection, Superman, The Quick and the Dead, and dozens of other highly entertaining films. While he has earned a lot of recognition in recent years for The Royal Tennenbaums and Unforgiven, I would actually argue that his two greatest acting performances, and his two greatest star vehicles, are in movies that are laregly unknown or underrated. The first of these films is French Connection II (which, thanks to the Cold Turkey segment, and the wonderful fish-out-of-water storyline, I would consider superior to the original) and this film, Under Suspicion.Like 12 Angry Men, Under Suspicion is largely confined to one location - an interrogation room - and, because of the confined setting, it could arguably be called a "filmed play" rather than a movie. And yet, the film has a lot of flashback segments and bridge segments that take the action out of the interrogation room, so it is actually a less claustrophobic film than 12 Angry Men, if not *quite* as good a film. (12 Angry Men is probably one of the top 5 movies I've ever seen.)While the subject matter is very, very unpleasant (Hackman is accused of raping and murdering young girls on the cusp of adolescence), the film is gripping, and one finds oneself really involved trying to determine Hackman's guilt or innocence. Since there are so few characters interacting in a confined space, we get to know a lot about the personalities and histories of the interrogators and the witnesses, and Hackman and Freeman do some of their best acting work. Monica Bellucci is gorgeous and compelling, and I am glad she is at long last catipulting to fame thanks to the Matrix films. Thomas Jane gives a solid performance that works as an audition for his upcoming role as the Punisher.Without offering any spoilers, I must complain about the other reviews posted on imdb and amazon.com about this movie. Despite the stellar cast, I almost did not rent the film because a number of reviewers called the ending confusing, inappropriate, or just plain bad. Not only are these reviews false ... they are VERY false. The ending is shocking and marvelous, and really challenged me to re-examine my view of the criminal justice system. It is a tremendous ending, if you take the time to think it through.I'm glad that this film has started popping up in $9 bins at Best Buy. I'm hoping that this means that the film will get greater exposure and garner some of the attention it so richly deserves. And I hope that the same thing happens for The Edge, which I also spotted in the $9 bin at Best Buy last week, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a bad movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** BIGTIME SPOILER***If you haven't seen this movie yet, please don't read on.This facts of this movie do not add up. There are too many coincidences for this to be possible. Sure I can buy the theory that someone can confess to crimes they haven't actually committed if they are under extreme pressure, etc. but let's look at the facts here:Coincidence #1: Gene Hackman's character happened to be in the same area of Puerto Rico the night the first girl was murdered.Coincidence #2: Gene Hackman's character knows the first girl who was murdered, as proven by the fact that he had pictures of her.Coincidence #3: Gene Hackman's character knows the second girl who was murdered, as proven by the fact that he had pictures of her as well.Coincidence #4: Gene Hackman's character happened to find the second girl who was murdered.The odds of all four of these things happening have to be somewhere around 10 million to one. It is just so incredibly unlikely that he knew BOTH murdered girls, was in the SAME town that the first one was killed on the SAME night, and that he found the body of the second girl whom he also knew. I just don't buy it. If his wife had somehow set him up, that might make more sense. If the young detective had somehow set him up, that might make sense as well. If both of them had conspired together, that might also make sense. The movie as it was is impossible and unbelievable, and should have never been released. It is a shame too because Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are both brilliant actors, they just had the bad fortune of executive producing a terrible movie.If you can somehow give me a reasonable explanation of how these coincidental events actually happened I am all ears. I highly doubt it, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not hard to "get" at all-- yet still grossly flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING; PURE UNADULTERATED SPOILER; COMMENT INTENDED FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILMOne need not be a rocket scientist after seeing this film to know that is aint about the "whodunit"; that it is about the mano a mano between Hackman and Freeman, wherein Freeman backs Hackman into the corner where his pedophilic tendencies must come out; and, that it is about the so-called love story between Hackman and the wife ("so-called," because the director never bothers to offer us even a scintilla of evidence there ever was something akin to love between them, other than the periodic "We were in love once" comments from the obviously biased Hackman). And yes, the culmination of the film occurs when Hackman realizes his wife believes him guilty, and he actually confesses to crimes he didn't commit because (a) he now has nothing left to live for; and (b) he can hurt her back most dearly by falling so far from grace; her role as part of Puerto Rico's glamour couple is irreparably spoiled (remember the contempt with which that other society dame says, "Why, we saw him going into the POLICE station!")Further, anyone who has seen 10 movies in their lives knows 20 minutes in that Hackman is innocent but will be caught up in Kafka-esque nightmare as the proof against him mounts up. So of course all movie we are wondering, who IS the real killer, and why do so many clues point to Hackman? WHY does he find the body of the little girl off the road, if in fact he didn't have the dog? (and his story that he picked up the dog along his run holds no water; surely there would be witnesses to his RETURNING, if not picking up, the dog.) Sure, we understand, the real secret of his being in the town where the first girl was killed was his obsession with young whores, and his pretty niece. But WHY was he there the exact night the girl was killed, that night of all nights he visits the sister-in-law out of nowhere, with no alibi to account for his actual whereabouts at the time of the killing? HOW do you explain that both victims were photographed by Hackman?To really be able to say, "Who the killer is, isn't important," you have to be able to take the monumental number of unexplained coincidences and be willing to just write them off. And this, quite frankly, is impossible. The filmmaker takes too many great liberties with tossing off unexplained coincidences that point to Hackman's guilt, for the viewer to be able to say, when all is said and done, "C'est la vie."Imagine, for a moment, that this film was the Titanic. Big boat hits iceberg. Big hole in boat. But movie really about love story, not crash, so boat never sinks. Sinking not really important. That is what we are left with here-- a hole that big in the narrative, an implausible hole, that is this film's fatal flaw.A more deft director would have left enough ambiguity in the "evidence" that the viewer could walk away believing, "It could have gone either way." But you simply cannot walk away from this film glossing over the inexplicable, impossible string of coincidences with no explanation (the killer, say, was also a pedophile who knew Hackman from those circles, and deliberately framed him) and not be plainly aware of that hole the size of an iceberg in the narrative.I did not see the French original. But I would suspect it was nowhere near as clumsy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money, power, love and murders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell you the truth, I didn't expect anything out of this movie. I watched it only because top name actors, so my surprise is big in here. We've got all: money, power, love and murders. And a very good movie also. This is not brilliant movie, but it is very watchable. Let me tell you why.Stephen Hopkins directed "Under Suspicion" with very low budget, cause Hackman and Freeman were payed little and they are also executive producers. That means that this movie is theirs. They wanted to act in their own way and Hopkins couldn't do nothing about it. It turned out that that is great. Gene Hackman adds another stunning performance in his long career and Morgan Freeman follows him. Hackman had harder role so it is normal that he will be remembered in a context of this movie. Hackman plays a lawyer Henry Hearst, who is called to come to the police station to clear up a few loose ends in his witness report of a murder of young girl. Captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) is asking Henry all sorts of the questions, along with detective Felix Owens (Thomas Jane). That interview is said to be very short cause Henry has to make his speech on a found raising party. There his young wife Chantal (Monica Bellucci) waits for him, just like the creme of San Juan's society.As the movie goes on we found out lots of things about Henry Hearst. About his marriage with young and beautiful Chantal, about their problems and about his job. Henry becomes first suspect for murder and raping of two girls because of his little lies in his testimony. Benezet and Owens thinks he is the murderer and they are not alone in that. Chantal also suspects and that's what hurts Henry the most. Their relationship is shown on all levels and that's why characters of Freeman and hostile Jane suffers. But I liked that cause Hackman grab the opportunity to shine. Maybe his role in here could remind you on "Absolute Power", where Hackman plays similar role. But that is his brilliance. This character is so much different then that one, cause he didn't want to repeat himself. I also liked twist at the ending and all the scenes where Hackman or others are telling the story (Freeman always enters in their story, right at the sight). That was great, the atmosphere of interrogation room is good and the whole movie is very underrated. So I advise you to take a look on this movie; at least for Gene Hackman's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did Henry Hearst rape and kill two young girls? That's the question occupying the whole of Under Suspicion.For nearly the entirety of its running time, the film is executed brilliantly. There is no action: it keeps the audience's attention through its intelligence, brilliant construction and the reliably excellent performances of Freeman and Hackman. We are not given definitive evidence, and many strange and suspicious things crop up that we yearn to find out about.This could well have been one of the greatest mystery films I've seen... Until the ending. The ending leaves the audience without an explanation - and not in a good way that lets the audience ponder. It's an ending that leaves you shouting at the screen for an answer.Overall, I'd recommend this film because it will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat for more than an hour and a half. Just prepare yourself for an ending that will leave you wholly unsatisfied and rather annoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unique, neat ending which I think I got</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I do really like Hackman and Freeman as actors, and I feel I haven't seen Hackman with as good as a role since Unforgiven. The ending does seem to be a make or break for a number of people, and, if I do "get it," adds a lot to what this movie was all about. *MAJOR MAJOR SPOILER* In my opinion, the ending is NOT about how anybody can confess to anything when under pressure. What it is about, is that Hackman, for the entire movie, is convinced that his wife has committed the murders. All the references to the green monster of jealousy, her refusal at any intimacy with him after the episode with his neice (where his version certainly seemed more likely for once), Morgan Freeman's very brief but intentional comparison of the photo of Hackman's wife and the two dead girls, and so on. A lot of Hackman's lies during the interrogation can be seen as covering for Hackman's own bizarre behavior -- bizarre because he all along was convinced his wife had been going after his little girl obsessions. Meanwhile, of course, his wife is becoming more and more convinced that not only is he a sicko but a murderer and rapist. Hackman's confession in the end? He is taking the fall for his wife, convinced she did it. The title "Under Suspiscion" -- both husband and wife have put each other under suspicion. Perhaps I have read too much in this. But all along, as a viewer, I felt Hackman was covering for her. Apparently, so did he.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The investigation is over. What's next?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under Suspicion (2000) is a re-make of a French film Garde ? vue (1981) directed by Claude Miller and starring Romy Schneider, Michel Serrault, Lino Ventura and Guy Marchand. It was based on the British novel Brainwash, by John Wainwright. I did not see the French film simply because I can't find it but I've seen Under Suspicion more than once and enjoy it every time even though I know how it ends.As a thriller/mystery/crime investigation, Under Suspicion (2000) teases a viewer and more likely would leave a fan of the pure genre disappointed but as a psychological character study which uses the mystery and serial murders investigation as a device to explore the darkest places of human desires and relationships, it is very good. Besides, watching for almost two hours the duel of wills, intellects, and despairs between noble as always Morgan Freeman and exceptional Gene Hackman is a treat. The director's approach to narrative that allows the viewer to be placed along with Victor (Freeman) inside the flashbacks of Hackman's character, Hector, is interesting, unusual, and fresh, and adds to an uneasy and dark atmosphere of the forbidden and deeply hidden desires and fantasies. As great as they both are, for many years after I saw the film for the first time, it was the striking beauty of then relatively little known to the American viewers, Italian Monica Belucci that I remembered vividly. The film director, Stephen Hopkins wanted to cast Monica Bellucci after watching Mal?na (2000) while on an overseas flight. I am glad he did. She did not get lost next to her celebrated partners in the film. I also think that moving the action to San Juan, Puerto Rico during the San Sebastian Street Festival that is celebrated every third week in January was a good idea. The carnival atmosphere of music, vibrant colors, and grotesque masks strikes the dramatic contrast with the harrowing devastating experience the main characters of the movie go through and the place in life they find themselves after the investigation is over. Will they ever forget?</fullReview>

I would rate the directing superb, with the exception that I thought that the artsy dreamlike film sequences of apocryphal events could have been eliminated. Contrary to some opinions, I think that the end of the movie was about perfect.

Then the twist, someone else did it, Hackman just confessed, because the cops push him to the edge. Considering his marriage was basically over. The had been caught with prostitutes. And constant aggressiveness of the police, he basically gave in.This goes back to a larger point, many people confess, many times, do to the cops pushing them to hard. Some nuts even give false confessions, to get attention for someone else's crimes.This movie was really good, really like the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does Hearst confess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the risk of sounding pretentious, the movie seems reminiscent of Kafka's The Trial. Josef K. declares his innocence, then he states that he can't confess since he doesn't know what he is being charged with. To which either the fuzz or the Magistrate replies: If you don't know what you are being charged with, then how do you know you are innocent. Meaning: everybody is guilty of something, either in a strict legalistic sense or in a metaphysical sense (no one is without sin). Everybody has hidden secrets ?some criminal, some just embarrassing- that a person wants to keep hidden, which causes that person to act really guilty. As the saying goes: only saints and madmen don't know guilt.The movie also reminded me of Citizen X, a movie about Andrej Tsjikatilo, the infamous Rostov Ripper. In this movie a psychiatrist makes the killer confess by using a psychoanalytical method: the patient (suspect) is repetitively confronted with his morbid repressed desires in order to break him down to the ground ?by destroying his defense mechanisms- and then rebuild (cure) him. The problem with using this method in a police interrogation is obvious: a worn down suspect can be in a messed up state of mind and confess crimes he didn't do (although Tsjikatilo was guilty as sin and they cured him by blowing his brains out). In the Netherlands there was a famous case in 2002 in which two(!) suspects confessed a horrible crime they ?as later turned out- didn't do.As for why Hearst (Gene Hackman) doesn't ask for legal representation. This movie is a remake from a French movie (Garde a Vue). In many countries - unlike in the United States- one does not have a right to have legal counsel present during questioning by police officers. One can only have legal counsel present when questioned by a magistrate. This is about 'equality of arms', since police officers are not legal experts and would be out of their league against a legal scholar. This is mentioned in Garde a Vue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to discuss the point of this movie without discussing the ending, which is a twist and so is better left unknown when viewing! But the comment above about the ending being implausible, in my view misses the whole point of the movie. The movie addresses in a very serious way the many significant questions about the validity of confessions obtained in interrogations, even when conducted with the safeguards that we demand in a free and democratic society. It explores the psychological process of interrogation, and the questionable results, in a compelling way. Viewed from that perspective, the ending is not implausible at all.If you watch the movie and like it, and are interested in the questions it raises, you should check out "The Conversation", an Australian film that comes at the issue from the diametrically opposite tack. Very good as well.</fullReview>

First of all i invite everyone to see "guarde a vue" the french version of "under suspicion". This movie is supposed to be a "huis-clos"(in camera picture): two cops an the presumed guilty lawyer the marvelous Gene hackman .In this remake we escape from the police department many times,a way to take a little break,catch some fresh air and understand the plot. I read once something like: give smaller shoes to a dancer he will invent knew steps. this motion picture is over-sized! A scenario is like partition:not a formula but music! Is just a bit too rich: Even in the flash back the drama is boosted with the presence of Mr freeman,helicopters,parties,even cars... in the first version Romy Schneider was not visible,except in the flash backs and at the very first end. In "under suspicion" Monica bellucci photographed with talent,is too obvious in my opinion! to end my little Analise this remake finish with an happy end this jealous wife did not commit suicide! Where is the drama here? It's too glamor even the second policeman who has a great deal of gleaming to do is insignificant to nice; to open,intimacy is the key word that what not in this rendez-vous bye bye to all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing performers like Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman together is always pleasing. On this occasion though, it was also exhausting. Almost all of the action happens in an office; an endless crossexamine; a web of lies (some of them useless) and a series of flashbacks that interfere with the present action.This film has us waiting for the ending. We die to know whether Henry (Gene Hackman) is guilty or innocent, but almost everything the characters say is a lie or a twisting of the truth. We can't be sure of anything. They surely have many things to hide. I believe not all of these things are revealed in this almost 2 hours long motion picture. For instance, you get the feeling that there is something going on between the lovely Chantal, Henry's wife, and the young detective Owens. This is just a hunch that doesn't lead anywhere. Then we must wonder why Henry lies about the dog. Maybe this is just a flaw in the script or maybe he really got things mixed up. Who knows?To conclude, an extrapoint for Monica Bellucci, a gorgeous woman. They couldn't have found someone better for the part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A critical review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Under Suspicion' is a remake of the French film, 'Garde a Vue' which itself is a remake of JohnWainwright's book, 'Brainwash', and when I heard that Gene Hackman had waited years to make the film, I decided that it could not be missed.Henry Hearst (Hackman) is a wealthy tax lawyer who is due to be making a speech at a charity event in San Juan, Puerto Rica, to accrue funding after a hurricane had devastated the area. The previous day he had reported a young girl to the police who had been strangled and raped. The police captain, Victor Benezet, (Morgan Freeman) asks Hearst whether he could come down to the police station for an informal discussion of the previous days events before he goes on to the charity ball with his stunningly beautiful wife, Chantal (Monica Belluci). Hearst cooperates and reaffirms the statement he made to the police the previous day, but we soon realise that Hearst's story does not stand up to the evidence. Hearst continually changes his story to fit the facts, but seems to be implicating himself further and further as to having some kind of involvement with the girl's death, and indeed to another girl who was murdered and raped in an identical fashion. We soon learn about Hearst's marital difficulties, and indeed to his liaisons with prostitutes, which exacerbate the situation and indeed Benezet's suspicions of his involvement.The film is somewhat reminiscent of 'Death and the Maiden', where Sigourney Weaver holds Ben Kingsley hostage, as she is convinced that he tortured her years earlier. Kingsley is tied up until his guilt or innocence can be verified. In this film, there seems to be equal evidence as to whether he is guilty or not, and only at the very end does the audience find out. However, the evidence in 'Under Suspicion' overwhelmingly points to Hearst's guilt, and this is accentuated by his guilty demeanour, with profuse sweating and rolling eyes.This is an intriguing film, expertly acted by Hackman and Freeman, who are ably backed up by Monica Belluci, and Thomas Jane. Director Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2) allows the audience to visualise Hearst's account of events to see the cracks, but such clarity is seemingly lost for an obscure, but thought-provoking ending, where everything is revealed, apparently! Overall - 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Suspense Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like suspense, logic, and psychological drama, this is a great movie. If you want action and entertainment that's simple to understand, it's not for you. Reviewers who criticized the plot and ending definitely missed the boat- there are very few loose strings left at the end except one, which is intentionally left that way. Why did I understand all that? I WATCHED IT TWICE. That's one thing about this movie- you have to watch it twice to get all the nuances. Then you will know how well it was made, and what a great performance it is from Mr. Hackman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Long Night's Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can only imagine the synergy you'll get one you group Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman together. Put in a dash of Monica Bellucci and Thomas Jane, and you're left with a more than balanced movie diet.I've heard of some evenings that just went on and on, but the evening Henry Hearst (played by Hackman) is interrogated for the murder of two girls, it seems the longest night of all. But don't get me wrong, this is not a drawn-out boring movie. It describes Henry Hearst, a community-minded attorney married to the lovely Chantal (Monica Bellucci). Police Capt. Victor Benezet (Freeman) asks Hearst to stop by the police station to confirm his statement about finding the dead body of a young girl. Soon one lie leads to another, which leads to another, and so on. Beneath it all, "lies" a sordid and malformed relationship with the accused, Hearst, taking police further and further down a rabbit hole. What's unveiled in this film is more than just the killer.It's hard to describe this movie in any detail and still do the reader of this review any justice, if they haven't watched it yet. That's because the spoiler would be to discuss the interrogation, which represents about 85-90% of the movie. I will say that the film takes on the "who dunnit" theme and delivers excellent plot progression via a police testimony setting. To break the monotonous confines of an interrogation room, the director employs a creative film-school idea in showing the testimony as a flashback, but with the police in the flashback asking questions, as if they were all actually back at the scene of the crime. Very clever and entertaining! Hackman and Freeman give me just one more reason to continue watching their films. And Bellucci continues to live up to the reasons for her international film exposure. I just hope she doesn't do anything like Irreversible again! Under Suspicion: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last a remake that makes sense !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always thought that Claude Miller's "garde ? vue" was a highly overrated work.Adapted from an English writer,it actually harks back to good old George Simenon psychology and to venerable directors of the fifties (Henri Decoin :"la vérité sur Bébé Donge"(1951) and "non coupable" (1947);Edouard Molinaro:"la morte de Belle "(1960);Jean Delannoy:"Maigret tend un pi?ge" (1957)).In 1981,when Miller's movie was released, French critics hailed it as a miracle,lauding the unity of time of place and of action.They had probably forgotten that William Wyler did that thirty years before ("Detective story",1951).There was actually nothing "modern" in this "huis clos",and to think of a remake is no sacrilege .So Gene Hackman,Morgan Freeman and Monica Belluchi take on the parts of respectively Michel Serrault -who was beginning to do any job going-, Lino Ventura and Romy Schneider,both of whom were to pass away soon after.Even Guy Marchand's infuriating part of a cop-the pain in the neck- has been kept.His American counterpart overracts as much as he did. Miller's movie took place on New Year's eve and the scenarists found an adequate equivalent with the carnival.The American remake is no masterpiece but the acting is better as far as the two leads are concerned,and the director lightens his story with a frequent use of flashbacks well integrated into the plot;a good idea:Morgan Freeman seems to be in them,and to relive the events with the characters.The female one,although often a walk on,plays a more prominent part:in "garde ? vue" ,Romy Schneider appears a few minutes,too bad for the audience.The conclusion has been watered-down,but it does not make it happier for all that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, terrible ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS As I watched these 2 great actors (Freeman &amp; Hackman) and I got into the film more (beginning almost lost me it was so predictable and slow) I became aware of a few things. One, the acting was riveting. Freeman &amp; Hackman spar throughout, and they make the sparring believable through the power of their presence on the screen. Two, the obvious initial conclusion that Hackman was guilty was a ruse, and that there would be a twist at the end, revealing the real murderer, wrapping up the point(s) being made thru the movie at that time.Well, the twist hit, &amp; I almost threw my shoes at the screen when it did. How could the screenwriter and/or director have botched such a great effort with so many loose ends and coincidences? Why did Hackman have photos of the soon-to-be-dead girls in his possession? (The movie seems to lead us to believe that the sole contents of the girlie photo box were photos of the two murdered girls.) Freeman, playing a San Juan police chief, still had so many unanswered questions before him that his release of both Hearsts was totally unbelievable.The Gene Siskel review is right-on. This movie ultimately disappoints. If you like Hackman and Freeman, try other flicks, unless you can stand the disappointment that the end presents.Oh yes. It might have helped to have had a good actress playing Mrs. Hearst. Just a thought.</fullReview>

I am quite disappointed that so many people did not get this movie at all. Some said there were not enough clues to get what happened, but obviously these people did not watch the movie carefully enough. It all makes perfect sense if you just spend a little while thinking about it. Gene Hackman does such a wonderful job with his eyes and expressions in this movie.And to those who want spoon fed endings, please stay out of this one. Go see those unchallenging movies where everything is explained twice and if you still don`t get it, the director will be there to hold your hand and explain it all.Possible SPOILER:This movie has nothing to do with the "Whodunnit" point. That is of no importance and is never revealed either. The identity of the murderer plays no part. This is a love drama with amazing psychological load. Keywords are pride,love and jealousy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fabulously shot intellectual drama! Freeman as the accuser, and Hackman as the suspect are at the top of their respective games; if this had been released later in the season it would no doubt have generated Oscar nominations.This is a well-written taut psychological warfare-type film reminiscent of Hitchcock. No explosions, gun battles, even special effects. The script is manipulative, in that one spends the movie rooting for an accused child-molester and murderer, who ends up confessing. One finds oneself hating several of the "good guys" including Hackman's on-screen wife, who is breathtakingly beautiful, by the way.This is a truly exceptional film that will no doubt get lost in the fray of Arnold's and Brooce's latest "things go boom!" movies.Ah well.

		<shortDescription>Top rate crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One has to suspect that any film starring and produced by Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman is going to be good. That assumption would not lead to disappointment in this case. This is a terrific psychological crime drama with an excellent story, great acting and powerful directing.Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman) is a prominent and wealthy citizen of San Juan, Puerto Rico, who found the body of a young girl who had been murdered. Police captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) is a long time friend of Hearst's and asks him to come down to the station answer some questions and tie up some lose ends. What ensues is a blistering interrogation where it is clear that Hearst is the prime suspect.The script is smart, probing and full of nuance. Subtle hints in both directions make us continually re-evaluate Hearst's guilt or innocence as the interrogation twists and turns. The ending is a surprise and quite abstruse, requiring some reflection to fathom.Stephen Hopkins' (Lost In Space) direction is fabulous. The camerawork is excellent, using various perspectives and jump cuts to lend power to the dialogue. I would have liked to see more character development of Captain Benezet to understand his obsessive motivation of trying to nail Hearst. Also, it seems a bit incongruous to have this set in Puerto Rico and have so many obviously American characters. Nonetheless, the work by Hopkins is first-rate overall.The acting is superb. Morgan Freeman gives a brilliant performance, worthy of an Oscar nomination in my opinion. His dogged pursuit of Hearst never lets up as he is slowly eaten alive by his fixation with proving Hearst is the murderer. Hackman's performance is equally outstanding. His is the most complex and mentally tortured character in the film, and he portrays Hearst like a rat on an electric grid. Italian star Monica Belucci is mysterious and lovely as Hearst's suspicious wife in one of her few American films. The only mediocre performance comes from Thomas Jane as the detective. He is unable to match the rhythm and intensity of the rest of the cast. This part probably should have gone to a Hispanic actor in keeping with the setting.This intense and clever film keeps the audience guessing throughout. I rated it a 9/10. It is an entertaining film for the thinking viewer.</fullReview>

Police detectives Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) and Felix Owens (Thomas Jane) investigate Henry for the rape and murder of a young girl. There is no direct evidence but Henry's story starts to fall apart revealing marital problems and personal sexual accusations.The material may not be worthy and the directing style is poor.

		<shortDescription>Huh?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't review a film that has already been reviewed by over 100 IMDb reviewers...unless there is a good reason. My good reason here is bad acting on the part of one of the supporting actors.The two main characters here -- Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman -- are, as both actors and characters like 2 men playing excellent chess. Except that the game they are playing here isn't chess, it's an almost intellectual competition between two men -- one is a police detective in Puerto Rico (Freeman), the other is a prominent attorney who is a suspect in the rape and murder of two pre-teen girls.But then, in comes a lower-grade young detective that probably can't even play chess -- Thomas Jane, Honestly, based on this film, if I never see him in another film it would be too soon.But, we can overlook him due to the strength of the acting by Hackman and Freeman. And, I say that as a person who never liked Hackman until he became older. Now I quite admire his acting in his maturity.I can't judge the acting of Monica Bellucci here; she plays Hackman's wife. The strong accent and behavior of the character made it difficult for me to judge her acting, also I suspect it was less than believable. I wonder what other think.The story here seems very good, although many would find it distasteful. It certainly is a very serious film. I suspect the film is set in Puerto Rico to give the police more leeway in their strategies for solving this crime.One thing that's very odd here is how Hackman holds his Puerto Rican cigarettes throughout the film. Very odd; I couldn't figure out if it was a message or just an odd way to hold the cigarettes.As I watched the film, I kept thinking that the suspect was hiding something...not his guilt, but the guilt of someone else. And then the end of the film comes and you say, "Huh?????" I'm giving this film a "5". Watch the film, get to the end, and you'll find out why...not to mention Thomas Jane's acting. How this film ever made the mint of money that it did, I don't know. Certainly not though word of mouth. And I say that as a great admirer of Morgan Freeman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The evils of men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a decent movie but i can understand why some people didn't like the ending as it seemed rushed and could have been better. However, this movie is interesting in the way it depicts the demons of the average man. A successful old man who is married to a woman he clearly doesn't deserve and thinks he is entitled to the world. She knows he is a pedophile and therefore doesn't want him to touch her so they have an estranged marriage, while he goes about looking for prostitutes which are the only women who won't reveal his abusive nature and that he actually likes little girls. He thinks it's OK because they are prostitutes and so he can pretend that they are not real girls. When becoming a suspect of such gruesome murders and rapes of little girls he is clearly sickened by it at first, but as we dig deeper his real thoughts come out and we discover that this rich, intelligent, subtle man could easily be the monster that he is being accused of being. The idea of raping and murdering children is not so far-fetched when we know what he has been doing, and we become aware of the fine line between going to prostitutes, where a man can relieve his gruesome nature and get away with it, and actually killing and raping. The only problem is the ending when his wife actually seemed to have felt remorse because she thought he was guilty. Makes no sense after his atrocious behaviour, cheating and attraction to 13 year old girls, she should have run the other way. Overall it was a nice film worth the time, good acting (apart for Thomas Jane).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morgan Freeman interrogates Gene Hackman, under suspicion of murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Under Suspicion" (2000) features two powerhouse actors in a duel of wills. Morgan Freeman is a cop who suspects Gene Hackman of the murders of two pre-teen girls. Hackman agrees to a 10-minute conversation to clear up some points in his statement, as he was the one who discovered the body of the second victim. But Freeman, assisted by accusatory cop Thomas Jane turns it into a marathon grilling in which Hackman's private life is laid bare, including the absence of relations he has with his wife, Monica Belluci, and her jealousy. Hackman finds himself accused of raping and strangling the two girls.The plot details and motivations have been covered in other reviews in great detail. "Joe Barrus", in particular, provides an excellent explanation of the psychology of Hackman's character.This is a rather stage-bound movie that tries to avoid too much staginess or confinement to one set by opening out to show the places where Hackman was during the murders and his home, as well as the streets where a carnival is going on. The focus is on the two men, much as in a trial movie. Hackman has the more interesting part and makes the most of it, adding another triumph to his acting vita. His breakthrough movie was in 1967 (Bonnie and Clyde), and he has gone from success to success. While I have not seen all of his movies, the ones I have seen benefited enormously from his presence (such movies as Heist, Enemy of the State, Extreme Measures, The Firm, The Package, Superman, French Connection, The Gypsy Moths, Cisco Pike and Prime Cut). Morgan Freeman, at least on first viewing, doesn't do as much with his part as one may have hoped for. However, that's partly due to the nature of the policeman he plays. In the French version made in 1981 (Garde a vue), Lino Ventura was also relatively restrained.The story is heavily psychological. Despite trying to avoid coming across like a filmed play, the movie still depends quite a lot on dialog to explain events rather than advancing the story cinematically. This is the reason I do not rate it more highly. But it's certainly worth seeing for its story and for Hackman's performance especially.</fullReview>

Fantastic performances by Gene Hackman (Henry Hearst) &amp; Morgan Freeman (Captain Benezet), and even a great performance by Thomas Jane as the most annoying (Detective Owens) immature untactful detective. Circumstantial evidence and innuendos are abound, but really this highlights guilt by a person's own dark demons and the social media's manipulation rather than giving any doubt to a person based on actual evidence. The end is not the typical Hollywood (happy ever after) ending or even one that the feminists will be able to hang their hats on, but rather one of that is understanding and emotional as someone who has succumbed to saying what people want to hear without any details being supplied or asked, resulting in their whole life being dissected and humiliated by a forensic scientist and then left discarded on the roadside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers aheadThis movie is amazing. There are almost no flaws in it. The acting is brilliant by all parties(including Monica Bellucci, and i only point this out because some reviewers wrote she was mainly "eye candy"). All the main characters are flawlessly played. The plot, scenes, the zoom-ins the suspenseful atmosphere created by the director and the camera.. As far as detective movies go this is one of the best of all times. Yes, of all times and believe me I have seen my share of movies. Many complain the ending is weak but IMO they don't see the whole picture. Other reviewers say that Henry loses character or that the ending is not surprising or climatic enough...IMO what this movie presents to us is the slow pealing and pressure that can be applied to a person and what it might make him do and parallel to that the complexities of relationships, especially the somewhat eccentric ones. Henry is first presented as an elegant and powerful figure but than his humanity is slowly revealed and he is shown as a regular person with many "flaws". There is nothing really to say about most of the movie because it is almost perfectly executes all perfectly does all that is expected of such a movie. In the ending Henry does not lose character or is just pressured into confessing. He is of course under great stress because of all these insinuations about him and all his secrets being revealed but the point is that at the end he is mostly concerned about what his wife thinks of him and her loyalty or disloyalty to him. This is why he confesses, he even says it right till the end, that he can't believe she thinks he did it, and after his confessions and after Morgan freeman says he is not guilty he stares at the mirror, knowing she is there and gives her a sign saying "ha! you see I'm innocent how could you think i did it you should be ashamed". If you weren't paying attention watch the last scenes before his confession and after and you will see what I mean. The point of the movie was not how he was broken by the copse, lost all sense and confessed of something he did not not. The ending was just an even more in depth look at the relationship between Henry and his wife. At the end the main character loses all hope in the marriage and strikes the final blow by testing his wife and seeing how she fails the test. the final scenes is him rejecting her completely and thereby supposedly ending their relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing ending, but not a bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the film is pretty good, it has good acting, excellent direction and very good dialogue. It aims a lot on symbolism and the viewer should observe not only the face of the actor who is talking, but also everything around him/her. Reactions of the other actors as well as the surrounding environment are important in realising what exactly is going on. There's also a lot about the flashback and imagination scenes. Bear in mind that when one of the actors is talking and there's a flashback at the same time, it's not necessarily a memory or the imagination of the talking character, it could be the memories or imagination of the one who listens. Flashbacks are also shown from the point of view of the one having it and are thus, coloured so, therefore they might not be the truth, but they can be just painted in emotion. All this leads us to understand more about the psyche of the people involved in this. Furthermore, the movie is not about the murders, but about relationships. The murders, although the centre of attention, are secondary. The primary thing one should focus is the marriage between Henry (Hackman) and Chantal (Belluci). I liked this very much, because it's not traditional Hollywood but it rather resembles more theatrical plays or dramatic novels. The people involved in this actually did a tremendous job. The film, although copying french film Garde de vue scene by scene, it's quite good (although I haven't seen the original 1981 film). Be warned though, the ending is very confusing and leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I don't usually like this in films to this extent (so that takes a few points off my rating), but I guess the director aimed at making the viewers think a lot about his movie. You shouldn't rush to hear other people's opinions in this and adapt them as your own but instead you should think out the motivation of Henry for doing what he did at the end and draw a conclusion by considering about what he talked throughout the movie.***SPOILER*** If you wish to learn my conclusion on what exactly happened at the end read on, otherwise watch the movie and read it out after you have thought about your own conclusion.Henry is feeling very lonely and depressed because of his wife being overjealous of him and thinking of him as some kind of a pervert, as she thought he was flirting with his niece. Henry vents this off by finding refuge in pornography and prostitutes, however he thinks (and I agree) that this does not make him a pervert since he has to vent off someway and instead of going around raping people or hitting his wife, he does this. However, he is ridden with guilt at doing it because he still loves his wife very much and would stop all this if she would just let him near her, not just sexually, but also emotionally. He wants children and his wife does not, both are fertile, but they lie to everyone else around them that they are both impotent and therefore can't have any. It's obvious his wife doesn't want children from the beginning, where Henry says he'd like a pet in the house but his wife denies him that, and from the fact that Henry is "adopting" his sister's-in-law children. Chantal's jealousy though denies him that as well and he is left alone, and that's where he starts venting off at alcohol, porn and prostitutes. The fact that he has prostitutes in dirty places is another indication of his guilt and his lies to the Captain (Freeman) are to cover up his "activities" because he himself is not comfortable about them. This makes Freeman extremely suspicious of him and his suspicions are passing on to Chantal, who already knows that Henry has taken pictures of the murdered girls, before they were murdered, as part of his collection for the culture of the city. Henry, having realised that Chantal has gone beyond suspicion into accusation, he gives up completely of having a functional marriage with her (since she is already accusing him of having "touched" her niece) and goes on to admit the murders, which serves to relief him of his own guilt, and also to give Chantal closure to move on with her life, because like any other man in love, he just wants her to be happy wherever she is. He doesn't care of the repercussions, but only cares about his wife to stop accusing him. When the murderer is found, in the middle of Henry's "confession", Chantal realises this and understands that Henry's speech was aimed at her, and that this man loves her and just wants to have a working family with her and not to touch children, as she thinks he does. She's overwhelmed with guilt and goes on a ledge thinking about suicide while Henry is being released, but decides instead to try and repair their marriage, so she goes back to meet him upon his release. They meet outside the station, but sit on separate benches (to show how far they are from each other) and then Henry leaves, as he feels disappointed at how she accused him of murdering two children. The ending of that is up to the viewer, whether Chantal goes after him and they repair their marriage, or if she stays on the bench and leaves on the opposite direction, and filing for divorce, as she wouldn't bear to look upon him now that she feels guilty about accusing him. Being a feel-good-ending guy, I believe they went ahead to repair their marriage, but again, that's up to each person's interpretation and I think the director/writer wanted to give the audience a lesson of how jealousy can bring forth illusions and fake accusations between two people and finally drive them apart, perhaps so apart that they can't repair their relationship anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I couldn't believe while I was watching this that the TV guide rating on this movie was only two stars. This movie was great. I was captivated.Now, I must admit, it took me a while to get into it, and the first appearance of the wife on the screen was almost laughable. Her accent and acting at first seemed terrible. Thankfully you forget this as you get into the characters. And you start to get interested in them.At first you wonder why are the police bothering this lawyer. And then Gene Hackman's story changes and things get more complicated.Gene gave a great performance, and what can you say about Morgan Freeman ? Have you ever seen him not be incredible ? I recommend you take the time to watch this movie and don't give in to the temptation to give up on it in the first 20 minutes. It really gets good and you don't want to miss Moran and Gene go at it.This movie is really well written and does a great job of delving into the complexities of people and their relationships. It shines a spotlight on the dark side of all of our souls and the secrets that all of us keep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ain't they enough for a movie to succeed? what could go wrong that the presence of such two great actors can't make it pass without you knowing anything?! Well, all I know is that the charisma those two have on screen got me focused all the time on their gathering which it didn't bore me at all and I didn't mind the fact that most of the movie covers the interrogation. So powerful performance out of the two, you will get puzzled whom to like more- is it Freeman with his talking eyes and features or Hackman with the wonderful role of a man who is so into his young charming wife Belluci forbidding him his sexual rights as a husband. The plot is amazing and the acting is more than convincing. All the time Hackman lets you believe that he is guilty because he was waiting for his wife to renew her trust in him. I loved the scene where Hackman tells Freeman why he likes the young girls, actually the so young girls. He describes the stiffness of the skin of a young girl as opposite to the resiliency of aging skin and God I couldn't agree more with him. His description made me hate aging in a way I never imagined it before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Crime-Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would assume that with a movie starring two powerful screen legends like Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman, nothing could possibly go wrong. Well that's not for me to argue, but I found the 2000 movie "Under Suspicion" a scintillating crime-drama, complimented with a brilliant story, superb acting and outstanding directing.Gene Hackman stars as Henry Hearst, a successful lawyer residing in San Juan, Puerto Rico who has found a dead body of a murdered little girl. A long-time friend, police Captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman)starts questioning Hearst about the murder. Eventually the questioning leads to a full-blown interrogation that leads to Hearst being the number one suspect.The script was crisp, clear and it shows that a lot of hard work was done in writing the script because never one did the scenes seemed random or forced. We get cramps in our stomach in determining whether Hearst was innocent or guilty because th interrogation scene is filled with a plethora of surprises. The ending is one you'd never expect and leaves you with many thoughts to ponder.From the director who gave us "Lost In Space", Stephen Hopkins did a masterful job in bringing this sadly over-looked crime-drama. The camera-work was well structured and the jump-cuts are what make the dialogue so involving. My main complaint would be the more development of Benezet's character and why he's so fixated on nailing his old-friend Hearst. I also found it a bit unorthodox to see the film set in Puerto Rico with a predominant cast of American characters. But that doesn't matter to me that much since the direction by Hopkins is one of his best work. The acting was rock-on solid as Morgan Freeman was as brilliant as in most of his films he's starred in, good or bad. His whole obsession of proving Hearst's guilt never fizzles out and he stays in character in every scene he's in. Gene Hackman is at an equal with Freeman as he delivers an excellent portrayal of a long-suffering man who's unpredictable to the fans in determining his innocence or guilt. Monica Belucci who's a star in Italian films lends support to the cast as Hackman's wife who's mysterious ways could throw you off guard. The real weak link leading actor is Thomas Jane as the detective. He just couldn't keep up with the level of power the other performances that the cast provides. I would've suggested someone of Latino extraction to have played his role. It would've been more accurate.A really riveting crime story with plenty of mystery and intrigue to deliver. It truly deserves a 9 because it will keep you guessing and is backed up by two of Hollywood's most outstanding performers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of art or a messy plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed reading others' comments, especially those who try to figure the "meaning" of this film. I am a counselor and have worked with many kinds of victims and perpetrators and "in reality" it would be highly unusual for a man to suddenly admit to a crime that he didn't commit unless he was delusional. Having said that, isn't good art such that it becomes more of a symbol based on emotional reactions because the film's ending makes no sense. So it can be said the the film itself is a mirror and reveals what each person believes, based on speculation and a gut feeling, what each character represents. And this is where art should take us--it tells us more about ourselves than simply a dry analysis about a film plot. Why do some people think that Henry is guilty while others see his wife as the evil one? Why do people project jealousy onto Captain Benezet while others see him strictly as a man looking for the truth. And why are comments so one sided about Detective Owens? I have little patience for films that I invest time in and leave me only with myself as the answer to film's meaning. For example, a film like Usual Suspects is as compelling but I felt a catharsis at the end when I found myself emotionally manipulated. Bravo! Also The Inside Man had me guessing and then come through with an ingenious story line. So both art and meaning can be merged in such a way that one is transfixed, relying on one's own abilities to "guess" what is happening and then being totally fooled at the end which, to me at least, is the hardest kind of film to make. Others' comments appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mediocre movie with a few redeeming features</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers here! A completely trite and mediocre movie, except for the last-minute false confession of Hackman. The whole set-up until then, as so many reviewers have commented, is nothing new, and the "surprise" at the end that Hackman isn't guilty is the least surprising thing that I have seen in years; it wouldn't have been an interesting movie otherwise so he had to be innocent. (I'm amazed at how many commenters found this to be a truly surprising ending. Maybe they haven't seen many movies...) But his false confession is the climax that bares the depth of his hopelessness to the viewer, shows you how very pathetic the character is, and finally makes the movie somewhat interesting.Of course Hackman and Freeman give their usual superb performances, each of his own usual type but nevertheless pretty gripping even in so formulaic a plot. Monica Bellucci doesn't act; she just poses, and I have to say that she does that very well indeed.And where do those tiny phony little cigarillos that they both smoke come from???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under Suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read some comments here about the film. I think they were randomly chosen. Most said it is a bad/lousy/disappointing film that is more like a staged play than a drama. I respectfully (though that depends on the standard of the comment) disagree.When dogmatic people make alternate forms of reality and put manufactured truth to fill up the missing pieces of the puzzle to get the whole story the way they want to believe it, hammering on the root of it all takes toll on their emotions. And if you have abandoned what you loved because of the alternate reality rooted deeply into your mind, and realize one day things you see so vividly inside your head never really happened, you get defensive, and you get furious. You already left what you loved. Now you have to leave your truths. What is there left for you now? That is a miserable state where you cannot even hate anyone for it. But what if someone, someone who loves you more than he loves himself, tells some more lies to keep you settled in your own world? Would you trade him for your truths? Would you be happy that your suspicion had material cause, or be sad that the suspicion ruined all you loved? Under Suspicion is a story of three people. A rich man, his much younger exquisitely charming wife, and a police detective. Two little girls have been raped and killed. The detective is convinced that man Henry (Gene Hackman) is a paedophile and the killer he is looking for. He brings the couple to his station, and plays a mind-game with them. As they all get annoyed, tired, incensed, frustrated, impatient, little bits and pieces of information keeps getting divulged that slowly starts giving a base to the suspicion. So, is Henry the killer? What drove him to such a thing? In my humble opinion, those who are losing trust on a special someone, living in a world of made up truths, visualizing scenes of intimacy that they did not witness but are convinced took place, should all watch this film. You only live once. Would you let suspicion run your life? Is that choice yours to make? Maybe you will find out. Maybe you won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather good and entertaining despite a flaw or two. Worth a night in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's odd: if we like someone, we are prepared to forgive them their irritating flaws and quirks. Conversely, if we dislike someone, each of those flaws and quirks is held against them, often with a vengeance. Something similar happens with films. We like to think that our judgment is rational and that we judge a film, how 'good' or 'bad' it is depending on how we evaluate its constituent parts. So we might ponderously proclaim that 'despite a good script, this film was let down by its direction'; of we might say 'the director worked wonders with unpromising material and a poor script'. But finally - and despite our conceit that we are trying to be fair and objective - we find that we liked or disliked a film despite itself. For me Under Suspicion is a film I found I liked. After watching it (on DVD), I called up the IMDb pages to read what others thought of it, and, as usual, I paid rather more attention to those who 'hated it' than to the many who are apt to go over the top. Criticisms made by other members included that Puerto Rico is a Spanish-speaking island but that neither Morgan Freeman nor Gene Hackman could speak any Spanish. Then there us one gripe that this must previously have been a theatre piece because all the action takes place in one room (it doesn't really, in fact, but then that is neither here nor there). These viewers obviously belong in the camp of those who couldn't warm to the film and who pick up on each and every flaw and quirk. I, on the other hand was rather taken with it. Granted, within minutes of the film ending a number of objections came to mind - flaws - but then I didn't care: I had just enjoyed a thrilling piece full of suspense with two riveting performances from Freeman and Hackman (and I can honestly say I haven't yet seen one film starring either of those two actors which wasn't in some way enjoyable). I won't bore the reader with a resume of what happened, and I am about to give away certain points about the plot. My one criticism might be that the film might well have dissected the state of Hackman's marriage to Bellucci more, which was, in fact the font of all the unhappiness. What might have been enlightening would have been an examination of the Bellucci character and exactly why she was so jealous of other younger girls that her love for Hackman had apparently turned to hatred. But what the hell, I liked it. I especially liked the final scene where Hackman and Bellucci leave the police HQ and almost meet up, but are finally kept apart by whatever private demon had made their marriage so utterly unhappy. In lesser hands this might have turned into a sentimental mawkish scene with the couple embracing and making up. But this film is honest and we get none of that Hollywood happy-end schmaltz thank goodness. This is a remake of a French film and I would be interested to see how the French presented the story. In truth, this kind of psychological film-making is unusual in Hollywood and does strike me as more European, but it is not hard to see what drew Freeman and Hackman to producing it. (NB One critic described this as a 'vanity production'. He/she also obviously belongs in the 'didn't like it and I'm not going like anything about it' camp. Don't worry, there is nothing self-indulgent about the film.) Given that in some ways the film is rather static and much of it consists of policeman Freeman interrogating rich tax lawyer Hackman at the police HQ, director Stephen Hopkins come up with a rather effective technique to give the film a little more breadth which also adds to the intrigue. While Freeman in questioning Hackman and later Belucci, he has him also being present at the scene of what each is describing. I have made it all sound rather tricksy and odd, but that is my fault. It is nothing of the kind: it is a simple technique but it works a treat. And that's it really. If you like a certain kind of suspenseful film, if you like seeing to longstanding pro actors giving something close to their best, finally if you simply liked to be entertained, Under Suspicion is the one for you. And not a single car is chased or a gun shot in the whole movie, for which the Lord be praised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man comes face to face with his real self - with tragic results.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under Suspicion" is adapted from a 1979 novel by that most English of English detective story writers,Yorkshireman John Wainwright.Mr Wainwright,a second world war Bomber Command veteran,was a policeman in his native county for twenty years before becoming a full - time writer. The book was the first in his "Inspector Lyle" series.His credentials for writing "romans policier" were impeccable and 2 years after publication, "Brainwash" was filmed in France as "Garde a vue". Nearly 20 years later,"Garde a vue" was remade as "Under Suspicion".These title changes are very significant because the whole "raison d'etre for the movie is the ending which has had nearly as many interpretations as there are comments on this site.#SPOILER ALERT# - do not read any further if you have not seen this movie........................................ Mr G.Hackman plays a lawyer who comes under suspicion for the murder of two young girls.Brash,confident,wealthy and an influential member of the community,he attends the police station of his own volition to be interviewed by long - term acquaintance detective Mr M.Freeman.Hackman is married to a very beautiful young woman 30 years his junior Miss M.Belucci whom,it transpires,he seduced when she was 14.He is a man tortured by his obsession for barely pubescent girls.After having been caught in an apparently compromising position with his wife's young niece,the marital bed is no longer available to him and he more and more resorts to child prostitutes.He is a man wracked with guilt,terrified that his secrets will come out.As the police chip away at his facade of self -delusion and denial and his wife reveals her hatred and contempt for him, he is gradually forced to face what he has become and this knowledge breaks him.He confesses to the murders. It is a tour de force performance from Mr Hackman as gradually we see the image of himself that has built up over the years crumble and he is left to look at his true self.Which one of us could bear such a close inspection? The crux of "Under Suspicion" is the ending.Had the movie retained Wainwright's original title there could have been little controversy. As it is,Hackman's confession is the key to movie.~SUPER SPOILER ALERT~ because as he confesses,the rightful suspect is arrested at the scene of another murder.The audience is left to ponder his motives. The movie came as a complete "sleeper" to me as it was free with a newspaper and I put it by for a dull evening on the telly(well,everything's relative).Last night,face with a plethora of "Reality TV" (a contradiction in terms if there ever was one) I turned on the DVD player with little hope other than being mildly diverted. As it turned out I was enthralled,intrigued and disturbed.And it's a long time since television did that to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant acting; indefensible ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading some of the "explanations" about the puzzling end of this movie. I found none of them are satisfactory. It just doesn't make sense. The closest to a sensible explanation was the one about the guy confessing to horrible crimes just to protect his wife, allegedly suspected of having committed the crimes of which he is being accused. But there is no hint whatsoever that there is any such suspicion in the character's mind. Moreover, there is even less reason to believe, or the slightest hint about the police having any suspicion against her, which makes the confession absolutely pointless. The one about the guy confessing under the pressure of the interrogation makes really very little sense considering the kind of man the suspect is, and that he still has a lot to lose with such confession. One does not send oneself to prison for life or the electric chair (I ignore whether there is death penalty in Puerto Rico) for such a trifle as a long night of interrogation. People with a lot less resources than the character would not break down under much worse duress, an even torture.I gave the movie a 7 because of what many already said about the superb acting of Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman, and just in case I really did miss something big in not understanding the ending, which I doubt, particularly after reading the other comments and possible explanations. Otherwise, it should be a 5.Entertaining, but disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hackman shines in another orgy of lazy flashback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow I can't help feeling that Gene Hackman could make the recitation of a shopping list sound dramatic and worth listening to and I have to admit to watching this on DVD simply because he was in it. An excellent Hackman performance aside, this film, though far from boring, doesn't have that much to offer (unless you're a fan of the modern obsession in film and TV of flashback story-telling) . It's really a vehicle for the two main stars who have most of the screen time (Freedman is also good but plays the world weary cop again - a role to which he has almost become typecast). The film's main hook is the inevitable plot twist, which I imagine will keep you, as it did me, watching to the end. I got the ultimate plot twist wrong, but in my defence this may more due to the sometimes inexplicable behaviour of the characters rather the subtlety and guile of the script writers.This film never really rises much above the level of a who-done-it (with the draw back that there are only two characters that can form the lists of suspects). Dramatic realism, as so often in crime dramas, comes a distant second to the need to drip-feed background information to the audience in a build up to the plot twist. This is a shame as the portrayals of the two main protagonists by Hackman and Freedman are good and the central theme of a pillar of the community being drawn into humiliating admissions about his personal life is interesting (mildly). The ambiguity at times works well; the main character is at times sympathetic (credit to Hackman) and at others his self-serving privileged climb up the greasy pole and sleazy sexual mores are revealed; but is he guilty!!? This film has little real psychological depth (aside from Hackman the other star of the film is possibly Hackman's hair-piece - which provides the best piece of pathos in the film). Monica Berlucci looks stunning and adds sexual tension but is a somewhat impassive figure; wooden, but beautifully carved.In the end, the plot will have you questioning the characters actions and caring very little about them. The main criminal subject matter of child murder is treated in a somewhat lightweight and voyeuristic fashion The murders themselves are fairly incidental which is always uncomfortable; compared to the central horror of the story the drama played out by Hackman, Freedman and Bellucci seems trite, Unfortunately, Peurto Rico and its people are also incidental to the story which is a missed opportunity I think. At least it spares you the over-the-top, visceral exploitation of films like "Seven" - which makes it, in my opinion, a superior project - but that's not saying much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cheap potboiler with good performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a powerful man is accused of murder, who is telling the truth - the man, or his estranged wife? Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman), an American attorney living in Puerto Rico, is called in to speak with police detective Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman). A few days earlier, Hearst reported finding the body of a 12-year-old girl while taking his dog for a walk; however, investigators now believe that Hearst may have had a greater involvement in the crime than he's admitting. Under intense questioning by confident young cop Owens (Thomas Jane) and gentler but firm interrogation from Benezet, several cracks begin to appear in Hearst's story. Still he's able to persuade the police to allow him to leave long enough to take part in a fund-raising function he'd promised to attend. However, upon his return, Hearst discovers that Benezet and Owens have been questioning someone else - his wife Chantal (Monica Bellucci), who has been on poor terms with her husband for some time. "Under Suspicion" is based on the novel "Brainwash" by John Wainwright, which was previously filmed by French director Claude Miller as "Garde a Vue". Freeman and Hackman prove their star power by enlivening this tawdry, cable TV-level tale of betrayal and murder in the Caribbean. A rather unsavoury plot involving child molestation and abuse burdens "Under Suspicion". As such, the subject doesn't receive the proper sensitivity it deserves; the film merely uses it as sordid fodder for a standard thriller. Hopkins' direction is taut if overly gimmicky, but the film never breaks out of its grimy pot-boiler mode, even with its dynamic lead actors giving the film requisite force. The film was a departure for Hopkins, whose career had mostly been composed of such gargantuan Hollywood pictures as 1998's "Lost in Space".</fullReview>

This is particularly so given the twist in the tail when another, previously unseen, police officer turns up and reveals that the real killer has been found, having committed another crime and having been caught shortly post-crime. This, all as Hearst admits to the murders under the massive weight of circumstantial evidence. His breakdown, while believable given the intensity of the questioning, is simply then not explained, and nor is the resolution of the false arrest, heated interrogation and need to resolve the very mixed up relationship between Hearst and his trophy wife. Overall, I was engrossed by this film until the final 10 minutes when I was sadly let down by the inadequately explained deus ex machina resolution of the crime investigation.</fullReview>

This alone makes this 'whodunnit' worth viewing.The story may be pretty straightforward, but that doesn't matter. The movie breathes a great atmosphere.

		<fullReview>i can't figure why this movie has such a low rating, c'mon people, a 6.4? i gave this movie a 9. i think this is gene hackman's best performance and certainly the best of morgan freeman (althought i didn't see "the shawshank rendemption"). monica belucci was the only low point in the movie. and i believe thomas jane was great (i admit i didn't expect a good performance coming from him).direction is superb and the movie is very well crafted. i could feel the tension in the air and it was a very suspenful movie. i specially liked the part were gene hackman, tired of his traitorous life decides to confess he was the murderer and it got better when we learn that he is not the actual killer, it was a very powerful scene.script is very good and the story development is great, this starts as a simple formality and it gets into an interrogation chamber.i just don't know what's wrong with this movie, i thought it was great. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of both Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman. However, unless this is some kind of chick-flick which I don't get, it's a waste of time. Lots of stylish flashbacks with modern-day Gene in years-ago scenes, with Morgan sternly looking on. Even the acting wasn't enough to interest me, however. I was glad I remote-surfed when this aired on Bravo. Some of the commercials were better than the movie! Go rent "Shawshank Redemption" or "The Conversation" if you want to see these actors earning their salaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, worst ending ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I notice that the credits list two screenwriters, one of whom (W. Peter Iliff) did the script for Patriot Games, while the other seems to have done nothing else worthy of note. So it is tempting to think that the producers employed a good screenwriter for the bulk of the script and a total moron to write the ending. Not that I think it really happened that way, but how else can you explain it? Not having seen the original movie or the book on which this film was based, I don't know how much blame the present writers should take.Most of the movie is really good. Ignore those who talk about poor acting and direction. The direction is a bit quirky, but it is certainly competent. The concept of the movie is very restricting, as almost all the action takes place in two adjacent rooms, a technique that is perhaps better suited to the stage than to the screen, so I think the director's decision to place the actors in scenes as they discuss them, while rather confusing at first, helps to relieve the pressure on the audience. And the main actors: Gene Hackman does a very sleazy job of playing a very sleazy character, and Morgan Freeman is always good - his worst performance is better than most actors' best.At one stage the Gene Hackman character refers to being unwrapped like an onion, and that is exactly what the movie is: one character unwrapping another to reveal the core of emptiness within. As a piece of psychological detective work, it is excellent.But the ending. I have seen plenty of movies with bad endings: endings that reveal nothing, go nowhere, make no sense, even detract from the rest of the movie. But this is the first time I've seen an ending that absolutely makes a mockery of everything that has happened before and makes the whole thing seem pointless.I'd like to be able to recommend this movie - but I can't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS Good...better...the best? Nah...just very good. Actually this movie has a very nice meaning...and it's also...in a strange way ironical. Two of the greatest actors of our time meet in this movie, and as it generally has to be, they end up confronting each other...why? Well, read up! Under Suspicion, with Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman is certainly a very good movie... Henry Hearst, a well known lawyer, is called for a "quick" questioning at the local police station before going to a charity act. This seemingly short interrogation evolves, and from a witness, Henry becomes the main suspect in a double murder case. He is being interrogated by the local police captain Victor Benezet, interpreted by Morgan Freeman, and detective Owens(Thomas Jane), a young and aggressive interrogator. Henry's testimonies become more and more confusing, and it is really hard to determine the truth towards the end. The actual finish of the movie is actually the most interesting part...we understand while watching, that Henry has a hard life, because his wife lives in another bedroom, not in his, and a 18 meter long corridor separates the two bedrooms. Slowly, Henry starts accepting what captain Benezet tells him...and we clearly see that...ironically the captain is right: Henry is a bored man, and that's why he handles how he does... The whole movie is interesting, and, as I said before, very good. The actors are very, very good, and I didn't notice any visible flaws. I enjoyed the movie, and I hope so will you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miscast and misdirected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt the movie was misdirected. The director wants to spice up the stage like adaptation so he add these visual effects to keep things exciting. What he should have worked on is gradually building up tension in the room between the characters.Also, the 2 actors, seemingly right in the beginning, eventually could be seen as acting wrong for the role. The Gene Hackman character becomes so outraged so early on that you think he would have lawyered up. The Morgan Freeman character just doesn't convey the ends justifies the means person that was portrayed.I thought the evidence was forced to point too much toward one view, without the ambiguity required for us to believe Gene Hackman was innocent. Especially with the flashbacks, where it tries to manipulate us into thinking he is guilty. So by the end, when the sudden evidence showed up, we are left thinking "what about all those evidence that pointed directly at him?" It is impossible for us to go back and rethink the evidence and say "yes, it could have happened that way also."Anyway, a decent film, just don't try to piece the whole picture together and make any sense out of it after watching the film. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the first 99% of this movie totally into it. I was still in the dark, wondering "who done it". It could have been a number of people leading up to the climax, but then, on the edge of my seat, the movie completely collapses, and before you know what didn't hit you, the credits are rolling. The first 99% of this movie was so good, that after the nonsense completion, I thought I was too dumb to understand what happened - as though I missed it. Then I came here and saw it wasn't just me, that the ending was indeed a total disaster, and I felt better about myself, and worse about this movie. I suffered through the disturbing images of dead little girls for a reason - I wanted to see the evil criminal face justice. Well, we never even meet the real criminal. What a waste of time. Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are brilliant, but it all goes to waste. Whoever greenlighted the release of this movie should be run out of hollywood, if he/she has not been already. I can't say don't see it, because there is a lot of good, but the ending is everything, or in this case, nothing at all. If you love Hackman and Freeman, this might be worth the watch as they both bring their A-game, but other than that, you will do yourself a favor by avoiding this tease of a film.</fullReview>

The long dialogue between the two main actors is fuelled by geat acting, the "flashback" scenes are very well done indeed.

If you would enjoy seeing them flexing their muscles as performers and displaying considerable versatility and agility in the process, this film is for you. It is a very interior and closed film in many ways despite a game effort to open it up with carnival color, light and noise. The story kept us guessing all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that is brilliant throughout because of the battle of two actors but is spoilt a little bit an ending that leaves things up in the air. Some films need to finish like this to let the audiance think for themselves what happens but with Under suspicion is that you are fed so much imformation during the film which is fascinating and makes you guess as to what is really happening but at the end it gives you no imformation as to why things happened they way they did. It is as if they had run out of time and had to end the film abruptly. Moans aside the film is very good and as i said the actors play of each other so well that you sit their and just marvel in two men at the top of their game. Some of the film is quite graphic as is the dialogue but this does not take anything away from the film.

However, if you enjoy watching two of the best actors in the business sparring with each other, you can find few examples better than this. Hackman is perfect as a lawyer with something to hide and Freeman is unusually good as a cop who suppresses his personal guilts and motives to find the truth. The story, however, is not for the squeamish: it involves murder and child molestation, topics not everyone feels comfortable hearing about. A few twists and turns dot the movie's landscape, but the film's best feature is the two leads taking turns interrogating each other. I would recommend it to Freeman and Hackman fans unconditionally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful love story. (Yes, love)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a very intense movie. The majority of the movie was one extended scene where an internal story was told and retold over and over,while the superficial story was evolving, along with the characters. The movie left you torn between the two main characters, Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman, as the watcher you want to take sides but not at the risk of alienating the other, you end up hoping against all hope that everything will work out and they can go out to McDonalds for a chocolate shake and be friends again. They were obviously good friends of many years, but it was never explained just left up to the watcher to take for granted, which is confusing why Gene Hackman knew the names of Morgan Freeman's two previous wives but then didn't know why they had split.Another great part about the movie is that it masquerades as a suspense movie, if it was, it still would have been very successful. What makes this movie great is that it is not a suspense movie, it is a love story. The director started out with two goals, suspense and love, he saw them both through to a surprising and thrilling end.The rest of the directing was ok. A main question left unanswered is what is everyone doing living in Puerto Rico? To his credit the scenery is beautiful. Also his use of memory sequences is wonderful the way the characters physically interact with people in memories, for example handing them towels to mop their brow and also talking to them.I think it is a worthwhile movie for anyone to see.</fullReview>

This film wants us to believe that you can succeed in the rat-race to the top of the legal profession (and at one point it's even hinted that Hackman is involved in financial legal procedures) and be so gullible... If those guys are trained in one thing it's to take apart flimsy evidence and survive the assault of the DA's insinuations. See one of O.J.s lawers fall for the traps Hackman stumbles in so willingly? Every cliche in the book - and the reality (in Europe as well as in the US of A) is a shade grimmer. Not that Hollywood might bother to do something remotely realistic, but then we don't have to. The only nicety one might remark about that film is that it gives the correct comment about the "acting" of Mrs.Hearst: These women reckon that it suffices to be beautiful (a few tears at the right moment won't hurt) and not to bother about being professional. True indeed, and reason more to avoid that movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see two old pros at the top of their game, this is the movie for you. Two hideous child murders have taken place. Morgan Freeman is the police captain and Gene Hackman is "Under Suspicion". Set in Puerto Rico, the movie follows Freeman's attempts to pin the crimes on rich tax attorney Hackman and Hackman's efforts to deny his guilt. Also in the cast are Thomas Jane as an over zealous police detective and Monica Bellucci as Hackman's young wife. As the investigation proceeds, many secrets are revealed and many rocks are over turned. Most of the story takes place in Freeman's office and involves one on one encounters between the two stars leading up to the unexpected climax. Director Stephen Hopkins keeps the story moving amid the scenic fiesta celebrations in colorful San Juan. He also employs an interesting technique during the interview sequences. As the interview is being conducted, the characters are "transplanted" back and forth between the scenes of the two crimes and Police Headquarters, which in effect, looks at these situations through the character's minds eyes. I don't think that "Under Suspicion" received wide distribution in its theatrical release, at least I hadn't heard of it until it came out on video. It's a shame because this tour de force between these two old pros deserves a better fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Potential Spoiler ***Having just rented this movie, which I never heard of if it was even released in the UK, I have to say it is one of the best movies I have seen for ages. Perhaps Hackman and Freeman decided they would produce a movie which was a little different from the mainstream, and I'm sure they don't care whether it did well or not, because it stands on its own merits. Yes, the ending leaves you hanging, but it is supposed to for goodness sake, that is the whole point - why do so many people find it unpleasurable to put some thought in?! Doubt is created in the viewers' minds all through this film, doubt of Hearst's innocence, doubt about his mental state, paedophilia, skills as an attorney (one of the weak points I feel - he really should have kept his cool!) BUT one thing we are not left in doubt about is his love for his wife, as we are constantly reminded. That explains his confession, as he thought that his wife the killer and was framing him out of jealousy all along, but how do you explain his then not living happily ever after with his wife? Well she turned out to be the first to doubt him (Camille etc) and he finally realises that he doesn't love her but just the 20 year old he married... 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Freeman. Hackman. And now Belluci. Thomas Jane? (whatever).**SPOILERS**Anyway, this movie is fascinating, if at times uncomfortable, story. I like the idea of a intense conflict between these two men, without explosions and hollywood special effects. It is about the tension between two of our finest actors. Did Hackman do it? If so, why? Monica Belluci is gorgeous and cold--just as she should be. Jane's character is bascially a waste--a red herring if you will. The movie makes some amazing leaps of faith--the other reviewers chronicle that. I even enjoyed Hopkins' directing--interesting narrative structure...lushly shot...looks great on DVD. However, the ending made almost no sense. I looked over reviews and it still...finally, I put my rented DVD back into the machine and listened to the commentary. In fact, Hopkins and Freeman joke about only the DVD viewers being able to fully comprehend the ending. Ha. Ha. Ha.SPOILERS!!!!!The ending it seems was meant to suggest that Freeman (again playing a good cop...how many times does he play this?) was wrong...The scene where Belluci seems to commit suicide? Red herring. In the french original, she "blows her brains out" but decided not to go that way. Why did Hackman confess? Well...to show his wife that he was not a monster...talk about proving a point. He finally breaks at the end. He can't reunite with her. I'm still not buying the ending all that much, but I'm glad I saw the film and the ending was not pat. I admire that, but there is subtle and then there is opaque.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first came out of Under Suspicion, I thought it was a good script ruined by the wrong director, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought it was a good idea ruined by a bad writer and the wrong director.The plot, adapted from a French movie which was itself based on a book, sounded promising enough; a respected tax attorney is asked to go to a police station to give more details on his discovery of a child's body near his home, and ends up being interrogated as the main suspect in her rape and murder. With Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman in the leads, I was expecting to find a gem of a film with two powerful performances at its centre, but it was weak and the actors have given far better in far better movies.Stephen Hopkins hates to keep his camera still, and while his excesses are just about bearable in trash like Lost in Space or Predator 2, here they are out of place and oddly disruptive. What should have been a tense drama became instead a flashy melodrama. Within ten minutes of the interview, the good cop/bad cop style had become obvious and grating, and Hackman was already using words like `outrage' and `disrespectful' as he over-reacted to the questions, storming into the corner of the room to start on some serious fuming. This kind of explosion happened over and over again, to be followed each time with an apology and a careful mopping-of-brow shot. It was as if Hopkins didn't have the patience to build towards a climax and had to have a small one at the end of every reel.Over-acted and over-directed, I couldn't help thinking of Twelve Angry Men and its understatement, its claustrophobia and growing tension, none of which were to be found here. The interrogation room needed to be smaller and less cluttered, the events outside the room should have been given less importance, and the duelling between Hackman and Freeman should have been more intelligent and more prominent.Hackman being caught in a lie every few minutes killed what remained of the tension, so that the idea of a movie based entirely on an interrogation was buried almost completely. Some of the dialogue was so stilted it had me sighing and tutting involuntarily, and often sounded as if it had been translated word for word by a computer from the original script. Lines such as `We had a time, Harry and I' just don't work in English.The only understatement came in its ending, which refused to spell everything out. This should have had me thinking about it on my way out, letting it sink in, trying to understand it. Instead, I was just grateful to be out of the cinema and away from the screen. It's always a shame to see a great idea forgotten and a great ending in a bad movie.At some point I'll watch the original, in the hope that the fault lay in the adaptation. I'm convinced this was a great movie just waiting to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The start of the film made me feel very sleepy. Once I'd struggled to wake myself up, I did find the storyline intriguing. Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman were very good. The flashback scenes were clever. I left the film feeling that it wasn't that good, but it did create quite a bit of discussion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having just finished viewing Under Suspicion I figure that now is the most oppurtune time for me to review the film and share with you, my internet movie friends, my thoughts...which are very jumbled as of right now. The movie had great acting, which is to be expected from Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman who have both earned the respect of their peers through many years of acting and now film producing. The movie also had a great plot which had a few twists and trip ups. The film did not however contain a very explanatory ending. As a viewer I was left lost and confused as well as upset at how the film finished up. There is quite a bit to be deciphered by oneself which isn't the characteristic of a good film. Overall the film was decent and I would recommend watching it...and if you figure out the ending and I just missed something please e-mail me with some sort of explanation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under Suspicion....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman), a well respected Attorney in Law and one half or Puerto Rico's golden couple (the other half being Monica Bellucci) is brought into police custody under suspicion of the rape and murder of two young girls. The next 100 minutes sees Captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) and his sidekick Detective Felix Owens (Thomas Jane) interrogate and re-live the story in an attempt to make him 'break'. The acting of these three actors is appalling beyond belief, granted, a stilted story line does not help. The whole film drags minute by minute until you want to scream 'just frame him and then we can all go home'. The screenwriters then throw in a cheap trick to bring the audience back, but for me I'm afraid it was way too late. If the Hollywood writers strike had already begun then maybe that could be the excuse for bringing this movie out...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under Suspicion -film explanation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion about the story: 1. Freeman is just a simple detective, who has nothing left in his life but his job, so he puts everything into finding the killer. He has real reasons to suspect Hackman. Hackman finds the second victim, and normally he gives a statement, statement that the police HAS to check of course. Many thing do not add up, and the real suspicion starts when the car of Hackman had been trace to the place where/when first victim was killed. Fair enough I would say! Even if for Freeman is a very sensitive case, considering that Hackman was not only an attorney, but also a important figure in the island society, still Freeman is keen to find the truth, no matter who the killer is. 2. Hackman is NOT a paedophile! He is a normal guy, that felt deeply in love with this very young woman. Mind that they got together when she was in college, as he paid for her education. She was not 11 or 14 in college, was she? He loves enormously his wife, but the SICK person, in fact the only sick person in the story, is Chantal. She is extremely jealous, possessive, to the point of accusing him of having something for her sister daughter. He is just a simple 57 old guy, who never had his own kids, and of course he would feel tenure for the kids of others. Chantal suffers, besides of her unreasonable jealousy, she also suffers of a high level of selfishness. She would not have her own kids, just for a simple fact. She would lose Hackman attention and she would feel jealousy towards her own children. That i would say is sickness. 3.Hackman confess to 2 crimes he did not do for a simple reason. Years after years he tried to fight back all sort of accusations,including him liking little girls, accusations coming from the woman he loves profusely. Every second of his life he hopes that his wife, that he so much loves, will come around, realising that those accusations and jealousy are totally crazy... and then he ends up in the middle of this murder investigation. He is tired, he can't do it anymore, so he gave up! He gave up defending himself from his wife, not the police. In fact by his confection he is sending himself free from Chantal. Admitting all her accusation meant losing her, which was what he strongly fought against. 4. In the end Chantal has a moment of clarity, when her mind is cured again. She realised what she had done and she thinks of killing herself. Of course she is too selfish, self observed to go ahead with the jumping. But Hackman is free! Free of her! When she tried to approach him, considering that all he wished for and hoped for was for her to come back to him, he rejects her! HE IS FREE! Freeman realised that too! This is why maybe the name of the detective is FREEMAN... as the detective was the man who helped Hackman to become free again!!!! 5. Regarding Chantal sickness, well the explanation is simple. She knew Hackman since she was 11 years old, as he was her father friend! She lost her father when she was 14 years old, and Hackman took care of her, paid for her education... well, he became her father. Until the moment they became also lovers, the relationship should be clear.. and, this is explaining why she would feel jealousy towards little girls! She was not worried that Hackman will find a sexual attraction for a little girl at that particular moment! She was concern that if a little girl will fulfil Hackmam parental need, and will end up growing and becoming also a beautiful woman, then she has been replaced! Hackman was seen by Chantal both as father and as lover. And her only competition could only develop in a similar bound as hers with Hackman. First innocent parental love, which will grow into sexual attraction as the little girl will grow into a woman. Of course Chantal was a very confused woman, who needed professional help!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Advice: Do not read any spoilers or details about this movie, the less you know about it the more you will enjoy it. This is not because of some "amazing surprise ending" but because every line of dialog gradually builds a picture of the life and character of the protagonist, and the thrill of seeing it all develop is so much the greater if you do not know where it is (supposedly) going.Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are their usual brilliant selves, but the study is all about Gene Hackman, his troubles, triumphs, loves and losses, and how he has dealt with them -- for better or worse.Gene Hackman discovers the body of a murdered girl and dutifully reports it to the police. But there are some problems with his story they want to clear up, and as he attempts to explain them he seems to be digging a deeper hole for himself, bringing us to the title, he is "under suspicion." It is impossible to discuss this movie without giving spoilers, so I will instead mention one of the greatest classics that it can be compared to, that play we all had to read in high school: Oedipus Rex. We all know that play is about a man who murdered his father and married his mother, right? Wrong! The play is about a man who has been told he is destined to do these things. But he is not a craven pervert who wants to kill his father or sleep with his mother. He is in fact just like you and I, he finds such things disgusting, and so he spends his life seeking to avoid the prophecy. But the reason we all have to read it in high school to this day is not just because he is a good guy trying to avoid an evil fate, it is the masterful revealing of each little detail through the play that gradually reveals how Oedipus' attempts to avoid the curse have brought him directly into it.There are two parallels with Oedipus Rex. Both stories deal with a crime universally recognized as horrible and perverted, and both are masterfully told to gradually reveal more and more detail about what may or may not have happened.This is why you do not want to know anything about this movie before seeing it, because it is not about knowing whether or not he is guilty, or what troubles he may have in his marriage (who doesn't?), it is about the brilliantly written dialog and interplay between Hackman and Freeman as the suspicion is developed.One final warning. There are plenty of good movies out there that fully develop both man and woman as characters in a troubled relationship, this is not one of them. Hackman's wife exists solely to further develop his own character. It is not about her, it is about him. If you don't like such one-sided developments, well, maybe you won't like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the wonderful thing about under suspicion is that people have their own interpretations for what this movie represents.and my interpretation about this movie is that it's about how pretentious people really can be.and this movie contains a message about,bad relationships,jealousy and how law has the power to ruin an innocent man's life. under suspicion is a tense movie.the movie is dialog driven but never bores you.the flashback scenes are cleverly done and it helps maintain the theme of the movie.freeman and hackman give outstanding performances,not the best of freeman but still brilliant.i expected a twist ending but was satisfied with the ending to a certain extent.but this movie would have been a lot better if they added a twist ending and added more characters. under suspicion is one of those movies that are not about the ending,but the way that the story is told,my mom wanted me to see this movie and im really glad i did.this movie is not for everyone but it is worth a try. rating 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand this is an unoriginal production. A rip-off of some one else's idea. A remake. That not withstanding it's amazing to me to see so many spewing utterly inane, clueless critiques. The script? Unimportant it was ripped off. The characters? Unimportant they were ripped off. It's all some one else's work.Okay, really slowly now for the intellectual challenged. If Harry Hearst didn't murder the girls, how do pictures of them end up in his dark-room that his psycho wife led the police directly to? It's a stupid reveal because Hearst has been portrayed for the entire film as a liar. Duh. Remember? Hearst has a moment of clarity after he sees the pictures of the murder victims. He becomes convinced his wife set him up. Duh.This movie isn't about a lawyer and a cop participating in an interrogation this is about a wife destroying a man she feels stole her youth from her for purposes of feeding on it. The amateur-hour ending is supposed to expose all of this but Monica Bellucci can't act, the remake writer couldn't write, and the director should stick to his kid's school plays.This is a character study of Bellucci's character. This has nothing what so ever to do with the principles. They are a backdrop to a statement about the power of women. Notice too how this thing flopped in post-feminist western societies. This is an expression about the pure evil within women, and their unending power to destroy men. A motif that doesn't fly well in female-dominated cultures like America and the UK.The ending is Harry figuring this out. And it clearly leaves him a little less than enthusiastic about his gal. He's so disillusioned by her poisonous swipe at him that he knows he'll never be able to look at her the same way again. A fate she was trying to condemn him to.Pull out the noggins' folks. Morgan Freeman's character summed it all up once. You were spoon-fed this reveal in that Bellucci's character is discovered to be jealous and threatened by her own 13 year old niece. I mean duh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whaddya Do With This Thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's what I asked myself after I got done watching Under Suspicion, a 2000 film that allows Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman a chance to pretend they're doing a stage play on film. Hackman and Freeman are the sort of actors who, when on screen, cause the viewer to give up doing anything else. You have to watch them, they're that good! But even with the state-of-the-art cinematography and visual trickeries (which have become old hat ten years on), Under Suspicion is an NBC Mystery Movie with lots of foul language and implied pedophilia. It's a time waster; good performances lost in mediocrity. Even the prurient interest--Hackman's wife (Monica Bellucci), a lovely woman who appears nude just for a moment--is lost because you know director Stephen Hopkins gave you a peak just to keep you watching until he figured you were in too far to back out.Under Suspicion should be retitled Under Manipulation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film with one loose thread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was certainly a surprisingly enjoyable film. From the outset, it appeared to be a relatively cheaply made film shot off-shore. However, when the two main characters are powerhouse actors Hackman and Freeman, you could film it in a toilet on a $10 budget and still come out with some Oscar-level performances.There are two things that really caught my eye about this film. First, it's an intriguing murder mystery with twists. Some people thought thatthe run of films that included Se7en, Copycat, The Bone Collector and Kiss the Girls burnt out our desire for murder mysteries, but I think they are still one of the best film genres and more film makers and script writers should dedicate themselves to it.Second, this one is done in a relatively novel way, which is fantastic. The characters almost re-enact the murder scene while guiding and speaking to the camera. It was a terrific and refreshing way of going about it in my view. It made the mystery much more engaging and gave you feeling that you were one of the detectives in this case. Brilliant!!! One loose thread was Detective Felix Owens. This was a mixture of poor script writing, lack of character credibility and the fact that, as an actor, he was simply overshadowed by top-class seasoned performers in the lead role.In any case, thumbs up - make more of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long on Potential - Short on Delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like its French inspiration, "Garde a Vue," Stephen Hopkins' film attempts to follow the tack of a psychological thriller but fails. It might have taken the path of a pure who-dunnit except that it is far too slow, caught up within its self imposed venue and contains entirely too much trivial talk.I'll mention, for purposes to be addressed later, that the he film is an adaptation of the English novel "Brainwash," by John Wainwright, but unlike every novel's predisposition, this film makes no attempt to 'set up' the characters so the audience might witness their methodical exposure. Freeman and Hackman are intermittently engrossing during the very long 101 minutes it takes to reach the end - and it is ever the ending the writer has in mind. The rest of the story is a setup for the ending, so, if the story isn't spun out adroitly, the ending becomes pointless and you've wasted 2 hours and seven bucks.Hackman and Freeman certainly have the chops to work in a more tightly wound presentation, but their characters need more meat on their bones so the audience even cares that one or the other's flesh is being stripped away in front of our eyes. We're never given the opportunity to meet these protagonists, form any opinions or understand either characters essential facade, so, in the end we just don't care what happens to either of them.I am tempted, after watching this film, to go read the book. Like the optimistic child who dives into a mound of horse manure declaring "there must be a pony in here somewhere," I'm tempted to believe that this mound of bs must have once been a good yarn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a movie that nobody seems to like, but I just love to pieces. Okay, so it was torture when I tried showing it to a roommate who has ADD. It's slow. The action rarely moves from the interrogation room. But so what? For me, it's a joy to watch Hackman and Freeman strut their acting stuff even if they aren't moving around much. Just think of "Under Suspicion" as a filmed play, and its staginess might not grate on your nerves.Like any other mystery, "Under Suspicion" is convoluted and sometimes confusing, but I understood the whole thing on one viewing. Unlike most mysteries, this film really takes its time in exploring the psychology of the characters, so I actually didn't find the ending unbelievable at all - without giving too much away, Hackman's character simply breaks under the pressure, particularly when his wife turns on him. Anyway, I love the way the film gradually reveals more about his marriage, his vices, and his relationship with Morgan Freeman's police detective. The carnival setting adds energy and color, and the furious partying outside of the police station is, of course, a nice parallel to the boiling undercurrents of the interrogation.Two great actors, a compelling mystery, and the most beautiful actress of the century...what more could you want? A real gem among modern dramas, and one that deserves to be rediscovered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed and unbelievable, but not unreal: contains Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pretty sorry defense for the ending, but it really happens (more often than we'd like to think). In the course of a long interrogation the cops divulge so many details that they enable a suspect, whose sense of self-preservation (and maybe even reality) is worn down to nothing, to make a convincing though false confession. Plus if a suspect thinks they will be convicted anyway, they may hope cooperating will earn them a better fate, and so they confess. It happens all the time. With entertainment however it isn't good enough to say "but that really happens" when the audience doesn't buy it. The creators are supposed to invent the reality of the film in a way that is believable, and you can't lean back on the reality of life to make excuses for the reality of the movie. I like the movie, but I accept other people's criticism as well. After seeing a TV show, I read up on the subject of false confessions. So I was more prepared to believe it when I saw it in a movie. But I don't think this film adequately explores how false confessions really happen. They fail to remind the audience (at the end of the movie) the strict meaning of the phrase: circumstantial evidence. As overwhelming as circumstantial evidence can be, rarely should it eliminate any reasonable doubt. Nor do they adequately make the audience empathize with Hackman's character at the end. Everyone in the audience has had lies told about them. Everyone has been suspected of things they didn't do. Hackman's anguish is the same anguish all of us have felt, but (at the point it is revealed) the character has gone from being totally asinine to totally pathetic without much in-between, and you can't connect with him. He needs to be re-humanized at the end. If people could have related more to the character, I'm convinced they would feel different about the movie.Gene Hackman had to walk a fine line between not being too guilty and not giving the ending away. I don't envy the job. I'm not sure there is a perfect way to play it. I think he leaned toward guilty, but the choice was the lesser of the two evils.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a breath of fresh air! As it had both Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman listed as Executive Producers AND it was financed by TF1 - so there was a French influence - I was dying to see what they would do with themselves. The result was a wonderful did-he/didn't-he cop and suspect drama that always seemed bigger than the few people on screen. The plot, or rather our suspicions and Freeman's frustration and triumph roller coaster twist and turn so that you're never quite sure. Yet, it was not as annoying as some of that type of film can be as it did not deliberately mislead. Rather, it displayed the evidence being told with the interrogator right there in the picture - a device that I had not seen before. Whether it is correct that a couple of American cops would be playing detective in San Juan I have no idea; apart from that the plot hung together remarkably well. And the ending? One of the best I have ever seen in a film of this type and beautifully played by two very strong actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Dubious Directing, Bad Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film staring such great actors as Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman, as well as the gorgeous Monica Belluci cannot be too bad. This is true for 'Under suspicion', the film is a 7/10 crime story, and the reason it misses to be more than that is the dubious directing and the twist at the end which unexpected as it may be leaves too many of the things having happened in the film largely unexplained.Most of the action happens in the confines of a police station in Puerto Rico. It's carnival night out there, and the rich lawyer played by Gene Hackman is invited to answer some questions related to the body of a murdered teenage girl he had discovered the day before. The supposed ten minutes of non-formal witness declaration turn into a night long interrogation, in which many hidden secrets are being revealed between Hackman's character and the lower class policeman played by Freeman.The two act wonderful, and the director could have let the movie fall completely on the two's shoulders. However, he did not have the courage to do it, and brought some innovations to help him, probably being afraid that the film will look too TV-like, or low budget. Some of them work reasonably (bringing Freeman's character on the scene of Hackman's flashbacks), other just add unnecessary filling, or do look as taken from the TV low budget repertoire (like the interrogation rooms scenes). The end comes abruptly and it does not explain at all the well acted evolution of Hackman from full self-confidence to complete social and psychological break-down.The film is certainly worth a rental, but it is mostly for the pleasure of seeing again these two great actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is simply an overdose in magnificent acting by two of the greatest "veteran" actors of modern times.Hackman and Freeman play each other to a tie. They both perfect their roles. Jane does a nice job as Freeman's assistant but Bellucci is simply sad. Watching her stare with blank stares at everyone else in the movie makes you feel sad because she was obviously chosen for her looks and not for an acting talent that matches anything Hackman and Morgan have. In a way, this is good, her lines are limited and her confrontations with Hackman are few. She has a couple of long scenes with Freeman where he desperately tries to get some life into her character, but she is no help.I didn't think the directing of the movie was bad, on the contrary, I felt it was very good. It is a bit gimmicky for a movie of this type. Too many toys and gadgets to play with these days that the director simply had to cut and paste all over the place. But I thought his idea of PORTRAYING Morgan Freemen within the recollections of Hackman and Bellucci was brilliant. And it DOES gain more significance when the ending is revealed. I personally enjoyed this move very much. but overall, I though he used gimmicks and weird shot angles too much. I do not think he hurt the delivery.I would advise anyone who has a passion for a well-written, well-acted story to watch this movie. The ending also has a nice twist to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gradients of Love, not of Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under Suspicion is about the distance that comes between two people, when love becomes split by what we used to be, and what we are. a 60 foot hallway is an eternal night, and each night, the door slams in your face, locks us out, from our heart, from our love. No money, no success, can bring us joy in this dark night. The heart is splintered with the mind, as it slips into the mist of day, like shadows grown long, and thin, like butter over too much bread. The wavering inside, becomes the gradations of love, that mock the truth that will not stray; that is the 60 foot hallway between despair and defense. The movie did leave me with a question.. perhaps I was too engrossed to catch... but, why did Henry confess in the end? Just to end it? Perhaps he didn't want to live anymore knowing the woman he loved, was certain of his guilt? The acting of this movie was incredible. When Henry walks away from Chantal at the end, it was truly the turning point and a major point of the story. He finally let go by walking away, and that was heartwrenching to see. I thought it was a terrific film, I wonder why it scored so low with the general audience. I really wanted him to be innocent, and the further the story spun, the more I was certain he was innocent. He was forgetful, he was depressed, he was smart enough to mastermind anything, but he was at heart, a lover, a romantic, and a desperately lonely man. Bravo for a well told story by Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Thomas Jane and Monica Bellucci.I give it a 9 of 10.</fullReview>

Warning bells also sounded in my mind as I sat down to watch the opening sequence which was directed in a rather unsubtle manner by Stephen HopkinsAs things progress one thing is obvious - Hackman`s character Henry Hearst is lying but does this make him a murderer ? This is the whole premise of the movie and found myself sympathising with the angry young detective Owens rather than Hearst or the more level headed Captain Benezet and by sympathising with one of the characters I realised this wasn`t a whodunnit - it was a psycho drama , one which I couldn`t help thinking may have worked far better as a stage play but all this is spoiled by Hopkins over directing everything with obvious flash backs , voice overs and often abstract sequences that have been used before as in THE BOSTON STRANGLER and RESERVOIR DOGS and I couldn`t help thinking less should have been more on the part of the directorBut the flawed directing pales when we are treated to the twist ending . I won`t spoil it for you but I found it totally ridiculous and found myself questioning Hearst`s motives for saying what he didUNDER SUSPICION isn`t the worst movie I`ve seen this month and it is very well acted by the cast who do try to make the best out of the material but ultimately it`s a stupid and illogical movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just one thing to add...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?to everything else already said about this film - which I gave a 7 out of 10 rating due to the outstanding performances by Hackman, Freeman and Bellucci (who here transcended her fairly squarely decorative role in ways I haven't witnessed her managing to do in any of her other roles, sorry to say, so far - !), despite detesting the directing (which I suspect was exacerbated by bad editing, to boot?) - I wish to add what I notice seems to be missing from almost all other reviews (pro &amp; IMDb); the very real problem of reducing a person down by the process of police (or any official or organised) interrogation which can indeed result in a person credibly confessing to crimes NOT committed; not to make the claim that most of the inmates of the incarceration system confessed to crimes not committed, but high-profile, high pressure crimes can really become a sort of psychological pressure-cooker, perhaps in collaboration with a media circus, reducing wrong results - and thereby not only 'breaking' an otherwise OK or perhaps even decent &amp; upright person caught in the wrong place @ the wrong time, but permitting the actual perpetrator to get away with an unspeakable &amp;/or awful crime. Ironically, serial killers &amp; sociopaths KNOW that, and so manipulating others in ways which will most likely result in this sort of thing IS their thing! (I recall there was a famous case of precisely this in England with a serial killer who started during the war, when getting away with murder was relatively easy, then through a series of elaborate manipulations, resuming his murdering while cunningly framing another for it afterward.) By way of a more simple example; a friend of mine's mother was once questioned by the FBI on the basis of a matter carried out by someone with her exact same name, which mistake revealed itself during the course of their conversation and so was corrected - but she said that by the end of the interview/interrogation, she herself was questioning whether she really was the person she and her family &amp; friends knew herself to be, or the one they THOUGHT she was! Which is hilarious on the one hand, on the other hand it shows how when convinced persons in authority assert something with sufficient confidence, their conviction can be so compelling as to have unintended consequences.Obviously this movie revolves around the relationship of a very flawed couple caught up in a painful &amp; toxic marriage, and a detective who is motivated by his own largely unspoken post-divorce demons, in addition to his genuine outrage over the crimes committed and concern for the public and other potential victims (justified, as he's unable to prevent a third crime - and as a direct result, could be argued, of taking up SO much time trying to pin the first two on the guy under suspicion and in his custody during the time of the 3rd crime?), and being - as already pointed out - really &amp; truly a play, not a movie, it visits much (mostly murky!) subject-matter much more suited to staging than filming, IMO. But as-said, the acting is outstanding in this and worth watching for that, as well as perhaps this very pertinent and perhaps also primary point - which I really want to make, as I really think it matters. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've got two fantastic actors in this one, and they really do give outstanding performances. What seems to always kill it for me is the lack of believability. The story takes place in this VERY ornate police captain's office in Puerto Rico with flowing liquor, beautiful furniture, one way mirrors concealed in the wall, and an outside deck to die for. In Puerto Rico? You've gotta be kidding me? None of the major characters in this film are speaking Spanish and nobody is Puerto Rican. *IN* Puerto Rico! OK sure... I'll buy that.The Hackman character is seen several times jogging around San Juan. Yet he's chain smoking like there's no tomorrow.Aside from these realty-busters, the plot if you want to call it that is just non existent. A 1 hour, 50 minute movie. One hour and 35 minutes consist of a cop trying to break down the will of a lawyer to confess to a murder. At the end he does while simultaneously a deputy walks in and informs everyone that there's been another child murder and they caught the murderer in the act. End of story. Really, I literally could have started this move 80 minutes in and it would have made NO difference whatsoever.That's 2 hours of my life I'm never getting back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than A Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than a who done it this is a movie that depicts where a couple journeys when tender love is lost. The screenplay magnifies the pain of an injured marriage and the insult added by jelous, suspicion, loss of faith, loss of intimacy, willingness to disgrace and finally the ability that lovers have to destroy each other. The movie was so intense that each time I see it I get chills. The darkness of a seemingly blissful couple is brutally exposed during a grueling police interrogation of a tax attorney who is suspected of murdering a young girl in Puerto Rico. His frustration surrounding his marital problems are explored to the extent that his dignity is destroyed. His wife looks in on the other side of a two way mirror hoping to confirm her greatest fear, that her husband has been unfaithful. She hold onto the memory of their tender early romance hoping that at least that was hers alone. But then her last refuge is destroyed when her husband confesses to the rape and murder of a thirteen year old girl. This movie clearly depicted the thin thread that we hang onto hoping that our worst fear is not a truth and fearing that our greatest hope is not achievable. In the end two spirits are destroyed unjustly.....as a result of suspicion. Suspicion creeps in when tender love is abandoned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anatomy of the human soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's lately undoubtedly rare to watch a movie that will actually leave you with something to think about. With a weird feeling in your stomach.A sense of something or someone having secretly pushed you inside the obscure world of the true human soul. The majestic, astonishing, deepest and most important parts of you, of me, of anyone. What this intelligent piece of art does is take us through one person's entire life's most important 2 hours. His violent fall from power, dignity and arrogance to complete surrender, despair and humiliation.His realization of the truth in the hardest and most cruel way. Whether his is immoral or not is not really important in the end. Because, in the end, he is everything like us. And that's all he is... More "practically" the leading character is portrayed "demonically" by the ultimate actor Gene Hackman. No flaws, no overreaction, absolute commitment.Morgan Freeman is classically classic and he offers us yet another strong and mature performance. While Belucci is doing nothing less than what she has done already more than once in an at least satisfying way. The total is thrilling and the atmosphere shivering. The plot is simple in a most complicated style and the outcome long expected and hopped for by all those who really "watch" a movie and not just look at the screen while eating pop-corn. A huge "bravo" to everyone involved and a strong wish for even more similar surprises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of "Sleuth", that old movie starring Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine. It's so much like watching a play. Settings that don't change. Too much dialog. Too few actors. I really think a movie should be a movie and a play should be a play. If things go on like this, we'll have to watch 90 minutes monologues on screen. That said, I liked some of the dialogs, especially the philosophical ones from Gene Hackman about how his neighbors hate him because he's so ordinary but still so rich. And the other one about why it's so natural to be attracted to teenage girls ("If I wanted to talk about the S&amp;P 500, I'd call my stockbroker. Teenage girls don't talk, they laugh.

This tells you that it's the kind of movie where you have to think a little to understand why the director wanted to show you this part and this other part. Which, for me, is quite appealing.Reading the comments on IMDb, I didn't see any topic regarding the confrontation between to great and respected actors. Freeman as the investigator and Hackman as the suspect. From my point of view, this confrontation was better than the one between Deniro and Pacino in HEAT. But anyway, the dialogs are great, the Hackman character is incredible. In fact, I'm pretty sure his role his not to far from reality in some couples. Getting insecure and changing his way of living to accommodate the jealousy of his or her partner in life is common.Two thumbs up on this one...</fullReview>

Claude Miller's 20 year old French film was marvellous, energetic, spellbinding, with some real suspense in it, while this enterprise of Gene Hackman's and Morgan Freeman's is lacking in all respects. It has ambitions to break down the stagey format of the original but the outdoor sequences are mannered and badly integrated. None of the two central actors, and co-producers, manage to rise above the concept and seem to be quite at sea, apparently receiving no direction at all. So sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's talk about the ending SPOILER??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, 'Under Suspicion' is a decent movie with a cast that seems better on paper (or the movie's sleeve) than they do on the screen. This is the type of movie that would appeal to people who like the concept of David Mamet's movies, but without his cardboard dialogue technique.The films centers around Hackman, a rich and famous tax attorney(?!!) who is being questioned by police (Morgan Freeman, Thomas Jane) regarding the discovery of two little girls who have been raped and strangled. For the next 100 minutes, the police use various techniques to coax the "truth" out of Hackman. It is this process that ultimately deflates the film. The evidence overwhelmingly points to Hackman. His statements are almost instantly discredited by other witnesses, and, most tellingly, the police are, "100% f**king positive" he's guilty. With all this stacked against him, the viewer, if he or she has ever been to the movies, HAS TO KNOW he's probably innocent. And guess what?...The solution to the police's dilemma comes in the form of a 'deus ex machina' so ridiculous, that it not only leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied, but it actually insults everything we've been shown previously. If we are to believe the ending we're given, then all the evidence we've been shown is 'strictly coincidence.' Given what the evidence is (the director is just shy of actually showing Hackman commit the crime and waving a huge flag at the scene reading "I did it! Nyah Nyah!"),the audience is forced to wonder whether the director incompetently lost his way, or if he just thinks we're that dumb. It is this quandry that provides the film's only real mystery.</fullReview>

Well, yes and no.This is a gripping, stylish game of cat and mouse between 2 of the greatest screen actors of the last 30 years. Freeman as the wise cop (think Seven, Kiss the Girls!) and Hackman as the businessman on the edge (think No Way Out, Extreme Measures !)Whilst occassionally assaulting the senses through his use of jump cuts, loud music and unsettling camera work, the director makes us think, reflect and review what we have seen and question what is reality and what is fiction. The most striking stylistic device is the maintenance of the interrogation during the flashback sequences so that whilst Hackman is retelling his story, Freeman - his inquisitor, is with him in his flashback. This causes the viewer to question the truth of what he is seeing. Is Hackman the murderer or is he drowning in a sea of circumstantial flotsam and jetsam? Go and see for yourself but take your brain with you - this is no walk in the park but an intriguing, thought-provoking grown-up movie in a summer of mindless pap.Enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman (especially) display their professionalism in a suspenseful interrogation movie in which Freeman's police captain, Victor Benezet suspects Hackman's successful tax lawyer, Henry Hearst, of having raped and murdered two sub-teen girls. The suspense holds and the plot makes sense until the very end when the whole premise collapses with an unexplained and illogical conclusion.There are other characters who are significant to the plot. I will only say that Henry Hearst has a strained marriage to a young and beautiful wife, Chantal Hearst (Monica Belluci) whom he met when she was a sub-teen and began bedding at 18. Ms. Belluci plays a very important role but she can't hold her own with Hackman and Freeman, and that's another of the film's weaknesses. However, her insufficiency wouldn't make that much of a difference if the ending did not knock the props out from under the plot. In a better film, it might be interesting to speculate why the movie ended the way it did -- or, better yet, how it could possibly have ended the way it did. However, despite Hackman and Freeman, it just isn't worth the effort</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brainwashed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of the French film "Garde a vue" directed by Claude Miller, who also wrote the screen play. This film is based on the John Wainwright's book 'Brainwashed'. The French film had excellent appearances by Lino Ventura, Michael Serruat, Romy Schneider and Guy Marchand, among others. In the American version, director Stephen Hopkins, tries to recreate the atmosphere of the original one with mixed results. Although, this movie is not as claustrophobic as its French counterpart.Spoilers herein.When we first meet Henry, a wealthy lawyer in San Juan, he's getting ready to go to a charity ball. He walks the 60 feet hallway from his bedroom into his ravishing wife's dressing room where she is about to slip into a gown for the occasion. We realize immediately there is problem in this marriage. The age difference is evident; besides, nothing seem to be right between these two.Before going to the place where the gala is taking place, the chief of police, Victor, who happens to know Henry, asks him to please come to the station, across the plaza, for a chat about what the crime that he reported earlier, in which Henry, while jogging, has found a young girl murdered.Thus begins a game of cat and mouse about the present murder and a previous one where another young girl has been murdered in a slum area. Little by little Henry's confidence begins to weaken because of the evidence Victor, and his associate, Owens, pile up on him. Chantal, the wife that has gone on to the party, is brought to the station and she gets to witness her husband as he is 'brainwashed' into admitting he is the culprit. Or is he?This is the best part of the film because in extracting the confession we get to know what makes Henry ticks: his love of young girls. Now, he is no pedophile, mind you, he just loves the young girls that he cannot have, or can he? We learn about his relationship with Chantal and how it started and how they grew apart. There is a key scene during the interrogation of Henry, when he looks into the see through window and tells the wife to look him in the eye. He wants her to see him confessing to something he has not done.In the end, nothing is what we thought it was. Henry is allowed to leave as the real killer, suddenly, is found, but we never get to know who is this person. Henry and Chantal's lives have been permanently damaged. First we see Henry walking to the plaza and we witness Chantal in the roof top of the precinct. Is she going to commit suicide, was she guilty? Right after that we watch Chantal come to sit in another bench next to Henry is sitting. Obviously, finding out who is the killer was not in the mind of the director, or the writer, at all.The acting is first rate. Gene Hackman is Henry, the man accused of murdering the girls. We see him wearing his hair piece; he wants to be younger than what he is. Morgan Freeman, as the chief of police, is equally excellent. Monica Bellucci is a puzzle, or at least, on the surface. Ms Bellucci is a mysterious presence in the film.Even with the strange twist at the end, this is a movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, well-acted, but the ending seems flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a crime-drama, this is quite good, and very well-acted. The plot is pretty good, has a good pace(I don't think I was ever bored, not even a little), and is told in a good way. I really liked the non-linear, pause-action way of telling the story, in particular the recaps of the various points in the story that had impact in one way or another. The acting is very good; Freeman, Hackman, Bellucci, Jane... all great. The performances are all completely convincing. The characters are credible and well-written. The dialog wasn't particularly fresh, but it was somewhat humorous, and did get a smirk from me every now and then. The editing and the cinematography is very good, especially in the recap sequences. It's not unique, but it's well-used, and it adds a new dimension to the film(especially due to the constant changing nature of the recaps). The film has some great acting, some great cinematography, and great use of those two features, but it just seems to lose it when it tries to deliver the ending. I don't know if they didn't have a good idea how to end it, or if they suddenly had to change the planned ending for some reason. I know that this is based on a book, so that might have something to do with it. Maybe they didn't understand the books ending, maybe they didn't know how to execute it properly, who knows? All I know is that whatever they tried to do with it, whatever emotion they tried to convey, they failed. All in all, a good film, but not great. It's worth sitting through the nearly 110 minutes for, anyway. I recommend this to fans of crime-dramas, and fans of the various main actors. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Under Suspicion" has a number of stumbling blocks to get over, though none nearly as big as that facing the main character;1. It's a remake of a French movie.2. It's executive produced by its lead actors (self-indulgence?).3. The director is Stephen Hopkins (of "Predator 2" and "Lost in Space" infamy).4. The director gives us some gratuitous flesh-baring in the first five minutes.But said French movie ("Garde a Vue") was based on a novel by a writer with English as his first language - I don't know whether he was in fact English or American, or from somewhere else - and this version is a co-production with France's TF1 anyway; said lead actors are Gene Hackman (as an American lawyer in Puerto Rico who may or may not have raped and murdered two young girls) and Morgan Freeman (as the police captain conducting his interrogation), which isn't exactly the worst omen for a movie; said director made an interesting Australian movie called "Dangerous Game" and one of the better "Nightmare on Elm Street" sequels, and went on to play a key role in making the first season of "24" a success; and said flesh-baring comes from Her Hotness Monica of Bellucci (as Hackman's daugh... I mean wife). Enough said.Although filmed entirely in Puerto Rico, an awful lot of the movie is set inside a police station, with most of the main action in flashbacks - outdoors, yes, but mainly in flashes, with most of the visual razzmatazz coming from Hopkins's direction and the tendency of whoever's speaking at the time to continue their discussions in the frame of said flashback (a device that comes close to wearing out its welcome). The script by Tom Provost and W. Peter Iliff takes its cue both from the book and the screenplay for the first movie, which explains why so much of the dialogue sounds stiff and unconvincing - even the cast clearly has trouble with it. But the movie does improve and actually becomes fairly intriguing en route to its ending... which is where it falls to pieces.True, it's never really outstanding up to then, but at least it keeps you going; the restricted settings of a lot of the movie make it seem almost like you're watching a stage play, and the sleazy aspects of the plot (not to mention Christopher Lambert-alike Thomas Jane) make it hard to take for some, but Hackman, Freeman and Bellucci can make anything watchable, and do so again with this, even if all told it doesn't add up to much... ultimately, it winds up more like an okay episode of a cop show than as a proper movie. But then again, can "Law &amp; Order" or "NYPD Blue" give you the sight of Monica Bellucci zipping up her dress and not wearing anything underneath?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Six Feet UNDER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must have been a theatrical release, or they just didn't have the bucks for locations because this film mainly takes place in ONE room. Yes, It has Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman, two of the best character actors in the world going for it, but it takes exceptional actors, and supporting actors, to pull off a one room play on film. I'm thinking Glengarry Glen Ross, where you had a stellar cast. And GGR at least moved to a few other places like the interior of a car, peoples' homes, phone booth, etc. This film doesn't have a stellar cast nor does it go anywhere for very long where anything worthwhile is happening.And why Puerto Rico? That's too exotic. Maybe if a hurricane had been approaching there would've been more tenseness to the film. Then again a strong wind would've blown this film out to sea, which is where it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Routine "mystery" thriller; Hackman and Freeman are good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Routine "mystery" thriller pairs Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Monica Bellucci together. Enough said. If you like the stars it's worth a rental, but the plot is rather thin and I can't say I was won over by any suspense. I viewed it on cable television and it was entertaining for what it was, but I would never want to spend money on it.So if you like the actors, give it a go. Otherwise, stay away.3/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freeman + Hackman = worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film puts two great actors in a room together and lets them go to work. It doesn't really give them enough to work with and the story features some rather odd details and pointless digressions, but anytime masters of their craft like Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are given an entire movie to strut their stuff?it's always worth watching.Under Suspicion concerns the rape and murder of two young girls in Puerto Rico. Police Captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) thinks the culprit might be an old frenemy of his, wealthy tax attorney Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman). So on the night Henry is to give a speech at a hurricane relief fundraiser, Victor asks him to come down to the station and answer a few questions. It seems Henry was the one who found the second dead girl and some of the things he told authorities about that discovery don't make sense to Victor. He also has questions about Henry's marriage to the beautiful and much younger Chantal (Monica Belluci).Henry doesn't particularly like being challenged and questions what role Victor's ambition is playing in this case. He also throws up Victor's two failed marriages whenever he gets a bit to insistent on the nature of Henry and Chantal's relationship. As the evening wears on, however, Victor pulls the net tighter and tighter around Henry. He catches him in lies, strips away his secrets and even turns Chantal against him. But do all those things make Henry guilty or just an unhappy, lonely old man?It takes a while for it to get going, but this movie eventually becomes a pleasure to watch. That's entirely due to Hackman and Freeman. The plot they're given to work with is surprisingly skimpy on twists and turns and the dialog is okay but rarely memorable. Once Hackman and Freeman hit their stride, though, none of that matters. These guys are just that good.Proof of that is how they're able to carry this film over a few rough spots. For starters, why in the world is this story set in Puerto Rico? Adding in Thomas Jane as Detective Felix Owens, Victor's partner in Henry's interrogation, three of the 4 lead characters are mainland Americans and the fourth, played by Belucci, looks about as Puerto Rican as I do. In fact, the movie is never clear if Chantal is actually Puerto Rican or from Europe. When you're main characters are two gringos, an African-American and a Frenchwoman trying to pass as some sort of Spanish, there needs to be some explanation for why this tale is set in a Caribbean island nation. Not only is there no explanation, the nature and quality of Puerto Rico plays no role at all in the story. There's no reason why this thing couldn't have been set in Chicago or New York or Detroit?unless Hackman and Freeman, who are also executive producers, just wanted a balmy vacation spot when they weren't on the set.The lack of complexity to the murder investigation also means that the script has to manufacture too many extraneous twists to keep things going. A subplot about Victor being pressured to let double-murder suspect Henry walk across the street to give his fundraising speech is fairly stupid. Another about why Chantal has a bad relationship with her sister does have a point but goes on far too long.Belucci does briefly show some skin but while her beauty is stunning, it's not the most striking thing about her in this film. Her face seems locked into one expression, like she got waaaaay too much botox right before they started shooting. It might not be that noticeable in other circumstances but when she's paired with either Hackman or Freeman, Belucci comes off like a mannequin.Under Suspicion is a decent bit of entertainment, especially if you're a fan of its two stars. If you expect much more than Hackman+Freeman goodness, you'll probably be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would someone please explain what happened at the end of the movie? I mean who was the real killer and was the police actually trying to frame Henry? If he was innocent why did he have the photos of both kids that were found murdered, where found in his dark room? At the very end another police officer informed Victor that a CD case has been found in his car and it contained photos of the two young girls and the third victim, how did this end up in his car, and he who has been caught red handed in the third murder? Was the wife connected in any way? I might be stupid not to understand the twist at the end of the movie, but usually I always manage to understand, and this time I am truly disappointed since I could not get the hang out of it. Personally I think both actors have acted really good too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does this movie fail...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This should have been a great thriller, but somehow it never manages to be the acting showdown you expect. Hackman vs. Freeman, couldn't fail, right??? Indeed, this film does fail on almost every conceivable level, and afterwards you feel like you need to throw up. The horrendous subject matter (the rape and murder of 2 (very) young girls) is treated as if it's the most normal thing in the world, and is almost completely ignored in the course of this film. **Spoiler begins**The problem is mostly on the direction side. If there is a single point in this film, which is really doubtful, then it's the fact that under extreme circumstances (psychological pressure/physical threat) a crime suspect can confess things he hasn't actually done. Then the audience has to ask itself this question:- Why does Hackman's character confess the rape and murder of the 2 girls, something he has not done??? Stephen Hopkins fails to clarify his point, and instead he throws all the clichéd garbage at us: unhappy marriage, prostitutes and the ambitious detective (Brad Pitt springs strangely to mind). And when Hackman's confession, complete with his admittance of craving for young girls, begins, all you can do is feeling very, very sick. **Spoiler ends** Then there's the acting, which is painfully bad at times. Movie veterans like Freeman and Hackman are expected to deliver the goods, but they fail miserably. The whole thing feels forced, and the leads don't manage to convince up until the final reel, which is rather impressive. Then the whole Thomas Jane thing. He harms every scene he's in, and it sometimes feels as if the role was written specially for him, having won it in a poker game with the director or something. (Remember Salma Hayek in Wild Wild West???) Anyway, the writer has clearly found inspiration in Brad Pitt's character in Seven, with the only difference that Jane's character serves no purpose whatsoever, except being a burden for Hackman and Freeman to really flourish. One huge plus point, it has the be said, is a story telling effect I have never seen before. Almost the whole story takes place in one single room, but whenever Hackman tells his side of the story we cut to Freeman and Hackman discussing the action while the action actually takes place, as if Freeman was actually there at the time!!! This trick is used numerous times with often brilliant or hilarious effect. (Do you not understand what I'm talking about? Watch the film and you will, it really has to be seen to be believed)Overall, I enjoyed this film because it keeps you guessing until the end, and there's pretty good acting here and there. I still feel, though, that such a serious subject should have been handled more professionally, but that means it shouldn't have been directed by Stephen Hopkins. **1/2(out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In San Juan, Puerto Rico, a police captain fingers a high-profile lawyer and prominent member of the community as the prime suspect behind the killings of teen girls. It is a pleasure to watch two old pros like Hackman and Freeman battling wits. Unfortunately the film is undermined by overly flashy direction that serves no purpose other than call attention to the director. When Hackman relates events to interrogator Freeman via flashbacks, Freeman appears within the flashbacks, continuing his interrogation. This kind of technique is not innovative; it is distracting. Bellucci is given little to do except look alluring. Jane manages to be extremely irritating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty pathetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see that Freeman &amp; Hackman are executive producers on this stinker. Just reaffirms, I guess, that actors are not the best judges of good material for themselves. The truth in spades in this case. I think, as I'm sure millions do, that Freeman &amp; Hackman are the very best around, but I've never seen them work with such stiff, stilted pathetically sensationalistic material. On top of which Hackman is terribly miscast &amp; comes off shrill &amp; artificial in a part that would have been a natural for someone like Ben Kingsley.Why oh why didn't they just take the moolah they raised for this turkey &amp; give it to Kenneth Branagh to direct them in a dream version of Othello?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great performances do not, of themselves, make a great film. Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman, great actors, deliver fine, nuanced performances, and Tom Jane and Monica Bellucci also do very well in this rather low key thriller which has almost disappeared off the filmographies of all concerned.I said, "thriller", but that is part of the problem here. The pursuit of Hackman's attorney as prime suspect in the paedophile murders of young girls in San Juan, and the subsequent discovery of elements of his character and his relationships with Freeman's police chief and Bellucci's trophy wife appear, at first sight, to be the substance of a thriller, and maybe they are. But the film does not conclude as a thriller might be expected to.It is strange how much the lack of a satisfactory resolution can have a bearing on one's enjoyment of a film. The last five minutes here left me scratching my head at what had just happened and why. And my inability to accept the conclusion - specifically (spoiler) Hackman's decision to admit the accusation against him - devalued what came before.This film did not work for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Disappointing Movie I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two stars I've given this uninspired remake is only because I love Hackman and Freeman and because the dialog is moderately interesting. But acting won't fix a valueless plot. Save yourself nearly two hours and watch something else. Or go to sleep. The plot for this movie is missing a core. It has no thread to make sense of the events that take place. Re-read the last sentence--the core and resolving thread aren't poor--they simply don't exist. The movie taken as a whole is not feasible and the director makes no effort whatsoever to fix the problem, which eviscerates the story. Take a pass on this one or enjoy it at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILER ALERT**** DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DISCOVER WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END *************************I just wanted to say thank you to those of you whose thoughtful posts helped me to make sense of the movie. I actually had it right, but doubted my own interpretation of Henry Hurst's motives for confessing, and for walking away from the woman he loved so desperately. Your posts reassured me and helped me make sense of my doubts.I am a fan of Hackman, very much so, and was well rewarded by watching this movie, even though I tend to avoid killer movies and cop movies in general because they offer so few surprises. Kudos to IFC for showing this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription># 36 : Under succession of Columbo (DVD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a painful watch for me: First, this is a face-?-face: so you must care about the two protagonists. Unfortunately, nor Hackman nor Freeman count among my favorites.Then, it's the kind of movie where the law enforcers are as repulsive as the criminals. They take pleasure in breaking the convict, in playing with his nerves. I just can' stand it. When you got power, you don't abuse but you are responsible.The only moments of fresh air here comes from an innovative filming: it's a great idea to have the partners together by their speaking both in the police office and in the murders location.We could also have said "Great, there is La Bellucci" but as she kept doing almost silent parts for which glamor came first, well there is nothing new from her here.I have never seen the original french movie nor read the book, so maybe they would be interesting, just to understand what really happened.</fullReview>
