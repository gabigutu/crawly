		<shortDescription>ah well, screw it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie again last night, for the third time, and once again had to keep watching each torturous minute until its chilling end. Going through the comments index, I see the expected responses: it was boring: it was pointless: it was too long: it's a satire: the games aren't actually that funny: it involved the audience in a neato way: it's nothing new: it's been done before. So I here offer an interpretation to add to the cacophany of reactions that FUNNY GAMES seem to engender.What this movie reminds me of is the Book of Job, in the Bible, where God and Satan decide for their own amusement to torture this guy Job, killing his family, racking him with boils, and various other divine amusements. While watching this movie last night, I thought of another reference, this time from "King Lear": "Like flies to wanton schoolboys are we to the gods;/ They kill us for their sport." What this movie does is challenge the audience's own involvement in visual narrative -- usually, we watch movies from somewhere on-high and omniscient; we're invisible but we see all; we're voyeurs, just like God. In Haneke's film, we identify not with the victims but with the all-powerful killers as they set about their funny games. The two polite young men are performing their entertainments for us, the viewers; they're slaking our bloodthirst, our desire for gory spectacle - - after all, isn't this why we watch movies like this in the first place? Haneke, however, doesn't play the usual evasions; he makes explicit the audience's participation in violence; and he forces upon us the need to take responsibility for it.I find this fascinating. I also find the negative comments here fascinating as well -- "not violent enough!" "the victims deserve to die..." "all the violence is off-screen..." "no gore at all, 'LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT' did it first, with more blood...." etc. as being inadvertantly revealing of those viewers' psyche. I especially love the comment made by that one Viking guy, who writes that Haneke's film has "no point," and goes on to say "...I just hope those people break into MY house, so I can break them in two!"I think Haneke made his point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unsettling, gripping movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay... I just read most of the 144 user reviews.... Basically I wanted to make up my mind about this film, a film that is a very heavy load.I've seen this movie 5 years ago, the good thing is most of the time you forget about (having seen) it but now and then you recall it. I can understand that many people hate this film, it is not nice to watch, the more when you see it in a theatre where the only chance to break its spell is leaving the theatre. Regardless if you leave or stay and watch it leave it beats you one way or the other. I fully agree with many other reviewers that I have no idea whom I should recommend it too. I am tempted to watch it a second time but didn't make it happen in 5 years.Don't get me wrong. I think it is an excellent movie. It is also very disturbing and upsetting, I can't think of the right mood to watch it cause it'll take you down. And I think here is where the movie polarises. If, after watching, you find yourself deducting some message in the violence, and perhaps rethink violence - in both real life and movies - you will, well, also will have found some reason for this movies existence, if not - and it might be better if one does not - you will join in the 'crappiest movie ever chorus'.I do however want to point out some achievement of this production:*) The movie catches the audience in theatre. *) It does shock the audience but most of the violence is off-screen. You see more people dying in many fast-driven action movies. Only here you care. There is minor suspense, but I, personally, wouldn't put it into that category. (But then I am no horror/shocker/suspense fan and can easily err here) *) It's hard to compare it with any other movie (that I have seen). I am not sure if this is an achievement, but it's outstanding.The reason I think Haneke made this movie. or, what I deducted from it is how far away violence and death are in our everyday lives today. While Hollywood - and other film productions serve them daily right in our living room, we hardly notice them anymore. Violence also sells movies, and we're meanwhile pretty used to that. Haneke also serves violence, and he dishes it next-door. He turns into a moral figure that asks the audience if they want more (after all me and you consume it every day) - and while HERE we want to say 'no please stop' he doesn't do our silent bidding. He pushes us down the drain, forcing us to deal with aspects of the violence we don't (want to) see. He even goes one step further. He offers us a 'good' ending, a payback that would make it easier for us to bear the movie, only to snatch it back and rip us of any cheerful emotion, telling us like 'no, sorry, here it doesn't work that way'.I also read reviews mentioning the unsatisfying (often used, cliche) end. One more time Haneke manages to disappoint us, so far we were driven and didn't know what would happen, what to expect.Only in the ending, we see it coming, and so it ends, obviously similar to many other movies. We're back standard movie stuff, the arc bent and the connection made."Funny games" is everything else but the title. Perhaps it refers to the funny games built on standard film violence in everyday movies. Perhaps it doesn't. Perhaps Haneke wants to stress that violence is a bad thing. Perhaps he's just sick.One thing for sure, regardless if you like it, don't care, or hate it. You might have seen something somewhat like it, but nothing similar.If you hate shockers, don't watch it. It will only be torture. If you love suspense, sorry, only very little gore here.If you plan to watch it, calculate a few hours before you will manage to put your head to rest.And don't watch it it personal crisis.This movie will make you feel bad. If you watch it in a cinema, just look around. You're not alone with this feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most gripping films about the dark side of human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those I nearly didn't watch (I thought it would be pseudo-intellectual drivel about the evil nature of video games) - I'm very glad I got over myself and finally did watch it one day. What an amazingly done film! I've never seen such great acting in a German language movie (the film is Austrian - just to be precise); the script is full of surprises and the whole film has a tightness that is very rare; every little detail is in the right place.Michael Haneke always likes to challenge his audience, but even among his more controversial films 'Funny Games' stands out. The story follows the logic of a nightmare; uneasy tension gives way to unreal horror as you stare in disbelief at what's happening on screen. This is one of the most gripping films about the dark side of human nature I have ever seen; pure cinematic entertainment and yet it goes beyond that (and stays with you long after you've finished watching). A masterpiece ? 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely captivating...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, Michael Haneke HATES Quentin Tarantino's films. He hates the way violence and death are shown as being 'cool' - Cool gangsters executing their enemies whilst saying cool lines (And you will know, that my name is the Lord! etc,etc)with a cool song playing in the background. This is not how violence is in the real world, violence is a horrible fact of life, not a glamourous thing for youths to copy, and I think Haneke intended Funny Games to show it how it really is. I watched Funny Games without the slightest clue what the film was about, so I just had to sit back and take it as it comes. At first, I wasn't too impressed. I thought the scenes were too long and dragged out, yet at the same time, I felt a strange feeling of suspense. The incredibly long camera shots leave you that bored, that you think "Something bad is going to happen soon, I can tell...". The suspense also lasts right through the film 'til the very end. You don't want to watch it, but at the same time, you feel hypnotised by it.I will not detail any events of the film, to save spoiling the atmosphere, but I will note one thing that people tend to be confused about:- "Why did the family let them into the house in the first place?" The two characters of Peter and Paul are let to walk all over the family because of one flaw in the bourgios psyche - 'The more polite a person is, the better a person they are.' This absurd way of thinking is played on by Peter and Paul and they obviously score, plus 'getting into the house without breaking in' is also one of their 'games'.For those who haven't seen the film, I definitely wouldn't recommend this for a night in with the parents/girlfriend, but I definitely would for people who want to see the difference between death and Tarantino-glam. Prepare for a highly suspenseful yet sickeningly violent, non-Hollywood, edge-of-the-seat piece of art. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought Provoking or Condescending?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think there is a valid argument to make that the universal visceral impact that Funny Games has on audiences undermines the very thesis of its director Michael Haneke. I use the word thesis very deliberately because Funny Games is an intellectual academic statement. Plainly it is not an entertainment movie but I don't consider it to be an art film either. Haneke intended it to be neither in my opinion. I think he intended it as an assault on both Hollywood and the audience. It's the cinematic equivalent of punk. Rock music against rock music. This is an analogy Haneke draws the audience to himself by overriding the classical music Anna and Georg are listening to with some extreme punk music on the sound track. We are left in doubt that the world of Funny Games belongs to Peter and Paul. Anna and Georg and their bourgeois taste in music are treated with utter contempt before Peter and Paul even appear on the screen.Getting back to my original point: I think there are two parts to Haneke's thesis. The first is that Hollywood has commodified and sanitised violence and turned it into thrilling entertainment. Hollywood violence doesn't show the reality of violence or its consequences on those it is inflicted on. The second part of his thesis is that Hollywood's portrayal of violence has dehumanised and inured the audience and reduced their capacity for empathy and sensitivity. I fully agree with the first part of his thesis. The problem is most people do. I think you would be hard pushed to find any reasonably intelligent, educated person who doesn't agree with Haneke in this regard. Anyone who doesn't isn't going to be enlightened by watching Funny Games. On this point I can't help feeling that he preaching to the converted.It's the second part of his thesis that he inadvertently undermines. Haneke set out very deliberately to make violence real again so that the audience feels it in their gut. Funny Games isn't real violence though. It's still just a film. However it is a film that manages to make a huge impact on an audience well accustomed to watching violence on the screen. This clearly indicates to me that audiences are smart enough and sensitive enough to be able to tell the difference between Hollywood trite and a convincing portrayal of violence. You could argue that Haneke had to resort to making such an extreme film to have the intended impact on an audience dulled by years of cinematic violence. However Funny Games isn't actually that violent. Compared to the average Arnold Swarzenegger movie it's actually quite tame in both the quantity of violence and how graphically it's portrayed. What makes Funny Games so disturbing is the emotional content in the impact and consequences of the violence on the victims. This is effectively contrasted with the casual approach, understated sadism and emotional shallowness of the perpetrators. If audiences were as lacking in sensitivity as I think Haneke is suggesting then surely Funny Games would have simply have been accepted as another piece of horror entertainment.Haneke said something along the lines that anyone who stops watching before the end doesn't need Funny Games, anyone who watches it to the end does need it. This strikes me as thoroughly arrogant and is quite wrong in my opinion. Nothing can be implied about anyone who watches it to the end and there is no such thing as a film that an audience needs. Funny Games is a superb piece of cinema and there is no doubt that Haneke was fully successful in what he set out to achieve. However what exactly is it that Haneke thinks that the audience needs from it? As I said earlier most of the audience already understands the point he is making about Hollywood. It seems to me that Haneke is trying to shame the audience into realising how immoral they are for watching violent films. I fundamentally disagree with him if this is his intention. Personally I have no problem with the cartoon violence of Hollywood for the very reason that it is lacking in any real emotional content. It would seem that Haneke not only has a problem with the cartoon violence in films but with actual cartoons. Both Tom and Jerry and Beavis and Butthead are referenced in Funny Games. If Haneke is seriously suggesting that Tom and Jerry cartoons are a moral problem then he is beyond ridiculous.Having said all this I still give Funny Games a 10 out of 10. Whether we agree with Haneke or not he made us react, think, defend and argue. He also made a truly remarkable film with some of the most heart breaking and profound acting I have ever seen. Funny Games a deeply intelligent film and I don't doubt Haneke's total sincerity and moral integrity. I just don't necessarily agree with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great thriller... as long as you ignore the director's pretensions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this cross between Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf and A Clockwork Orange, two insolent young psychopaths torment a vacationing family.It was hard to organize my thoughts on this movie, never mind rating it. As a thriller, this is a tense, well-acted, and relentless experience, marred only by a contrived sequence two-thirds through in which characters behave in unbelievably stupid fashion. However, said sequence is preceded by an incredibly effective ten-minute take. Unusually lengthy takes are often deemed self-indulgent, but this one is anything but.As an ideological statement, though, this film is a failure. And there is no doubt that writer-director Michael Haneke is trying to make a statement. By having one of the psychos address the camera a few times, saying things to the effect that they have to give the viewers their money's worth, Haneke is essentially wagging his finger at anyone who has ever enjoyed the portrayal of violence in a film. This theme is certainly open to debate, but the problem is that Haneke expresses it in such a condescending way. His harrowing treatment of violence already serves as an excellent counterpoint to other films that glamorize it. There was no need to then leave viewers feeling as though they'd just been lectured by a stern parent.The last time a filmmaker made me angry, it was when I saw Independence Day, and it was for the same reason. In both cases, the writer and the director display contempt by assuming their audiences are idiots. My anger didn't really ignite, though, until I watched a short interview with Haneke on the DVD. It made me never want to see another one of his films. The man is disgustingly full of himself.So why the relatively high rating? Because as pretentious and self-important as Haneke is, he is also very talented. The movie is very effective on an emotional level, and it's possible to watch it while ignoring the director's wrong-headed decisions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Difficult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie attempts something virtually impossible, and probably only a German filmmaker would be interested in this particular problem. Watching film is intrinsically exploitive. Often the cinematic exaggeration of entering personal space results in violence. What about this?An intelligent exploration of this problem from the viewer's side is "Clockwork Orange." Therapy in that case is forced viewing of a movie, presumably the exploration from the filmmaker's side. This is that movie. Because it is about itself, it enters into a conspiracy of awareness about itself with the viewer. The intruders wink at the audience. Just before the movie begins the phase where it starts to shape up as a movie, that intruder remarks on it not yet being a movie. At one point, the action is "rewound" to be replayed with a different outcome.It is all very clear. But the challenge is not to remark on the problem, but to say something interesting or new or useful about it. That may be impossible, at least with normal narrative techniques, so this exercise is something of a waste.The one interesting thing for me is the white gloves. Most commenters assume this is to avoid fingerprints, which goes against every motive we see. As it is the only noticeable costuming, one must conclude it is to denote the cartoonish element.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Record-breaking evil all the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I thought I had already seen all the forms of movie violence, Michael Haneke's "Funny games" shows up. Two friendly and ordinary looking young blokes dressed in white neat clothes turn out to be a pair of sick and perverted psychopaths and the sadistic molestation, tormenting, harassment and torturing of a perfectly innocent family gets started without even a tiny warning. Although we can't practically see even a one clear act of physical violence during the entire film and we spot hardly a drop of blood, "Funny games" is probably one of the most violent films there is. It's so overfilled with mental cruelty the pressuring anxiety grows up to be something highly enormous. For example when the torturer orders the desperate mother to undress, camera only concentrates on showing her agonized and painful crying face when she strips off.At one point the other punk even looks straight at the camera and blinks his eye - inviting the staggered viewer to join this warped madness. There are certain rules in filmmaking that "Funny games" breaks and that's the sickest part of the film. We are all used to the facts like bad guys can never be the victorious ones. It's obvious the audience clearly feels sympathy for the helpless family but this time mentally ill and distorted thugs are still represented as the heroes. "Funny games" is a confusing, shocking, curious, strong and slow but very gripping film. Naturally repulsive, cruel, disgusting, frightful and sadistic but surprisingly good - most likely because it's something totally different. I can't really compare it to anything I've seen before because it's absolutely unique in its insanity. I have no idea who can I recommend it to, though. Haneke's work has to be one of the ugliest movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny Games was certainly thought-provoking. Haneke seems to have enough knowledge of film to infuse this movie (and most of his films to be honest) with a whole range of plays on established conventions within the thriller genre. And these on the whole worked quite well. I found the intellectual argument he puts forward less convincing though.It appears his view is that we are all advocates of violence. The 'rewind' scene sets up the conventional retribution that normally proceeds the kidnap and torture sequences (see Straw Dogs etc). He doesn't allow us that outlet however, although he draws attention to it, thereby allowing us to examine that desire further. And the conclusion, one can draw. Yes, we call for acts of wanton violence to be administered upon arbiters of violent acts. There is a further link, I feel, he is trying to make from this position and that is this desire to see violence administered is somehow responsible for the violent world we live in. (There is, of course, another line of argument running through the film about the true visceral nature of violence but that's for another post)I don't feel this is credible however. When a cinema audience calls for blood in a movie, I feel it is from a position of being completely aware that the narrative they are viewing is an artifice. People aren't going to be really killed. Hence, they can observe the violence being carried out in a 'comic' manner (bad guys getting shot in Westerns without a bullet hole appearing etc) and not have their disbelief in the fantasy world of the film suspended. This isn't misleading I feel, and doesn't inure people to the reality of how brutal and ugly real violence is. After all if one takes that approach then one can argue that Tom and Jerry cartoons suffer from the same problem. I think where he may have a point, is in the manipulation of actual real-life events to make them less unsettling to an audience. I'm thinking of the Western news reports of Iraq, where disturbing footage of atrocities are cut so the Western viewer doesn't become upset or disturbed about what they're watching. This DOES desensitise the viewer to what war is about because the fact/fiction boundary has been crossed and we can't fall back on the intellectual safety nets I talked about earlier. And why is that a bad thing? Because our government is committing these acts and we have a duty to see the full horror of what they are doing in our name. Any thoughts?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two realities put into one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr Haneke seems to love observing family member characters dealing with extreme situations. On one hand we have a typical family which one could call civilized, and on the other hand two young violent sadists. The two worlds are opposed to each other, but then in reality they meet everyday in every part of the world. Their difference is the difference of classical music and black metal (both musical styles can be listened in this movie)...But yet, what is the difference of a normal humorous pretty bomber pilot with Paul and Fatty? They both guarantee a fatal sadistic without hope end. Maybe some people have these realities inside them too. Yet Mr Haneke did not present the beauty of violence as Hollywood movies would (mainstream or Tarantino), nor he directed an hymn to violence as it is clearly seen in "Clockwork orange". The "normal" watcher sympathizes the normal family. On the contrary in real life situation, maybe reading through a newspaper or watching TV, he would feel sympathy for them for 5 minutes. The power of "evil" is presented unquestionable. No hope can survive, even time rewinds and cannot beat the violent (re)actions of these young monsters. The personalities of Paul and Fatty are very interesting as in the end they express some questionable pseydophilosophies. What's their difference again with Nazis and current aggressive wars? Maybe this is a reference to Chaplin's "Monsieur Verdoux"... The movie can also be seen through the "shocking effect" theory. We question the strength of the family especially father&#x2019;s protectiveness, but we miss the point that in reality people with normal lifes become easily victims, one can say they are conformists. The shock is less intense for a person who lives an abnormal life and is ready to protest against violence... The actors perform excellently. One must be ready for a "disturbing" movie no happy end, no cheap Hollywood violin music, no Deus ex machina, but as it was written above this is an every day incident...We cannot expect from people who are hypnotized all their lifes by "happy endings and superheroes" to credit this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>relentless but rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening credits, "Funny Games" is already playing tricks on the audience: as the film's family/victims drive to their summer home, listening to classical music, Haneke splices freakout thrash metal over shots of their unsuspecting faces. But what truly impressed me about this film wasn't the slight gimmicks (of which there are plenty, some more successful than others) but the muted, unobtrusive style in which the film is shot. Extremely long takes (like the first egg scene, or the harrowing, sparse shot of the father sitting in his living room floor, howling for his dead son) combined with elegant cinematography and lighting ( I liked how quite subtly the family's first interrogation grew darker and darker, until Paul commented upon it and turned on the lamp) never makes the camera feel an aloof presence to a choreographed scene. That is, until Paul turns, and in a Goddardian aside, winks knowingly at the camera's eye. At which point the audience is instantly implicated in the vicious proceedings. It seems here that most people get caught up in trying to explain the film's intentions. "Funny Games" isn't a film so much as a cinematic exercise in the spurious shock of violence on the silver screen. Gone are all the scapegoats of plot or genre conventions that would help make the audience feel vindicated or justified in watching, say, a man get shot because earlier he raped the film's protagonist, etc. But Haneke's film doesn't shock for the simple exploitative aspect either. When the mother is forced to strip before her torturers, the audience is kept just as blind to the proceedings as the young boy. Likewise, we don't witness the child's murder, but hear it off screen, as Paul is making himself something to eat. The films shock therefore comes not only from the brutal torture scenes but the intense apathy conveyed not only by the purposeless killers but the lack of cinematic conviction commonly combined with narrative violence, a point all the more reinforced with the film's final murder. As Peter and Paul are sailing back into the harbor, Paul comments how seeing violence in a film is no different than witnessing it in real life. The violence portrayed in "Funny Games" is so unnerving not because of any excessive display of exploitative gore, but for the exact opposite: the banal regularity of which such atrocities occur. "Funny Games" is anything but...but as is proven by the scores of reader responses, it's sure to provoke some reaction. Whether you think its fascinating or revolting, regardless it makes you think.</fullReview>

It's 'shocking' (on the DVD backcover), but it's not shocking enough (self-censored); it's 'terrifying', but actually it's interminably dull &amp; dumb; it's not radical enough (even by late 90s standards), and it's too insincere. Haneke seems interested in *telling* what the audience should see, how they ought to feel - perhaps then 'lectures' would be a better word for it than 'games'.Misery, Death &amp; the Maiden, Hard Candy (just to name a few in this 'genre') are infinitely superior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "Funny Games" (1997) directed by Michael Haneke for the first time was an unforgettable visceral experience. It was the horror that really scared, devastated, and stayed with me long after the final scene was over. I can't easily recall another movie that made me go through the same emotions as the innocent victims in the movie did, to feel the same helplessness, hopelessness, despair, humiliation, and horror. I could not stop thinking of how illusory and fragile nature of happiness and safety is and how easy it is to shatter and destroy them. Is it a blessing or curse not to know what lies ahead and not be able to change the future? It's been several years since I saw the film but it still makes me shiver just to think about it."Funny Games" can be first mistaken for yet another conventional thriller where the good guys always win in the end and the evil is punished. Wrong, not by Haneke. He shocks you, he hits you in the gut, and then, he shocks you again. Haneke's is a true horror for his monsters don't look like the creatures from hell. No, "they are among us", they are nice and polite, well read, shy and ironic, they have the names from the new Testament, Paul and Peter, they talk with the soft refined voices but they are monsters nevertheless who have no regard for a human life and who want to play their sadistic funny games to the extreme."Funny Games" is a controversial film and I've read many reviews and comments that call it "a failure", accusing the film and its creator of not having said anything new or original on the connected subjects of violence, the media, and voyeuristic audience. It may not be a new or original subject Haneke dissects in his film but how he did it, his matter-of fact approach to the material and the seemingly unemotional manner affected me deeply, and I don't think I would ever forget this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As opposed to Oliver Stone's speculative box office hit NATURAL BORN KILLERS, that actually made us laugh and thus destroyed the whole threat of violence, Michael Haneke's FUNNY GAMES turns the art of cinema into a loaded gun. The movie hits you below the waist time after time, until you feel as helpless and molested as the characters on-screen. And thus Haneke's point that "violence is bad" is made terribly clear.Not an easy task, but Haneke pulled it off like there was no tomorrow, and for that he deserves our praise in a time when violence is synonymous with entertainment.See FUNNY GAMES - if you dare!</fullReview>

There happens to be the next stop for a pair of psychopathic young , articulate, white-gloved serial killers on an excursion through the neighborhood . They take the family hostage in their cabin and all of them are physically and mentally submitted to coercion , torture , punches , kicks and many others things .Violent as well as disturbing film about two psychotic young men take a mother , father, and son hostage in their vacation cabin and the family is forced to participate in a number of sadistic games in order to stay alive . This is a thought-provoking exploration of our violent society by means of two young delinquents and how depictions of violence reflect and shape our culture, a middle-class family submits violence, and death foisted upon them by two young , unexpected, white-gloved visitors at their vacation retreat near a lake. Violent film dealing with a familiar deconstruction in the way violence is portrayed in the media . Good acting from protagonist duo , Ulrich Muhe and Susanne Lothar , marriage in real life , and both of whom sadly deceased . Actress Isabelle Huppert was offered the lead role of Ann but turned it down as she thought both the film and the lead character's hardships were too disturbing to portray , she regretted the decision later after seeing it, but still admitted she probably wouldn't have the courage to do it . Director Michael Haneke has said that he never intended 'Funny Games' to be a horror film ; instead his idea was to make a film with a moralistic comment about the influence of media violence on society , it's a subject that Haneke is quite passionate about. When the film was screened at Cannes in 1997 it shocked the audience badly enough that many viewers, including some film critics, walked out of the screening. This ¨Funny Games¨ was remade in English-language adaptation (2007) , starred by American roles , as George Farber (Tim Roth), his wife Ann (Naomi Watts), his son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) and two violent young men, Peter (Brady Corbet) and Paul (Michael Pitt) .The motion picture was well directed by Michael Hanake . Hanake is considered to be one of the best European filmmakers and Twice winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for The white ribbon (2009) and Amour (2012); as playwright he directed a number of stage productions in German . He has directed various brooding and engaging films ¨Cache¨ , ¨Time of the wolf¨ , ¨The piano teacher¨, ¨Unknown code¨ , ¨Benny's video¨, ¨The seventh continent¨ and ¨The castle¨ also starred by marriage Ulrich Muhe and Susanne Lothar .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Funny Games' is certainly not a pleasant film to watch. As the title implies, this film is about Michael Haneke playing games with the audience rather than simply telling a story and this artistic strategy is borne out in the interview added on to the latest DVD edition.I don't want to give too much away, so I'll comment on the interview with the director. Haneke takes a rather mocking view of the audience by chastising viewers who would object to his film yet stay to watch the end of it; he implies they are perhaps sick for doing so. He also says that the scene where the female hostage shoots one of the torturers, caused many people at cinema screenings to clap with relief, only for them to fall into silence when the scene is rewound like a videotape and the woman is returned back to her terrible predicament. Haneke says that they were applauding murder by cheering the woman's actions. In essence they were not. Her actions were not an act of murder but of desperate self-defence, but, hey, this is only a film. However, Haneke seems to think that screen violence is the flip side of real violence. To the director the audience's reactions to the shooting are more than a reaction to a narrative, but a condonation of an act of 'murder', which it is not. The woman's actions can be judged as justifiable self-defence whether as part of a narrative or real life itself.Haneke vainly congratulates himself for 'manipulating' the audience with this scene. However, this suggestion of manipulation is rather pompous of Haneke, as almost all films, in fact all forms of storytelling, manipulate the audience; it is part of the cathartic pleasure of watching a film and what makes cinema such a uniquely rich and rewarding experience, but this 'manipulation' ends the minute a film is over. We are perfectly capable of emotionally and intellectually distinguishing between a depiction of fictional violence and the real thing itself, and I think Haneke is mistaken to believe otherwise. This is a film everyone should watch or attempt to watch (it certainly isn't pleasant viewing), but I would take Haneke's thesis interlinking screen and real violence with a strong pinch of salt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of psychos terrorize a family at its remote vacation home. Frisch makes a scary villain, but the three actors playing the family are not very convincing, with the couple's nonchalant attitude towards their son particularly odd. Haneke is not so much interested in creating a thriller as in showcasing his indulgent brand of filmmaking. Here the German director has his villain break the "fourth wall" with asides to the audience. While such a device is fine for comedy, it is wholly inappropriate for a serious film. There's a scene where the screen is basically frozen for about ten minutes. And then there's a scene with the remote control that defies explanation. Pure indulgence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSIt is difficult to review this movie without spoilers, given the nature of the plot ....The basic story is that of a subtle form of home invasion, but without a happy ending - and this seems to be the reason why some fans seem to regard the movie as 'art'. The actors did a fine job and the production values were quite good but the content left a lot to be desired. It is certainly not a movie for the faint of heart. A couple, with their young son, arrive at a remote location for a vacation. They encounter a pair of young men who slowly infiltrate their little world and, with menace, first disable the husband (by breaking his leg) and thereafter threaten the child in order to coerce the parents into 'performing' for the two young men who take perverse pleasure in their dominance. It does not end well. And that is the departure from the normal happy ending where the good guys win and the bad guys get their desserts. This is, apparently, the major selling point but I have a sneaking feeling that some 'fans' will seek this movie out for their own perverse pleasure. I realize that there are people who like horror movies for the adrenalin 'rush' and others who are turned on by violence but I am not one of them. I like to watch movies for entertainment but viewed this with some distaste. I was not entertained. True it was tense and menacing - but not thrilling - and devoid of any redeeming features. I would recommend this movie to clinical psychologists as a test screening for mental patients to see their reaction. It may help them to understand the motivation of serial killers and/or psychopaths.</fullReview>

Please, potential future victim of this movie, listen to me this picture is cheap commercialism. Even if the director tries to immunize himself by spicing his story with pseudo-intellectual social commentary, his main, blunt motive is creating a financially successful entertainment product. I could live with that, if he was honest about it. However, his strategy is to perplex the audience with a few cheap, stale gimmicks. Just enough to keep them hanging in there and prevent them from walking out. The stupid, disappointing ending proves it and seals it. Insulting! I just want those 90 minutes of my life back and my money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*It's so great watching movies that have complete contempt for their audience. They must have said, "Hey, let's make a violent movie and show the audience how much we think they're stupid." There is a story about two guys attacking a family but I think they were sent by the filmmakers in an attempt to wink, (sometimes literally), at the audience to let us know that they despise us for liking blood and violence. The one scene at the end sums it up nicely. Another "funny game" is being played and the wife lunges for the shotgun. She blasts the fat attacker away only to have the skinny attacker hit the remote control and rewind the movie so the fat one can live again. See, it's all fake! Don't you want a movie to remind you of that constantly? How dare you enjoy the violence movies sell? This movie is consistently biting the hand that feeds it and it gets very tiresome.Incidently, that was a great shotgun blast scene. I rewound it myself to see it again. I had to get some fun out of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still freaked out and incredibly disturbed by that piece of film I saw last night. For me, yes I did get his intended message about how awful violence is, about how we are consumers of violence, voyeurs, and that this should be criticised. But, as did many other viewers, I thought that it was hypocritical because he seems to revel in this violence, in depicting it in the movie, and is very didactic and heavy-handed in the way he treats his audience. He hates his audience, in fact, feels above them, something I gathered from some of his interviews which I read. In all, I thought it was a disgusting film which yanked our emotions way too much in order to prove a point that has been done much more tastefully in other films. I've been hard pressed to see any beauty in anything around me since watching it, which I'm sure was his intention. And **** him for making me feel this way.Adrian</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seldom tried to watch the movies rated highly by critics. And, yes I do go by the critics reviews by heart. But in the case of this movie, I suppose the critics have gone awfully wrong. I mean unless the critics themselves have seen this type of genre more than enough, they would be in a good position to review this title. I am sorry but I have seen better than this and this was like total waste of time. The movie's pace is too slow, it is not that gripping and the story line is much too predictable. The movie failed to grip my attention as a horror thriller should have. These type of dark movies generally end with a sad ending or a mixed emotion ending - leaving something for the viewer. This movie left neither, the acting seemed awful, the direction was awkward or perhaps this movie could have been shot by any amateur. All in all a total waste of my time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A clumsy, groping attempt at a self-referential/fourth wall assaulting slasher flick. I'm pleased to be able to say that Michael Haneke has gone on to make an almost incomparably better film examining narrative, memory, assumption and fiction-or-reality in Hidden (Caché).In Funny Games however, we are simply presented with an oil-black farce of manners which attempts auto-development by getting the principal maniac to talk to camera. That (and another couple of poorly executed ideas) is too little presented with too heavy a hand. There is none of the sleight of direction that characterises David Croenenberg's genre-kaleidoscoping A History Of Violence, nor the more thorough scripting of Man Bites Dog (C'est arrivé pr?s de chez vous).Haneke is spoilt with a freakishly committed, self-effacing central performance from Susanne Lothar as the mother. It can't disguise the film's shortcomings though. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Games, indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't thrilled by this Haneke effort, particularly in light of his other work... "The Seventh Continent", "The Piano Teacher", etc. Haneke is capable of great subtlety, shading and rich ambiguity. His films ask questions, and, generally, they don't rely on cheap devices and contrivances to do so.That being said... Funny Games did. It's been too long since I've seen the film to point to specific plot details as evidence, and I'm quite sure that I won't be seeing it again... and probably not even its remade version. (Few are the remakes in the history of film that are worth anything, but Haneke does have two things going for him: 1. He made the original; 2. The original was pretty abysmal, so there's nowhere to go but up... and no "masterpiece" or "classic" to which the remake will be compared.) But without these details, I think I can get to the essence of the Problem with this film.First, I don't think people really get this piece. They watch it literally, as some kind of horror/suspense film. Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this is an utter farce. Especially given Haneke's eye for the subtle and his ability to bring it to the screen... it seems to me nearly impossible that this wouldn't have seemed completely over-the-top to the director himself. And when I say "over-the-top", I don't mean in that way that an "ultra violence" film is over-the-top... still regarding itself as cool and hard hitting. I mean... this was ridiculous... unrealistic... foolishly obscene, etc. The question is... why? The answer is... because. Hehe. Because we deserve it. We live in a time where we're fascinated by murder, forensics, psychics, UFOs, conspiracies, etc. We like to watch "reality" on TV, warped sadistically into some twisted, satirical smirk in the mirror. This film isn't meant to be taken literally, the way I saw it. The film I saw was social commentary. It was contrived to be contrived, because the reality we live in is one that we contrive out of the building blocks that society gives us. We live in a sitcom or a movie clip... pointing at Topher Grace and saying, "You know... I'm a lot like Eric." "Funny Games" is every bad "Lady in a Cage" or "Panic Room" rolled into a ball and spat upon. It's funny, because the jokes on us, and we're not necessarily meant to see the point unless we seek it out. It's probably funny as hell for Haneke, because you can litmus test out the audience that way. Like... "Oh, really... so you couldn't get past that totally ridiculous, plastic dialog..." And I'm not saying that Haneke is smug, that way. I'm just saying that it's fun to play games at other people's expense, for just about anyone, and when you can reach more people by putting these games in the form of film, TV, etc... all the better.But that's why, to me, it's a failure. It's simple. It hinges on one particular contrivance, and the humor is totally one dimensional. There are those who "don't get it", and their questions are nil. Those who get it get it easily. The rewind should make it clear to this type of person, "Ah, OK... he's laying bare the medium... showing that what we're looking at doesn't correspond to reality in any way." It's a device. Devices, in themselves, are generally crude... because they only have a single effect. Again, those who "get it", get it easily, and easy film-making, to me, is poor film-making. And if it were easy but raised interesting questions, well enough. It does raise some questions, indeed, but it practically answers them. The basic answer being, "People are suckers for mind-numbing violence, and they don't even know it." OK. Hmmmm. BFD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What everyone says is true, this movie takes a new, non Hollywood perspective of violence, it pushes the boundaries on what we find acceptable and definitely does exceed the threshold of a "disturbing" viewing experience.With that said, it is still a boring movie. The action is slow and the violence (for you gore hounds) is non-existent. The acting is superb... but the script itself is flawed. The characters are far too passive and the lack of dialog definitely restricts the audience from developing a picture of what is happening, who it is happening to... and most of all why they paid to watch a movie with such a slow moving plot.There is a 10 minute stretch in the middle in which nothing happens at all. This movie needed major editing.Will people find this to be an amazing movie? Some will and I do suggest that you watch it. However, don't go in with high expectations, you might be let down like I was.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy-handed Haneke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been watching a lot of films directed by Michael Haneke recently. Why? I don't quite know, probably a combination of things really, availability (UK channel film-four dedicated a Eurovision's season to his work), boredom, and mainly curiosity. When a director has the power to divide an audience as smoothly as the red sea, I take note. When a film comes along that seems to challenge its audience to switch off, look away, find something more rewarding than the monotony of cinema, I can't help but be intrigued. However, reputation and moral outrage does not, a good film make -- and the over-hyped shock of reactionary audiences could not be more present than in the backlash/acclaim dished-out to Haneke's psychological thriller/cum social conscience -- 'Funny Games'. The title, 'Funny Games', is a curious one, because there's nothing in particularly funny about these Games -- this is without a doubt one of the most unrelenting and unnerving films ever made. It's not horror, but it's tightly wound scenes of tension have a shocking affinity with 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and 'The New York Ripper'. And despite the certainty that this is definitely not a comedy, the majority of the actors still make sly, ironic references, and mug uncontrollably to the camera, the sort of behaviour more at home in a Mel Brooks' spoof than a 'serious' film. However, the multitudes off-putting contradictions only derail Haneke's subtle cinematic depth (he can be a good director when the mood suits him). Hitting us with a message that is so crystal clear, you could write it on a blackboard and even the most shortsighted student at the back could make it out.The film begins with a family car travelling through a lush Austrian countryside, filled with willowing green trees and homely lakeside cottages. The family, comprising of mother Anna (Susanne Lothar), father Georg (Ulrich Mühe) and young son Junior (Stefan Clapczynski), are on their way to spend a relaxing week of boating, fishing and entertaining with friends, a truly stereotypical portrait of the bourgeoisie. I wouldn't want to ruin the set-up, but from the minute the family arrives at their glorious lakeside home, a mere ten-minutes into the film, you can tell things are about to turn nasty. In setting-up the arrival of the two, white-clad young menaces, Haneke lays down the heavy-hand. Signposting events to the audience with glee, he makes the two youths come across like the killer equivalent of Laurel and Hardy, rather than a male counterpoint to Bonnie and Clyde. Understandably, from this point on, 'Funny Games' spirals way off track. What follows is one of the most heart stopping, nihilistic and degrading portraits of humanity ever produced. An hour-long onslaught of violence -- sexual, physical, and mental, often at the same time -- and although Haneke goes to great lengths to make sure none of the violence is ever depicted on screen, we are frequently treated to one bloody aftermath after another, complete with copious amounts of screaming from the victims and 'comic' head-scratching from the victors. But unlike a lot of commentators of the film, my negative reaction isn't based on moral outrage, but on the principal fact that 'Funny Games' just isn't a good film. It attempts to convey a serious message, but does so with all the shallow, stylistic emptiness of a Hollywood blockbuster. To those who trash the film on grounds of violence and pretension, I think you're watching the wrong kind of movie. 'Funny Games' is (supposed to be) about violence, if you know of its reputation then you'll know Haneke is hardly a close cousin to Steven Spielberg, so why is there such surprise when the events turn nasty. In terms of cinematic pressure building 'Funny Games' doesn't do to badly, there is at least a spark of ingenuity to some of the set ups. However Haneke does nothing with these sequences -- his entire objective with the film is to play off the audience's lust for violence and anticipation for characters to be picked off. His message is clear from the start, and after an hour it becomes grating.Simply put, 'Funny games' doesn't want to do anything other than shock the audience. There is no insight, no creativity and no direction -- in short, it's a film with great promise, but little discipline. If you've seen the pathetic 'Man Bites Dog' or Oliver Stone's over-indulgent 'Natural Born Killers', then you've seen this kind of thing done a million times before and you'll understand why films like this never successfully work . This is the cinematic equivalent of a car wreck, it's messy, violent and never something you'd want to be involved in, but to the spectator it holds an almost forbidden, voyeuristic curiosity. So if you decide to brave the nihilistic mayhem of 'Funny Games', and for whatever reason, find yourself feeling outraged and appalled by the excessive diversions the film takes, don't say you haven't been warned. 1/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I call Bullsh*t.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a family who is tormented at gunpoint and murdered one by one by two jerks. That is all it is about.Now, a lot of pretentious, obvious smut peddling has gone on over this film. Over and over again you will hear how it is a "scream of anger directed at the viewer" and garbage like that, as if the film's creator is really some kind of peace loving, soulful artist who just wants people to think. I call bullsh*t on that, for the following reasons.1. The kind of viewer who actually has sadistic reasons for watching violence in films to some problematic degree is not going to be affected by this kind of thing...they are going to BUY it, and they are going to LOVE it. The director, with all his "angry screaming", did nothing more than make them some more porn. We are talking about the "Faces of Death" crowd. This is a very small, private minority. The majority of filmgoers do not need or deserve this lesson.2. When people complain about violent movies, the typical scenario they are talking about is a good guy who must take on powerful bad guys, and gets his ass kicked most of the time as he kicks the bad guy's asses back. I don't know anyone who likes watching children tortured, terrorized, and killed on film. So who is the FUNNY GAMES lesson for? People who already don't like to see it? They will not like to see it here, and that is no surprise. People who DO want to see that happen? Well, they will be delighted. There are very few movies that feature anything like this, and the idiot who made this movie gave those perverts a big present, wrapped in a shiny bow.3. People tend to do what they want to do. So, if a filmmaker makes a horrible, sad, offensive, obscene movie and then turns around and acts like he felt forced to make it to teach someone a lesson, he is full of sh*t. He isn't trying to teach a lesson, he is trying to bring his sick fantasies to life, like any pornographer. The fact that he can claim to hold some moral high ground as he hands the viewers a plate full of sh*t, and makes impressionable people think they should feel at fault for what he himself did is just a joke he is playing on the viewership. He is laughing his ass off at how he made a something horrible and perverted for his own kicks and thrills and got you to call it art.The bottom line is, you can't fight violence in films by making one more violent film. And the director knows that. It was never really his goal anyway.I put this same comment on the page for the American remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as the credits rolled at the end of Funny Games, I felt as if the Michael Haneke played a joke. It was like "Gotcha!". This is a case when a director has a good idea in mind but completely sabotages it. If this was in the hands of another director, it could have been great. This is how much potential the film had.The film started off very well. A family is playing a game where they play classical music and the father starts to guess the composer. Suddenly, dark heavy metal music plays off screen as we watch there unexpecting faces go along with the music. The metal song would later be used well and then not so well at the end.The film has some considerable merits. There is great acting all around. The director definitely knows how to build tense moments. Some parts were pretty well written.The biggest problem I had with the film was the self reference scenes. I knew before that those type of scenes would be in this but somehow thought the director would pull them off well but he does not. It is painfully obvious in the "rewind" scene. I like the whole idea of the "Show. Don't tell" type of film-making. Self reference complete shatters that purpose. If I wanted someone to spell it out to me, I would read a book. The movie has a real lack of logic (How is there only one phone in the whole house of a very rich family?) The movie is tedious to sit through. It feels like a chore watching. There is a ten minute one take scene which showed some amazing acting but honestly could have been about four or five minutes. The psychos are clichés of the suave, sophisticated, and charming killers in other superior films. The end is probably the most disappointing. It ends on probably one of the worst clichés you can think of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen and greatly admired Haneke's "The Piano Teacher," I was curious to see "Funny Games," which has garnered such diametrically opposed comments. I expected to be either horrified or mesmerized, or perhaps both.What I didn't expect was boredom. But that's what I got.Imagine "The Desperate Hours" starring Laurel and Hardy as the criminals. Add a lot of sadism and take out all the suspense, since it's pretty clear from the start how everything will turn out. And that's about it. Highly unpleasant, but a snore.Oh wait, I forgot. "Haneke brilliantly lets the criminals make meta-comments to the audience. With sly winks and remarks about 'putting on a good show,' they implicate the film's viewers in the violence taking place on screen, radically shifting the traditional perspective and forcing the audience into an admission of its own voyeurism. Astute viewers are compelled to realize that they, too, have become involved in the grisly proceedings: they *choose* to watch, even though they could use their remote controls to do otherwise, just as one of the killers uses this device to reconstruct his reality in a nonlinear fashion, destabilizing the hegemony of conventional chronology in this masterpiece of blah blah blah."Double snore. Meta-commentary has been around forever. Check out some of Buster Keaton's films from the 1920s, in which characters comment on how much the stunt men are being paid for their pratfalls. "Sherlock Jr." (1924) shatters more boundaries between film and audience than a boatload of Hanekes.On the positive side, the direction, acting, and cinematography in "Funny Games" are quite good, but only as far as the script allows. And that isn't very far.3/10. Self-conscious drivel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally dislike movies with killers who have no motivation other than the fact that they're "evil" or "disturbed" or whatever. Recent examples have been THE STRANGERS and EDEN LAKE. It's not that they're sadistic... I can enjoy a good bit of brutal violence for its own sake. After all, that's what slasher films are for. What bothers me is when people try to make these movies with a straight face... to present them "realistically." Michael Myers maybe be "scary" but c'mon, who is seriously going to have his soul disturbed by that? HALLOWEEN is, by its very nature, cartoonish on a level. We know this and this is why we are entertained by it, despite its violence.But films like THE STRANGERS and EDEN LAKE attempt to plunge us into reality and make us sick to our stomachs. They don't want to entertain. They merely wish to sicken. I can enjoy this kind of film while viewing but, overall, I recognize it as a forgettable exercise in futility.Now, along comes Haneke, a self-serving Austrian with a hilariously overblown sense of self-righteousness, and he doesn't like these films any more than I do. In fact, he really hates them. Ya can't imagine how much... And he wants us all to see why he hates them. So what does he do? He makes one of the films of the type he hates, and he fills them with all sorts of IDIOTIC post-modern dog crap such as characters "breaking the fourth wall" by addressing the audience, scenes being rewound and replayed with different outcomes (the characters make sure to tell us why this is happening). Anyone with an iota of intelligence should be...well, not insulted, exactly. That would be giving Haneke too much credit. Amused, is more like it. Bored. Annoyed. You will experience a subtle feeling of having been taken for a sucker.I can imagine Haneke with an expression on his face as if he had a lemon stuffed in his mouth, wagging the finger at us for the entire worthless two hours of his sad little attempt at an anti-violence lecture. He thinks by portraying realistic violence, we will see how ugly it really is. He thinks this because either he is too stupid or he believes we are too stupid to know that, in movies, violence is not SUPPOSED to be realistic. That's what the news are for.Skip this piece of crap, folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film doesn't deserve the attention it is receiving, so my comments will be brief."Violence and the media". This theme has been explored before (e.g. Natural Born Killers). "Violence that is shocking because it is devoid of emotion". Hmmm,Truman Capote wrote something called "In Cold Blood" forty years ago and THAT film as well as the real event that inspired it were shocking. (Now more so because it ironically starred one Robert Blake.) But praising Haneke as a cinema "god"? Give me a break. Haneke's background is in theater and TV, and it shows. This is little more than a one act, one idea play. Sure it plays on our innate curiosity. They aren't going to do that ...oops, I guess they are. But not...oops, wrong again. Character development, movement? Non-existent. Plot idea: two men wearing surgical gloves enter home and terrorize family. Does family survive? Stay tuned. Moral: Don't let rubber-gloved young men into your house. Sure, you'll watch it just to see how it ends, but please don't tell me that this movie depicts deep philosophical questions about media or morality any more than a video game does.As for terror, Haneke has just taken a lesson from Hitchcock or Lynch (Blue Velvet) who have shown that it often works best in seemingly nice circumstances when it is unexpected and therefore unsettling.And as for the character winking at us, I think that is just because the joke is on us for having watched. This is a heavy-handed exploitation film that titillates the senses. The '70s brought us black exploitation films and it looks like this decade is bringing us the "media glorifies violence and since we watch, we're guilty too" films. And in case you're wondering, it isn't the violence that I object to but rather the overt manipulation masquerading as social commentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviewing this title is much like eating rotten meat. A baseless, pointless movie that puts you into the feeling that vital 2 hours of your life has been wasted.Michael Haneke is desperately trying to behave intelligent. In fact, I felt all of his movies (except Amour, of course) as too simplistic that comes up either with no logic or a stupid logic at the end. Even he can't explain what is happening in his movies. I would say, he is covering his mediocre or even lesser intellect by creating logic-less movies and finally asking the viewers to decipher the point themselves. I haven't ever seen a director who is as desperate as Haneke, trying to behave intelligent.Hey Haneke, your movies are too simplistic and totally void to deserve our attention. Go watch the works of Martin Scorcese, David Lynch, Christofer Nolan, or Tim Burton, and see how an intelligent(The one you always tries to become. No man, you are not!)movie is made!Overall, a very substandard film from an even sub-standard director.Rating 2.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Sadism, Alienation and Cruelty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Georg (Ulrich Mühe), Anna (Susanne Lothar), their young son Georgie and their dog Rolfi travel in vacation with their sailboat to spend a couple of weeks in their lakeside cottage. When they arrive, they ask their neighbors and friends Fred (Christoph Bantzer) and Eva (Monika Zallinger) if they could help them to put the boat in the water and they note that the couple has guests and an unusual behavior. While Georg and his son are in the lake outfitting the boat, Anna is in the kitchen preparing steaks. Out of the blue, a well-educated young man wearing white gloves named Peter (Frank Giering) knocks on the door asking four eggs for Eva; he accidentally breaks the eggs and asks for another four. Sooner his arrogant partner Paul (Arno Frisch) joins him and Anna asks them to leave her house. When her husband and her son arrive from the lake, Georg is hit on his knee by Paul with a golf club and the family is imprisoned by the strangers that start to play a sick and sadistic deadly game along the night with the defenseless family."Funny Game" is the movie that made Michael Haneke worldwide known and certainly is ahead of time and a masterpiece of sadism, alienation and cruelty. I believe "Funny Games" in the late 90's had the same impact of "A Clockwork Orange" in the early 70's, and I recall how disturbed I was after watching this impressive movie. The sick violence of Paul and Peter is free, and the Brazilian title is perfect and even more appropriate for this movie. The performances are stunning, giving full credibility to the plot. The last time I saw this movie was on 18 December 2000, and I have just watched it again to compare with the unnecessary American version. The most amazing is that eleven years after the release, the impact of "Funny Game" is reduced, showing how the world violence increased along the last decade and how we get used to abuse and destruction. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Viol?ncia Gratuita" ("Free Violence")</fullReview>

The plot becomes stupid and pointless. It was so boring that I had to fast forward a few scenes. It's not intense or anything. It's such a disappointment. It would have made a great short movie of 20min though! Funny Games lacks in subtlety to really make it captivating and mind twisting. I'm usually a big fan of such movies but here it not even scary or anything. I wasted my time. I usually don't write reviews but I had to intervene for this one.

		<fullReview>This is a slow and clumsy exercise in pointless violence. Think the rape scene in Clockwork Orange, but decontextualised and extended to feature length. Think poor acting, awkward dialogue and gauche 'metacinematic' features such as characters winking at the camera, referring to the audience and even rewinding the movie for an alternative take. I read some of the positive reviews but I cannot see any of the redeeming virtues pointed out. The 'analysis of violence' excuse for indulging in carnage is perhaps the most overused in the history of recent cinema. Even if we buy this excuse, it is a poor movie. It is an analysis that doesn't say anything that hasn't been said before. The media angle has been exploited a lot better in movies such as Man Bites Dog (or even its poor rip-off Natural Born Killers). More bad news: There is a Hollywood remake of this starring Naomi Wats about to be released. Same director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is simple enough - two strangers talk their way into a young family's summer cottage and proceed to torture and humiliate them for the next hour and a half ("feature film length").At one moment I was impressed by the audacity of this movie and the next appalled by its utter lack of compassion for the viewer. Throughout the picture I felt that Michael Haneke had made this film out of spite for the viewing public.There were two scenes I was very impressed with: the scene where our two young psychopaths aggravate the mother of the family to tears with a disagreement over eggs and the tense sequence where the boy attempts his escape. With these two scenes Haneke sets up a wonderful thriller but he takes all pleasure out of it by giving complete control of time and space to the psychopaths. What tension can be created if the movie won't follow the rules of the real world? And if Haneke wanted to make a statement about violence why did he bother to create such a skillful escape scene for the boy? Why? To trick us viewers into thinking this family had a way out. Haneke plays with our emotions like they mean nothing. He betrays our trust just to make a point and for that I give the movie 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nasty puritanical film, disguised as being Progressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this excruciatingly didactic flick at the 1998 Sydney Film Festival, and to say it made me mad is the understatement of the century! I would hardly describe it as a thriller or horror film, since these are the genres it seeks to deride; it's more a puritanical lecture than anything else.What's going on in 'Funny Games'? Rich family goes to holiday house. Rich family is imprisoned, beaten, tortured and then some by contrived baddies devoid of any motive. These things are depicted graphically and usually in whatever is the most visceral fashion that the director feels he can get them across, with a particular emphasis on the lack of motive or happy closures, or any kind of relief for the audience. Now, toss in Postmodern self-referential stuff like having the killers wink at the camera (at US!!! OH MY GOD!!!) and talking about the audience getting enough entertainment - eg 'we'll keep beating em up cos there hasn't been a feature film's worth of violence yet' - blah blah blah, to say that we, all of the audience, are complicit in this violence, and you have a conservative faux-intellectual's fantasy.The drawn out articulation of Funny Games' ideas is so blatant and methodological, that all I feel is this film's contempt for myself, and any other viewer who doesn't buy said ideas. And heck, probably just for the average cinemagoer who might see films to experience all kinds of feelings! It's getting up on a soapbox to attack what it would like to think of as gratuitously violent exploitation films, yet is itself an exploitation film in the worst sense. This film would have you believe that so-called 'motiveless' killings really are 100 percent motiveless. And if it's so progressive, why does it associate classical music exclusively with the family and extreme heavy metal with the bad guys? At every level, Funny Games likes to set up what it sees as high culture versus low culture in general (classical versus rock being just one instance) then says that all this low culture is junk culture and tied in with all this excessive violence that the film wants us to question in the cinema. Totally regressive!It is probably also a film that's both hypocritical and preaching to the converted at once. As mentioned at the start, I saw this at the 1998 Sydney Film festival. Now, I know a lot of the people there wouldn't give a horror film, for instance, the time of day, believing that the genre was inherently inferior. Yet these same people were content to watch the didactic sadism of Funny Games, knowing that it's directed by an intellectual Austrian and will pat them on the back in the end and reinforce their viewpoint, which is that horror/violence in cinema is trash. I love horror films, and I think there's infinitely more humanism in feeling the fears they can elicit, in confronting your mortality, and in their sincerity and imagination, than in the one-note lecture and violence of 'Funny Games'.I gave Funny Games my BLACK HOLE award for the film at that festival which SUCKED the most!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and uncomfortable, but a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Haneke's film Funny Games is far from an enjoyable movie as the family are tortured and humiliated in a frighteningly realistic manner. However, as an exploration of cinema violence, subversion of the conventions of the thriller/horror genre and the role of audience as voyeurs complicit in the actions on screen, this is a masterpiece. Almost all of the violence and humiliation inflicted on the family is off screen, the agonizing cries of the victims are horrible enough.The plot is simple. A wealthy family (Susanne Lothar as mother, Ulrich Muhe as father and Stefan Clapcynski as 8 year old son) arrive at their secluded holiday home. Soon after, a young man (Frank Giering), seemingly a friend of the neighbour, arrives asking to borrow some eggs. When he is soon joined by his friend (Arno Frisch, who played Benny in Haneke's earlier film) the two attack and terrorize the family.Frisch and Giering treat the situation as a game with rules that should be followed. Hence, after Giering wrongly shoots Clapynski who should (according to the rules) have been left alive after being counted in, not out, the two men briefly leave. Refreshingly, it is Muhe who breaks down sobbing uncontrollably after his son's death and it is his wife who comforts him, rather than the reverse as the convention of the genre so often dictates. Throughout the film Haneke revisits his theme of the audience as voyeurs by having Frisch speak directly to the camera (i.e. at us). This may disconcert some, but it is here that the film identifies itself more as an essay on the thriller/horror genre and its conventions, than as violent spectacle for the masses to lap up. Indeed, the majority of the violence is off screen further subverting expectations of audiences desensitized to accepting periodic killings in many a Hollywood thriller. Frisch asks us what he should do in certain situations. He also asks us who we bet on to survive. We're all rooting for the family he tells us. Indeed, given the conventions of the genre we should expect them to survive.The most unexpected, unusual, audacious and possibly groundbreaking moment in the film totally evidences the fictional construction of film, here explored in a different way to say, Bande a Part (Godard, 1965). Here, Lothar manages to snatch the rifle and blow Giering away. Frisch then confiscates the rifle, pushes her aside and then screams for the location of the remote. When he locates it, he rewinds what we have just seen, bringing Giering back to life and preceding to thwart Lothar's effort. This scene may be interpreted in several ways. For the briefest of moments the audience is given what they want to see - the convention of the genre is fulfilled - before Haneke audaciously and cruelly says sorry, screw you and your expectations of the genre. That the film had effectively been thwarting audience expectation throughout, can be evidenced by the fact that when I saw the film various audience members cheered when Lothar killed Giering. Stunned silence and nervous laughter followed Frisch's action with the remote. The scene may also be interpreted as titillation (indeed it is the most explicitly violent moment in the film) which erodes the film's point about violence in film being used as gratuitous entertainment (a view I don't espouse). Finally the scene may also be read as a further point about thwarting expectations that we've all acquired by watching thrillers. Haneke's interest in subverting convention can also be seen via the relationship depicted between the two killers. Frisch often refers to Giering as "Fatty" much to the latter's annoyance. This is another means to cue audience expectation. So often, as in Scream (Craven, 1996) for instance, killers working together can become their own worst enemies, ultimately leading to their downfall. Here Giering's displeasure doesn't lead to the two turning on each other, further subverting the expectations and hopes of an audience accustomed to 'the wicked being punished.' Indeed, Haneke refuses to give the audience any simple reason for the behaviour of the killers. Unlike, the multitude of Hollywood thrillers where the killer is revealed to have a history grounded in psychological or sociological disturbance, drug abuse or poverty, Frisch and Giering's characters clearly do not fit into such simple and na?ve categorisations. Indeed, throughout Funny Games both killers are referred to as Beavis, Butthead, John, Paul etc, presumably to present them as diverse and non-classifiable. Both are articulate and polite, neither is looking for their next fix and neither are poverty stricken. Rather than depicting the killers as the 'other' Haneke presents them as white, middle class, well dressed and intelligent. The only recent Hollywood film that springs to mind which draws such a complex and disturbing killer is Se7en (Fincher, 1995). Ironically, the denouement in that film dared to subvert expectations and yet (its predictability not withstanding) is considered by some critics to be a weakness.The performances in Funny Games are excellent; Lothar and Muhe particularly stand out. Haneke has created a brilliant, audacious film which is a must see for any serious film buff interested in a commentary on film violence and its effects. The film will invariably stimulate discussion and/or argument amongst its viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst kind of serious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched 'Funny Games' out of interest mixed with skepticism, because I had read a lot of the director's comments about how if you couldn't watch it all the way through, you didn't need to, etc. This seemed to me like a remarkable high-handed attitude for a film director to take, as if the inability to watch his film was somehow proof of the viewer having a more beautiful soul than that of somebody who can sit through the whole thing without dropping their popcorn.I realised fairly quickly that 'Funny Games' is not a movie in the conventional sense of being a filmed dramatic fiction designed to give the viewer a satisfying aesthetic experience. Oh no. It's some sort of art gesture, designed to make Michael Haneke feel like he's doing something special, something higher than other film-makers.I don't like Quentin Tarantino's films not because they are very violent, but because I find them boring; I don't like all the trashy B-movies that Tarantino is in thrall to, so I don't appreciate it when he cannibalises their plots and motifs for his own stuff instead of writing about real people. 'Funny Games' is nothing more than a humourless art-house version of a Tarantino movie, in which the smirking protagonists systematically terrorise a family and wink at the camera throughout, asking us if we want to keep watching. I kept watching because I was getting more and more angry at Michael Haneke's pompous disapproval of my viewing habits.Why shouldn't we want to keep watching? It's only a movie. I am a fan of serious film directors like Robert Bresson, Michael Powell and Jacques Rivette, and I appreciate films that make me think, but I do not appreciate some pretentious fool behaving as though an essentially cheap exploitation film is making some sort of grand comment about violence in cinema. Haneke is an untalented, pretentious and humourless director who disguises his inability to tell good stories by tricking up his films with silly gimmicks that give intellectual film reviewers handy talking points. He did it with 'Hidden' and he does it here. He is a one-joke phony.I am not the only person to find 'Funny Games' a stupid and intellectually indefensible waste of time, a B-movie with delusions of significance. Jacques Rivette, a real film-maker, called it a 'disgrace, a piece of s***' in an interview. I watched it all the way through. I came away depressed and demoralised by a world in which people think that s*** like this means something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family is terrorized by two psychos in an isolated vacation house. That's the whole plot. The movie is sick, degrading and sadistic (people walked out when I saw it)--but it won't leave me. I saw it a few years ago and I still can't shake it. It is well-directed and extremely well-acted and it is horrifying. My guess is that it's trying to show how madness and evil can show up anywhere at any time and how any one can be destroyed. But there's one aspect of this film I HATE. One of the killers keeps turning to the audience and making comments like, "You want to see more, don't you?" It seems it's implicating the audience and pointing out that they are just as responsible as the killers for these people being degarded and tortured. In other words we're guilty of watching this. I don't buy that for one second. If that's true, what does that make the director who directed this? He made this violent sick movie...but that's OK? He's clean because he's not watching? That's bull. Also, when one of the killers is shot and (hopefully) killed the other REWINDS the movie to save him! That's cheating and a pretty dumb device. Still it does stay with you, but do you really want to sit and watch a family being terrorized AND be blamed for it? View at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psychological horror masterpiece presses all the right buttons to disturb at an epidermal level.On the surface of this movie, the mere plot about two psychopaths terrorising a family doesn't seem to be particularly interesting, or critically, original either. Indeed, the fact that the entire story takes place in pretty much one place would suggest it might struggle to capture the viewer's attention, certainly for its duration.However, the simple combination of the mechanics of the performances, the script and the general tension make this story work outstandingly well; indeed, its isolated feel simply adds to the overall claustrophobia.Peter and Paul are two apparently genial young men, who show up at the isolated boathouse of Anna and Georg, a mature couple with a child, who are all taking a couple of weeks holiday.When Peter seems to be making a nuisance of himself, Anna starts to lose her patience with him. Paul then arrives on the scene and before long it has converted from an underbelly of irritation to outright intimidation, followed by crude violence.It is extremely hard to sum this movie up without making it sound like a highly unoriginal piece of cinema, but there can be no question it is anything but.The script is simply incredible; the overtone of terror slowly creeps up on the viewer, and on Anna and Georg, with more than a dose of psychological manipulation. Almost by pretending they are doing nothing wrong, with more than a hint of cordiality along the way, the two perpetrators manage to inflict a disturbing level of fear upon the family, and yet it is the most subtle form of assault.Rather than constant threats, the two act like dinner guests who just happen to be terrifying the heck out of their hosts.When things go further, and violence joins in, it takes the trauma to a new level, as it is gritty horror rather than a splatterfest. These are two psychos who take intimidation, violence, and all round fear to a thoroughly psychological pane.The movie is also laced with some deliciously dark humour, with a few addresses to camera by Paul, who steps out of the character and joins the viewer on occasion. Absolutely marvellous.However, it cannot be forgotten that the performances all round are simply outstanding. Each actor plays their part to perfection, and hats off to all - the victims were especially convincingly terrified, and the perpetrators frighteningly cool.Haneke, the director, delivered a masterpiece with this. It's not conventional, doesn't end traditionally, and makes superb use of direction to construct an honestly masterful affair.Highly recommended, but it should be noted it's not for everyone.</fullReview>

It's a bit like the torture porn Saw films except the abuse is mostly psychological and you actually care for the characters.A pair of psychotic youngsters hold a family hostage in their vacation home and force them to play sadistic games. It's a harrowing 108 minutes, and at some point I'm sure many viewers will ask "what's the point of all this?", but for some reason I found this movie strangely compelling. The suspense is palatable, and the banter between the two deranged captors is somehow perversely fascinating. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion - I couldn't take my eyes off it.As the anguish endured by this poor family worsens, and we become more and more invested in their survival, it begins to feel like the director himself is playing his own twisted game with us; as if he's fully aware of the torture he's putting this family (and us) through, and he's stringing us along and testing our limits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tame compared to Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you saw the camcorder scene in Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer at an impressionable age (as I did), any shocking movie you watch thereafter will seem comparatively tame.I didn't find the events in this film bothersome for a couple more reasons. One, the killers use that hipster dialogue Tarantino made famous. It's the same reason I don't find the violence in Tarantino movies disturbing. The cartoonishness makes it not hit home. Two, the stupidity of the mother and son reminds me of the stupidity of characters in slasher flicks. The killer follows the escaped boy at a glacial pace. The boy could literally go anywhere, and yet the killer catches him with ease. And then you have the mother running into the killers on the road. The way the mother and son are captured is so similar to the way that happens in dumb slasher flicks that you realize at all times, "This is just a movie and would not likely happen in real life." The reason the camcorder scene in Henry was so disturbing is because it looked like what a home invasion by sadistic murderers could look like. It was like watching a home invasion snuff film, replete with the rape of the mother in front of the son and husband, set to the maniacal cackling of the crazies as they destroy this family. Supposedly the actress who performed in that scene needed psychological counseling afterwards. I think I may have gotten PTSD from watching it. If that scene had been left on the cutting room floor I don't think Henry would be regarded as a noteworthy movie.This film had nothing close to that kind of edge. It started out promising, but became merely watchable 25 minutes in when the killers lose the act and make their intentions known.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Game In Funny Games Is Between Michael Haneke &amp; Us Viewers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mercilessly playing with the audience's expectations by giving them their fair share of hope but only to snatch it all away at every available opportunity, and making a critical statement against the violence in media &amp; its desensitising effect on modern society, Funny Games is an entirely different level of brutality unleashed by Michael Haneke on the filmgoing crowd and is one psychological horror that cuts real deep.The story of Funny Games follows a wealthy Austrian family that arrives at its lake house to enjoy their vacation. But their visit soon turns into a nightmare when two young men, whom they first spotted at their next-door neighbours, takes the family hostage in their own house &amp; torture them for their own amusement by forcing them to play sadistic games with one another but it's unclear what their personal motive here really is.Written &amp; directed by Michael Haneke (best known for The White Ribbon &amp; Amour), Funny Games presents the esteemed filmmaking playing a cruel game with people who are watching this film as he extends their role from mere observers to hapless bystanders by amplifying the violence as the plot progresses, is extremely aware of what the viewer expects to happen, and turns it around whenever there is the slightest glimmer of hope.The screenplay is another gem for it doesn't tell much about the characters inhabiting this story, gradually develops the arc of the family members through their suffering at the hands of the two tormentors, creates an eerie ambiance with remarkable simplicity and sustains it really well for the most part. The violence in this film plays no role in the service of its story but exists purely to confront its viewers, as evident in the scene where it breaks the fourth wall to ask the spectators if it's too much.It's no news that many of us are used to the violence we see in films today &amp; even take great pleasure out of movies that revel in extremity. Here, we only have three people whose fate hangs in balance and through their prolonged torture &amp; sadistic games, this film tries to show what violence actually is all about. What's even more admirable is that most of these gruesome acts take place off the screen, thus allowing the viewers to fill the gaps with their very own imagination which results in greater shock when the aftermath is shown.The story is wonderfully assisted by its technical aspects, which work together seamlessly to give Haneke the atmosphere he desires. The camera employs a number of long single- take shots to bring an unsettling vibe into those scenes, at which it succeeds. The seemingly isolated location also helps its cause. Pacing is on the slower side yet there isn't one moment in the picture that I would trim out. The real show-stealer however is its splendid cast that delivers truly smashing performances, with Susanne Lohar &amp; Ulrich Mühe impressing the most.On an overall scale, Funny Games isn't going to be an easy sit for even those who aren't easily affected by on-screen violence and what makes it such an emotionally devastating &amp; sickening experience is the fact that Haneke keeps giving the viewers a reason to root for the suffering family, even allows the narrative to follow a conventional route of its genre but whenever a redeeming moment surfaces, he just pulls the carpet beneath our feet. The real game in Funny Games isn't the one that those two psychotics play with an innocent family, but the one that Haneke is playing with us. And the sad truth about it: he's always one step ahead, here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping psychological horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Funny Games" is an Austrian 110-minute movie from almost 20 years ago. It was written and directed by Michael Haneke and is a prime example of his work, which gives us an insight into the dark abyss of human behavior and, as in many of his other works, there will be no happy ending. It's interesting how Haneke plays with the audience when, at the end, it is mentioned that one of the two is not able to swim and they are on a boat, so maybe will he drown and there will be some comfort at least for the viewer? Nope. But back to the beginning. We have a couple and their son and the two get kidnapped by a duo of psychopaths. After a short introduction, this film is at least 90 minutes of physical and emotional torture. This film is certainly very tough to watch and even if I thought it was a really tense, gripping and well-made work, I have no intention of seeing it anytime soon again.Haneke worked with some actors here that he has worked with in the past already. For me, it was particularly difficult to watch this movie knowing about the untimely deaths of Mühe, Lothar (Mühe's wife actually) and Giering. Only Arno Frisch is still alive from the core cast. Well.. the child actor is as well, but he is not working in film anymore, has not appeared in a single film in the new millennium. It is not uncommon at all that Haneke's cast does include only a very limited amount of actors and I like that. It helps me focus better on the characters and it is also the case in "Amour" for example, a film I really really loved. It's not really the cast in "Das weiße Band", but also a very good film. "Funny Games" is a movie Haneke made long before these two that got great acclaim also from the Academy Awards in the USA.Anyway, there are many really interesting aspects in "Funny Games", for example the breaking of the 4th wall on several occasions or the way one character uses a remote to move back in time and make something undone, literally turn back time. This is certainly not a film for everyone and you definitely need strong nerves to sit through it, because it's extremely shocking from start to finish. Still pay attention how you never see anybody dying in front of the camera, even if it is very obvious in all cases. Final note: Haneke made a US version 10 years later. I have not seen that one, but I'd be surprised if it's as good as this one here. The 1997 one has a remarkable script and great acting from the entire cast. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Three members family comes to enjoy their vacation in a rural and serene place. Two innocent boys come to them, then occupy them, then no one defense themselves, no one try to escape after getting time and hole, no one call any police, but just mourn and mourn and feel and see, and take part in games with the two psychopaths. And the ending, WOW what a hollowness ending. If anyone whats to make sequel, the sequels will never be ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to fathom the point of this twisted tale. Surely it can provide some entertainment for sadists, but beyond that? Is there supposed to be some point about outsiders taking out their bitterness on that lynchpin of a mainstream society, the typical nuclear family? Or is it simply a cinema verite tale of sadistic manipulation and violence? Or does the writer-director want to remind us of the persistence of evil, even in the happy domain of bourgeois people on summer vacation? This is a coldly presented, intelligently made horror film that wants to mess with your head and leave you feeling bad about things. The most interesting moment occurs toward the end, when Haneke literally hits the rewind button and denies the audience the satisfaction of seeing one of the psychos get what he deserves. Very clever - but still repulsive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pompous director Michael Haneke chastise viewers for consuming cathartic violent fare, but makes his living peddling it. The sanctimonious Haneke wants to punish the bourgeoisie, casual movie goers, and people who love children and animals. Some how Haneke rationalizes depicting extreme violence as acceptable as means of enriching himself, if it is not depicted "on screen." The tone deaf director conveniently overlooks the fact that film is an audio and visual medium, and by including the sounds of a child being murder in his movie he is no better than the likes of Quentin Tarantino. The pretentious "auteur" doesn't bother to offer us justification as to why catharsis through cinematic violence is wrong. He is too self amused shocking and abusing his audience to formulate an alternative. After all he has made a long successful career in the business of selling violent entertainment.

		<shortDescription>Hanake and his unfair lecture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you, as an audiant, are ready to be treated like a child, in a very inappropriate setting for anyone (especially children) - then Funny Games is just what you are looking for. The critique of violence in media today is fair, although Haneke fails to acknowledge what role he himself is acting in this problem.Funny Games has become an absolute hit in it's genre and has assumingly grown to be more popular than he'd first predicted. Mental, physical, really any form of terror you could imagine, is what this film is bathed in. Hanake is proving a point, that violence in media to day is excessive - that said Hanake is really just pouring gasoline on the bonfire.A fair bunch of 'Funny Games lovers' (they're bound to exist somewhere) will claim that i don't understand what Funny Games is about - i believe i do - but then again how can i know that i do for sure... I believe that the film in general is misunderstood to be sophisticated when it really is just spoon feeding it's audience with a fairly simple message - wrapped up in some of the most intolerable suffering you as a film lover have had to endure. The cult status of this awful movie forces poor souls like myself to watch it, all just for this review to be justified.I marked it as containing spoilers, because people who really don't know what they're going to watch when they pick up Funny Games, will think it's a fairly pleasant setting as the movie proceeds through it's short introduction..... From where the agony begins - or should i say "games begin".1/10 - disgusting movie, nothing less, NOTHING more. I'd have to give it a point for it's sudden fiction-interference - that's a neat detail - won't save the flawful overall performance.../W</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film does not make any sense at all. I finished watching just waiting something happens and when it did what happens? He took the remote and re-winded it: what a bullshit. Some of you might say that it has a meaning in the talks the young men had but not for me.Apart from a possible meaning everything was bad: the plot was completely unoriginal and unbelievable too (sometimes the parents did not look in a lot of pain after their son died) and as regarding the directions it was nothing special. Plus can you explain why some scenes in which nothing happened lasted forever?It reminded, in terms of director's intentions, to A clockwork orange (but also as someone said to Natural Born killer) but nothing to do with it. Natural Born Killer which is not one of my favorite movie is much more original and it makes you feel something. This movie is just an ugly rearranged copy of A Clockwork orange but it failed in every aspect. After watching it left me nothing. A total waste of time.MY ADVICE: DO NOT WATCH IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Justify it any way you want, this film only reinforces that we are desensitized to the pornographic celebration of violence.Hopefully it makes people aware of that, but if you already know it, and see how much money is being made by 'Saw',and all of the murder movies, and television shows. Judge by the attitudes of kids who think knocking people out and filming it for Youtube are entertaining after being entertained by the violence-porn industry. We are more separated from compassion, more complacent, and less shocked by the violence around us until we are overwhelmed as more casual violence destroys us more every day. This movie has no redeeming value. i don't care how any reviews here defend this as 'art'. it is not. You don't need to see this movie, OR it's English remake. Hollywood has plenty more to sell you.

Of course at Babbo you pay 11 dollars for a small slice of jellied pig head and feel grateful for it. In the end. no matter how much you pretty it up. It is still head cheese. Pompus, over-priced, and and in the end... brains, and entrails and crap. No matter how enlightened you think you because you love this movie... this is endless. Its a film that drags on over the silliest points. Suspense? no. Horror. No. Its just endless talking about nothing. The violence is mindless. The violence is endless. And yet... there are those who eat the head cheese and roll their eyes and talk about the primal nature of the animal they are consuming and tasting the meaning of a pig.Just because it is unconventional... just because it is different... does not connote or denote quality.

		<shortDescription>Third rate cinema masquerading as art cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt Michael Haneke is sincere in his use of film to tell stories but I suspect he is surprised at the critical acclaim he has received as I also suspect he knows that his stories are not particularly clever and his techniques not that original. Funny Games is yet a further example of his style in action. Find a plot with unpleasant themes, throw in some 'alternative' techniques (there's good reasons why such techniques aren't usually used), shock the audience into taking notice (possibly keep them awake) and hope the critics don't notice how empty and mediocre the production actually is. He's fooled people before Funny Games with the phoney mystery in Hidden and fooled people since with the overplayed understatement of Amour. The central themes to Haneke's work are potentially interesting but the ways in which they are dealt with are needlessly complex to the point where they don't provide insights or develop deeper understanding. Well composed shots with interesting Mise-en-sc?ne are not enough to make a film memorable and long takes of little happening end up as distracting rather than revealing. Film critics looking for 'art cinema' upon which to heap praise are fooled into thinking they're dealing with something profound when in truth it's third rate cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, it is the movie poster that captures your imagination about the movie. And, this time (unfortunately), it caught mine too. I was captivated by "See if you dare and stuff" and some nice reviews. I kept daring till the end to watch something shattering which will keep me in blank state at least for an hour or so. But, alas.Sometimes you do crave to watch movies which make you feel bad about the world so that you yourself feel "being good". Movie achieves that. Not intentionally but with its slow pace and uninteresting plot.No doubt that you will find acting very good. Everyone gave their best performances. But, due to intentionally "uninteresting" treatment given to the film, it makes it real boring. I mean there are movies which makes you blood boiling with the in-sensitivities in the world. For example, take a scene where Dr.Lessing is all concerned with the puzzles, in "Life is Beautiful", when Guido and his son is at stake. You feel bad. Or for that matter, check out the end of Eden Lake. You will get to see good and bad of everything.Here, with this movie, I was feeling bad only because it was not funny and was not ending soon.Only point it gets bit interesting is when after killing their son; Paul and Peter suddenly disappears. It makes you think that something interesting is coming. But, I would consider that Paul or Peter fast forwarded the movie (like in other shot); to save us from more boring scenes.Funny.So Michael, don't feel bad. But, being more clear on what you want to show instead of letting us judge what you want to show would have helped us (me at least)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Funny Games" is definitely one of those movies that divide audiences. It's controversial. Many of the reviewers seem to really hate this movie, and I have to say, that I also didn't really like it. But that cannot be understood in a negative way, because it's not meant to be a movie that is "liked". However, I do pay a lot of respect to Michael Haneke for bringing a statement that he really believes in to the big screen without making compromises. It is a movie that really has an opinion on violence in the media, an opinion I'm not quite sure to share, but I'm stunned by the artistry, with which Haneke makes this statement. If you're making a film that wants to teach things to its audience, it's difficult to stay on a certain level of subtlety. This is the point where Haneke seems to fail partly in "Funny Games". "Caché" on the other hand, which has a similar topic, was a full success. "Funny Games" is an important and talked-about film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Are You Watching This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike my other reviews that have been about the films themselves, this will describe the effect it had on me. Just to clarify, I am an 18-year-old Brit who has seen more than his fair share of violent films, and I thought I could take the content of this one.When I noticed in a listing magazine that Funny Games was being shown, I looked forward to it. I had heard that it was a film about the corrosive nature of movie violence, and contained many unpleasant sequences. This is, of course, the other reason I wanted to see it, the reason I did not admit to myself: I wanted to see the violence.As I was watching the film, I found some of the scenes unpleasant, and understood and agreed with the moral subtext. I wondered in my mind during the commercial breaks who would play the leads in an American remake of the film. It was only towards the end that it occured to me that no-one was going to survive, and that my boredom during long, uneventful shots was partly because I wanted something violent to occur. As the deafening thrash metal played over the end credits, and Paul's empty smile gazed at me, it finally dawned on me what was happening. I did not find the violence in Funny Games repulsive because I have myself become desensitized to it. That is the genius of Haneke. If you decide to walk out of the cinema/turn off your TV/press stop on your VCR, you will have lost the game of Chicken that not only Haneke, but also Peter and Paul are playing with you. You will probably get out unscathed and you will know your limits. If you decide to stay to the end, you win the game, but at what cost? If, like me, you did find such suffering and humiliation intolerable, is that not more disturbing than any violent act you can possibly imagine?That night, I couldn't sleep.</fullReview>

Little did I know that this film would disturb me more than any other I have ever seen. To this day I am still haunted by the story, the visual images and, above all else, the brilliant performance given by Susanne Lothar.An affluent family take holiday at their lakeside home and soon encounter two young men who, without cause or provocation, turn their vacation into a living hell. The why is unimportant and, in fact, never really made clear. It is the how, the layout of the nightmare, which takes you by surprise and leaves you in utter disbelief. Like stumbling upon a horrific traffic accident, you instinctively feel the need to look away and at the same time you cannot bring yourself to avoid witnessing the carnage.Without giving anything away-and, honestly, this is a movie one has to see for one's self to appreciate the sheer horror-I have to make mention again of the gut-wrenching performance of Susanne Lothar as the mother, Anna. What an actress!If blood and guts is your thing, this movie is not for you. If, on the other hand, psychological terror captivates your imagination, Funny Games is worth checking out.

It's incredibly well directed, and I've honestly never seen any actors do what Lothar and Muhe do here. Anyone who thinks terrible fascist movies like Oliver Stone's "Natural born killers" have some kind of point, or anything interesting to say should try this one...

		<fullReview>This haunting piece of violent cinema, (and all of it happens off screen!), is the type of film that would have definitely converted the naughty Alex, (Malcolm McDowell), from CLOCKWORK ORANGE, into a civilized citizen. The pain and agony of the victims has you scratching at the exit doors but you can't get out because you want to sit through to the very end, hoping to get a revenge scenario to occur. Michael Haneke does not give us that pleasure. It is frightening and very uncomfortable to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put. Boring. I had seen this thing suggested through a number of lists. I didn't know anything about it going in. It's boring. It's supposed to be some psychological thriller horror or such. But, I just kept getting bored. It showed up on a whole bunch of bucket lists. This should be the last movie you watch on your bucket list, as you might just die of boredom. Don't risk it. I apparently have to pad this out to 10 lines so SPOILERS from here on out. A couple of guys harass a German family on vacation. I'm pretty sure the little kid could have beat both of them up, but the family keeps just letting a couple of boring idiots tell them what to do. They apparently killed the dog, but I suspect they just told the dog their plan and he died of boredom. BORING! Simply put. BORING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you would expect with Haneke it is wonderfully filmed. I forced myself to watch it to the end and wished that someone had advised me initially not to watch it. It is a film that disturbs and takes away.It gives nothing to explore in the wonder of humanity or a purpose of a redemptive spirit. Why watch a film that leaves yourself with less than when you started watching it? I disliked the effect it had the I removed the 2 DVDs from the box set and put them in the bin. Extreme enough to not want the content on site and yet Haneke's other films inspire and provoke such thoughts of us and our choices and our faith and the working through of love;real love that creates action and meditation/prayer.Advice: choose not to watch it; there is strength in this discipline and advice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very original and disturbing movie. This movie have some positives and negatives aspects, human beings can be very bad doing violent stuff just to see another one suffer... After I saw this movie, I will double my cautions before open my door to ANY stranger. But, why killers used surgical gloves? There is not relation for leaving digital prints. Why the victims didn't suspected when see two strangers in surgical gloves? Why the parents didn't get crazy after seeing his kid dead? The mom didn't react after the killer shoot his son... If someone shoot my family, my angry will raise, and I'll get his life, even if I died too. When killers leave the house first time, why the victims didn't take weapons, like a big knife or golf club??? And the final question: why the killer have control of time and space, using remote control? That was definitely the last straw. Do not watch this movie with your family, girlfriend... Very disturbing, not very realistic...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I'm a huge Kubrick fan, but I find 'A Clockwork Orange' a kind of miscalculation, because he makes the brutality so spectacular - so stylized, with dance numbers and so on - that you almost have to admire it. It's incredibly difficult to present violence on-screen in a responsible manner. I would never claim to be cleverer than Kubrick, but I have the advantage of making my films after he made his." ? Michael Haneke"All you can do is either pose questions or make truthful observations about human behaviour. The only morality is not to be dishonest." ? Stanley KubrickThough marketed as a horror film, "Funny Games" is an ice-cold comedy by the notoriously frigid Michael Haneke. References to "The Shining", "A Clockwork Orange" and Disney movies (the film's villains wear Mickey Mouse gloves) abound, Haneke subjecting his audience - and the family at the heart of his film - to an orgy of sustained violence and abuse.The plot is simple: a bourgeois family is assaulted by a pair of villains reminiscent of the droogs from Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange". The family are tortured, fight back and win, at which point the film we're watching is rewound and a new outcome is inserted in which the intruders successfully kill the family. Despite its aloof tone, this is a fairly simple satire on media violence. The point: violence always has a sexual/power element, the audience is always complicit, on screen violence is often titillative and exploitative, audiences seek decontextualized violence and most violent films offer some catharsis as penance for the audience's complicity. Many complain that the film is manipulative, pretentious and patronising. But Haneke's very point is that violent films are manipulative, patronising and that no amount of pretence removes the fact that their machinations are identical to his own film. Others complain that the film warns against violence but is itself violent, and this is true to an extent. Though Haneke employs various distancing effects, his self-reflexive style is now the very norm of cinematic violence (most violence is now meta-violence, ironic or self aware), the result being that the once critical function of "Funny Games" has been diluted.Nevertheless, Haneke clearly admits that he is the antagonist of his film, the artist aligning himself firmly with his droogs and their violence. It's no coincidence that the father in Haneke's "Funny Games", "Benny's Video" and "Cache" sport the same name: all are tormented by "films" forced upon them by Haneke. In other words, Haneke's very point is that the artist is as complicit as the audience, and that artists have a social responsibility.Some viewers then ask why, if directors and writers are equally complicit, doesn't Haneke present violence in a responsi-?and then the light-bulb flashes. No other Haneke film presents violence as "Games" does. He's one of the few directors who habitually portrays violence responsibly, though one wonders if such films are exercises in futility. Haneke's "The White Ribbon", for example, was an attempt to address the problems of "Schindler's List" ("Spielberg meant well, but it was dumb. [?] You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States." ? Haneke), but no one went to see it. He's since made two versions of "Funny Games", both of which under performed, the original, quite ironically, released in the US at the same time as the ultra violent mega-hit "Saving Private Ryan". Whether Haneke likes it or not, the public salivates over violence today as much as they did during Gladatorial times.Though he can't touch Kubrick's Olympian visuals ("Funny Game's" opening shots are "The Shining's" minus the grandeur) and though he's in love with a kind of banal realism, Haneke's aesthetic is nevertheless still very Kubrickean. He uses a variety of Brechtian techniques, takes his scalpel to the usual Hollywood's catharses ("Funny Games" denies its audience the vengeful conclusions of "Straw Dogs", "Death Wish" etc), makes heavy use of Kubrickean symmetries, traps his actors in head-to-toe framings or rigid head and shoulder close ups and hits us with several recurring motifs, most notably the white sphere ("2001: A Space Odyssey"?), in the form of eggs, golf balls and a child's head wrapped in a pillow case.What this film lacks, though, is Kubrick's scope. Haneke views "Funny Games" as the "big brother" of Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" (the American version of "Funny Games" even copies Kubrick's famous "Clockwork" trailer), and believes that it "fixes" the problems of violence which Kubrick's film has. But that assumes that "Clockwork" is some banal "anti violence" tract. While "Clockwork" touches upon some of the themes of "Games" ? the violence is always "staged" as a "play" for the audience, the droogs are always rewarded by their complicit audience, the film is framed as a Ludovico film "forced upon" its spectators etc ? Kubrick's film is not "anti violence" but advocating a kind of radical ultra-violence. Unlike the modernist future of "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Clockwork" asks how is it possible to transcend the end of history, and posits a postmodern future in which ultra-violence becomes the only rational form of expression in a society in which the mass assembly/production give rise, not only to commodity fetishism, the destruction of authenticity and the collapse in the distance between art and the masses, but to cultural impotency and the death or decontextualization of art. Kubrick's central character, Alex De Large, as a criminal-artist, therefore embodies the last vestiges of a sort of creative freedom (the true "free will", or "creative expression" of the picture) who initiates the violent reversal of commodification and turns art back into a tool of violence. This is the opposite of "Funny Games", Kubrick pushing Haneke's "logic" much further, heralding Alex as the logical (even necessary) outcome of the very society of "clockwork" voyeurs and spectators that Haneke derides.8/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most manipulative film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All films manipulate the audience - of course that's true, just by their nature. But watching this film, you just get the feeling that the director feels he's so much smarter than his audience. If you get the DVD, there is an interview with the director, where he says something like, "If you watched the film to the end, then you needed to see it to the end." Basically he's saying that if you watch the whole film, then you're the type of person who needs to learn the lesson about how violent movies manipulate their audiences, how they engage the audiences to cheer the violence. That's a pretty bloody conceited and arrogant stance. Also, in the interview, he says that he hates writers who think of their characters as weak or unintelligent, and that he himself gives his characters intelligence. This is a lie. The wife in this film is an idiot. When she first meets one of the attackers, he seems harmless enough, but he's wearing surgical gloves. She doesn't find this the least bit odd? She doesn't even seem to notice, though when she hands him some eggs, her hands touch his. And then a little later she has a chance to get help, when a boat full of her friends pulls up to her dock. All she has to do is tell them to call the police, because at this point the attackers have already killed her dog and broken her husband's knee - so she knows they're serious. But she doesn't do this. She gives no indication that anything is wrong at all. In fact, she goes out of her way to show that everything is normal, even introducing one of the villains to her friends (which then leads to the predictable and annoying ending). So how intelligent does the director really consider this character? I have a problem with films in which a character can do something very obvious which will end the story right there, but doesn't do it. Still, the film has some pretty amazing moments, and is still worth watching. I thought about giving it a 5, but there is a scene that I thought was fantastic - I don't want to give it away here, but it's something I haven't seen before in a film. The director's entire point in this film is that violent films make the films' audience just as guilty of the violence as the fictitious villains within the films. And to show this, he has one of the villains talk directly to the audience several times. It is an interesting point, that audiences are complicit in the violence of the films they watch. But if that's true, aren't the writers and directors that much more complicit? And isn't this film itself a violent film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crude depiction of the occidental society's blood lust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you enjoy watching Kill Bill (or any other Tarantino&amp;co movie)? Watch Funny Games.Or, on the contrary, are you frightened by the banalisation of violence in nowadays' films ? Watch Funny Games. Do you think you are not easily influentiable and manipulable ? Watch Funny Games. Do you want to realise how defenseless our society is without its numerous social codes ? Watch Funny Games.The list could keep gaining in length endlessly ... ! Funny Games is a brilliant and shocking movie, because it reveals to us relentlessly the bestial, primitive, uncontrollable and therefore disturbing side of humanity we'd (consciously) rather not see.Whereas the vast majority of films show violence in a heroic, almost sublime, and deeply hypocritical way, Funny Games makes us fully conscious of what we really applaud in theatres everyday : the two handsome and polite young slaughterers blinking at the spectators (which become involved actors), constantly laying the blame on the family and its deeds, remind us that violence is neither about glory, nor justice, nor joy : it is about pain, humiliation and despair. Funny Games' message is clear : enjoying violence (and therefore becoming its complicit, just as the dreadful tandem makes us feel) is about pure and simple dehumanisation ("emotional glaciation" as M. Haneke names it).Moreover, another side of Funny Games is the way it depicts the deep weakness of the occidental human : easily intimidated in the presence of predators, which break all kind of social barrier and codes (notice the almost non-existent distance between the two young men and the father during their first "chat"), it becomes quickly helpless, "drowned" in the absence of these social codes, which are its only true "marks" when facing other people.Being forced to see what we don't want to see is all but a delightful experience : thus is Funny Games ! This can explain the violent reactions to this movie : as Haneke says, a punch in the face often triggers analogous reactions ! Therefore, do not expect to experience any real fun with Funny Games (ironically) :) Let rather yourself get imprisoned in the two killer's vortex of inhumanity for the time of the film, and admire the disturbing human bestiality in full scale !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film which challenges the institution of violence inherent to cinema was never going to be an easy pill to swallow, and with Funny Games, Austrian auteur Michael Haneke makes damn sure that this is the case. Funny Games is so, so, so much more than simply entertainment. It quizzes you endlessly. It delves into why you'd want to watch something like this. Why you'd want to watch some pour souls suffer at the hands of torturous, teasing foes. Haneke provides a bleak, satirical reality check (leg wounds actually incapacitate, escape plans fail, the good guys don't always win) blasting with a side helping of irony. Breaking the sacred fourth wall of cinema which divides us from them, which keeps our worlds separate and safe, Frisch has several pieces to camera which shock and invoke contemplation. When they make the bet that by 9am the next morning the family will be dead he turns and asks "what do you think? Ah, you're probably on their side anyway aren't you?" and towards the end when Lothar, near to hysteria, asks why they're doing it and hasn't it been enough, Frisch retorts with not only some outrageous and, frankly, hilarious false reasons, but turns to us again asking "what do you think? Has it been enough? Surely you want a plot development?" Haneke took a wild chance by making a film as ballsy and pretentious as this but it pays of admirably. Towards the end you do find yourself questioning the violence in cinema, and while some may find they cannot make it to the end ? which, Haneke has stated, means they have no need for this film, while those that stay do ? we are finally delivered one Hell of a boot to the teeth which has been in the waiting since reel one.This film is 100% gruelling, testing just how much you can take, it ups the ante to eleven and as the Haneke-helmed U.S. remake makes it to our screens this year it will undoubtedly be the original which will live on as the true masterpiece it is while the remake gets thrown onto the ever growing mound of Hollywood's failed attempts to incorporate into its own the far superior cinema of the wider world.Read the full review and more at www.wrawreviews.co.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're on their side, so who will you bet with??Funny Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been meaning to write a review for Michael Haneke's Funny Games since rewatching it Halloween night. I had seen it for the first time around 3-4 years ago on IFC and was blown away by its inventiveness. It definitely holds up today as a sharp thriller and satire for our culture of wanting to see pain and torture on screen. With movies like Saw coming to theatres now, it may be even more relevant than it was in 1997. Word had it that Haneke, after the huge success of his most recent film Caché, would be remaking the film for English language audiences next year. I had reservations about this, but eventually heard it would be a revisioning not a strict copy in English, (although pulling a Gus Van Sant?Psycho?would be cool to satirize America for being too lazy to either learn German or read subtitles that they need a Hollywood adaptation). Whether this is true or not, the film has gotten underway as I've heard from an old friend how he has been cast as a stand-in for one of the troubled youths. Although unknowingly, Brett Vanderbrook has finally gotten me on track to review Funny Games with his jogging my memory a couple weeks late.One knows they are in for a treat right off the bat watching a family drive along a road guessing classical music. All of a sudden the sound cuts to a heavy metal scream and the entire car ride is displayed, complete with the family still swaying their heads, with the jarring guitars and hoarse voice. The family finally reaches their vacation place and sets up to get a fishing excursion going and dinner cooking. When their neighbor's houseguests come over to help, the film really starts going. These two young boys, played with playful malice by Arno Frish and Frank Giering, begin to mess with the family psychologically until the confrontation escalates to violence. To make the proceedings more fun, they eventually strike a bet on whether the captors will survive the night. This would seem strange at first until the director does the unthinkable and breaks the fourth wall. Yes, the antagonists start to converse with the audience, making the viewer into an accomplice, allowing the torture to continue. Credit Haneke here as the first moment of using the camera as a character is so subtle, one will think, "wow that was weird, I almost thought he was looking at us."Funny Games is a comment on the fact that we as moviegoers enjoy to watch torture happen on screen. We feel safe knowing that the events transpiring are fake, yet feel inclined to watch them play out. By talking to the audience, Haneke is showing that these characters are conscious of their activities and are almost asking the audience if they should continue on their treacherous ways. Of course you could just walk out of the theatre or turn off the TV, but instead you become enthralled and need to see what happens. Just by finishing this film you yourself become that which it is a commentary on. One reason, however, besides the psychological reasoning, keeping you in your seats is the emotionally draining performances by Susanne Lothar and Ulrich Mühe. Their anguish at the helplessness of their situation towards themselves and their son is heartbreaking. They are at the mercy of their captors and must bear with the "games" until their fate is decided. You need to watch the excruciatingly long single take around three-quarters in, and see true cinema greatness. What Orson Welles did technically with his opening to Touch of Evil, Haneke does here emotionally. To be able to change mood from being defeated, to scared, to angry, to helpless, to utter sadness is amazing. If Naomi Watts even comes close in the remake to what Lothar did here, she will be guaranteed that Oscar she was robbed of for Mulholland Dr.Hopefully Haneke knows what he is doing with a retelling of his brilliant Funny Games. I must admit I recently told my friend Brett that Haneke was a God of cinema, mostly because of the jealousy that he gets to work on a movie with him no matter in what capacity. While that statement is a bit premature, being that I've only seen this film by him, I do own his filmography and in the near future will most certainly be able to make that declaration again feeling justified in doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In another review on this page, the reviewer writes: "But there's a flaw in Haneke's logic: the only time we consume torture and protracted murder as entertainment is in recondite European art films like I STAND ALONE, MAN BITES DOG, and FUNNY GAMES." I don't agree at all. In fact, I'm tempted to say that the reviewer proves the point of the movie.We see so much violence in movies, that we usually don't react at all. We see movies where people get shot, kicked, beaten and tortured, but we're so used to it that we don't notice it.The difference is that in this movie, it's all so real. There is no Hollywood "magic" with beautiful actors and actresses, nothing fancy at all, almost like a documentary. The fact that one of the guys talks to us through the camera, makes it more "life-like". This could happen to you and me, and that's what makes it special.Also, there is no other plot in the movie, so the violence is the only thing that happens, and that makes it more difficult to watch.Also, the game references in the movie makes me thing that the director is trying to show us how things would be in real life if the video games we play became reality. Small children kill people in video games, and does not think about it, but when we see two guys torturing and killing a family, just for fun, we react.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suggest everyone to read at least one of the following books before watching this movie: C. R. Browning, Ordinary men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the final solution in Poland, New York, Harper &amp; Collins, 1992.Z. Bauman, Modernity and the Holocaust, Cambridge, Polity Press 1989.E. Scarry, The Body in Pain. The Making and Unmaking of the World, New York, Oxford U. P., 1985.I recommend also this famous article (even a movie was taken out of this experiment): C. Haney, C. Banks, P. Zimbardo, Interpersonal Dynamics in a Simulated Prison, in «International Journal of Criminology and Penology», 1, 1983, pp. 69-97.The thing is very simple. As demonstrated by several experiments (and especially by people's behavior during Nazism and Communism), any harmless and ordinary man can turn into the worst sadistic. One can find many reasons playing a role in this transformation (conformism, sadistic personality, influence of the environment, etc), but none of them seem to be determinant. At the end, it remains the simple pleasure that somehow every man finds in cruelty. This is exactly what comes out of this movie: when the father asks: "Why are you doing this?", the guy answers with another question: "Why not?". Afterwards, he even explains to the family that they don't have to look for hidden reasons (as for instance a miserable and difficult childhood or whatever): this is missing the point. Evil doesn't need the the devil to be evoked: it's around us, it's inside us: it's normal and banal, like this couple of ordinary guys (who are all but deep and diabolic).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not so much a movie as it is about the experience of watching movies and what it says about our fears and desires. There are two basic reasons for watching a movie from the classic "home invasion" genre. One is to be entertained and the other is to somehow rid ourselves of our fears by facing them in a low risk way. In both cases it is the director who is piling the "funny games" on us, with our compliance.Notice that the poster for this movie shows a frightening image reflected in an eye. It is as though that eye is a window into the inner psyche and that the camera is peering into our fears. In the case of entertainment, this can only work if we are so scared out of our wits that we forget whatever else was worrying us in our everyday life and thereby see it in perspective. There are however conventions that are required for making this work. The source of the fear [ie. the bad guys] must get what's coming to them and there must be a happy ending. Notice your reaction when you get neither. The remote trick pulls back the satisfaction of revenge and the ending makes it clear that the fear not only hasn't gone away but instead must be relived again and again!Arno Frisch [the skinny bad guy] can be viewed as the director who periodically peers at us thru the camera, smirks and reminds us that we are watching a movie, and reveals to us the funny games that he and other directors play on us at our insistence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd just watched Haneke's "The Seventh Continent" and was excited at the thought that I'd found another great director whose work I could trust. [You see... I have this big thing about not wasting time on lousy films; when I walk out of a stinker, I never feel like I want my money back... I want the two hours of my life back.] I'm still in shock over "Funny Games." How could Haneke have made these two films? One of them must be a fluke. Either he was momentarily touched with genius in making "The Seventh Continent" and is, in reality, an incompetent idiot or "Funny Games" was the nadir of a great auteur's career. Was he forced to shoot this turd by a demanding studio? Was it a lame attempt to sell out? And, no, it does not work on any level... not as satire, not as thriller/horror flick, not as kitsch, not as "the joke's on you"... niente. The games are neither funny, nor elaborate, nor believable, nor gripping, nor horrifying, nor interesting. Aside from the opening credits, when the classical music is suddenly replaced by death metal (a truly brilliant moment), this film has nothing going for it. The industry has been churning out this kind of junk since "Lady in a Cage" (which does it far better, as a note.) I have a feeling that Haneke would (dubiously attempt to) claim that this movie was, indeed, farcical and not genuinely "in genre." As Brecht pointed out, knowingly-conceived kitsch is not art; to that, I would add this: "When you 'spoof', you must not only outdo the original but must display a high level of creativity, as you have a template off of which to work." In that sense, even "Scary Movie" does a better job at spoofing the horror/suspense genre, and that's saying a lot about the low quality of "Funny Games."A big, fat 0/10. Hang your head in shame, Michael Haneke. Not Bergman, nor Kurosawa, nor Truffaut... not even the overly prolific Godard ever put out a turd like this. You've ruined your legacy.

In "Funny Games" the latter two are the important ones.Any my personal opinion: a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A failure on every level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watching 'Funny Games' as I'm interested in movies about violence (pro- and anti-), and I generally think European film makers handle sex, violence and disturbing imagery in a more intelligent and complex way than the increasingly more cowardly American movie industry. Well, I was wrong. 'Funny Games' is just as trite as any Hollywood popcorn fodder, and to make matters worse, is supposedly some kind of BIG STATEMENT about violence and the media. I say "supposedly" because it says nothing new or original on the subject. As a criticism of screen violence and voyeuristic audiences it fails, and as a thriller or horror movie it fails also. There is absolutely no suspense, no empathy for the uninteresting victims, no depth to the cliched psychopaths, no real on screen violence or torture to speak of, and way too many dull patches. I also thought the one or two Brechtian moments where "Paul" talks to the audience were gimmicky and redundant, and the less said about the ridiculous "remote control scene" the better!Don't waste your time with this over-hyped garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that I like this film alot. Not because of the qualities of the movie, but rather for the way the director keeps challenging the audience. Will the family survive? Will the kidnappers fail this time. Will they escape? But the thing is this isn't a film for the audience, but rather it is a film against the audience and our opinions. See it, but don't see it as an entertainment movie. Rather it is a wake up call for the audience. How do we see violence in the movies? It ain't fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FUNNY GAMES Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalJust over an hour into Michael Haneke's FUNNY GAMES, the tale of a middle-class couple and their son who are held hostage and tormented in their isolated holiday cottage by two young psychopaths, something happens which is *so* appalling, you'll either walk away from the film in abject horror or be completely ensnared by Haneke's audacity. This is a movie which dares to confront its audience with the realistic consequences of a sustained murderous assault whilst refusing to display the act of violence itself. Haneke has said he didn't want to make a film which exploited the hypocrisy of a sensation-hungry audience by wallowing in the kind of on-screen brutality which caused him to make FUNNY GAMES in the first place. In truth, the film relies more on the *threat* of violence than anything else, with the worst horrors depicted off-screen, often just out of camera range. But the resulting trauma - both physical and mental - lingers heavily throughout, with the husband virtually crippled and the wife blasted into a kind of emotional deadness by their nightmarish ordeal. When *that* scene comes around (believe me, you'll know it when you see it), you'll probably begin to understand how she feels.As much as you may be insulted by Haneke's point of view - his film is an antidote to the sanitised, beautifully choreographed violence of Hollywood movies and the audiences who lap them up - he's certainly got a point. People *do* seek out violent entertainment, while most filmmakers refuse to depict the awful consequences of that violence, thereby distorting our perceptions of it in an increasingly media-saturated, image-dominated society. FUNNY GAMES was first unveiled to shocked audiences at Cannes in 1997, where a huge number of patrons walked out during the screening. Since then, the film has been equally championed and condemned by divided critics who have practically fallen over themselves to warn prospective viewers of its horrific content. So if you seek it out on the strength of these admonitions, then Haneke was right all along. Like slowing down at a traffic accident, very few of us can resist the temptation...Aside from Haneke's deceptively straightforward approach to the material (his camera remains stationary for the most part and simply observes the action, while a couple of Hitchcockian suspense scenes are deliberately underplayed), much of the film's success is due to the magnificent, Oscar-calibre performances. Whatever else you might think about the production, there's no denying the quiet menace of Arno Frisch as the bland, emotionless killer Paul), the awkward simplicity of Frank Giering as Frisch's demented partner in crime, and the bewildered victim Ulrich Muhe. But the real stand-out is Susanne Lothar as the tortured wife; her dreadful agonies are so utterly convincing, you simply won't believe she's acting! Paradoxically, it's also one of the reasons why FUNNY GAMES is often so unbearable to watch.See the film, buy the DVD, make up your own mind. Be prepared for the worst and Haneke will reward every expectation...(German dialogue)</fullReview>

Firstly, where was the horror or suspense considering it was meant to be a movie of these genres?? Secondly the acting was so bland and cardboard like I actually couldn't wait for each character to die or be killed. Not once was I scared or even remotely thrilled and found the whole way in which the characters responded totally non plausible...what a wimp the father was ...his son had more stones.Is it possible to give this movie negative points? Also the fourth wall breaking was like a desperate act by the director/writer to save what had become a complete mess of a movie.....utter crap!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has in common with other German films from the nineties (Run Lola, run) that it is a tad too childish and unrealistic. I got up and walked out when "Paul" started rewinding the movie after "Anna" had shot his partner with the shotgun. It just gets to silly for grown people to watch this stuff. This is also clear from the voting. Teenage girls votes the film to an average of 9,9. That pretty much says it all. And the quasi-metaphysical mumbo-jumbo talk about what is real, and what is fiction... well, maybe if you are a 15 year old girl who have just discovered the Smiths.

		<shortDescription>well - you got to love the killers, there's no choice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a bit of trivia, the production coincides with Hanekes Film "Das Schloß (the castle)" an adapted novel by Franz Kafka - which may explain some of the darkness Haneke seems to be going for.To me, a description of "Funny Games" would be: Archetypical Austrian sadomaso artist's s***! (&lt;- sorry about being vulgar, but people who have seen the movie may understand)The point Haneke tries to make is "I'm showing you all these terrible things, and it's you who wants all that to happen, right...?" - an attempt at making the audience become the villain, to expose all the sadistic and fascistic tendencies in us that supposedly made something like the 3rd Reich possible - so that we shall be accused. In many ways this movie is a sibling to Pasolinis "Salo", only this time it is not about fascist society but about violence in the media.Haneke denies the viewer any resolution or retribution after the thrill. Relentlessly, we are tortured with violent, nihilist and aggressive messages going beyond all that is morally or humanely acceptable, not stopping for the psyche of 9-year old children, delicate religious feelings, etc., it only tries to steal your soul, and it only ever gets worse.Fans of the "genre" you may attribute to this movie will doubtlessly find the movie a real snoozer though, and I strongly doubt these possibly addressed recipients of the films undercurrent moralist message will get the point of it all - I bet it must in fact be a pretty boring movie for fans of "The last house on the left", instead of an enlightening one. All other viewers will be annoyed and appalled by this movie though. For all the obvious in- and pretensions, Hanekes imagination of human behavior is strangely limited - e.g. the behavior of the family in its mode of continued silent suffering seems quite unrealistic to me. I couldn't share the fascination with the latex-gloved sadism of these god-like everyday killers, which rather seem to carry some significance about Haneke's own fantasies.There is no way to stop the killers in the movie, we just watch everyone going through more and more pain and finally die, so the only way for the movie audience to get through this movie alive is to masochistically fall in love with at least one of the bad guys (the alpha-male-intellectual-smirk-in-the-camera one who is so godlike that he can even rewind the film when something doesn't go as planned).Haneke is not doing magic though but rather doing violence to his viewers, making quite a few incorrect assumptions along the way about our (the viewers) inner state - e.g. when the killers return, I had no desire for them at all, even though it was claimed this would be the moment Haneke proves his point (that we'd supposedly want it to continue).I somehow didn't get the secret joys I was supposed to feel - I could have also just walked out - all I did during the movie was accumulating aggressions against the two killers, which in the end more and more turned against the film maker. What's the point of all this?Haneke here beats down his audience in every way he can like a violent abusive kidnapper - thereby claiming the same kind of god-likeness and submissive love that he forces upon the audience for the killers. It's the typical claim of the magician-like 19th century artist persona to a position of unquestionable power surrounded by a totally impressed blown away awe induced audience, but sorry, I won't play along with your claim to fame here, Mr Haneke.This movie is a typical Austrian sadist artist's excrement. Watching it is nothing but a sacrificial masochist ritual in honor of the violator. Don't do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good start but turns to dreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was intrigued by this movie's description and it's reviews both on here and on Netflix. I finally rented it and watched it last night, and have to say it started out very promisingly, with a believable cast of actors and a pretty good story line. HOWEVER - when the first assault on the family occurs (one of the thugs hits dad in the knee with a golf club) no one really fights back. At a couple of spots the eight year old son goes after them, and mom tries once, but most of the time they either try to rationalize with the psychos (which they should have realized was a waste of time after dad got knee-clubbed), whimpering, or sitting and staring. Keep in mind, now, this is a family of three against two guys initially armed with a golf club. A GOLF CLUB!!! Why mom didn't reach over and pull out a mashie niblick of her own to start whaling on the guys is beyond me. And two of the family manage to escape during the movie, only to be caught and brought back by the thugs. First the son escapes and is captured, okay, you could believe that, after all, the kid's only eight; but then (spoiler) after the kid has been shot and killed the thugs tie up the parents and then LEAVE THE HOUSE! Mom and Dad finally get the gumption to get each other unbound and then they sit and try do dry out a wet cell-phone battery to call for help, rather than getting the hell out of there. They are in their summer home on the lake, they have a boat (we saw dad and son getting the boat all rigged up and ship-shape early in the movie) so why didn't they get on the boat and sail away? Perhaps the boat was scuttled by the thugs, you may query. Nope - the boat is in ship-shape condition for the thugs to drag mom (alive and bound and gagged again) onto, sail out on the lake, and push her overboard where we assume she drowns. The real breaking point for me on this movie wasn't the occasional asides the thugs made to the camera, making it seem like there was perhaps a third person involved and they were filming it for their own sick amusement later; but when mom grabs a shotgun and gutshoots one of the thugs and kills him. The other thug screams and starts yelling "where's the remote?" and finds the remote, and (get this) REWINDS the movie to before the shooting. They then re-do the scene so that when mom makes a grab for the rifle she doesn't succeed. So now it's a matter of is this movie a docu-drama, a psychological thriller, or a bit of sci-fi fantasy? I think they really missed a good point there, it should have continued on from the mom killing the one thug (at last they fight back) and the remaining thug carries on without his pal. The rewind thing just turned the whole movie into something unbelievable and ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weir sense of humor, these Germans...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh yeah, this movie was very funny! Couldn't stop laughing? I mean, isn't torturing innocent people and children THE most fun? Hmm, as you can guess by its reputation and the other reviews around here, Michael Haneke's "Funny Games" isn't exactly the type of film that makes you merry. Haneke is a brilliant German director who was never really interested in the bright side of humanity and revolves all his films on misery, emotional pain and violence. Without ever reverting to exploitative gore, his films are disturbingly intense and petrifying on a psychological level and his narrative style somehow always involves the audience. "Funny Games" is another truly effective and chilling thriller but, regretfully, it slightly fails in being a social satire about the role of the media in the portrayal of violence. The only inferior moments in this film are the brief shots in which the characters pro-actively address themselves to the viewer and emphasize that this is a movie. Particularly the "rewind"-scene towards the end was pretty stupid and it nearly ruined the whole movie for me. I can only hope that Haneke subsequently decided to add this part in order to prevent his film from being too 'harsh' for the likes of critics and mainstream audiences. Enough about the minor flaws, as the largest part of "Funny Games" is genuinely shocking and exceptional. A middle-aged couple and their son arrive at their lakeside house for the annual vacation in which they sail and catch up with old friends. Before finishing unpacking already, two twenty-something boys show up at the door and invite themselves in. In a polite way, they're being very obtrusive and they quickly turn out to be repellent psychopaths that kill and torture for no apparent reason. Again, Haneke shows almost no explicit violence and mainly focuses on the nihilistic nature of the young criminals and ? especially ? the emotional aftermath of their vile games. Most of the film seems to be filmed in real-time, which only increases the intensity of the family's suffering and several sequences are incredibly difficult to watch. "Funny Games" literally is a devastating cinematic experience and definitely not intended for all types of viewers.</fullReview>

The central character (who was suitably unpleasant) invited us to witness increasingly unpleasant acts, but if the film was meant to educate or reveal as to why we watch this it didn't, or was too subtle for me. I perhaps wasn't interested enough, as the theme that drew me to watching this film didn't outweigh it's flatness and dullness. If it simply meant to open the debate, fair enough. Can someone please enlighten me if I've missed something, although whatever I may have missed doesn't alter the fact that this is a dull film, for all it's violence.</fullReview>

Man Bites Dog does it so much better and so much more effectively because of its ironic tone and satirical slant. But if you want to see the same issue done it relentless fashion, without the school-boy shock value of Haneke's `look here, I'm disturbing you aren't I' then see the last word on depictions of screen violence - Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Haneke could never make a film like this (although Benny's Video is a good try) because he's always approaching us like a professor ready to teach us a lesson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever finds this shocking story of torture and murder that can happen to anyone, even a perfectly normal family (of bad actors) to be any funny have got to be sick (I've read some of the reviews) Funny Games is not funny...it's a dull, tedious film with stupid characters you just want to slap in the face (that's not just the bad guys!). The results kinda gave me a surprise and the ending was very strange. But this film is just too non-existent and irritating. Very few people will like this movie, but MANY other people will not. So i do not recommend this film to anyone but indie buffs who understands a filmmaker's goal (even if its a disturbing one) to explain what this movie is about (or maybe this director is one sick puppy.) As for the trickery thrown at us, that's the director's way of playing funny games on us....get it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White, is no more innocent !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, read many of the comments on these pages, and think there is really little to add. But, I found Haneke's choice of colours remarkable. Those having the power -read it as violence, or vice versa- present themselves usually in whites: That is, even the seemingly innocent egg in its white shell presented or asked for with hands in white gloves is no more innocent under circumstances that make up our society. We love things presented to us in lyrical or innocent forms, and rulings first rule is: to exploit this. After acceptance of the ruling, it is too late to protest against. We still love white, but do not look what there is behind that colour. That is why we still vote. That is why we still high-rate all possible stupid TV shows, all that garbage giving examples of violence against humans, animals, the whole environment. Haneke really is one the most powerful metaphorists. Great movie.</fullReview>

In Funny games, there's no explanation, just cruelty and no way to survive. You know it and that's what it's so difficult to "enjoy" that movie.

		<fullReview>I had heard all sorts of stories about "Funny Games". It's shocking, brutal, a torture to watch and really exceptional. Well, it was certainly an exceptional topic for an Austrian movie to deal with, but "Funny Games" couldn't really convince me. Haneke (or whoever is responsible for the cast) made the mistake to choose an absolutely horrible actor for the role of one of the bad guys (Arno Frisch, who had already been in Haneke's "Benny's Video", where his bad acting could be forgiven considering his young age then). That way the movie, that works like a stage play could not unfold like it should have. I wouldn't go as far as saying that Frisch' amateurish performance lead to unintended comedy but it certainly defeated the horror that should have been created in our minds. All the other actors were great, however (except for the kid, who can be forgiven considering his age) and Haneke's direction was pretty good, too. I don't exactly know why he would let the actors talk to the audience or rewind certain scenes, though. I think in the end he tried to tell us that psychopaths like the two in the movie are existing in real life, too and that we, the audience, oughta be scared and disturbed. Maybe he tried to say the exact opposite. Whatever. Maybe I had too high hopes for "Funny Games" because "La pianiste", a later Haneke-movie, really impressed me. Maybe it's the fact that watching Tarantino, "True Romance", "Natural Born Killers" and several eastern movies has blunted me, but "Funny Games" failed to disturb me in any way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a pretty gullible filmgoer, demonstrated here as I fell completely into Michael Haneke's trap: browsing the foreign section of Blockbuster, I picked up FUNNY GAMES and was seduced by the words "See it if you dare!" and "Makes NATURAL BORN KILLERS look like ORDINARY PEOPLE" (or something like that).If Haneke wants to shame me for this, fine. All it proves is that, like millions of other movie buffs, I was bored on a Friday night and wanted to see something exciting. Contra Haneke, I was not wanting to see a family tormented cruelly and mercilessly by a pair of twits in tennis whites and gloves, as if that kind of scenario truly, secretly titillates me.No. What I will admit to wanting is to see the family turn the tables on their attackers and expedite their damnation. Buh-bye Beavis and Butthead! That's what I wanted.Haneke is the one who should be ashamed, since he denies his audience catharsis, even pretends he doesn't understand the classic concept just so he can make his narrow argument to a niche audience of pychopaths.But I fell for his trap, and what he did achieve is a truly frightening vision of a world without hope or justice, only evil in charge.*****SPOILERS*****Haneke says "If you leave the cinema you don't need (FUNNY GAMES); if you stay you do." Well, after the precious little boy is murdered I stopped the film. You just don't DO that in a movie! (Not that I think the child's psychological torture was appropriate either.) I don't care if it happened off-screen, since Haneke doesn't need blood and guts to ply his theme (he is a brilliant director, actually).The aftermath of this scene was reminiscent of the subway scene in Haneke's later CODE INCONNU (which was my first Haneke film, a wonderful film, and yet a source of warning to me before I rented FUNNY GAMES that a thriller by Haneke would potentially be very disturbing). In that scene Juliette Binoche is verbally taunted by a couple of young Muslims, and Haneke just turns the screws of discomfort as the kid thugs cause all but one passenger to cower.An old man, he confronts them and they leave, but not without a final "Boo!" just to scare Binoche. She cries tears of release and says "Merci" to her only defender, and that scene was just so poignant to me. I felt the same of the parents in FUNNY GAMES as they just sit there in a catatonic state after their child is blown away with a shotgun (and the killers have left). What can they do but slowly come to, and try to get out? They can't deal with their loss just now. Yet the father slowly begins to gasp for breath and gradually a crescendo of grief builds up and he just flat out sobs violently.THAT, my friends, moved me and proves to me I don't need FUNNY GAMES. I cared about this family-silly me!-and the last thing I wanted to see was their one-by-one murders. I couldn't watch the movie after that, only fast-forward through clenched fingers in search of some hope. (Ironically, I missed the "rewind scene" as I fast-forwarded! Ha!)I found no hope. In the end even the foreshadowed potential of hope in a dropped knife is cruelly taken away as the last victim (the mother) is casually tossed off the boat to drown (she was bound and gagged).Folks, THAT is evil, and Haneke couldn't be more distorted in thinking that audiences go to thrillers to see the kind of hopeless degradation he portrayed in FUNNY GAMES.All said, I do admire Haneke as a director and respect his ability to disturb. CODE INCONNU is a film of his I could recommend to anybody who can handle "boring" (but rich) films; FUNNY GAMES is a film I refuse to recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny Games is a well made and acted film, the young psychos were effectively creepy, and the family were effectively horrified.Unfortunately, I was unable to make any sort of connection with the material, one which would've enabled me to think highly of it. Rather than believe that two young men were torturing a family, I only felt that I was watching two young men acting they were torturing a family, and a family acting horrified. This made it very difficult to watch. It was as if there was no reason for this to be made to begin with.But my biggest problem is that occasionally one of the young men, Paul, would occasionally turn to the camera, wink, or comment that the movie couldn't end yet, as they haven't reached feature length (never mind at this point the film had already been on for 90 minutes). At one point, Paul picks up a remote control to rewind his partner being killed, so that it never happened.The whole idea of that wouldn't be so bad, but in this film I felt that it was the director's way of saying, "Hey! Don't be so bothered by the torture and humilation! It's only movie!". I find the whole idea of this rather insulting.At least good sense was used in putting the "music" of John Zorn and the Naked City on the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may be the most disturbingly realistic horror film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolutely merciless horror thriller from Austria, Funny Games is an unforgettable tale of nerve-wracking suspense.A quiet family on vacation at their lake house is menaced by two mysterious yet clean-cut young men, who turn out to be some very sadistic killers.Funny Games is anything but its title. This film is one completely intense ride that recalls some of the most brutal home-invasion horror films of the 70's. However, unlike most tales of madness and torture Funny Games is a story that's played out in such a realistic nature. If it were a true story re-enactment of a real crime, it wouldn't surprise me. In fact that would be about the only way that this unsettling shocker could have had a bigger impact. There are moments of incredible suspense in this film and such an atmosphere of overwhelming tension that it becomes almost unbearable at times. The film has some off-beat moments of cheeky dark humor with our villains, they refer to each other by cartoon character names and there's one particularly memorable twist involving a remote control that reverses the film! Michael Haneke's direction is very simplistic, there is no music score and the camera work is generally basic (one tense shot lasting nearly ten minutes). This however adds all the most to the film's chilling feeling of realism.The strong performances of the cast add all the more to the believability. Susanne Lothar is outstanding as the terrorized housewife and mother. Arno Frisch is effectively creepy as the calm madman who torments the family. The supporting performances of Ulrich Muhe, Frank Giering, and young Stefan Clapczynski are also dynamic.Over all, Funny Games is one stunning horror film. Not only does it have a unique feel and tons of tension - it's an absolutely unforgettable experience.Michael Haneke remade this film for the US in 2008.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To the uninitiated, the unbelievers and then to those who chance to agree with me, I am writing to acknowledge that I believe FUNNY GAMES should be honored with the "BEST @#$!! movie" of all time award. Granted when I saw this flick I had not heard anything about it, didn't know what to "expect" except that this was the director who did the Piano Teacher. So, I was delightfully surprised by an opening that may be my favorite opening ever - on par with Blue Velvet- which sets a tone for the film but in doing so also leaves the viewer confused - wondering at a surreal scene composed of opposite extremes - the bizarre music with the equally bizarre "perfect happy family" twisting down an empty road to god knows where and god knows what. Foreplay. Like the films Funny Games lampoons, the opening is an invitation, hits a few very obvious buttons preparing the audience, gearing us up, winding... winding... winding. but no pay off. I have never heard of a nightmare with a happy ending. The film is relentless and as it runs the audience like mice through a maze - throws blinking signs that say "this way out" "exit this way" but just as we get to what might be a light at the end of the tunnel - SLAM!! goes the door and we're all set to running down corridors again, tripping on our tails. Great fun! Great terrible, horrible fun!I suppose if one were to put ones mind to it, one could find away to NOT get caught up in the film. I suppose one could see this film and not get wound up (excited) because there is never the "pay-off" no "money shot." But the fact is, this film works perfectly. I have heard people "hate it because its stupid and boring" because "this movie is supposed to be intense, B.S. - no gore" -and as they tell me this I fight to keep from snickering. It's hard not to laugh in their faces. These people are, by not liking the movie, solidifying the fact that the film has accomplished it's goal of exposing the foolish as foolish. To stand and hear someone so completely divulge their ignorance, their inability to "get the joke." It's uncanny. Funny Games holds these people in utter, biting contempt. I am quite certain that the Director made it his preoccupation to be certain this film would never be found enjoyable by the the drooling blood-lusting pencil-dick sect. This film is not for the lovers of violent cinema - the cousin of pornography -those closeted lovers of the rape scene. It is not for the masterbators who, through repetition, have worn away at the sheen of their self -indilgence; those who must find new ways to be excited. Funny Games is bored by these potential viewers and mocks them, hates them - hates me. Funny Games condemns even those who praise it. What fool would love an unpleasant experience? What fool would WANT to watch someone get killed, or raped? This film should be mandatory viewing for all 4th grade classes in America. They can see it in Health class. Those little kids will be horrified, as you and I should be. -J</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure non motivated sadistic actions claiming to be an anti-Hollywood-violence-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad acting and directing aside, this is definitely not an intellectual movie but a senseless addition of sadistic action without motivation plus a second class cliché B-movie ending. Mr. Haneke, you call this an "Anti-Hollywood-Violence-Movie". What bad Hollywood movies are you referring to? At least "Hollywood" movies tend to have a story which you lack. The pure violence you show is of course consuming the shocked audience with the desire of some kind of redemption. That's nothing special at all. Neither is your lack of statement. You tried hard to be Punk, Mr.Haneke. Well, you're not! Calling this an "Anti-Hollywood-Violence-Movie" is just as smart as kicking someone in the balls and calling it an "Anti-Abortion-Action".

		<shortDescription>Suffering? You ain't seen nothing yet...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this year's remake of "Funny Games" prior to the original, simply because its sick-with-irony trailer got me extremely curious. Granted, this goes against my usual process of viewing a remake's precursor prior to the remake itself, but I couldn't help myself. By the end, I was astonished by writer-director Michael Haneke's audacity in telling a macabre home-invasion story devoid of Hollywood glamour, humor, and mercy?remake or no, it's still one of the ballsiest exercises in visceral, reality-based horror ever released by a major studio.So, when I decided to give the original "Funny Games" a spin (mere days after my viewing of American version), I was filled with presupposition toward how much I would appreciate the original (with the twists of Haneke's shot-for-shot remake still mapped out in my mind)?similar to a sadistic "bet" our captors make with their prey, I was wondering if this earlier, German-language version would survive on its own terms. And, while each version is practically identical (save for some subtle nuances in the performances, the slightly varied location design, and?of course?the spoken language), both quite miraculously carry the same visceral, jaw-dropping sucker-punches as the other. Unlike the much-derided American remakes of "The Vanishing" and "Les Diaboliques," Haneke sees no need to let either culture off the hook, especially when each has its own prominent history of violence, on- and off-camera.Ironically, the references to metalhead couch potatoes Beavis and Butt-Head probably seemed like an incendiary bitch-slap to the passive glamorization of American filmed violence in the 1997 version, but there is an even stronger sense of irony when the MTV-hosted duo are referenced in the remake?on the shores that birthed them, and the cult following of Generation Y-ers that has accumulated in the years since the show's cancellation (a sure sign that our passivity, if anything, is more pronounced now). It's subtle observations like this that give both versions of "Funny Games" an added resonance.If anything takes some getting used to in the 1997 film, it's the general unfamiliarity of the cast. After seeing a collection of familiar performers run through Haneke's horrifying 2008 experiment, the German cast begins with a studied approach to the performances that eventually loosens into hysteria and desperation that is just as convincing as their remake counterparts. It is truly stunning how Haneke mines the same static framing and intense performances to ends that are equally effective in both films (even knowing the outcome of a protracted long take following a pivotal off-screen event, I found the experience just as emotionally agonizing to witness).While it may seem hypocritical to "side" with Haneke (at least in the context his film creates), especially when I patronize (and am prone to enjoying) films that frequently downplay the reality of human suffering, the effect in both versions of "Funny Games" is undeniably powerful?these are difficult, ugly, and emotionally draining films crafted with undeniable (and remarkably subtle) purpose. If there's any catharsis to be had from them, it will be in the introspection and assessment of your own attitudes toward violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worn-out themes hidden behind a veil of flashy, pretentious direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This supposedly shocking, humorless and grim thriller is about an affluent couple (Susanne Lothar and Ulrich Muhe) and their young son, whose attempt at a peaceful retreat is turned into a nightmare. While vacationing at a remote and (so they think) ultra-secure lakeside home, the family is tormented by two clean-cut young men who initially stop by to borrow a few eggs, then won't leave. They try to provoke violence, break the dad's leg with a golf club, kill their dog, make the mother strip and lie about being gay, having horrible childhoods and being drug addicts for a motive (although it's made quite clear that they don't have or necessarily need one). When asked why, one says "Why not?" and it's all for "entertainment value."The commentary here, I suppose, is to illustrate that society is often pointlessly brutal and sadistic, and there's no real way to pinpoint an exact cause for the increasing violence in the world. Apparently the director is also doing some finger pointing of his own toward "desensitized" audiences who enjoy lapping up simulated violence in their popular entertainment, as well as those who tune into the nightly news to get the scoop on all the real-life horror stories taking place. In taking on this kind of material, Haneke creates the exact kind of film he is demonizing, which will make this a tough sell to certain people. Who doesn't look at the car accident site while they're passing by hoping to see what happened to the poor sucker involved in the wreck? Who doesn't see a violent scenario playing out in a film or on a TV show and stop to take a look? Most of us do... In my estimation, it's completely natural and healthy to fill one's morbid curiosity about the darker aspects of life and death via film, art and music. I'm not entirely sure what the point is in making us feel bad or guilty about it. If the director is simply wondering why violence and horror are so appealing to the masses, then his film completely lacks any insight, depth or psychological credibility when it comes to that topic.There's some flashy direction, but unfortunately, a lot of it just doesn't work... like long, unbroken takes that seem to go on for hours and a character who talks to the camera ("Is that enough?") and then grabs a remote and rewinds the movie after something doesn't go his way. This was an official selection at Cannes and has a fan following, but I found it unpleasant, pretentious and downright boring at times, and it's nothing that numerous other films didn't already do (and do better) in the early 1970s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Disturbing Film I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is shocking, painful, and awfully disturbing. It is also a cinematic masterpiece, and the first film I've ever seen from acclaimed filmmaker Michael Haneke. After having seen this film, I can already tell that Michael Haneke is a very talented filmmaker. The film includes a long take right in the middle of it, which is about 10 minutes long. It painfully shows the horror of the situation that we're witnessing.Rather than just being a gruesome, unpleasant experience so you can make a gruesome, unpleasant experience, it is packed with social commentary. It is a movie that I analyzed, myself, after watching it. I decided that the 2 villains in the film can resemble the filmmakers behind horror movies. They create terror and violence but carelessly, just laughing and calmly enforcing all of the misery on these characters.Even without the subtext, the film is still a masterpiece. Great direction, acting, etc. I highly recommend "Funny Games" for anybody who can handle it's disturbing nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film; Pushes the viewer to an extreme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Haneke's 'Funny Games' is the kind of film which splits viewers into two extremes. And no matter what people think of it, there's no denying that it's a brilliantly made film, and in my opinion, it's really clear in its point.In the movie, we see two robbers/killers disguised as well-seeming gentlemen, who invade the house of a three-member family to torture and play "funny" games with them. And it's never clearly explored why they do all this, and that's the main point Haneke makes - "senseless violence". I'm not against every kind of violence depicted in various forms of art and media, and I don't think Haneke is as well. If the violence is explored in detail, serves a purpose, depicted in context, and not just as a random or stylized act in an action or slasher film, I'm okay with it. And as a rebuke to such violence, Haneke tests us by subjecting us to a movie with almost no plot and unexplained violence. He remade this film in 2007 for an English-speaking audience; I wish someone remakes this film in countries like India, where any sort of violence is okay on screen, but anything related to sex is still so censored.Through the film, Haneke has an interesting dialogue with the viewer. The way Paul (on the the young men) winks at the viewers or asks them questions, catching one in a voyeuristic trance of violence and making one question the reason for their presence there, was really interesting. Whether it's just to see where the story goes, or to explore the true intentions of the two men, or to see if the family makes out safely after killing the two sadistic torturers, I actually found myself thinking these questions from time to time. And despite all that, Haneke plays with his viewers in exactly the same way the two men do with the hostage family, except maybe, the former has a purpose. Quite a few escape opportunities or situational clues are shown for us to assume them to be of some importance, but they are snatched away one by one and revealed to be red herrings.The acting is really good. Susanne Lothar and Ulrich Muhe are incredible as the helpless couple, Frank Giering is commendable as the chubby and childlike Peter, and Arno Frisch is amazing as the calm, cold-hearted and sadistic Paul; he's so good that there numerous moments that provoke us to punch him on the face, or even kill him. And that's when I realized that the film, maybe, also tries to test our own morals and ask "What constitutes as a justifiable reason to kill someone?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 3 all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, simply put, one of the best films ever made. Stanley Kubrick attempted to evoke the brutality of Funny Games with A Clockwork Orange. Whereas Kubrick was successful in conveying the terrible senseless brutality of Alex and his cohorts, nothing in A clockwork Orange matches the cruelty and disregard for humanity in Funny Games. This is one of the extremely rare films that actually forces the viewer to feel something. It challenges the viewer to continue watching. It leaves the viewer changed afterward. The acting, directing and cinematography are all superb. This is perfection. It is impossible to be ambivalent about this film. Either one is completely repulsed and unable to watch the whole thing, or completely entranced and captivated. This is art. If you want entertainment this is not for you. This film is moving and provocative. It depicts life as it actually is. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so 'Funny Games'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the movie might be too slow most of the time, 'Funy Games' packs a pretty strong and unusual punch! There are plenty of moments in the movie that will be sure to get you scream at the screen (not in a good way however, out of pure frustration at the hopelessness of the family). The story isn't terribly unique (though at the time in 1997, it probably was), two intruders take a small family hostage and together they psychologically and physically torture them. That may seem all too familiar, but director Michael Haneke adds some very unusual flair, most notably the main villain breaking the fourth wall multiple times and speaking directly at the audience. I can confidently say that 'Funny Games' is one of the best horror movies on the 1990s (though, as I commonly say, the 90s was the worst decade for horror movies)!Full Review at : http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/09/funny-games- 1997.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably The Most Realistic Home Invasion Movie, That's Guaranteed To P*ss You Off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Funny Games" and I have a history. Back in 2012 when I was 20 years old, I viewed the American remake of "Funny Games U.S" (2007) and hated it with a passion. Why did they not fight back? Why did they not make a getaway at the very moment the invaders leave? Finally an act of defence is instantly "rewound", and I felt I had been spat in the face. Jump to 2014, and now more fully aware of director Michael Haneke's original intentions. He wanted to make a movie set in the United States, but for budgetary reasons had to settle for Austria. The entire film was also not intended to be a horror film, saying he wanted to make a message about violence in the media by making an incredibly violent, but otherwise pointless movie.Two young men hold a family hostage, and begin to torture them with sadistic games. The men proceed to break mundane cliché's typically seen in horror movies, and also make a bet that the 3 family members will be dead by 9.am the following morning. The leader Paul (Arno Frisch) constantly breaks the fourth wall, addressing the slim chances they have as well as your expectations of how the events usually pan out."Funny Games" runs at a smooth pace blurring reality and fantasy, remaining a very dialogue driven and beautifully shot story. All the tropes of the genre are laid out and after viewing both versions twice, I can confidently say I adore the original and still don't think much of that remake. I respect the shot for shot decisions, love that they replicate the sets to a tee and I adore those actors (Tim Roth, Naomi Watts, Michael Pitt). Still, I remain very put off a by a lot of what I considered short comings. Final Verdict: "Funny Games" goes against the rules and comes off more as a parody. In a lot of ways it could be the most violent torture flick ever, and very little blood is actually seen. I respect what Michael Haneke set out to do and in the recent waves of typical horror movies nowadays, I'm glad this exists to point out how mundane all this excessive violence really is. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Dark Version of Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is like a very dark version of Scream. While I enjoy horror movies, haunted houses, etc, not many of them raise my heart rate anymore. A good thriller, however, may still get my blood pumping. Enter this unique take on the serial-killer thriller. Haneke uses a calculating and methodical tempo, a Hitchcock-style method of making your brain fill in the gore, and an expert contrast of peaceful music with obnoxious music to keep the viewer's eyes glued to the screen. The movie is like a soccer match: stretches of anticipation, with exciting moments happening very quickly and with little warning. I had the good fortune to watch the film without knowing what it was about, so those payoffs were even more exciting for me.And like Scream, while the director showcases his ability to make a proper killer thriller, he also sends a message to the viewer in a creative and artistic fashion. According to IMDb, Haneke told producer 'Veit Heiduschka' during the production that if the film was a success, it would be because audiences had misunderstood the meaning behind it. It could potentially get frustrating to watch a well-executed thriller color outside of the lines all of a sudden, but if you keep an open mind, you might realize that such creative license actually adds to the thrill.It would be wrong to end this review without mentioning the actors, who all performed very convincingly. A great game plan is of no use if the players don't execute it well.In closing, I would also be remiss not to mention what I saw as the most important lesson of all to take from this film: a man should have the physical ability and disposition to protect his family. Just ask Muhe's character. Moreover, when presented with a threat, passive compliance is not always the best answer. Act decisively and before your situation has worsened, and you might just catch the enemy in the OO of his OODA loop. Sometimes you just have to fight with a busted knee.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

So I decide to watch it. 90 minutes passes by and my head is about to explode. The dreadful pacing, the imply violence; it was so overwhelming. The director once said that if anyone like this movie, then they did not get the message. I appreciate the movie for its cinematography direction but not the content it holds.

		<shortDescription>The very definition of a clever disturbing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can without exaggeration say I have seen almost everything there is to see when it comes to disturbing movies, and yet I think "Funny games" might have been the one that moved me the most. At least it's among the top 3. This movie is not gratifying in the least, and that is what makes it so powerful (even though I totally enjoy gratifying movie violence as well). I haven't really gotten into the home invasion genre that much, but those movies I have seen so far have been quite good. But in spite of that I can almost with complete confidence say that this is by far the best one out there. It's so good you might consider skipping the rest of the movies in the genre. Or perhaps not. "The last house on the left" is also very good. And if you like the genre "The house on the edge of the park" is OK also. But "Funny games" is definitely crushing the competition. So the story is simple enough. A father, a mother and their kid goes on vacation in a secluded house near the sea. There two men in their early twenties shows up, first acting friendly, but soon starts act weird. The weirdness escalates to mild harassment, followed by violence and from then on it gets worse.There is very little blood in the movie and no graphic violence whatsoever. Everything is implied. What this movie does is playing extremely heavy on the emotions, which is done with almost perfect balance. An excellent example is the scene that follows the first kill.And balance is the key word for the entire movie. The music score is limited to when the characters plays music, which was an excellent choice. This movie does not need music to lift the emotional tension! The little music there is features, together with some great classical music, music by the extremely talented, multifaceted and to most people unknown musician John Zorn.Also, three or four times, one of the killers turns to face the viewer, making comments about what is going on in the movie, which is also made in a very balanced way. It could be seen as a cheap move, but here it really works and ads to the overall feeling. Two reasons why it works, is because it is done very moderately, with three or four very short segments, and because of what is said.You also get to know the family a bit, just enough to like them. They are intelligent, kind people with good taste and they have an intelligent, well mannered kid. In many violent movies these days the victims are either not likable or you don't get to know them at all.The killers are also interesting. You don't get to know anything for sure about their backgrounds, but they are well mannered, calm and seemingly friendly. And the point is, they don't seem to have any reason whatsoever for doing what they are doing. There is in general a lot going on with the ways the killers behave and talk, but I will leave that to you to figure out. But keeping that in mind will probably enhance your experience of the movie.The acting is great both when it comes to the family and the killers. The emotions portrayed are very convincing, and the killers are creepy in a very unique way.This movie is about making the viewer reflect over how he/she views violence in modern culture. In my view it does this without being preachy. It is a clever reflection over senseless violence, where the senselessness and sorrow, rather than the violence, is rubbed in the viewers face. I felt really empty after watching this movie. And again, this was done in a very minimalistic way. I don't give out a lot of 10:s, but I think this move definitely deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The utterly senseless torture of the family in "Funny Games" isn't nearly as disturbing as our complicit witnessing on it... Upon first viewing, Haneke knows his audience better than we know ourselves. We believe that we only continue to watch "Funny Games" because we are empathizing with its characters. No. We are not. We love it. By watching, we are agreeing, we are complicit -- and Haneke is our Austrian dungeon master. A sadist. To be clear: I don't think I like Haneke's approach. It's like watching a pointless vivisection. It's destructive. His corpus of work is an anatomy of hatred, but I'm not sure what can actually be learned from it.(As a side note: I think that there should be a pen &amp; paper RPG about Haneke's worlds. About genital self-mutilation, cancer, sorrow, stunbolt guns. Would be way more extreme than "Call of Cthulhu".)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smirk at our predictions and indications to sadism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian opera arias flows through the serene forest on a clear road, and then you are stomped on the face by bold red credits and obtrusive rock music with dreadful howls and screams. Two psychopaths are on a rampage of death and deception, with no clear motif they hunt rich families in most suave manner by playing games, bluffing, discussing their career paths and pseudo-science, and all the while winking at the viewer. Haneke smirks on our experience of watching and predicting films/stories, he points out and flips over all the defaults that gives the viewer a sense of attachment with the protagonist, a build-up leading to excitement in his suffering, instills fear for his safety/success and finally saves him for that happy ending. This film is not exclusively of effluent well mannered people who listen to Bjorling, Tebaldi and Gigli and go to secluded posh villas on holidays and are vulnerably helpful. It's about anyone who is not hunting; it's about the total control of the hunter over his kill i.e. the games he plays with them by the rules he makes for his pleasures and ours. The two laddies promise entertainment, makes us realize our voyeurism and keep their part of the deal by delaying death, by playing hide and seek, by giving a chance to their kill to participate to escape and sustain us on our seats by giving us hope before 90 minutes are over. Haneke increases the viewers level of involvement by breaking the fourth wall and thinning the line between reality and fiction, reversing the sequence we wanted, deploying false escape device to question our intelligence, freezing the frame from a distance and not giving close-up shots of the protagonists and thus making us think about what we are watching, what we expected and what we want next to happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An idyllic well-off family of three, Georg (Ulrich Mühe), Anna (Susanne Lothar) and their son Schorschi (Stefan Clapczynski) are abducted by two immaculately behaved youngsters Paul (Arno Frisch) and Peter (Frank Giering) at their reclusive lakeside vacation house...Given the artistic angle of Michael Haneke a strong focus of written reviews is placed on the shoulders of its social commentary, whilst the story itself takes the back-burner. Few distinctly comment on the story as a pure horror movie, even though it borrows clichés and essentially poses as an exemplary thriller. Just to take a step back from deeper analysis what about viewing the project as a total package?. As such "Funny Games" offers a cold and calculating psychological nerve attack and even though the gore or creativity of the sadists is pretty brittle the emotional wallop makes an uneasy viewing. Tension builds up creating the sense of hopelessness and paradise lost within the confines of your own home. Nonetheless what's a horror movie without crater sized plot holes or idiotic victims, who basically throw themselves onto knives, guns and/or golfing clubs? Our trio of hapless misfits go through no length to get killed, including unbearable inertia, when presented the opportunity to do something. For example when visited by a boatload of friends Anna decides not to warn them, despite her single captor being unarmed. This escalates when Anna and Georg are left to themselves for 20+ minutes and undertake self-persevation at a morose uninterested pace. That said this could be a deliberate ploy by Haneke to poke fun at horror movie clichés and the ineptitude of victims. Given however Haneke seemingly lacks the credible overview of the genre (unlike Wes Craven and his "Scream") and this would seem a bit petty given the director's grand intentions, my bet is this is more owed to general script weakness than directorial foresight.Moreover throughout Haneke presents a certain level of dishonesty or lacklustre, as mistakes surface several times with blatant ridicule. Unintentionally symbolic when Paul breaks the fourth wall to state that the runtime isn't long enough for a feature film, when in fact we are 95 minutes into the strained experience. And strained it is - after a gripping opening the movie lags and struggles to keep interest, which at one point had me crying for the director to just kill everyone and show the end credits. This entailed an excruciatingly boring, irritating half hour of Anna and Georg attempting not to get rescued. Summarizing from the most basic level as a thriller "Funny Games" lacks the psychological punch of "Straw Dogs" or the visceral brutality of Eli Roth imaginings, essentially a pretty successful, but not ultimately shocking movie as many art-house fans make it out to be.That said Haneke's movie is first and foremost a commentary and although the packaging can't be ignored, focus should be placed on the underlying message. As evidently suggested by countless breaking of the fourth wall by Paul (winking at the camera or asking the audience whether they've had enough) and references to violence-ridden animations such as "Tom and Jerry" or "Beavis and Butthead", Haneke asks about what we view and why we view it. The evil protagonists are nihilistic and aimless, a product of the audience and their expectations to experience violence, brutality and mental torture, as if it brings us closer to understanding ourselves. The obvious empathy is directed towards the three hapless victims and despite the undying hope of retribution, the audience watches them being maimed, slaughtered and killed, as if to satisfy some need which we pretend doesn't exist. "Funny Games" manipulates the viewers sympathies, not offering respite. Why should the bad guys to ultimately lose, but only after the initial carnage they caused? Paul conversely asks the viewers these questions and gleefully fulfils initial expectations, but then following through with the deadly finale, not letting the viewers off the hook.The brutal relentlessness and the suggested blurring of reality with fiction are aimed at commenting on the theme of media violence, with which we coexist in seamless harmony. We watch these games, snicker at blood and gore, as if they were funny. If we watch the violence on screen in a fictional movie does it make it any less real, asks Paul after disposing of the last victim. Despite being emotional pulled into empathising with the tortured family, Haneke forces the viewer to enter a discourse, a meta-narrative, with their executioners, pointing out the shared responsibility for the on-screen violence. Pointing the finger at a society with violence as a story necessity, a means to an end, Haneke becomes the accuser. To enhance this Haneke attempts to initially create a close relation with the viewer in a starkly realistic setting with close up shots imbuing a sense of proximity. Slowly he strips away this closeness by juxtaposing it with Paul's winks to the audience, thus forcing them out of a the empathic attachment and points out the 'entertainment value' of cinematic violence.Despite strong kinship to "Straw Dogs", Haneke's self-admitted reference is towards Stanley Kubrick's work, most notably "A Clockwork Orange", which presents violence as an overlap of the surrounding society. Here however Haneke converts and personalises the question, as if asking: Why exactly are you watching this? In this dishonest jibe by Haneke is basically questioning why we don't turn off the movie. My return question would however be: Why exactly did you make such a movie, if you question motives for watching it? Much like preaching the immorality of theft by stealing a loaf of bread.An influential movie in many ways unfortunately lessons were not learnt, but morbidly rehashed into gorno, which litters the horror genre with mindless violence and takes breaking viewers as a matter of pride, not commentary. Where "Funny Games" suggests and breaks preassumptions to comment, gorno just kicks the rulebook away for the hell of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's condescending in its ill-judged commentary, but 'Funny Games' is an undeniably gripping and powerful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Funny Games' is one of the most provocative films I have ever seen, if not the most. Michael Haneke revisits themes of the media and desensitisation like he did in 'Benny's Video', however this time Haneke is directly confronting his audience about the violence they supposedly watch with relish. The antagonist of the film actually addresses the audience, asking 'Don't you want some plot development?', 'You're on their side, aren't you?' He needlessly injects this nasty film with condescension and pretension, and none of it really works, Haneke only succeeds in appearing smug and self-righteous. Haneke has said that he makes the viewer an 'accomplice' of the murderers. No he doesn't, not at all. Not once did I even begin to want to be an 'accomplice', the antagonists are some of the most wretched I've ever seen, it's nonsense. During the evil mind games that the killers inflict on the family, I felt like them, a victim, not an 'accomplice'. I, like any other viewer, was desperately hoping that the family could somehow escape their captors. The ill-judged provocation climaxes in a scene where Haneke 'manipulates' the audience, making them 'applaud' violence; but applauding is a completely justified response to the scene, which, without giving anything away, concerns the maiming of a truly reprehensible character. If Haneke himself was in Anna and Georg's situation, he'd be utterly liberated by what occurs; it is the film's most self-righteous, hypocritical scene. It is obvious that violence can be used accordingly, it is sometimes a necessity, and this particular scene is the most appropriate use of violence imaginable.The majority of the violence one witnesses in film and TV is far removed from reality, people are aware and afraid of the ugly, messy truth of violence, the films that 'Funny Games' tries to chastise serve only as harmless escapism. Haneke seems very pleased with this creation, but he shouldn't be, this rather ambitious film falls flat, achieving in merely riling its audience, not holding a mirror to their faces. Haneke seems to think he has the viewer in a vice-like grip, and he does, but certainly not in the way he thinks he does, which is 'manipulating' and exposing sick little voyeurs. Instead, he keeps the stranglehold on his audience through his skill of building excruciating tension to the point where the eventual violence, which is never gratuitous, is wholly more devastating. It's undeniably powerful, and the acting is unsettlingly excellent; it's a thoroughly unpleasant, tortuous film. However, if you need reminding of the ugly reality of violence, there are many films out there that will deliver without the pretense.www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting experiment, but a not entirely successful one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stereotypical home-invasion horror will simultaneously entertain and anger its audience by having its helpless victims subjected to sickening acts of violence and humiliation, before delivering a satisfyingly cathartic finale in which the survivors exact a fitting revenge on their tormentors.Director Michael Haneke is clearly not a supporter of such emotionally manipulative and patently unrealistic movie-making ploys and uses Funny Games to voice his concerns about the exploitative use of violence in cinema: he betrays those viewers who have come to expect a happy ending from such fare by repeatedly breaking the fourth wall, having his psychopaths communicate directly with the viewer (making them guilty of complicity), and eventually allowing the antagonists to alter the outcome of the film in their favour.Haneke's use of meta cinema to try and subvert the viewer's expectations is an undeniably brave move, but I cannot help feel that it doesn't succeed as well as intended; this could be because there just isn't enough of this self-reflexivity to allow the viewer become comfortable with the concept, but if I were to be brutally honest, I reckon it's because it's simply not handled with the level of finesse required.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember spotting the description and photo for this Austrian film listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You, I had no idea about what was about until I read a little, it definitely sounded interested, from director Michael Haneke (Hidden (Caché). Basically a wealthy family, parents Anna (Susanne Lothar) and Georg (The Lives of Others' Ulrich Mühe), their son Georgie (Stefan Clapczynski), and their dog Rolfi have travelled for a holiday in a Austrian lakeside summer house. After arriving Georg and Georgie go off sailing on the lake, and Anna prepares dinner in the kitchen, she interrupted with the arrival of young man Peter (Frank Giering) who wants to borrow some eggs. It seems he innocently drops the eggs and goes back for more, and also dampens the cell phone, and obviously he gets Anna more frustrated, the arrival of his acquaintance, brash arrogant young man Paul (Arno Frisch). By the time Georg and Georgie arrive back, she is so frustrated she is demanding they leave, and when they refuse it is obvious that the events were not accidents but intentional. Peter and Paul trap the family as captives in the lake house, and violent acts begin, as the two young men start to play sadistic and torturous games for their own amusement. Their nasty intent was proved when dog Rolfi was found dead, then Peter breaks Georg's leg with a golf club, and they make a little bet with themselves that the family may not stay alive after 09:00 the next morning. While the violence ensues Paul keeps insulting Peter about his weight and seemingly low intelligence, but the origins and a motive for their actions is never revealed. We see Anna turn away some people for help pretending the two men are friends, and Georgie attempts to escape the house for help next door, but he finds the family there have been murdered. He did grab an empty shotgun, and Paul takes him back with the gun and the bullets for it, and after a few more games we hear Peter shoot Georgie dead, and they seem to leave the house. Anna and Georg are alone and after weeping together because of the death of their son they try to dry the cellphone to call for help, but when this doesn't work she leaves running for help she tries to find, while broken-legged Georg keeps trying the phone. Of course Paul and Peter only left momentarily and recapture Anna, kill Georg, and the final scenes see them take Anna out on the boat tied up and gagged, and even though it is early to 09:00 they throw her off to drown, and find another family to victimise. Also starring Stefan Clapczynski as Schorschi, Doris Kunstmann as Gerda, Christoph Bantzer as Fred and Wolfgang Glück as Robert. Giering and Frisch do a great job being the psychotic pair who torture with their degrading and sickening humiliation, and Lothar and Mühe are just as effective as the couple suffering it all. I was mistaken in thinking this film was four stars out of five, what the actual three stars, but that doesn't make this any less watchable, it is deliberately hard to watch with powerful shocks, certainly a psychological horror thriller to see. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the intriguing egg motif</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story about a family hostage situation. As the plot unfolds, the audience should have become aware that all the family's effort at fighting back is futile at the moment when the wife catches the 2 villains off guard by picking up the hunting rifle to kill one bad guy, Peter, the other one, the mastermind Paul, finds the TV remote to rewind it to the moment before the shooting to forestall her move. This bad guy, Paul, in fact, is godlike. The audience at this point would be totally bewildered as to what to expect. Are "Peter and Paul" symbolism of authority judging whom they would let into heaven and whom they would leave for damnation? Is this magical realism? A bad dream on the part of the wife? Or a novel the husband is developing if he is a writer? (A viewer with the 2000-movie "With a Friend Like Harry" in mind is likely to think along that line ? especially with the inter-textual egg motif.) The horror is built up bit by bit, from the episode of the twice-smashed eggs, which is an annoyance, to a menace through physical harm, which still seems to be a retaliation for the slap on the face, to the killing of the family dog, to the extermination of the whole family. When Paul explains Peter's pathogenesis as a psychopath to their captive audience, he mocks the American psycho-killer genre: His mother divorces her husband to be in sole possession of her son, and he cannot take it, etc. The evil motif is unexplained, as in another European movie, "The Vanishing" (1988), which, incidentally, is based on a 1984-dutch novel, "The Golden Egg" (Het Gouden Ei).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretentious cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the director of this film succeeded in showing the horror of violence, and its real aftermath. This is due I think to the great performances of the main actors in the film. However, I have a huge problem I guess with the film, and the idea of making this American Remake.I saw the film on Independent Film Channel many years ago. However, I can't say I really saw the whole film, especially with the child being pursued in the film. I would turn the channel, and then go back to it. I had seen the ending first. I have however, not seen this film since early 2001, and would not want to see it again.First, it has been mentioned that the film was not a success at the box office when first released in the United States. I would however, even venture to guess, that this film was not a success even in Austria or Germany when first released their. I don't really know if this is the case, however, many Germans, I have been told, when they go to the movies, they would rather go to the American movies.Some 23 years ago, I was talking to a former lawyer for Duetche Gramaphone. Orson Welles had just passed away, and I was quite sad about that. He was critical of Welles, claiming that he made only films for himself and not people, and that was why he was not as successful as he might have been. he was also critical of German directors, saying that they made films for themselves, and not the general public. I always remember Welles saying, "I'm your humble servant". Mr. Hanke, to me seems like perhaps like some other European directors, who can make films because they get help from some film funds, try to hard be giving people sermons on what they should think, and perhaps are not able to communicate to the people they really want to communicate to. They only end up having their films seen by what might be regarded as an elitist group, and may only be preaching to the choir. If those people who are interested in what might be described as a sadistic cinema, I sadly think this director might be entertaining them, and might be wetting their appetite for "more". Now, and I think rather sadly, because he is considered one of the top European directors, He can come to America, and make an American film, a remake, with well known actors in the Hollywood establishment. I have no problems with film critics who are able to champion films that the general public might not otherwise see, or film festivals that might open our eyes. However, where films that just would be entertainment, have their downsides, people who can get money to make films from sources I suspect that might not be interested in box office, also has its downsides.My next criticism is that in this directors remake, he felt that the original story should really have been an American film, and it is my understanding, that is why this remake is taking place in the United States. This is really a cheap shot. In Germany, in the 1960's, the film adaptations of Edgar Wallace stories were very popular, with murders taking place constantly, and conveniently for the German populace, taking place in England. Later in Italy, Dario Argento, and to some extent Mario Bava, also had the sadistic murder thrillers, also known as the Giallo's. It is interesting that Mr. Hanke ranks PSYCHO, as one of the greatest films ever made. This American film, directed by a great English Director, is the kind of film that Mr. Hanke should really be repulsed by, since it can be argued, that it spawned many of the films that Mr. Hanke seems to despise, and blame. If he is blaming the Americans for our present state, what a hypocrite.Finally I guess Funny Games is some 90 minutes long. I saw the Martin Ritt film that he made with James Gardner and Sally Field's called Murphy's Romance. In one scene, the characters are in a movie theater. I believe they are watching one of the Friday THE 13TH films. During the watching of the film, a blade goes through a woman's stomach, as I recall. Murphy, played by James Garner, walks out of the film. An American man who I watching it with, not only found this scene quite funny, but we understood what the film makers were saying at that moment. They made an entertaining film, and made their point in only one minute, where it to Mr. Hanke some 90 minutes to say the same thing. I also think that those people who enjoyed Friday THE 13'TH movies might also have seen MURPHY's ROMANCE, and might also have been given more food for thought, than Mr. Hanke ever could dream of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Georg: Why are you doing this to us? Paul: Why not? Perhaps the best way to describe it is 'Hostage' (the Bruce Willis movie) on crack. 'Funny Games' is perhaps the strangest film I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty crazy stuff. The second Austrian made film I've seen in the last two weeks (I know, odd), 'Funny Games' starts off as an ideal summer cabin getaway for an average family of three. There's the mother (Susanne Lother), the father (Ulrich Melhe) and the nine-year-old boy. After they get settled into their cabin they are slyly taken hostage by two deranged early-twenty-something boys, Paul (Arno Frisch) and Peter (Frank Giering). Both boys are absolutely deranged and their motives seem unclear, but during the 24-hour captive of the family, the boys torture the innocent family as well as make them play weird, deranged perhaps even "funny" (to them) games with each other. 'Funny Games' is a maddening film in many respects because it has no idea what it wants to be. Is it a drama? Is it a thriller? Is it a horror film? Is it a dark comedy? Is it a social commentary? Perhaps all of these things wrapped into one. 'Funny Games' holds your attention with exquisite acting from the enormous cast of five, haunting cinematography and unpredictable plot twists. 'Funny Games' doesn't offer much resolution at the end, and that will no doubt upset many viewers off. But for those who can just relax and accept this morbid little tale as what it is, well then, you might get something out of it. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploitation, or art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like "Funny Games" - and there aren't many movies which are easily comparable to it - will inevitably bring up a question: Are the film makers trying to make a statement, or are they simply exploiting ultraviolence for the sake of shock value? Throughout history, certain films have invited a great deal of criticism regarding controversial and violent content; perhaps the most obvious example of this is "A Clockwork Orange." Most people, however, agree that certain points were being made in Kubrick's film, even if they aren't obvious, and even though an element of shock value is infused in the film. But with "Funny Games," it's difficult to detect any specific message, moral, or idea - other, perhaps, than the simple affirmation that some people truly live a life of cruelty and thrive on terror.Yet it's difficult to define this film as a work of exploitation; although there is much violence, only a small amount is actually seen on screen. Opportunities to show nudity are also bypassed in favor of other views. And a great deal of the film features sparse dialog, and simply shows the family trying to deal and comprehend with what has happened, and is happening, to them. Most of the torture here is mental and emotional - for the family in the film, and also, in a way, for the audience itself, which will almost uniformly feel an amazingly strong hatred towards the men who are in many ways the film's protagonists. What happens in this movie is extreme, but the events are not depicted in an 'exploitive' manner.Life is filled not just with beauty, but also with very terrible things; in one sense, this movie is simply a depiction of that second side of reality. But also, in some moments - such as when the main 'bad guy' interacts directly with the audience, and when certain science-fiction elements are brought into the movie towards the end - this work play with our emotions, and our conceptions of how movies should be made, perhaps even how stories should be told. This movie is not for everyone; if you find depictions of violence or suffering to be overly disturbing, this will probably stick in your head for a long time. But for others, I think it's worth seeing. What is the director saying? Is he saying anything at all? Draw your own conclusions.</fullReview>

About one third into the movie, a woman sitting in front of me, got up and left, not looking too well. I was not surprised.This is not a nice film, portraying violence in a way that really gets to you, and at times the sheer ugliness of it all makes you want to throw up. - However I really liked it, not because I felt like throwing up, but because it felt like a giant hand had reached from the big screen, grabbed my hair, and was forcefully dragging me through the events. I didn't feel comfortable, but I didn't leave. Because I couldn't. I had to see it all. No choice.This film is all about brutality, and how very brutal it can be.

		<fullReview>Michael Hanekes film is precisely what its title says it is, a game, though not necessarily ´funny´. It is a play with our perception of violence within the cinematic medium. The antagonists in this film are present only to inflict the utmost physical and mental torture onto the protagonists. Not to satisfy themselves but to pose questions to us as viewers. What is it that compells us to watch this elaborate terror being inflicted to this innocent family? Hanekes film is a geniunely disturbing construction, and yet strangely evasive, it is worth watching for the questions it raises. The effects of the violence are shown in utmost naturalistic detail, while the acts themselves are off-screen. As naturalistic as if they´ve been ´real´. At the same time the perpetrators are unreal and stylized, to the point of being aware of our reactions as an audience. They therefore, with the beforehand knowledge of the dramaturgy of movies, do what they do within the strict confines of that model. It is a bizarre and disturbing juxtaposition, and unlike anything I´ve seen before. But it is, like some of Hanekes previous films, a not a very easy or pleasant experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film begins with an aerial shot following a car with a boat trailer, on its way to a country retreat. The driver of the car, a man along with his wife and young son, hope to have a nice quiet break in a large house beside a lake. The arrival of two unusual young men who wear white gloves breaks the idyllic tranquility. Their request to the lady is just to borrow eggs, but it soon becomes clear that they have a malicious and sadistic motive. They want to play a wicked game with the family, entraping and abusing them. The man of the house is soon injured, and can hardly walk, and the woman is tied up and humiliated. The young boy attempts to run away, and tries to shoot one of the men, but unfortunately the gun is empty. The most notable thing about the film is that one of the intruders, at times, looks at the camera and winks, and also asks us what we think, as though we are fascinately entangled inside with them. There's another scene where the women struggles free, and shoots one of the intruders, the other one then grabs the TV remote control and rewinds to the beginning of the sequence, as if to say, 'hey we are going to prevail here, come what may'. It inevitably reaches its only conclusion, and the final image is one of a cold, stark and ruthless gaze into the lens. Evil is around us all the time, and can surface in even the most calm and tranquil of places.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The odd thing about this film is how repulsed people are by it. Certainly it's a shocking brutal film but there have been few more restrained and less bloody films about the subject (especailly given that the subject has to be bloody) Funny Games shocks and horrifies people because of it's realism and naturalistic setting. Unlike the twitchy ranting performances we are used to seeing in movie serial killers, the two killers in funny games are normal, almost bland. The film is free of the moralizing and also of the exploitation we see in Natural born killers. (Spoiler soon!) the film does not dwell on violence it dwells on the psychological aspects of it which makes it much more disturbing. Consider when Georg's wife is forced to take off her top we do not see the usual flash of breasts that we expect from our slasher films. And when one of the killers shoots their son we merely see the blood splattered on the t.v. The camera is out of the room when the boy is shot. The ending is really frustrating but it's meant to be frustrating. The vengance which is stopped by the godlike hand of a remote control is ridiculous but it makes us aware of our own role in the films violence and brutality. And the ridiculousness in the tacked on vengeance that will make our sordid experience worthwile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny Games is a chilling portrayal of two serial killers who force a vacationing family to play their sadistic "games." This movie was a response by Haneke to criticism that his earlier films were too violent; his intent is to make the audience squirm by portraying the true nature of violence - trumping his critics. Haneke says that the proper response to the violence in this movie should be to "leave the theater," but few do.This 1997 Austrian version is the original and it was followed in 2007 by a scene-by-scene remake set in America. Both versions are excellent but I would encourage you to watch the original Austrian version first (be sure to check out the interview with Haneke in the DVD-extras). Both versions are well-cast and the score is truly inspirational. There are quite a few fun and unexpected twists; the movie does have a sense of humor, but my what dark humor it is!One final note - this can be an uncomfortable movie to watch with friends. It's a movie that I'm glad I viewed privately first - but I have indeed shared it with other friends after an appropriate warning.</fullReview>

I just want to tell those who dislike the movie why I think its a good and important film.Haneke doesn't basically want to entertain us, but rather make us ask ourself why we watch violent movies and if we really enjoy it, and why? For me this movie was a turning point. Violence in movies could never be seen in the same way after this.I tough that I was hard and had seen it all in movies and that nothing could affect me. Well, Haneke proved me wrong. I saw this movie at home together with my ex, the absence of music and direct violence was extremely effective. When the movie ended neither me or my ex said anything, we just stood from the couch and walked like zombies to the bedroom. No words where exchanged we just went to bed trying to sleep. For my sake I couldn't, I had to many things on my mind and all of my body where aching.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care for the word connoisseur, mostly because I can't spell it without looking it up in the dictionary, and because it gives the sense of uppity-ness. But never-the-less I am a horror film connoisseur. I enjoy the occasional thrill and chill, bump and thump. But these last few years have only given me an occasional tingle in my spine that lasts no longer than the screen-time given to the decapitated head rolling around on the floor. I jump when something pops out on screen, I might even yell- I enjoy being in a movie and being scared. Yet, I am still able to go home to my big house full of windows, out in the middle of the woods and lay my head peacefully on my pillow afterwards. But not tonight. I have seen something that will hopefully be with me for days. I have been scarred in a way that I have been patiently waiting for, since I knew that a film could scar you, since my mom showed me The Exorcist. Funny Games was in one word amazing. No on-screen violence (just the way I like it), only the after-math. I did not scream, I did not jump, but I did cry. The director, Michael Haneke, tells the story as profusely as if he had 350 pages in which to write it in. You are lulled into a sense of near boredom in the beginning (especially if you do not know the story, or background). But then an inaudible bang jerks you from anything you might have been feeling previously and grabs you-literally- by your junk. This movie was fluid motion incarnate, you, oh lucky you who haven't yet seen Funny Games, will know what I am talking about after viewing it. After watching this great helping of Haneke, I placed the rest of his films in my queue. Happy viewings to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Games is a creepy and sickening horror film, although it turns out to be more of an endurance test by the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny Games is the 1997 German horror film written and directed by the talented Michael Haneke. It is about a wife and husband named Anna (Susanne Lothar) and Georg (Ulrich Muhe), and their son Georgie. They drive down to their luxurious vacation home by the water. They're all set to put the boat in the water, and start their dream vacation when two young men knock on the door. The two young, and strangely polite and illiterate, guys are named Paul (Arno Frisch) and Peter (Frank Giering), and after just a few minutes Anna is beginning to get uncomfortable. They start making excuses and refuse to leave until Paul finally takes a golf club and injure Georg's leg. From there on in the two guys make a bet that the family will not be alive by 9:00 the next morning. And until that time they play torturous and mind bending psychotic games with the family until they almost completely lose their wits.This is quite a hard film to review since for a while I just had no clue what to write about. But now that I've had two days to think about it a little, I have a few comments. Let me start off by saying that Funny Games is an extremely disturbing film. I read up on it before I watched it and knew to expect the violence, but nothing prepared me for the shocking nature of the movie. Most of the violence occurs off screen or is implied but blurred out in the corner of the screen. Very much of the violent acts, save for the golf club scene, are all psychological and require the viewer to imagine the pain and terrifying misery this family must be feeling. This makes Funny Games all the more potent but definitely not for everyone. I am sure many people walked out of the theater or turned it off when watching it. Some viewers either didn't know what Funny Games was about before-hand or their expectations for the violence was completely disoriented.The acting is very strong from all the actors. Ulrich Muhe is excellent as the concerned father who in the end just fails to do anything to stop the situation. Susanne Lothar is also excellent, and I'd like to congratulate the make up department because they made her look like a woman that has just been dragged through the burning embers of hell. Arno Frisch and Frank Giering play their parts to the T. Although Frisch makes his character Paul creepier and more psychotic-seeming than Peter. However Peter does turn out more insecure than Paul. Other than these four, plus the boy playing the son, there are not many other actors throughout the movie. So essentially these actors have to carry everything on their own shoulders, and they do quite a fine job.Michael Haneke said in interviews that what he was trying to do with Funny Games was toy with the audience, and make them feel guilty for enjoying violence in the media and especially movies. Though not so much back in the 1990s, and more in the 2000s, people seemed to enjoy and crave gory torturous films. Funny Games was remade in 2008 in English not only to widen its audience, but also because it fits more with the new generation. This original version of Funny Games was not quite as fitting as it would be today. But if it was punishing the torture craving audiences Haneke wanted, he sure did it quite well. There are a couple of scenes in the movie when the lead villain Paul acknowledges the audience, and either gives them a leering grin or actually talks to them and/or asks them a question. This is where Haneke goes too far. We get his point clearly so he really doesn't need to go all "Ferris Bueller" on us. The one thing you should probably never do in a film is have a character verbally interact with the viewer. It works in some films usually for comic relief, but for Funny Games it detracts from the emotional response to the film, and is just not necessary. However all in all peoples' thirst for violence is a controversial topic, and I'm glad at least one director out there is addressing it. Some did not like this movie because it doesn't follow horror movie clichés and what you expect to happen backfires on you. Almost everything you expect is demolished in Funny Games, so expect the unexpected.Funny Games may be sickening and torturous to its violence-hungry audience, but it is an experience. While many people were just plain out disturbed by this movie, I was disturbed in a different way. I've seen what the new generation's torture porn genre has to offer. So the film did not really make me cringe or send shivers down my spine, I was more disgusted and hateful to the two villains. However therein lies the point of Funny Games, it is more of an endurance test by the end. If you're enjoying the torture going on, then this is a learning experience for you. If you are repulsed by it then you're pretty much human. I give Funny Games a 3 out of 4. For some strange reason I still want to see the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Michael Haneke said in a DVD interview about his film Funny Games that the film was an exhibition of how audiences consume violence. I'm paraphrasing of course, but he makes it clear that this was his premise. And in addition, he tried to show how we, as voyeurs by nature, act as accomplices to violence. Though Funny Games is well made, it fails to reach Haneke's premise. The reason is simple. There aren't any motifs in the film to lead the average moviegoer to that conclusion. The one theme that is consistent (though mainly in the last act of the script), is that of the audience member being a character in the scene. This is done in clever fashion, as we learn that the culprits are filming their crimes. However, this does not insinuate a tongue-in-cheek satire about violence in media. Because the premise of the film does not match the director's claim, the meaning of the film itself is diminished. Directors of violent feature length films have a tendency to justify their films by claiming that the film is a commentary on society. It's a convenient cop-out in some cases, especially this one. Case in point: A film that sucsessfully satirizes how the media sensationalizes violence is Man Bites Dog (1992). The film is shot in documentary style and our subject is a consciousless serial killer who finances a film being made by penniless filmmakers who soon enough becomes just as involved in the murders than the serial killer. The reason why this is more successful than Funny Games is because the film's comedic themes are maintained throughout. The comedic approach to a disturbing subject matter is an indicator that the film is a satire. In Funny Games there is both a comedic and tragic approach that is juggled throughout, making the intended premise unreachable. The torturers maintain the comedy and the family maintains the tragedy. Consequently, there are no indications of a satire. In fact, the most crucial point of the film, "the rewind scene," disproves the director's intended premise by introducing a world of fantasy when the only thing the viewer knows up until this point (as well as after this point) is a world of brutal reality. It's sloppy art and it's by far the low point in what was otherwise a well made film. Haneke has a track record of making films about motiveless violence. That is all this film is about, nothing more and nothing less. There is no difference between this film and other torture film that are more horror-oriented. By torture films I'm referring to films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I Spit on Your Grave, as well as newer ones like Hostel and Wolf Creek. The killers in Funny Games are written a whole lot better and its brutality is admirable. What diminishes the film is the preteniousness of the director and "the Rewind Scene." Man Bites Dog is a much better alternative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>something unusual that breaks the rules!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the movies i didn't forget over the years. The unpredictability and consequence of this movie is the reason why I like it. If you haven't seen this movie, watch it and do not read any further!!! Two unusual guys walk in a house of a family an kill all of them. That's sounds not to be a unusual or surprising plot but it is. We as the audience, are used to see and desire that the good side wins against the dark side. But after thousands of movies with this idea some people might get tired of that crap. So, when suddenly a movie has no hero and the bad guys just kill the good ones, I am happy. Like in the movie 'Dogville', I was afraid the end is about 'fogive and forget', but it's about anger and revenge. I think that this is more authentic in our real world. That's why I like Funny Games, it's authentic. When two crazy guys walk in your house, they kill you. You not gonna, take a knife and kill them both with karate moves or somewhat. No, that's only in movies ;-) Funny Games is a good piece of work. I think that this movie is not disgusting like many people say. It just shows how it would be in real life if two crazy guys walk by. Other horror movies are disgusting because people spend hours of thinking about how to kill somebody in different ways. Funny Games, however, just plays with your mind and you are disappointed because the woman didn't make it :-) The motive of killing is unclear, maybe its because of fun, hence the title 'funny games', or something more plausible. Anyway, the motives of other movie's characters are not much better just because the film makers equip the character with deep psychological issues. Watch this movie if you like to see something unusual and something that breaks the rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny? Funny How?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next time you find yourself looking to define the word 'excruciating' look no further than the 1997 Michael Henke chiller Funny Games.The story is a simple tale of two 'happy go lucky' young psychopaths who ingratiate themselves with a married couple and their son at a secluded vacation retreat and then go on to hold them hostage and terrorise them by playing - you guessed it - funny games. For the viewer the film is a cinematic endurance test of the darkest timbre, most of the violence takes place off-camera engaging your imagination in the process, which as you know is worse that anything a filmmaker can throw at you. Who knows better than yourself the thing that scares you the most?Just as disturbing, is the ordinariness of the two intruders. Whereas Hannibal Lector or Clockwork Orange's Alex are intelligent, charismatic and (all killing aside) fun, these 'funny gamesters' are perfect examples of the brutality of the banal. Their games appear to come from a desire to avoid boredom or worse, from staring into the void where they're likely to come face to face with themselves. If it wasn't for the injurious consequences of their antics they would just as soon bore you to death instead.For all the tricks and frustrations this film subjects you to, none of its horrors even comes close to the sheer mental disturbance of the ultra-white, ultra tight tennis shorts as worn by one of the tormentors. In terms of 'all time horrific movie moments', I'd put them right up there with the Exorcist's alternative use of the crucifix or Psycho's shower time etiquette. Be warned, these shorts are only to be viewed by those with a gut like a blacksmith's tool bag.This is probably the only film that has ever been made that is literally asking the viewer "Why are you watching this?" Henke's movies generally deal with the extremes of human behaviour but Funny Games employs a series of knowing references to the fact that by witnessing this horror you are somehow complicit in it. The entire film seems to be challenging your continued involvement via explicit devices such as the characters talking about their actions in terms of film structure, and a 'rewind' sequence that will have you calling the Samaritans. Even in the final frame you are subconsciously accused of sharing the psyche of the tormentors by still watching; by which time it's too late and the funny game that has been played here is on? you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very tough to take, but well made and acted even if it is as a whole not entirely convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Hanekes Funny Games is basically a thriller who wants to be much more because it wants to show YOU, the audience that you take violence in the movies for granted. The premise is not exactly new or original: family takes a vacation and wants to relax in their house next to a big beautiful lake where they are held hostages by a pair of seriously disturbed psychos. The difference between this thriller and hundred others can be found in certain scenes like the one where one character winks at the audience and another one where he actually asks us on which side we are and if we want to bet who is going to be alive the next morning. In this way he makes the audience part of the game. There is hardly any gore in the movie but that doesn't mean there is no violence in it as some try tom make you believe. The two psychos who call themselves by various names throughout the movie show no sign of any humanity and they talk like any stereotypical Hollywood villain and i think thats why the movie doesn't quite live up to its expectations. If they talked like regular people the effect on the audience would be much more powerful, instead one can't be entirely shocked because you are always aware that you are watching a movie. The acting in this movie is on a very high level - Lothar and Mühe are extraordinary good as the victims and Frisch who worked with haneke before in Bennys Video (a more effective movie in my opinion) and Giering make a very chilling team. I mentioned before that one cannot be entirely shocked because of the way these people talk to each other but some images are another matter. The disturbed faces of the victims and their desperate attempts to escape who are finally to no avail will haunt you even days days afterwards. The most effective scene comes near the end when on of the gangsters is shot and the other one rewinds the scene with the remote control. It's an original idea and the scene develops in a very surprising manner. All in all the movie is certainly ambitious and occasionally quite powerful but finally in its criticism of the audience and their respond to violence not a hundred-percent convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeper idea is largely lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course this film movie is psychologically very effective. We all are afraid of violence, we're heard about serial killers, psychos etc, we all have some kind of fear to be victims of them in our homes. Haneke is just playing with these kind of fears. Simple. Almost every comment about this film is talking about violence, violence, violence. Yes, this is the core of the movie. But nobody is seeing the other aspect of the movie which is main idea of the movie -- the irony and criticism about Western middle class family and people. Anna, Georg and son Gergie are typical German rich middle class family. They are spending their summers in idyllic summer house besides the lake. It's nice place but -- more important -- seemingly safe. Summer houses' block is rounded with tough fence, the place is guarded, no lower class people, no strangers. No criminals -- at least they think so. But the middle class people doesn't know that they are locked into real prison. And in prison are the laws of prison. We don't know but it seems that these two evil guys are from the same middle class too. They wear golf suits and carrying golf sticks -- typical symbol of 'classy' people. But they know that they are in isolated playground. They knows that in this kind of society only stronger gets all the power, only stronger stays alive. Haneke demonstrates us several times the idiotic helplessness, nonsense behavior of typical comforted rich people. Evil guys are leaving family alone after (accidental?) killing of Georgie. And Anna and Georg are just acting like two real idiots. They doesn't know the number of police, they don't know what to do at all. All their decisions are just wrong. They are just not able to survive in different situations and deserving their death. Using psychologically effective methods Haneke have made impressive film. But violence is too strong and deeper meaning I described is just lost in public mind. They just see lot of painful violence but not see the critique towards them. So I don't know is the movie very good or not.</fullReview>

You can kill the son, or the father or the mother instantly. Or you can play with them in long-term. Communication with the outer world isn't possible. Rules are given by two psychopaths who are committed themselves to the psychopath tendencies of their own. And they see what they do as a game which results in persecution of a family. You can struggle to find a better end for this family, but NO. Everything is evil.You must have guts to watch it, because you can't change what you're witnessing as an audience. What you can do is only watch it helplessly.The movie tells about the irony that lies in the fact that things these two have done aren't funny at all, but considered to be a part of a "funny game".(which is very obvious) Be gentle to the strangers in your house!

Movies similar to this have been done so many times (more successfuly) that you really expect more from an old theme. I usually like movies with slow developments, like movies from Tarkovsky, but some of the scenes where so unnecessarily long that after a while you start to wonder if the VCR didn't get on Pause by itself.

		<fullReview>I never realized the extent to which big-budget American action films condition audiences into savoring and craving `justifiable' acts of violence until I saw this fascinating and deeply disturbing Austrian movie from noted German director Michael Haneke. I couldn't sleep after seeing it, but after about a week had passed, I was very glad that I'd seen it. I'm now `immune' from being manipulated into enjoying onscreen violence, because the movie made me keenly aware of when I AM being manipulated ? and of the `commandments' that movies featuring cathartically satisfying acts of vengeance are built upon and dare not violate.The storyline is sort of a hybrid of THE DESPERATE HOURS and CAPE FEAR, with two very Aryan-looking young men invading the summer cottage of an upper-middle-class family of three and sadistically playing `funny games' with them. But there's much more than the surface story at work here ? Haneke has some clever tricks up his sleeve when it comes to exercising his total control over the `rules' that the movie plays by. He keeps the audience off-balance by repeatedly violating movie conventions and confounding conditioned expectations as to how events will unfold.Amazingly, there's only ONE act of on-screen violence in the entire movie ? and it's a classic example of the 100% acceptable, `justifiable' sort that American audiences so crave and Hollywood so obligingly provides on a regular basis. But just as your `rush' kicks in, Haneke pulls the carpet out from underneath you with one of his sleight-of-hand tricks, flip-flopping your pleasure into an equivalent amount of pain. And as for the RESULTS of the OFF-screen violence ? well, you're on your own.Special kudos should go out to actors Arno Frisch and Frank Giering, for being willing to play what must be the creepiest, most contemptible crime duo in movie history. (The hillbillies in DELIVERANCE have NOTHING on them!) It takes fearlessness to make yourself a target for audience detestation at this level, and the film wouldn't work if the roles hadn't been so capably filled.Know going in that the `See it if you dare' challenge on the DVD cover is not to be taken lightly. But know also that if you DO take the challenge, you'll emerge from the experience shaken but wiser ? in possession of a whole new perspective on the bogusness of traditional Hollywood crowd-pleasing violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matthew wilder was absolutely right on the money with his review. This movie tries for one thing and one thing alone, to disturb you. In this way, it panders the absolutely lowest common denominator. of all the possible emotions to attempt to elicit, to disturb is by far the easiest and cheapest. Perhaps it sells and makes money. but it requires no great talent and speaks of nothing greater than what is seen on the surface. It is the fastest way to a response of any kind and a hollow, sensational, short cut. it makes what is amoral and should be appalling nothing more than banal and commonplace. One might try, instead, to inspire or enlighten and then see how much more worthy are movies that conjure this response.Furthermore, the sort of mind that would chose to write, direct, or that would enjoy this movie is of a very sick and perhaps sadistic nature. Why would anyone enjoy watching other people in hopeless torture? Nietzsche would say it is because his or her will to power (or desire to be master over someone or something) is thwarted in real life and he or is unable to exert this drive in any other way. Freud might say it is internalized id impulses without an outlet. In either case we have a certain amount of passive aggressive behavior. And so I ask anyone who participated in or enjoyed this movie to look inside yourself and see if any of these motives are present.In any case, this movie is either sensational and salaciously cheap or of sincere, though sick and depraved, motives.</fullReview>

Funny Games may not be the first of its kind, but it creates an air of dullness which seems to contradict the inner meaning of the film. How could the two antagonists not be tense and nervous about what they are doing?

		<fullReview>When I watched this film -a year ago-,it really haunted my dreams.There aren't many movies which can make you feel that you participate in them,that you are one of the victims.I was disturbed and shocked,feelings that only a few films have caused me (another one is Polanski`s "Repulsion"),although I am really into thrillers.I believe that it`s even sicker than splatter movies.The actors are excellent,the plot is great and Haneke is really at his best.For me,this movie is a masterpiece.Enjoy it if you have the nerves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one's for all of us...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some folks might not be able to stomach this wonderfully shocking film, and if this is the case, they should ask themselves why. For those of us who managed to sit through this psychic skewering, the answer couldn't be simpler. Confrontation with fear, be it realistic or fantastic, brings our mortality out of its protective sheath. This film shoves it in our faces and manipulates our expectations with the use of more or less brilliant techniques. It doesn't take a full-fledged masochist to want to jump the white-picket fence every so often.Peter and Paul, the innocent looking antagonists, emerge as tormenters without the intensity of David Lynch's monsters like Frank Booth. They are perhaps therefore even more effective in scaring the hell out of us. In a way they reminded me of some of Ingmar Bergman's on-screen incarnations of evil, especially from the Seventh Seal and the Virgin Spring.A naive bourgeois family is brought into the world of Beavis&amp;Butthead and Tom&amp;Jerry (P&amp;P's pet names for each other) minus the invulnerability. Excellent acting makes the callousness of the psychos and the helplessness of their victims believable. All viewers ask themselves how they would react in such a situation and few of us know. But I would like to believe director/writer Haneke's version is sadly true. If you read Philip Gourevitch's take on the Rwandan genocide you can begin to see why. As for this film's contribution to the world of violence we live in...well, it may be a comment on that vidiots and tube zombies spend their lives unable to distinguish between CNN's "The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated" and Itchy&amp;Scratchy, but in the end it's surely an indictment of the former. Infotainment coverage of real-life horror numb, while films like Funny Games resensitize us to how savage we can be to each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unrelenting Roller Coaster That Left Me Numb With Shock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this review says it all. I was left absolutely numb by the end of the movie, from all the horror I had just experienced with this poor family on screen. I had been dying to see this movie for so long, and now I wonder if I would have been better off not seeing it. Yes, it was that horrifying. Enough to make me fight with myself to stop the movie and just not watch it anymore, once I was knee-deep in this horror. But I didn't. I watched the whole thing, and couldn't move as the silent credits rolled over the screen. Anna and Georg have come with their son Georgie and dog Rolfi to their lakeside house for vacation. They aren't there fifteen minutes when a portly young man by the name of Peter shows up looking for some eggs for the neighbors. Suspicions arise immediately, but Anna doesn't suspect much, even after Peter drops the eggs "accidentally." She is quite annoyed when he "accidentally" pushes the mobile phone into the sink full of water, though. But then Paul shows up. Neither will leave, and won't listen when Georg demands they leave. And then the horror starts, and things quickly envelop from there, as the family is put through a series of grueling "funny games," for the most part resulting quite bleakly. All the while, a bet is on, to see if the family can survive until 9 AM, the next morning. But as the hours tick away, and the horror becomes more and more tense, you are only left to wonder if they will survive the next minute of this nightmare.I really don't know what to say about this film. It's unbarably intense, absolutely horrifying, and extremely bleak. Peter and Paul are quietly ominous, and at any moment, you know they will snap. Any chance for Anna, Georg, or Georgie to defend themselves or fight back is taken away before their eyes, and death is merciful. There is a real feeling of realism, as if this is a snuff film, watching all of this occur. The acting is extremely realistic, and the actors playing Anna and Georg are quite talented. The scene of absolute silence for two minutes (I won't reveal the why's or how's, sorry) is intense and painful, and then, when the emotions finally escape, they are all the more disheartening. And of course, there is no mercy in this film. None at all, and I promise you, you will be afraid to watch. I am a huge horror fan, and only one other film has made me want to close my eyes in sheer terror (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the single most horrifying film ever), but this film definitely tested my endurance. There is no on-screen violence, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it's just the horrors that occurs, and the dread that makes you want to look away. There is no hope for humanity in this film, and I was almost afraid for this movie to end. I had no idea how it would, but I was terrified anyhow. I am being perfectly honest, this movie is that intense.I don't know if I can recommend this. Can you handle it? Can you handle the psychological warefare this movie holds for its viewer? Are you ready to play the "Funny Games"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to say is that the choice of actors was perfect, because the two psychotic guys, especially the thin one, were stimulating all my repressed violence for all the duration of the scenes in which they were involved, since the very first appearing. Beginning with their gloves and horrible short pants. Who wouldn't have liked to crush the legs of the bad guy? And what about the moments in which our beloved hero was talking directly to us or rewinding the tape? I was going to explode of anger for the stupidity of the scene itself and for the disappointing fact that after finally scoring a point the referee was simply telling me that the goal was not going to be validated! Under this aspects the director did a good job. But I don't think that a movie about violence should generate other violence. Horror movies are full of violence but are generally blatantly fake, and that kind of violence, even if gratuitous is a sort of harmless fun. Movies like Clockwork Orange give us some antihero who we sympathize for, but there is some deep analysis of the phenomenon of violence and it's a movie that makes you think and is beautiful as a piece of art.I think that the old cathartic function of drama representing reality should still exist, otherwise we end to watch movies like this that have no point and that maybe could be used for some kind of "reconstruction of the facts" in a tribunal. 5/10 because it succeeds in capturing me, but it does in the wrong way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't take a Rocket Scientist to understand what this film wants to say. It's difficult to make a coherent, original statement about violence in western culture. Having the killers talk to the camera serves to distance the audience rather than disturb and reveals the film to be a pretentious construct. The choices made by the tortured family are puzzling and frustrating. The most disturbing thing about this film is that it is so academic and flat. I'm really tired of this type of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So these two sociopaths walk into a bar ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Haneke's "Funny Games" is a film of promise that ultimately fails to deliver, both on the level of social commentary and purely as film. An exercise in cinematic agitprop, it is meant to make clear that the willful viewing of modern violent films is an act of voyeurism bordering on the obscene. But by the same logic then, so is the act of reading. Scenes of horrific cruelty and violence have been portrayed in literature for thousands of years and across many cultures prior to the invention of the motion picture camera. Is Haneke also saying that one should not read the works of Homer, Sophocles, or Shakespeare; or just the softcover pulp sold in porn shops? Like that of most other social realists, Haneke's approach is as subtle as a train wreck to ensure that even the slack-jawed dullards among us won't fail to get the point. While much more common among European 'auteurs', this form of finger-wagging didacticism that sends award juries at Cannes into rhapsody is not unique to the region between the Atlantic Ocean and the Ural Mountains. After all, America has Oliver Stone, for better or worse.In common with many other viewers, I found this film difficult to watch, but for very different reasons. The acting varies from adequate to excellent, depending on the scene. And while moderately well-directed, the story is very poorly written. The film abounds with plot holes, loose strings, poor pacing, and highly unrealistic character reactions. In an early scene, Fred the neighbor comes over with Paul to help Georg the Elder put his boat in the lake. During this sequence, the camera moves in on a shot of a knife being knocked onto the deck. Why? This particular knife plays no further role in the film, so what's the point? Is Haneke perhaps making an allusion to Roman Polanski's "Knife in the Water" (1963)? The next scene is the egg debacle between Anna and Peter, after which Paul makes another entrance, and subsequently Georg the Elder appears. But where's good neighbor Fred? We don't know; he's just gone. Or has there been a significant passage of time between the boat and the egg scenes? Is it the next day? We are not given any indication. When Georg the Younger makes his escape, he is unable to get over the fence around the house, having a vertical leap of only three inches, if even that. Speaking from personal experience, I can assure you that even a child is capable of extraordinary feats of athleticism if there is enough adrenalin pumping through his veins. Following the boy's death and the departure of Peter and Paul, Georg the Elder, handicapped by and in excruciating pain with his broken leg, is helped by Anna as they slooooowly make their way across the short distance between the couch and the stairs. It takes several minutes. Why must Georg get downstairs? Wouldn't most men shout at their wives to get out while they could and get help? It's not as if he doesn't know he's unambulatory. But later, during Anna's absence, Georg is miraculously able to get back *up* the stairs unaided to drape a sheet over his son's corpse. Perhaps he took some aspirin in the interim. Meanwhile, Anna is outside the fence of a neighbor's house, screaming for help to no avail. But the bars of the fence are spaced widely enough so that she could shimmy between them and go up to the house and bang on the door (remember: "no flab"). Does she do so? Not in Haneke's world. There were times when I groaned out loud while watching this mess of a script. As for the antagonists, well a pair of smirking, post-adolescent boys in short shorts and white gloves, each as physically threatening as a bowl of pudding, is just not convincing. This pair brings to mind the adage that one cannot be a victim unless one is willing to be victimized. For a far more memorable portrayal of human depravity, I recommend viewers watch Dennis Hopper's performance in "Paris Trout" (1991).It's one thing for Haneke to lecture his audience, but to do so in such an unoriginal manner detracts from the validity of his message, making it almost risible. Much like his later "The Piano Teacher" (2001), "Funny Games" is a highly derivative film; there is nothing new here: a child's bloody corpse is shown on screen -- Sam Peckinpah's "Major Dundee" (1965). Violence and its effects are not realistically portrayed, here's what it's really like! -- done, again by "Bloody" Sam Peckinpah ("The Wild Bunch" 1969). This was also the entire point of the extended fight scene in Alfred Hitchcock's "Torn Curtain" (1966). People behave irrationally when under duress -- the underlying premise of the Coens' "Blood Simple" (1984). The homicidal criminals among us are otherwise very ordinary people -- John McNaughton's truly chilling masterwork "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" (1986). Worst of all, Haneke does not have the excuse of callow youth. He's old enough to be aware of the work of other film makers, and unless he's spent most of his life in some secluded hamlet in the Tyrolean Alps, there's no reason why he couldn't do his homework better.Between Haneke's heavy-handed hectoring and the numerous flaws in the script, I am tempted to give "Funny Games" a low rating, but will give it a middling one instead. As clumsy as he is about it, I do believe Haneke has something to say and his effort is an honest one. It could be much worse. It could be a film by Lars Von Trier. Rating: 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny oh-oh, not funny ha-ha</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film to quench the curiosity that has been building for a year or two now. I've read that the film is intense and that it's brutal and controversial and, many argue (and some suggest), important. And apparently no violence is actually seen on screen.Well, the truth is there is violence on screen. People are beaten and shot. But that doesn't bother me. Those who read my other reviews know that I am accustomed to on-screen violence which, as "Funny Games" would have me believe, is a serious crime on my part. Maybe the film is right in its moralizing assumptions and claims; I'll touch on that in a second. But before I do - "Funny Games" is not a daring film. It is not an interesting or very intense film. It is boring, contrived, empty and useless. It's a flagrant waste of celluloid, its reputation thriving off controversy and the foreign language its in - after all a foreign language film must be artistic and good just because it's different than the Hollywood drivel.Don't get me wrong. I mean the terms "Hollywood drivel" full-heartedly and sincerely. I like originality and daring. "Funny Games," the story of a family of three tortured and killed over a period of a little more than 12 hours by two strangers, for no apparent reason, is a bad, bad film. It starts off strong - the tension heightens when the viewer begins to realize what the title is actually referring to. But once the killers begin their little murderous spree, "Funny Games" loses any momentum. There is no plot, the spectacle so utterly nihilistic and (as I slowly grew aware of it) inane. Yes, there are several extremely heavy-handed narrative tricks where the killer faces the camera and talks directly to the audience about its involvement in the crimes being committed (the words "subtle" and "unforced symbolism" come to mind). But so what? Just because the killer says we're guilty are we supposed to listen to him? No. "Funny Games" attempts to show that by watching violence and enjoying it we come very close to the actual act of killing; or in the very least tries to establish a very close relationship between watching violence and committing it. (As a side-note, it turns out that the more violent societies are ones which don't have TV and the news and brutal films.) Anyway, first off that theme is so old. There must have been a hundred movies made in the nineties and now about media violence and violent society and so on. Think "Bowling for Columbine," or "Natural Born Killers." The theme is overdone and in "Funny Games" it is handled so awkwardly I wanted to burst out laughing when the killers spoke to the camera. Plus, the more successful treatments of the problem of violence usually had a broader social context. Here, five people interact, some tortured and killed, others torturing and killing. Beyond that there is nothing to "Funny Games." It's a dumb show fraught with violence, but hardly about it. It's a movie which could have succeeded on some bare level as a film if the dumb show was at least intense; it's not - it's boring. Do you reflect about anything after watching it? Yes. You wonder how bad the American films must be in order to make critics and serious film-goers write great reviews of a terrible film just because it's not in English. I believe that that's one of the only reasons people think it's good. I mean, imagine this film with an English-speaking cast and believe me - no one would like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The moral of the story is: Don't let ANYONE borrow your eggs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually saw the remake of Funny Games first, as it was on Film4 and obviously they're going to show the American one with A-list actors because who's going to want to see a load of nobody's whilst reading? You may as well find yourself a nice book! Of course if you can't tell I'm being sarcastic for I love foreign films. However, I fail to see why people have such strong feelings against the remake because it is shot-for-shot and line-for-line the same, and you can't go saying that it's a rip-off because Michael Haneke wrote and directed both versions of the film himself. I'm guessing he saw Funny Games as an important film (which it most definitely is!) and so decided to remake it for a slightly lazier English-speaking audience. It's certainly better than dubbing!Anyway I finally decided to buy the original as the remake is one of my favourites any way and I might say that I found the original slightly better, just for the pure fact that it's unknown actors in the roles (maybe apart from Ulriche, because I've seen him in a few things) which makes everyone seem quite ordinary, thus adding to the already stark realism. I also think that Naomi Watts is too attractive to be playing the ordinary mother. Also, this version fells slightly grittier because of the older cameras. None of this HD lark in our day kids! (I don't know why I'm saying that, I'm only 18 myself!) Despite all these differences the content and directing is exactly the same which is the most important part by far!It took me a while to actually understand the message of Funny Games when I first saw it (I was probably way too young!) but now I can appreciate it's clear and important message on violence in the media, and why we want to watch it. There's a great moment of profound realism when the camera doesn't move, and the actors barely move for what feels like 10 minutes! You suddenly realise that is watching a couple suffer like this really entertainment? It's certainly hard-hitting and extremely brave. Funny Games almost feels like a simulated home invasion film. It makes you think that this could be you, and it's a terrifying thought.The introduction to our two psychopaths is an oddly compelling one. I say oddly because it starts with a conversation about borrowing some eggs and for some reason it's a really compelling scene. The camera barely moves so you feel yourself becoming slowly immersed into the story and you know that something is going to escalate soon, and it does, spectacularly. The psychopathic duo (Peter and Paul or Tom and Jerry or Beavis and Butthead as they're called throughout the film) are supremely chilling due to their lack of empathy. They're also very polite, making them quite different to your average killers. It's later revealed that, through that wonderful technique of breaking the fourth wall, they're terrorising this family for our entertainment. How postmodern I hear you say! Bodger's probably having a postmodern attack right this second!Things unfold in a gripping manner. Whilst some shots may feel like they're going on for too long, that is also the beauty of the film, as it makes it feel so real and involving. At times it feels like a live stream of Big Brother without the birds tweeting in the background! It's very disturbing, and succeeds in being disturbing with very little use of on-screen violence. Funny Games is wildly unpredictable as it breaks all the conventions of a home invasion film so you really have no idea what's going to happen next. The film ends so suddenly and is actually very upsetting to behold. It's also full of suspense and has some seriously thrilling moments.It's clear from the opening titles that this is going to be no ordinary film as we hear such high-culture opera in the very middle-class car which then gets marred with some screaming death metal music. It's creepy, yet humorous at the same time. Funny Games possesses such immense power and it's an experience you're unlikely to forget. However if you're inexperienced with this type of genre then you may be in for a shock. I still find this film shocking despite having seen such home invasion shockers such as Inside and Mother's Day. Nevertheless it's an extremely important film, and one which I'd recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special film with film as a main theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Different movies have different goals and Haneke's Funny Games is very special on this issue. The story is simple, rich family: father George, mother Anna, and their son George Jr., goes to vacation in their weekend cottage. Their social status is accentuated during the film through expensive car, large cottage, classic music, boat, golf, their rich friends etc. It's one of the ways in which Haneke attempts to give viewers a reason to justify suffer of this family during the film. Once we get familiar with this idyllic family, Paul and Peter enter the story. They are psychotic young men dressed entirely in white with white gloves that we notice at the beginning of the film in a neighboring house in a strange conversation with the owners. Interaction with family starts with innocent asking for egg by two of them that quickly turns into irritating farce after which Anna and George try to force the duo out of the house, but that attempt ends with George's broken leg and the torture begins. Story continues with 'games' that psychotic duo 'plays' with family, like hide and seek with the body of a dead dog and the main 'game' is a bet with the family that none of them will survive the next 12 hours.Haneke's main goal is to make viewers reject violence in film industry that became main plot of entertainment. He tries to do that with putting the same senseless violence, that they enjoy on film, in a home of normal family and his desire is that the viewer stops watching the film before it ends. The main moment in which viewer should stop watching is scene after the first death which lasts for few minutes in which absolutely nothing happens, just shows the horror of violence and its consequences. The film also serves as a kind of experiment in which Haneke is trying in various ways to give excuses for terror that the family goes through, and even in some moments one of young men looks into the camera, winks and speaks to the viewer with a sad statement that he is surely on the side of the victims.There's small chances that anyone would enjoy the story, which ultimately is the whole idea. The technical part on the other side is well done. Acting is also at a high level, especially from duo Giering-Frisch who embodies Peter and Paul. The objection goes to the failure to use the high-capacity Ulrich Mühe who plays George and spends most of the film lying on the floor. This is a special film with film as a main theme, specially the violence within it and in most of cases it fulfills it's purpose, at least in short terms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must be insane to call this film great. But then again, I must be insane not to call this film great. Funny Games, directed by Michael Haneke, is a prime example of a great psychological, or the appropriate term would be mindf***, horror of high intense. Anyway, Funny Games plays like an episode of Big Brother gone wrong. And, in order to prevent losing their precious viewers, the director kept rolling, showing the world the sadistic nature of Peter and Paul (who affectionately call each other Tom &amp; Jerry and Beavis &amp; Butthead). But you see, it's precisely the all-too-real feel to it that makes this film unique and different from its peers. That, and the performances by the main five cast members. Basically, the film is not for the faint-hearted or weak-minded people. But it's not for horror fans either. It's mostly for thinkers. If you can understand what the hell happened by the end of the film, you will have known that you were the intended audience and not some half-baked ass wanting a cheap thrill. That came off harsh, didn't it?You know the killers are cold-hearted when they kill in pairs. When they're alone, the killer is scary, yes, but he is limited. But when he has friends, the brutality seems to have no end to it. Google 3 Guys 1 Hammer and you will understand. Here we have Peter &amp; Paul terrorizing a family. They're worse than hack 'n slash killers because they kill slowly and calmly, as if it's their profession, which, by the looks of it, could be. Not only they were well written for the screen, but they were so well acted that it's a wonder those two didn't become well-known actors. Arno Frisch plays Paul, the leader of the two, and the most talkative. His performance was the best from the film and very professional. He so fully embodied the character that the effect was uncharacteristically convincing. The performance is a must-watch. His buddy, Peter, is played by Frank Giering, widely considered to be his breakout performance, a statement I must agree with. Even though he became his character only 90%, the overall effect was damn scary because Frank looked, acted and talked like a true, no-bullshit serial killer. And seeing that was great. I forgot to mention, they have a third member, and that third member is YOU! (if you watch the film, you will understand!). From the family, Ulrich Muhe as Georg was also brilliant. He had his character in check from the start, but it was Susanne Lothar as Anna that impressed me the most. One of the damn best performances from the horror genre. It was terribly awesome! The little kid was good, too, you know, with his terrified expressions and watery eyes!Great performances in horror films are very rare, take it from me, I know. They're either one-sided or gain pace somewhere near the end. But you won't find any of that in this one. It looks and feels genuine. Authentic. Real. As real as if they're "live" actors in a very long snuff film. You won't be disappointed, I promise.In conclusion, Funny Games is controversial and seriously not for yellow tummies. If you're tired of watching the same old kills in every horror movie, then the uniqueness in this film should be a good surprise!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Haneke is a director that just loves to mess with our minds. Nothing in "Funny Games" is ever quite what it seems, it's a master class in toying with viewers' expectations. Don't get dragged into this expecting some sort of "torture porn", get dragged into this because it's a really good movie. You'll barely see any violence because everything's implied, but the atmosphere is totally suffocating. It's definitely not the most comfortable movie to watch, but somehow it's just totally fascinating. The only thing that didn't really work for me are the breakings of the fourth wall, which do have a clear point but still come of as stilted and a bit pompous. Aren't there more subtle ways to satirize violent cinema? The remote scene is sorta hilarious though, I'll give Haneke that. Overall "Funny Games" is a movie you just can't look away from, but that doesn't make it entirely perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Haneke wrote and directed Funny Games in Germany in 1997. He did an American shot for shot remake in 2008. Both are very good thrillers but I'll use the original for a review. Georg, his wife Anna, their son Schorschi and the pet doggie, Rolfi arrive at the family lake house for some leisure time. They are members of the German upper class who enjoy the good things in life. They are introduced by their neighbor, Fred, to Peter and Paul, who soon impose themselves by destroying a phone and breaking eggs of the perfect home. When asked politely to leave, Paul kills the loyal pet and Peter breaks Georg's leg with a nine iron; ouch that hurt! Paul quizzes the lucky threesome by asking them if they would like to bet whether they will be alive by nine o'clock the next morning. The two psychopaths argue back and forth in a comical manner and when other neighbors visit, Anna tells them that they are friends. Murder and mayhem ensue to an interesting conclusion which is a satisfying and believable one; Haneke has made a biting and entertaining thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of what I have on my heart regarding this movies has been already written in the previous reviews. However I just have to add my two cents, because this movie is truly extraordinary. I can't give 10/10, because this movie is really unpleasant to watch. It's the kind of movie you don't want to see again. Ever. I found myself shivering during certain scenes and at some point I was even nauseous. Haneke did tremendous job by toying with the audience. While the viewer is watching the family being tortured, the pain is literally transfered from the screen onto the viewer. I had a strange feeling that I'm part of the film. This doesn't happen to you when you're watching "normal" movies. Here you're not only the viewer. You're the part of the game. By the way I had to admire the references to Beavis and Butthead or Tom and Jerry, where its entertainment is based on violence and ugliness... in the easy and accepted form of course, but still. Whatever these points questioning violence in entertainment are accurate or not, this movie does one thing that art should and/or must be doing. It will move you. Doesn't matter in what direction, but it will leave a mark in your mind for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very peculiar way of showing violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays, the movie industry is following what people want; Cinema is laking authors. It is guided by the wants of the spectators, not the filmmakers . There are certain scenes and jokes that we are all sick of hearing. Haneke is aware of that. His movie "Funny Games" shouts "**** you" to the viewer. He doesn't want his movie to be another in the shelve. More than trying to be genuine, his movie wants to be the exact opposite of what other movies are. In a literal way. Funny Games is the synonym of dark-humour. And with a very good taste.A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconventional and very good intelligent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most movies seem to follow unwritten laws about how a commercially successful movie should look like. Mainstream tastes create an alternative movie reality which fits perfectly into the expectations of the audience. Besides creating the "i do totally know what will happen now" effect so common to probably most of us, it also leaves the audience psychologically disconnected from what is happening on the screen. Your beloved movie reality is serving only one purpose: Your own entertainment. Your awareness of watching an alternative reality basically is perverting your perception: You entertain yourself by seeing others suffer. You are so desensitized by violent movies that your empathy in this "movie reality" is numbed down to a level, where you need extreme stimulation to be entertained in this kind of artificial environment. Unnoticed by yourself, your emotional numbness and disconnection from what is happening on the screen puts you exactly in the mental place of a sociopath. Without experiencing the thrill of seeing people suffer, without blood and violence you feel bored. You feel bored when their suffering is ended too sudden, you would feel bored if their torture is not prolonged. In the end, the (not so) funny games are played by the audience alone - your movie reality alter ego is watching actors suffer for entertainment purposes and for nothing else. There is no purpose behind these funny games except your own entertainment. Your psychopath alter ego needs these extreme measurements to get satisfied emotionally, it craves exciting moment after moment or else you will get bored. You feel like wasting your time when nothing exciting happens, rather you would enjoy to see someone die, suffer, something extraordinarily violent happening suddenly and so on. As i described above, you don't realize that watching a movie you may be experiencing the way a sociopath psyche could be like - complete emotional disconnection and extreme needs for stimulation of your emotions.And i think that really is what this movie is about. It is constantly reminding that you watch a movie. It also is reminding you how reality could look like. It is very artificial and yet realistic at the same time. It will point its finger on the real player in this game - on you. It will show you that it is actually YOU, who expects too see nasty stuff happening to others. That it is you who is setting the rules of a sadistic game and who expects the movie to play along. The movie is ingeniously playing with this. It will not show you what you want to see at the time when you want to see it, but it will make clear to you that this is intentional by letting you see it later. Superficially it may seem as a way for creating suspense, but i think on a deeper level this movie is meant as a critical index finger directly pointed at the audience. Your expectations in a movie are completely perverted and distorted when compared to reality. Reality does not allow you to always guess what happens next. People will not act logically under pressure. You are the kind of wise guy saying "why isn't he doing ... so stupid!" in movies? Just be in that situation first and then we can argue about that. In fact, this movie is so disturbing because in some ways it seems closer to reality than other movies. It does not completely obey the rules of the "movie reality" which serve the single purpose to be entertaining. Movies should be an art form, but real art is created by the artist for himself. And then enjoyed by the audience. I think this movie is deserving being characterized as art. As such it is open to your interpretation - mine was described above.It is really good, especially if you like movies that are a bit "different". But i see that it might not be accessible to some people. But making it so would take away its purpose completely as i see it. That may be the reason why the director only agreed to an American remake when he could do it in a completely identical form just replacing actors (so i heard).To me as a German this original seems the better option. American movies tend to get a lot of its fictional character just by the fact that they look "american". The effect at least for me is increased with the austrian actors, because it seems more like "the family living nearby" that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always has been a prolific admirer of movies in the "thriller- suspense" genre but Michael Hanake's Funny Games has surpassed my expectation as an ironically satire portray. An innocent family's fate is baffled when two modest looking psychopaths resort to innuendo and insinuation. Their holiday plans are shattered into pieces by the schizophrenic acts of the two individuals. There is no help, no mercy, no occlusion and more importantly no rescue! The father, mother and child are simply subjected to iniquity as their argument ceases when George asks the two young lads : "Why are you doing this?" and Paul remarks : "Why not?". Eventually the kid is shot and the parents are left in turmoil only for sometime to console themselves when the plight of evil returns again. An extremely well dramatized script and acted to perfection by the relatively small cast. Hanake leads the viewers more and more into his raving downstream by making the scenes immensely helpless which reflects in the climax as well. This is not a movie for every viewer! it is very disturbing and may even lead to restlessness. So, get yourself ready for the ultimately ride of violence at its very best.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have broken my own rule here of reading a few other reviews before writing my own. I try to make my own mind up before being influenced by others thoughts but in this case I was just too damn curious. Sure , I agree with the person who said about Lethal Weapon being a fun film and death being a vehicle of entertainment. It is sad it has gone this way but in that respect I have to hold my hands up and admit to liking Midsomer Murders where the object is to try to guess the culprit from the dwindling cast. I say this so as not to be two faced about my thoughts towards this film. As others have commented, this film can be viewed on two levels, either at face value or looking for a deeper meaning. At a face value level it can be compared directly with the 1997 Graeme Campbell film Murder One. This is a rather pedestrian retelling of true events which happened in Maryland in 1973. Here three psychotic low life no brainers escaped from a high security prison, picked up the teenage brother of the gang leader and then went on a killing spree. They killed six members of one family including a pregnant woman who was forced to watch her family being methodically exterminated before being gang raped and finally shot in the back. This is the only time I have seen reviews on IMDb from people who have never seen the film. They say they were close enough to the real events for it to leave them mentally scarred and they have no desire to see the retelling on film.If we view Funny Games as a cautionary tale of senseless violence in films then that is not altogether a bad thing. Perhaps I am reading too much into it but I saw It as more than that; moreover as an indictment of falling standards generally. I am old enough to remember black and white television from the end of the 50's and the public bewilderment when Lady Isabel Barnett came on the panel game What's My Line with a plunging neckline that revealed two inches of décolletée. That was the talk of the queue in the butchers shop for a week afterwards, I can tell you. My mother was convinced it was a trick of the studio lights. "A real Lady of the land would not publicly expose herself on television in that shameless way" she said. But it was no trick of the lights and the viewing public were treated to a look at the top two inches of Lady Barnett's tits. How naff it all seems now. Very few commercially successful films nowadays get away without having their required smutty bits. Technology didn't help,either. The Korean War was something on the other side of the world and not something to get in the way of everyday life unless there was someone close to you over there. By the time Vietnam came around people could see battles in real time taking place with their TV dinners on their lap. It was a case of "Honey, pass the chips and dip" as soldiers were blown into a thousand pieces before your eyes. The population were numbed down and dumbed down.Plagiarism or not, Michael Haneke cannot have been unaware of Murder Ones existence before making Funny Games. If it is prophecy then events depicted seem to have been somewhat preceded. In this age of reason it is however well that someone is awake and saying "This is the path we are treading. Take stock of the situation or fall deeper into the abyss". Do we stop with this mental insensitivity or is it to be more Christians to the lions; cheering at public hangings and snuff movies for all? This leads on to the thorny question of censorship. At a time when we are pushing back the boundaries of science and technology should we not, on a social level, break free of prim Victorianism? But to what end when self regulating standards of decency seems not to be working any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, brutal, and effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the 2008 version of Funny Games (also by Haneke) already, so I already knew everything that I was in store for. However, it doesn't mean that this film was less effective.I guess since the 2008 'remake' was also done by Haneke it makes sense that both still come out across as intended by him, and both share the same effect. Saying that, whichever version one sees first is probably the one that the person will look for, but there is no denying the power in this one. It's themes still come across perfectly, so what I can review is some very minor differences. Both films have the same type of shots and cinematography and setting, but what I did notice was that this 1997 version has darker lighting in it's approach. As for the performances, I would say Susanne Lothar was fantastic, but I would say Naomi Watts was superior (although how much this has to do with me having seen the other version first I don't know). Ulrich Muhe, though, was much more effective than Tim Roth, who I thought was the weak point in the 2008 version. The kids are equal. Based on the two psychopaths, while Watts was the best performer in the 2008 version, it is Arno Frisch who is the stand-out here, and I would say he is overall more creepy and effective than Michael Pitt (who in all respects was still pretty good). As for Peter, I think Brady Corbert from the 2008 version was superior to Giering here. That means that overall, the performances as a whole are tied, since 2-2 for both films. And overall, this version is completely effective and I don't think that whichever version you see will make a big difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a story about a world full of psychopaths and of sheep-like victims that have no survival instincts. Is the story credible? From what I have seen in the news bulletins or read in the newspapers, it can be worse than this. I was unable to feel sympathy for the victims in this movie because not only they were stupid, but also wimpy. The dog is a symbol of their flimsiness: a big German shepherd, perfectly trained, who barks a lot but does not bite and gets killed by a golf club hit. Pathetic. Even a kitten would have put a better fight. OK, the woman allowed the young man into the house, but that is not the point. The point is that when the man knew something was wrong with the boys...you just don't slap the aggressor. Only prostitutes do that when they squabble for the best place to expose their merchandise. If you have to touch the aggressor, you do it with the fist, in such a manner that he does not get up from the floor. OK, the film goes on, the kid escapes from the house and cannot jump over the gate. When I was his age, I could climb straight trees using only their bark for support. A gate like that would have been a piece of cake for a boy that did something else with his butt other than sit on the couch playing video-games for years. FFD...FFD...the 2 aggressors leave the area just like that, leaving the victims in the house, alive. No matter how crazy he is, a criminal always wants to escape. What if that mobile phone would have worked? This part of the script does not stand. No criminal would leave himself vulnerable to so many variables. And a few scenes later, the woman gets caught by the evil guys. I can't speak for others, but if I am in the middle of a road and someone drives a car in my direction, I can identify it 1 mile before it reaches me. I know the headlights, the silhouette, the humming of the engine. I can recognize it from 100 cars of the same type. The woman gets caught by the baddies that were driving the family car. Pathetic. And in the end, when the victims realize their fate, instead of becoming uncooperative and raging with fury, they just do what the murderers tell them to do. Even if they know they will still die. Can something be more pathetic than that? The 2 villains in this movie are like 2 karate instructors. Sure, they can hurt you during the training, but you will learn something from them. You cannot be mad on your instructor. Have you learned something from this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film and was fascinated by it. It contains the little things that many movie makers seem to miss out. This film is never boring and it keeps up an interest thanks to the great actors and the story. After watching the original movie I wanted to see the remake with Naomi Watts and am sad to say that this was a flop. I like Naomi as an actress, but the story had been changed a little here and there and all the sudden it was not "the little things" special anymore, but seemed to be more about showing up Naomi's underwear :). Naomi is a great actress, but one person doesn't normally make a movie good. In this version I found the actors more sincere and real than in the remake from 2007. I am like someone else who had reviewed the remake, guessing that Haneke wanted to make a remake on his own film only for a bigger public. He made a few changes in the remake also which annoyed me because there was no good reason for them as far as I could see. Remakes can be done better than the original movies if they are made either the same or completely different, but changing smaller details when they were thought through from the start will only make them annoying. This original version was how ever very interesting, so interesting that I didn't want to stop watching it. The bad guy gave me the same feeling that only one person in one role has given me before. That is Robert Carlyle as Adolf Hitler in "Hitler, the Rise of Evil". I would say that Haneke had probably found the perfect actors in this first version of this sick and wicked story. Sorry Naomi, you are a terrific actress in the right role, but this remake was not it. In other words I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes seeing odd and funny stories, but not the later version of Haneke's "Funny Games".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you will expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most terrifying feelings in the world is utter helplessness. Knowing you can't do a single thing about the situation you are in and nothing good is going to come of it is such a harrowing and painful thing to think about. Funny Games hones in on these emotions and then unexpectedly breaks a different ground. The movie is about a family who travel to their lovely vacation home, only to be terrorized by two sadistic and purely evil human beings. The movie explores deep and awful violence, sadism, and terror. It is not an easy film to stomach because of the realistically astonishing way it depicts violence.Going into the film I had no idea what it was about and was amazed at what it entailed. It is a social commentary, but not in the way you would expect. It is not a commentary about modern society, but a commentary of the cinematic medium itself. The film utilizes a technique called breaking the fourth wall. This means breaking the wall between the actors and the audience and speaking directly to them. This technique practically comes out of nowhere and seems out of place until you read in to what the film is truly about at its dark center. That is really all I want to say about that, so as not to give away anything.Funny Games is a fantastic film to become immersed in and elicit the responses that German director Michael Haneke wanted from it. It has a great sense of direction that finds shock and intrigue in the most unexpected places. Don't try to dislike this film as you watch it. Let yourself be engulfed in the disturbing atmosphere of this film that reaches to new heights of this creative storytelling medium. This film is so captivating and it is all done so stylistically with the utmost care. The direction here is superb and stands out a great deal. The long takes (one of which lasts around 15 minutes) serve to draw in the audience and force them to deal with the situation as much as the characters have to. It's rough to watch and beats at your emotions in a frustrating way. I've never seen a film quite like this. It breaks all the rules of traditional storytelling, yet in an impressive and captivating way.I'm sure most of this review has made little to no sense, so all I can say is go watch Funny Games and see for yourself this extremely different method of storytelling that is as interesting as it is horrific. It's a fantastic movie that will unexpectedly raise questions and ideas in your mind about violence and its use in movies.</fullReview>

Maybe we need to be reminded that real people are involved in violence. It is not a game.I have already seen the 2007 version of this film. It is exactly the same script, just different actors.

		<shortDescription>A different kind of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Haneke's "Funny Games" is more disturbing, horrifying, haunting, and ultimately thought-provoking than anything churned out by the Hollywood mainstream horror industry today.The film is brilliantly photographed and acted, with long static shots that build unbearable amounts of tension, forcing the viewer to watch the terror unfold and daring you to look away. Another interesting tool Haneke employs here is the breaking of the "fourth wall." The villains occasionally smirk or wink at directly at the camera or reference the film and audience in character. A very unusual and yet disturbing tactic.As for the message of the film, it's obvious: violence is not entertainment, but something to be loathed and condemned. Some may argue that by conveying this message through the depiction of violence is hypocritical or oxymoronic, but I disagree. The villains (and the filmmakers) constantly taunt and tease the viewer and our protagonists, asking us if we're entertained, if the film is long enough. Haneke is trying to make the point that while we sometimes watch a violent film for entertainment, we forget how horrific and revolting it really can be. Therefore, "Funny Games" is a difficult film to categorize. I suppose, at face value, it is a horror film (albiet a "thinking-man's" horror film), but is also a social satire with a clear message and theme. It's truly unique and shockingly bold (although I predict many may disagree).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One who watches Haneke's Funny Games just as a thriller will be hugely disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many see Michale Haneke as a challenging director. He makes films that are hard to watch, hard to understand and he challenges the viewer to observe and think. I would say that Cache (2005) and Funny Games (1997) are his most accessible films. Cache because it doesn't break any huge traditions of narrative (even that a lot does happen below the surface). Funny Games because of its way of achieving excitement, the mystery and, the suspense whether there will be violence or not. But Haneke does use his own unique narrative and Funny Games is not an easy pill to swallow. It achieves to create very distressing scenes, challenge the viewer and through that make the viewer distressed. Michael Haneke's cruel psychological thriller doesn't give any chance for the viewer to entertain around the violence.A bourgeois family (mom, dad and son) set out to have a peaceful weekend at their idyllic vacation apartment. When the dad goes to fix their boat with his son, a young polite man comes to ask four eggs from the mother. Eventually the discussion starts having unpleasant features and another man comes to the apartment. When the dad and the son come to the apartment, the situation breaks out of control. Soon the family is in a cruel game, which isn't funny at all.Michael Haneke often takes an idyllic family to the center of his film. For instance in Cache (2005) he destroys the illusion of bourgeois peace. A major theme in his films is the part of wealthy Europeans in the world's suffering of the poor. In Funny Games he destroys their life - the family faces their worst nightmare. This destruction of bourgeois peace is clearly showed to us in the beginning: mom and dad drive in a car listening to classical music and trying to guess who's the composer, funny game right? Then suddenly we have to listen to a loud, screaming grind-core song. A very impressive start for a film, and one of the finest introductions I've seen in modern cinema. It's really a basic thing in the theory of film; to introduce the leading theme for the viewer in the very beginning, but still many new filmmakers seem to neglect this.Funny Games is a slap in the face. Slap in the face of American media violence. We see violence everywhere; in TV, news, internet, movies etc. In Funny Games Haneke doesn't give any chance for the audience to entertain while watching the violence. At some points it's unbearable, very hard to watch, for some at least. Those who can watch it without feeling distressed are the people Haneke here criticizes; a person who likes to watch violence like this is a slave of the modern society and, its media violence. One of the cruel men even asks once in a while "What do you want?," from the audience. He takes straight contact with us. What do WE actually want to see? If we love watching violent entertainment, let's. Michale Haneke always challenges the viewer in his films. He makes us think our own part in the film, but in Funny Games this happens very directly. It's post modernism, a brand of philosophy where reality is subjective and, there is no one single almighty reality. Funny Games also includes a lot of philosophical thinking. What is actually the reality. It mixes truth and fiction with the reality. It can be watched as a slap in the face of media violence but it also deals with European bourgeois life. A fascinating film, probably very hard to watch for some, since it doesn't give any relief to the audience, if it does, it instantly takes it away. I would recommend this to all lovers of cinema but I don't consider it as Haneke's finest. If you are going to watch Funny Games just as a thriller you will be hugely disappointed and, if you watch it like that you are exactly the ones who receive this slap in the face. Because you won't find any motives of the psychos, you won't find any conventional twists or solutions. You should look below the surface.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior on seeing this movie I had read a lot about it, an even a co-worker told me it was the most vile movie he ever saw and that he wished never to see it again. All that got me very curious and i stumbled upon an interview of M. Haneke where he explains Funny Games quite in-depth.Alert spoilers ahead : The beginning of the movie was very shocking, where the family gets physically injured. My blood was boiling and i felt the adrenalin flowing throughout my whole like in a bloodlust state wishing harm upon our 2 evil doers and even a few hours after the movie my limbs felt stiff. As it was no conventional fiction as the actors break the fourth wall multiple times so i decided to detach myself from the movie and it got more bearable and also a lot more fun by making comments in the theater. The 2 evil doers symbolizes the portrayal of violence in movies. Haneke has given them the traits of young well educated and wealthy killers based upon the fact that young people from middle and upper social classes had killed people only to experience the thrill of a kill. They have been on a torturing and killing spree for at least 48 hours and are heading for another 24 hours of vileness yet they don t have to sleep nor do they suffer from fatigue. I made it through the movie according to Haneke i needed it, as according to him i could i have walked out of the theater at any time ; well not really i was with someone.I will also give you the comments of my friend who saw the movie with me : He said he found it less shocking, disturbing than Requiem for a Dream or the Deer Hunter. I give it a 7 rating for it is a very well conceived movie with good acting, a sober pace and a bold purpose. I didn't enjoy seeing the movie yet i found pleasure in what the movie has brought me to write my first review on this site.Personal IMDb vote history : http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=26810025</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't want to keep watching but I found myself sort of riveted to the spot, unable to act - the same situation as the victims in this film. The film left me feeling disgusting and badly shaken, at the story itself, at the fact that I had sat there and watched the whole damn thing, at how real the suffering was. It's like how people slow down to look at a car crash, but it's not just a bit of blood, it's two whole hours.One of the most effective parts of the film to me was how Paul (the "leader" of the pack) continued to manipulate and psychologically "corner" all the characters, constantly making it sound like his actions were perfectly reasonable, and the victims were the ones at fault.The most ineffective part in my opinion was the Paul's interaction with the audience. Quite frankly, it just seemed silly, and the film would have managed to get its point across without that. It reminded me that it was just a film, and was the only way I could detach from it.But for what it is, it is outstanding film. It takes a very important place in the history of cinema violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start with "Funny games" directed by Michael Haneke? I happened to see it a few years ago ( before the remake was made) when I rented it at the local video shop. I had only heard that it was extremely violent and scary. The hearsay was right. Two psychotic teenagers who are very clean and well groomed take a couple and their son hostage and play nearly unviewable sadistic games with them that come off as all too real. At one point when the woman escapes, you think there could be hope but then she is recaptured and tortured more. This film is so disturbing because it is directed almost like a snuff movie. It has nothing to do with other more funny horror movies in the genre, there's no humor and no redeeming qualities to make it bearable to watch.

		<shortDescription>unforgettable movie, forgettable title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie late one night about 10 years ago and had to watch it till the end. I spent a long time trying to trace it on this database and only solved the mystery when they broadcast the re-make just the other night, and there I was, watching the unmistakable scene with the mobile phone and knew I had finally traced it.I remembered it as a foreign film but the main actor I had tagged as Danny Zane. I don't think any other film has stayed on my mind as much as this one, (perhaps 'Lost in the Desert' when I was a kid). This film is pure horror. Horror doesn't have to be expensive or full of camera tricks and CGI to really get to you. The best horror is the sort that is about our basic fears. I felt really cold when I watched this film and when I remember it now, I kind of get a chill. So there you are in the middle of this journey of horror and suddenly the protagonist turns round and does something so totally unexpected, even now, it makes me think about the power that cinema has to get right inside your head and disturb you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking the Fourth Wall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wealthy family heads to their isolated summer cottage for a family vacation. Shortly after arriving two young men encroach upon the families's idyllic paradise, imposing upon them a nightmarish series of "Funny Games". "Funny Games" is disturbing first and foremost. There are no cheap scares or over-the-top gratuitous violence. It's a first class terror that uses psychological attacks on the mind to endow the audience with an unforgettable journey into a nightmarish series of terrorizing events.Yes, this film truly is a work of art. The acting, every last actor, is impeccably well cast and turns in an outstanding performance. With the exception of several questionable editing and directing moves, the production aspects of this film are first class. The cinematography is simply beautiful. "Funny Games" has such refinement from beginning to end. It really puts shame to most modern American horror productions.The film should have been trimmed down from 1:42:00 to perhaps 1:30:00. The film makers chose to use very long takes in an effort to convey different emotional outpourings. And while these long takes are executed well and convey these feelings, these shots didn't need to be quite so long. There's a fine line between utilizing a longer take to convey emotions and distracting/ boring the audience. Again this film is a masterpiece, but I must disagree with the use of the "rewind" scene. Yes, yes the director was trying to make a point about gratuitous real world violence. But I felt the use of the "rewind" scene and the direct addressing of moviegoers (Or as defined in theater, breaking the fourth wall) were anti-climatic. Each time one of these techniques were used the tension that had been building was lost. I really don't care if the film maker was trying to make a point, these filming techniques were distracting and unprofessional; they were the reason I gave this film 8 stars instead of 10.Also in question is the decision to film almost all the violent acts off screen. Yes, I understand the film makers were using creative ingenuity to create this work of art, but filming almost every single act of violence and nudity off screen got to be annoying. I felt this decision by the film makers also took away from the terror we could have felt for the well developed characters that made up the vacationing family. What I'm saying is that I finally found a horror film with well developed characters, and the producers choose to exclude from the screen all the violent acts committed against these characters we care so much about. Usually the problem with horror movies is that the characters are underdeveloped and every single act of violence is shown over and over in a close-up. "Funny Games" has the opposite problem.Please don't misunderstand me, this film is a treasure. "Breaking the fourth act" and using on "screen rewinds" are totally open to interpretation, but I'm against them both. Despite the violence being off screen it still manages to be shocking and disturbing. "Funny Games" is a unique, genius that should be a pleasure for any educated fan of horror. I haven't seen the US version and will not be planning on viewing it anytime soon. I'm on the verge of giving up completely on horror films released in the US, but that's a different story. I highly recommend this film to seasoned and informed horror veterans across the globe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny Games is truly a disturbing and distraught film. It leaves all hope out. That being said, its a well made movie. Family of three on vacation are taken hostage by two psychotic men who make a bet with the family on their survival. The two performances by the guys are amazing and scary. They nail the sadistic, emotionless killers perfectly. This film is really slow most of the time, but never too dull. Also, while the film is in itself pretty violent, most of the violence is off screen or just moderate. However, this film is still depressing and intense and scary. It is not for everyone. A lot of people won't/don't like it because of the outcome. I only recommend it to those who can stomach dark, dark stories, or anyone who likes chillers. I rate it 8/10. Rated R for disturbing and violent behavior, including brief strong violence, terror-some involving a child, and brief language</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White short shorts (we're talking John Stockten short), no socks and deck shoes, white gloves and an ivy-league education. That's creepy for a serial killer. Said outfit and his friend Butthead make a bet with the vacationing family that they will be dead in 12 hours. This is one of the creepiest films I've seen.All the pretentious talk about "making a film that sends a clear message about violence, and the audience's view and involvement with violence on film" is NONSENSE. Where does that kind of silliness come from? There is nothing didactic or pedantic about this film. It is terror for terror's sake.One of the 'synopses' states "the viewers are forced ... to share a certain complicity with the criminals." How's that? Wouldn't that be true of watching any film? Is it because the director breaks the 'fourth wall'? When this film was over I didn't contemplate my complicity in media violence, I applauded the writer, director and actors in giving me a great ninety minutes of terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have this movie with me since quite some time but have not yet been able to set my mood to watch this. I am just not able to. I have seen some scenes at random; the mindless and sadistic violent games that the 2 psychopaths make the family play just hit me. I thought I knew what I was getting into as I had read a lot about the movie, the plot and the director's work but honestly, nothing prepared me for this. Nothing. I couldn't watch further. What purpose, I feel. Why. Why should I treat myself to such torture and agony? Is this a slice of real life? Can this actually happen? I don't know. No, I think I am wrong. Such torture can't be meted out on any family out on vacation. Can't, I feel. Just can't. I really don't know why the story has to be so violent. What does it want to convey? Or is this film just a voyeuristic journey that the director has undertaken and expects the audience to join in too? I guess I'll understand better once I see the movie. But how do I, when nearly the whole movie is a like slap on my face, a hard one, redefining the meaning of the word "violence"? When will I? I have no clue. But when I do, I will write further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny Games (1997) *** (out of 4) A husband (Ulrich Muhe) and wife (Susanne Lothar) take their son to the families vacation home where they are taken hostage by two friends (Frank Giering, Arno Prisch) who torture them with mental games. This is a brutally honest and frank film, which is something I really respect and something that made the film better even with several flaws in the plot. One of the plot holes towards the end, involving an escape, really got on my nerves but for the most part this film is a winner. What I really enjoyed is that uneasy tension that the director constantly keeps the viewer in. It's clear from the start that these villains aren't your typical movie villains as these men are capable of doing anything and they are so charming in their evilness that they almost come off as anti-heroes to root for. That's before the final act when things take an even darker turn and the black comedy is thrown out the window. What really makes this film work are the performances by Giering and Prisch who come off so natural that their mild manors come off very intense and nerve wrecking. Lothar and Muhe are also very good in their roles but the film certainly belongs to the villains. In the end, what really pushes this film is the fact that director Haneke is playing with the viewer. The director is smart enough to know that anyone watching this has seen countless movies like this before and he is constantly giving us things we don't expect. These type of films follow certain rules that are never broken yet each of them are shattered here and this is where the suspense comes from and what separates this film from others in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you sure you want a second home?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fiction is real . . . . What you see in the movies is what you see literally." Funny GamesIt's not Home Alone. It's not Panic Room. Funny Games is a combination of the two: part satire of the audience's expectations about the home invasion genre; large part scary horror/thriller about two psycho young men straight out of Stanley Kubrick's amoral hoodlums in Clockwork Orange. This is one scary movie compromised only by a larger purpose from writer/director Michael Haneke.George (Tim Roth), Anna (Naomi Watts, also executive producer of the film), and their little son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) visit their posh vacation home only to be beset upon by two clean-cut caddies, Peter (Brady Corbet) and Paul (Michael Pitt), dressed in white sweaters and gloves. Cinematographer Darius Khondi's shots emphasize the sterility and blinding torture. The bad guys' false respect also belies the horrible games they plan for the family after dad has been incapacitated.Austrian helmer Haneke did this same film, European version, in 1997, leaving little out in this version ten years later but adding an impressive Watts as heroin. In fact, while he guarantees the enduring elements of the genre by reproducing the same film, he continues his brand of playfulness by cutting away from the more horrible scenes and further disappointing us by not showing the nude Anna (a very fit Watts). The piece de resistance of his revolution is a couple of shots with the lead thug, Paul, talking directly into the camera about our participation in the scenario. By confounding the sequence of events, Haneke indicts our tyrannical expectations, only to make them irrelevant to the unusual horror at hand but accurate about media manipulation. A facile plot twist is Haneke's surrender to the conventions of screen horror telling; otherwise, he'll make you question your recent purchase of the second-home paradise where being away from it all is not the safest place to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film sneaks up on you - it has stayed with me. Some of the images are searing. Haneke is not for everyone. I've liked some of his films and others---not so much. Lothar and Muhe give rock solid performances (as does the rest of the cast). The film is very unpleasant and I can see how some would be very offended by it and even bored. But, the thing works for me. It is slow and deliberate but overall, the power of it seeps in. I almost don't want to see the American version (which i think the average American audience member will despise) - I like Watt and Roth and Pitt but the original version and cast was excellent. The premise of someone in their own home and then being terrorized by someone gets right to anyone's gut. We've all thought about it when we're home or isolated and we hear a noise outside. The recent French film ILS is also well done and creepy. The scene at the end on the sailboat still haunts me. Someone else described this film as a mental horror film and I think that sums it up nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconventionally Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny Games is an unconventional thriller by German writer and director Michael Haneke. The movie follows a mother, father and son vacationing at their lake house when they're interrupted and held hostage by two psychotic young men.The hostage-takers are strangely sedate in their brutal treatment of the family. The horror of the situation is heightened to epic proportions with Haneke's brilliant direction. You do not see any of the violence; instead, you see the horrible reality. The extremely long shots, the lack of music and the harsh factuality of the scenes make this movie brilliant.Haneke breaks the "fourth wall" at least twice during this movie. As one character looks and talks directly to the camera and the audience. Another breathtaking scene is a single take which lasts over ten minutes.These types of directorial choices are far from those which are found in typical Hollywood movies. Haneke purposefully uses non-glamorous portrayals of violence in a direct opposition to Taraninto-style movies and because of this, I think the movie is brilliant - highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a reflexion on violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Funny Games" is a "funny" film, because it tells a violent story, but it doesn't show violence directly - what the camera registers is mild physical violence. The hardcore violence (so freely shown in television and in so many films) is implied by noises, splatters of blood etc.. Even a sexual humiliation scene is shown through the facial expressions of the character; in many other films the camera would show us the happenings. "Funny Games" is a very sober/serious film - the camera concentrates primarily on the characters and their immediate surroundings; the film doesn't try to appeal to our emotions and also it doesn't tell us what is right and what is wrong. It leaves room for the viewer to think and reach his/her own conclusions. When Hollywood shows violence, it is just for the entertainment of the audience - consequence: a film that is easy to like and easier to forget.There are films that really show violence, and have no restraint in showing it. One of these films is "Cannibal Holocaust". Much has been written about "Cannibal Holocaust" so I will just say one or two things. I like very much "Cannibal Holocaust" because it showed many things that the traditional movies avoid to show - It's a film that tries to cross visually our moral boundaries: Civilization? Barbary? The heart of darkness may be everywhere: inside and outside. "Cannibal Holocaust" shows us raw images of violence whose intention is really to shock, maybe shock us into thinking. But it is not a "political" film and it doesn't make political speeches. It is an exploitation film, but even so, I think that through this film Deodato and his team conveyed something that they felt deeply inside about this world - heart of darkness. Back to "Funny Games".I don't think either that "Funny Games" is a social indictment - there is no direct condemnation of the media's exploitation of violence. The films shows what happens in a detached way. "Funny Games" is not cynical, but it's clearly a film made by an intellectual. Only an intellectual (one could say a philosopher) would be able to tell this story with such a serene distance. The philosopher says: "Violence comes like thunder. It strikes from the skies and can bring havoc. What can we do? I don't know. Anyway there's no god above and no hell below. Me, I am a film maker - I like to tell stories".The story runs like this: A family on vacation goes to an isolated house by a lake and two guys pay them a visit. What begins innocently enough will develop into a game of cat and mouse - annoyance, perplexity, fear and then, panic and despair. Funny games will be played and the stakes grow higher and higher.....There are no good and bad characters - the film doesn't judge, it doesn't appeal for our "tender feelings" or easy indignation. A good example for "Funny Games"'s style is its beginning - A car driving through a road, inside the car a couple with their son, they are playing classical music CDs for their enjoyment. Soft classical music and the green landscape provides the background for their conversation. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the soundtrack changes - wild punk music invades the screen. The couple go on talking, but we don't hear them anymore, we can see only their lips moving - frenetic music underlines the scene. A warning ... a slight feeling of estrangement. Funny games!The acting in "Funny Games" is overall excellent (especially Susanne Lothar as Anna) - one weak actor could have spoiled the whole film. A traditional American film would show more directly the violence but it would, at the same time, fill the story with moralism and "good feelings" and, of course, in the end the good..... Well, I guess no more need to be said.I wouldn't say that "Funny Games" is a masterpiece, but it will leave you puzzled - you'll have food for thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Funny Games" is the rare kind of picture one could watch even in the 22nd century! This film is Bunuel's macabre satire "Le charm discret de la Bourgeoisie" turned into a horror!I was shocked and outraged the first time I saw it, fascinated and mesmerized the second time and every time I watch it I never cease to find surprising elements that bother my mind and challenge my imagination!First of all I was surprised to see that a lot of people saw in this picture just a very convincing anti-violence manifest! This "cat and mouse" film/game embodies the ruthless critique of a social class that ceases to ACT OR THINK and eventually loses its instinct of preservation.I found it to be no critique of a certain society: American, Canadian or Western European but the critique of the bourgeoisie which lives within each and every individual and ultimately the critique of the Modern Man (No Hero, No Villain but a passive element part of a system).Secondly I was also puzzled to find out that many people considered the interaction actor/viewer to be a shortcoming and eventually spoiled their pleasure to live the drama of the 3 victims.Well...as long as we accept the film to be a metaphor with no real vivid characters I see no reason why we shouldn't accept this convention too!We are given a CONVENTION and we accept it.It's the same in theater: we know that not a real drama unfolds in front of our eyes on the stage but a re-enactment with some characters; nevertheless we still experience different emotions: we cry we laugh...in one word we accept the illusion!!Not a film for everyone!

I couldn't stop watching it. I hated the torturers so much that I wanted to jump into the screen and strangle them. This may be the point: you can have a great movie about repulsive things. It is very frustrating to watch, but that was intended. The two near escapes were as tense as any scene I've watched anywhere. I think the final verdict is that this is a must see unless you're overly sensitive. This idea can be applied to a film such as Schindler's List, repulsive in many parts, but still a great piece of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be very disturbing and gripping. The tale of a family caught in the violent psychosis of two intruders, the movie paints the picture in the stark tones of reality and not the highly stylized violence of film. The physical and psychological torture are seen only in the reactions of others as the sounds clue you in to what is happening. There was a mundanity that made the film hit home; long, lingering shots that lasted for minutes without any action or dialog brought you right into the heads of these unfortunate victims. People reacted as real people might react. There was no grand reversal in which the heroes suddenly turned the tables on their attackers, just desperate attempt after desperate attempt to survive, without much success. The violence was unpredictable and sudden and left you as shell-shocked as the protagonists. I think it would have worked better as a straight-forward telling of the story without the knowing comments on media violence and winks at the camera that came across as self-concious and distracted from the pure emotion of the film. I found my self in utter horror for most of the movie, largely due to the amazing performance of Susanne Lothar as Anna. As the mother of the family she was the center and soul of the film and brought you right into the terror she was experiencing. Though flawed, a harrowing film that has stuck with me.</fullReview>

This movie had so much potential and then it does nothing but let you down.If you want to watch a violent, disturbing "maniacs terrorize ordinary people" movie, there are so many I could list, House at the Edge of the Part, Last House on the Left, Desperate Hours, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>challenging, chilling, and effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**WARNING...SPOILERS IN THESE COMMENTS**i saw this film last night after spotting it while browsing through video rentals. i had no prior knowledge of this film nor of the writer/director, and rented it because of the reviews on the box and because it sounded like it would be a psychological thriller. after viewing it i immediately logged onto IMDb to read the comments of others.initially, the asides to the camera and the rewind scene were irritating and gimmicky. however, after reading the comments of others (most of which were negative), i have a greater appreciation of the film and watched it again.the story was chilling, the movie was beautifully shot, and the acting was unilaterally excellent. the antagonists always let us know that they are in control of everything, and invite the viewers to participate in a vicarious manner. the family is nice, white, and moneyed (people to whom things like this aren't "supposed" to happen), and the tormentors could pass for upstanding, white choir boys (who aren't "supposed" to be capable of acts like this), and the horror happens in a peaceful, idyllic environment (where things like this don't "ever" happen). i wonder if this is what upset so many people who have seen this film. all of the cliched, formulaic, hollywood "rules" are broken. the cavalry doesn't arrive to save the day, the cops don't arrive with guns drawn, the protagonists aren't able to turn the tables on their tormentors regardless of what they try. what the viewers are witness to (and participate in) is the gradual decent into despair that this family experiences, with no hope of salvation. this film challenges the anesthetizing of society towards violence as well as the vicarious thrill society receives from viewing violence -- but only if it's "make-believe" and the heroes "win" in the end. if it's too realistic and there is no neat "wrap it up with a nice bow" ending, people are shocked and outraged. the reality is that in real life there are no "rules". one only has to read about all of the accounts where people are killed and suffer through horrible experiences every day. they don't always survive. sobering? yes. "funny games" reminds us of this in a disturbing manner. i recommend this film to anyone who wants to think about the role of hollywood (and other)violence in our lives, and the expectations we have of such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, brutal, but excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers)Funny Games is one of the most disturbing films I have seen in recent times. Mainly because Michael Haneke's film is so relentless and brutal in it's message! The long takes of certain scenes were deliberately excruciating and emphasised the brutality of the situation!This a claustrophobic film that is very suspenseful, and even haunting. It leaves you thinking about how people like Anna and Georg make errors that literally changes their lives! It also makes you think about the hopelessness of the situation, and that you should never rely on 'hope'- seize the opportunity to escape! Those who have seen the film will know what I mean! In a way, Anna and Georg's failure to seize opportunities, continued Peter and Paul's vicious cycle!This film is excellent! A must-see for performances and direction if you can stomach it! Funny Games is disturbing, it makes you realise how unsafe your world really is- if you don't see the signs-if something feels unusual, it usually is! An exceptional film, even with it's cruel and violent subject matter- it certainly leaves it's mark! Funny Games is cold, unrelenting, edge-of-your-seat, brutal material that will really make you think long after it's finished! ****1/2 out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this flick. It had the usual 'what would you really do' type flaws, like when they stand around having deep conversations with the killers just outside the door, but this film has courage, and it works. It works the same way as most foreign films that are successful in the US work, by shocking us to the core by not following the same tired old formulas. "Ok, now he's going to... Oh, sh_t, where did that come from?". That's what I expect from a movie. I don't want to watch the same hollywood-big brother formulas over and over.The dialogue with the audience is shocking and effective, too... wish I had seen this one in a crowded theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting way of Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is alot about this film that I really enjoyed. The acting was great, and so was the screenplay. The two bad boys play mental games with this poor hostage family and sometimes it can be so disturbing and effective. But this film brought new insights into the art of filmmaking. Two methods I found very interesting: 1) There are a few scenes where nothing is happening and everything is silent. And this lasts for about 5 minutes. It might be shorter but it does start feeling pretty long. Just imagine a room, with a tipped over table lamp and one person lying on the floor, and one person kneeling on the ground. they are doing nothing but just staying there like that. It can be really effective on the audience. Very realistic and almost a break from all the mental and physical violence that we see early on in the film. But silence that long with no movement or dialogue is very unusual, but there actually is alot going on in that scene. I felt I was forced to put myself in their place and try to imagine what it was like. 2) The two bad boys now and then look back at the camera and ask the audience some questions or simply comment. That puts us into the picture but then it also makes us realise that this is a movie after all. But then it gets us confused and the line between violence on screen and violence in reality becomes very thin. Great film, very unique approach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly nasty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film late one night and was totally unprepared for what lay in store for me...This film is pure, unadulterated thrilling horror. I won't go into details about the plot since every other review here has and you've probably got the idea by now. In response to those who say it is 'hilarious' it's not, it's anything but, in response to those who go on about the directors message (which he hits home with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer....) i say it doesn't matter what the message is, as pure spine chilling, tense entertainment that glues you to the screen this film hits the spot.The actress who plays the mother is superb, scarily believable as are the performances of the two psychopaths (one of whom looks scarily like Gary Barlow). Several scenes in this film as so hard hitting even a seasoned horror fan like myself found myself thinking 'can i continue to watch this???' And there is the brilliant relief-then-fear again moments when you think things are going to be ok but believe me they're never going to be ok....(Spoilers)A few flaws are the annoying asides to the camera and the ridiculous rewind scene and possibly even the downbeat ending which no doubt contribute to the directors overall 'message' but are at odds with the plot. All in all i have never seen a film as shockingly nasty and unrelenting as this. Watch it if you dare!</fullReview>

I´m a really horror-freak and I´ve seen lots of splatter- and horror movies, but none of them was as shocking as this one. It´s because of the cramed atmosphere, you know what the visitors really want and it´s not eggs. When you see the movie, you want to go there and get help or protect the family. And because of the impossibility this movie is so hard to watch. I´ve never had such an experience in a movie as in this one. Rating 9/10 *********</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captured while watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most shocking aspects of this horrifying film, is that we as watchers are as captured as the family. Sometimes, Paul looks into the audience and talks to us. Also the scene in which he rewinds the film because Anna shot Peter makes clear that the two criminals are totally in control of everything and that they decide wether we leave the room or not.This was very clear to me when Anna could escape for a while; when the golf-ball rolled over the floor, we get the please-not- again, kill-them-both-so-that-we-can- get-away-feeling. Our nerves are teased that far that we almost ask to kill the hostiles. Very shocking was also the humiliating scene in which Georg had to say to his wife: 'Honey, undress yourself'.And then the final question: Why do Paul and Peter do this? We saw them killing a family, we saw the corpses of their antecedents and at the end we find ourselves in a similar position as at the beginning. Maybe the uselessness of the crimes make us feel so anxious about the film. We even get the impression that tomorrow it is our turn.Nevertheless, this film stands in my top 3, because it demonstrates how the medium 'film' can manipulate you and be almost as real as reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hilarious and brutally wicked morality tale of two young drifters who take an upper class family hostage in their own home. Brilliant direction gives this the spin Natural Born Killers aimed for and missed. That is the implication of the audience in media violence. Here the film doesn't pretend to be above and beyond it's own allegory, but it suprisingly does this while showing little on screen violence.The theoretical stuff aside, it's one hell of a suspenseful thriller. An excellent ensemble cast and uncomfortably perfect timing make the confrontations eerily believable. The husband and wife who are no experts at being victims, lead fairly bland lives. It's illustrated cleverly. At one point during their abduction and torture, the perpetrators leave. Free to escape or do what they will, they fumble about the house, blow drying the cell phone, bandaging wounds, taking their time before going for help, and basically sit around being as boring as hell.The hoodlums return for one last round, crushing all expectations of a bittersweet ending. Throughout the film, the main vandal turns to the camera and winks or invites us to share the joke with him. At one point, after the wife shoots one of them, he grabs a remote control and rewinds the scene, changing the outcome. Refusing to give us justification for the violence we've witnessed.Brilliant, fun, spellbinding, and an absolutely cute murderer. What more could you want?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can imagine the thoughts in Michael Haneke's head: "So, you like violence, do you? You laughed when the guy's head got blown off in 'Pulp Fiction'? You enjoy a good gunfight in a Western? You think Stallone destroying the Viet Cong is a great night out? Well, I'm going to show you what violence is REALLY like. And, what's more, it's exactly the kind of thing that could happen to you in your home."One of the most terrifying films ever made. Leaving aside the fact that the two young men are obvious psychopaths, this drama has incredible plausibility. Watching the film left me quite shaken. It's clear that Haneke has several motives in mind: showing the vividness and awfulness of real violence; challenging the smugness of the viewer, who believes he is not implicit because he is separated from the action by the screen; and defying movie cliches by immediately reversing any gains which the 'goodies' manage. That you want to get up at the end and shout "bastards!" at the screen is entirely the point.A courageous film, with good use of music, persuasive acting and a gut-gripping denouement. The kind of film that makes you want to go and become a policeman.9 out of 10. I knock off one point only because I wouldn't want to sit through it twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time through, this film is almost un-watchable. The casual sadism is akin to "Lord of the Flies" meets the random "ultraviolence" of Alex the Droog in "A Clockwork Orange." The two tormentors are distressingly real in their insight into and turning over of bourgeois manners and conceits. The pain and suffering are so palpable, the victims so passive, you can't help but think of the victims of Nazi genocide. Faced with nonsensical, unreachable, unteachable malice, the victims naturally fall into a stupor of numbness and despair. The madness is too much to comprehend. And when reason fails with one's captors, one goes limp, as if civilization itself has collapsed. All of this and more are raised by Haneke's work. An indictment of not only upper class complacency and mores, but of the German soul itself. The banality of evil indeed. Watch it. School shooters, suicide bombers, and lone wolf gun freaks of assorted persuasions all have nothing on Peter and Paul, the most honest and realistic evocation of the nihilism buried beneath the surface of post-modern life and entertainment.</fullReview>

It's amazing to me how upset some people can get because a scene happens in real time. Take a look at any classic movie pre-1970 and you will see a a very different style of movie making. Viewers are so so inundated with fast paced horror movies where people are getting their heads blown off or something pops out of the ether every minute or so that they can't give a movie a chance. There are no rules in movie making and that is the beauty of it. If I don't like a particular genre of movie I won't watch it must less make a lengthy negative comment or give a terrible review. Same thing with music. Of course you will hate a country song if you hate country music. There are plenty of movies out there for the masses so please give the rest of the viewers a chance to watch and film makers a chance to make movies for people that like something a little different.</fullReview>

It makes the viewers experience 'reality' of what is like to be captured by cold-blooded killers. This is not Hollywood. No hero saving you at the last minute. This is so real, so chilling. You can't expect how the plot will turn out at all. In some scenes, the camera holds still for a long time but, oh hell, it is so effective! I understand why they put the words 'See it if you dare'. For me, I really want to warn people who cannot take much disturbing movie to stay away from this one. This movie is well-made and original, BUT...it will leave you paranoid and scared for a long time. No,they don't use anything gruesome or any ugly pictures of corpse and blood, but they let you experience real crime,all of its terror, like you're sitting in it. It's an art, yes, but I'm not sure if it's good for everyone. If you're already paranoid about being captured by psycho killer or having bad people break through your house, then don't watch it. You'll suffer from it a long time. But for those who love horror films, well this is your treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Games is an allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this one of the most distasteful films I had ever seen. That is, until the next day, when it became clear to me that it was an allegory for the Holocaust. I won't go into all the parallels I drew, but I am sure many of you will see what I mean on re-viewing this film. The eggs, for instance, at the beginning I think represent the wealth of the Jews in pre-War Germany contrasted with the needs of those with less (the two visitors). The couple shared their eggs, but they wanted more and thus attributed their want to the owner's greed. Also, think how the Nazis used fear to turn family members against each other. The film opens with the rich couple in their luxury car playing games about recognizing music rather than really listening to it. Was the dog a German shepherd by design? When one of the victims could escape, she didn't. Their innocence after the eggs situation reflects the German Jews unwillingness to recognize the signs of the coming holocaust. One of the games was obviously a Nazi-style "Sophie's Choice" exercise in terror. I am adding to my review, though I haven't seen the film in years and know there are many other parallels which other viewers will fnd it they look for them. A very disturbing, but important, film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Not-So-Shocking, Yet Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FUNNY GAMES is another one of those films that I bought after hearing about the "shocking" and "controversial" content. I have to say, I didn't really find FUNNY GAMES very "shocking" or "controversial", but I did find it to be a very good film. The story centers around 2 psychotic hoodlum kids who hijack a family who are on vacation. They then mentally and physically abuse the family. The film is extremely well-acted, especially the 2 male leads. They are believable and extremely un-likable, which is exactly what I think the director was aiming for. The violence is mainly understated and off-screen, so those looking for a blood-bath may as well leave this one on the shelf. There is a scene where the family's son is killed (again off screen...) that a lot of people seem to take offense at. It is pretty tough to watch kids getting killed in film, but honestly, I had seen THE UNTOLD STORY (a classic Hong Kong nasty) and after seeing the child murder scene in that film (where several children around age 5 are brutally butchered ON camera...), everything else sorta pales in comparison. Even so, FUNNY GAMES is an intense and very well made thriller that may prove a little much for the standard movie-goer, also because the film ends on a decidedly grim (and cool) note. But anyone into more thought-provoking, subversive cinema should dig this one. Recommended 8.5/10</fullReview>

Two polite young men take a family hostage and begin to play mind games with them. They tease them like a cat teases a mouse he's about to kill. I actually began to feel a sense of guilt about "enjoying" a film so disturbing. You are, in essence, watching the apparent demise of a family and their dog...or are you? There is a scene where one of the interlopers searches desperately for a television remote control device so that he can turn back time. Is this to tell us, the viewer, that the ongoing is all fiction, which we know damn well it is. But then, if it is, why does the unreality of whats happening seem so real...or surreal? A fascinating and disturbing film where all but one instance of carnage happens off-screen. The director sets you up to think there are jumps just around the corner but the jumps never surprise you like that. The jumps are in plain sight at all times.</fullReview>

Its an indictment of violence in our everyday media and lives through perpetrating violence, almost with A Clockwork Orange appeal. The responses of the actors are realistic, the plot believable. In fact, one of the most shocking things is how easily the psychotic duo plays on the good natures of people and modern civility to wreak havoc.

		<fullReview>The previous comments by Mika from Finland are right on the mark, I don't see how anyone could describe this film better. I saw it a couple of years ago and the violence in it still haunts me. It's the kind of movie that once you see it you'll never forget it. It was extremely well done and kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone in their teens, no matter how many R rated movies they've watched, this film is not at all like the usual blood, gore and murder you see daily on TV. Despite being only a movie, the difference is nearly like the difference between seeing a movie death or car wreck and one in real life. It leaves you with the same sort of sense of horror that makes you feel drained and vulnerable. I'm glad it's only a movie. But like the other reviewer, I don't know who to recommend it to. I rented it and happened to watch it late at night then decided to return it before my husband could sit and watch it, not even wanting to subject a grown man to a movie like this. There's plenty of movies out there with sick and perverted violence, usually gory ones, but this movie is intelligent, understated and well made which makes the horror vastly more chilling. I'd give it a 10 and yet have no desire to EVER watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Mild spoilers* I did not really see this movie as being most importantly about violence in Hollywood film or whatever. That seems like a pretty trite theme compared to the idea that this film shows adults who are completely unprepared to defend themselves and save their own lives and perhaps the society that makes them that way (I extend to society becuase the sadists play their funny games with multiple families, though we see mainly one). It's ironic that these people are ostensibly fiscally powerful but can't protect their own lives against two attackers who are hardly supermen. Their small child has the greatest chance of escaping and saving himself. I mean, the woman could have asked her friends in the sailboat for help and maybe, just maybe, the four adults could have together beat up the skinny legged attacker posing as a family friend. That scene made it very ironic that the husband asks his wife to forgive him and she tells him she loves him. True, the husband is wimpy but all SHE had to do was suffer the indignity of saying to the boat people, "Help, save us from this pathetic little guy." How could their love mean anything if, after the attackers killed their dog, the husband and wife could not summon up the strength to fight back or seek help when it comes? Then, as further proof of the defenselessness of the two people, instead of running and seeking help, they hover over their deceased cell phone, trying to revive it. Peter and Paul gave them a long, agonizing slice of screen time to save themselves and they blow it.Maybe what Hanneke is really criticizing is the survival instinct that always seems to pop up in all sorts of different types of films (not just Hollywood) where the victims always cleverly find a way to wield an unexpected weapon or run and duck skillfully while escaping. Or adrenalin? It seems always to kick in in other movies but in Funny Games, it was sadly absent. The cruelest moment is when the wife finds the knife on the boat that the camera centered on tantalizingly in the beginning. The attackers notice and casually keep the situation from getting out of hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stop and question after watching this movie. Don't discard or idolize it for wrong reasons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thought that came into my mind after watching this movie was: "Am I a normal person? Do a normal, sane individual sits through this entire movie or will he/she just push stop or leave the theater?". After giving it some thought I really didn't know the answer. So I asked myself: "Did I like this movie or did I dislike this movie?" and I found out that I didn't know how to answer that either. I know that I felt bad after watching it and that was the movie's purpose so: should I hate a movie or a director because he/she/it told me an unpleasant story? or should I try to understand the real meaning of this and how it has affected me using what I learn on my benefit?Let's see, for someone that enjoys violence in movies and, I honestly and shamefully admit, sometimes in real life too, this movie kicked my face. People can complain that the objective of this can be achieved with simply showing something to feed the curiosity and sadistic part of people (like animal torturing and more in-your-face videos like mentioned in other post) which lack complete professionalism and merits other than spoiled minds wanting some over-stimulation. Well, I think very differently.I've seen many horrible and violent things that made me feel sick and really bad afterwards but I had never felt a sense of guilt combined with sickness as strong as I felt watching this. Why do I like this movie then? Because the director, actors and the ones involved into this production tried to give me, and everyone that dare to watch this until the end, a lesson, and they did it nicely and without restraints or apologies, like we all deserve it(and with outstanding performances which give you no choice but to take this seriously).Hollywood and the omnipotent, know-it-all media (mainly) have been playing some 'funny games' with all of us, tampering with our sense of reality and never having the decency to remind us that we don't live on a fairytale and that reality is harsh and ugly sometimes.I can choose to forget about this movie and mark it as simply another case of a sensationalist wacko trying to impress me, but I won't do that, mainly because of the strong influence television excerpts on today's society. I will, instead, keep remembering it and, hopefully, when I do that, I'll keep feeling bad and sick as the first time I saw it; as a reminder of what the media's excessive propagandistic influence is doing to our perception of things.I will keep enjoying violence on movies that is true but this movie will always keep yelling at me: "You know whos fault this is!? you can push stop whenever you like but you won't be able to rewind it." And I thank it for that, I'll be more careful from now on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise in film formula desconstruction *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Funny Games, two young men torture and kill a family of three while on vacation. I've seen this movie several times and it gets easier to watch each time. Not because one becomes desensitized, but because you understand more of what the film is trying to say. Now, I may be alone on this one, but here is my theory. The two "killers" are very aware, obviously, that they are in a film. Therefore, they understand what is going on isn't real (not that this makes their actions any less cruel.) The killers are, in fact, the audience members themselves. We can take our own remote control and stop the film at any time, but as Paul/Jerry says in one of his three camera addresses, we (the audience) want to see the end, as all audience members usually do. By continuing to watch the movie, we allow the family to die. Even after Paul/Jerry rewinds the film, after Tom/Peter is shot, showing us that there is no way the family can win, we still allow events to take their course. I like this film because it takes our natural expectations and turns them on their head. Nearly every movie "rule" I can think of is broken here. Apparently, there are other films like this and made before it, but being the first of its kind that I've seen, it will always stand out for not conforming to the formula I've become used to as an American movie goer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an interesting movie. With complete disregard to any of the cinematic rules of decency, Haneke makes everyone in the audience accessories to murder, and he does it with a smile and a wink. Completely unmotivated, the two gloved killers get a joy out of their chosen profession, killing simply because they can. Not only do they kill, however, but they make sure we know they're about to do it, and then go through with it. I can honestly say this film is one-of-a-kind. You will never see a film like this again, and if someone decides to remake this (or the idea) later on, it is not possible for the film to be as shocking. The basic premise is a happy family of three take a weekend trip to their lake house. Once there, the wife is approached by the neighbor's friends to borrow some eggs. The neighbor's friends turn out to be quite unfriendly, and the world as the family knows it quickly gets turned upside down and thrown in a blender. If you have a strong stomach for violence in movies (not the explosion kind, but the personal kind) give this one a shot, but if not stay away as you will undoubtedly hate this movie, or be sickened by it (or both). Rightfully so, ?Funny Games' did very well at the Film Festivals it was shown in, even winning a couple. Regardless of all the film school nonsense, however, this is simply a powerful film that deserves a chance to be seen. It will throw you for a loop, but in retrospect you'll be glad you saw it.

		<shortDescription>The viewers are to blame!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austrian director Michael Haneke came up with the idea of making this film after his trilogy about alienation (Der Siebente Kontinent, Benny's Video and 71 Fragmente...). It is a self-reflexive film about violence in the media, and it clearly points to its own factitiousness on several occations, which makes it really difficult to accept that people do not like the film, or that they were frightened by it. This is not a frightening film, but it is frightening that people are frightened by it. You must be stupid to be scared during "Funny Games", I believe people are more likely to be repulsed than scared. Repulsed by themselves because they are to blame for the violence in this film. Haneke pulls out a number of Bertolt Brecht- inspired asides to the camera that makes this film a reflexive masterpiece, a film that offers its viewers a clear argumentation of why film violence is not consumable, why it never can or should be entertaining to watch violence. "Funny Games" is almost anti-film, it is obviously not a classic film, and it is closer to the work of Jean-Luc Godard than any violence-obsessed Hollywood director. "Funny Games'" false mask is removed several times when the sadistic, violent young man Paul (or Beavis or even Jerry) stops the film time and steps into a conversation with the audience. "Is it enough? Really? Don't you want a plausible development?" he says coolly and disturbingly to the audience, who by now should know this is an experiment and not a thriller. The violence in this film, in contrast to American genre films such as thrillers, action films and horror films, is invisible. The consequences of the violence, though, are visible and feels painstakingly real. This is not an exciting film either, because Haneke either leaves out or totally turns around all the "rules" of a horror film. The message in this film is what I believe viewers who do not like it reacts strongly to. The film clearly is an attempt to make the audience expose themselves and their wish to see people killed on film. Its meaning is that the audience understands their role as the initiators of the killings and violence, and that they never want to see violence on film again. The violence in the media gives us a wrong impression of what violence is, because violence is real and it should not feel good to see fictional violence. It should hurt, and because it's your fault that it happens, it should hurt to watch it, too. The French director Gaspar Noé seems to have understood this when making "Irréversible", which is the best film about violence since "Funny Games". With this film, Michael Haneke wanted his audience to never indulge in visual, violent pleasures again. Unfortunately, it left many people so cold they never want to see a film by Haneke again. That is a shame: He is a director with a conscience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie that people love to hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film, I can no longer bear to watch the stylishly violent Hollywood pulps: they do not only seem pointless, but simply obscene! In the strong light of reality offered by Haneke, the Hollywood "perspective" on violence becomes not only boring, but downright immoral.This is what violence really is: unpredictable, extreme, sordid, pointless, and tragically relevant. It is interesting to note that the film is hardly gory---more attention is given to violence's physical and psychological aftermath on the victims, which are sadly given little notice by Hollywood. As we can see from previous comments, the victims' powerlessness inspires violence in some, and anger (towards the director) in others. Haneke refuses to give the audience any relief---no cavalry charging against the bad guys, nor payoff for the good. That's why he's so hated by so many. But I hope that some can still see his uncompromising honesty. Haneke is the greatest realistic moralist now working in world cinema. I have the feeling of having my hair relentlessly pulled back when the violence gets too much to watch. Who ever says that violence is just???I feel that after this experience, I can no longer talk about violence with the glibness that so many others still try so hard to hang on to.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIchael Haneke has made an interesting film here. Likeseemingly all artists (or any genre or type) Haneke wants to pointout something wrong with this world. But, and this speaks directlyto my problem with either him, his ideas, and/or his film, he findsno hope and his writings, if this movie be witness to both hisfeelings and those writings, don't give any hints as to what wouldchange things. To me, if one be critic, one must also become forma suggested solution. I have nothing to say about the quality of thistitle, as I think everyone should decide on their own about that. Myonly hope is that the pessimism that I feel pervades this movieand, again, if this be witness, Haneke's thoughts does NOTbecome epidemic.To say that not only have criminals become polite next-door- neighbors, but also that human decency can lead only to deathand human horror is to suggest that that death or that thishopelessness is, to me, the only way to exist. Let no one near you.Keep the world at bay. Rather, I think it's better to say that, with some caution and theability to reason and keep one's head about us, we canaccomplish so much.Andrew Johnson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, nihilistic, and unrelenting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About a year ago, I ordered this film from a movie store. I had heard about it from the magazine Fangoria a few years back, and wanted to see it ever since. I was highly anticipating its arrival a year back, and when I finally got my hands on it, I was in for the ride! This is one of the most disturbing, chilling, and creepy films I have seen in the past 20 years at least. I mean what other movie has the balls to torture an innocent little boy? I can think of none at the moment. There have been other films like this in the 70's, and a few in the late 80's-early 90's and on including 1990's "Desperate Hours," 1991's "Cape Fear," "Natural Born Killers," "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer," "Kalifornia," "If I Die Before I Wake," and the recent "House of 1000 Corpses," which I hope takes horror movies to a higher level!But back to "Funny Games." The "games" in this movie, are not funny. Not one whole minute of this movie is funny. It is unsettling, intense, and ironic at parts. The plot is simple. A family of three (four, counting the dog) are taking a vacation at a serene looking spot near a lake. But even during the opening credits, we well know that the tone of the film, is anything but serene as John Zorn's crazy death metal blares at you all of a sudden in a creepy frenzy of buzzing guitars, high-pitched screams, and incoherent lyrics that assaults your senses! Not even ten minutes into the film, the family meets two strangers who claim to be friends of the neighbors, in which they apparently force their way into their home and force them to play their fiendish "games."The cast in this film is terrific! Our leads Susann Lothar and Ulrich Muhe are compelling in their roles of the mother and father forced to endure mental and physical torture from their captors. The Stefan Clapczynski who plays the little boy is effective as an innocent who is helpless to defend himself or his family. Arno Frisch is ruthless and brilliant in his role of the sadistic leader of the two, Paul (or Jerry, or Butt-head). Frank Giering is creepy in his role of Paul's sidekick Peter (or Fatty, Fatso, Tom, or Beavis). To add to the creepiness of the film, the leader Paul, occasionally shifts his glance to the camera, and either winks at it, or makes us, as an audience, participate in the film saying quotes like, "You're on their side, aren't you?" This approach disturbed me and actually made me think that I had no power to stop these sickos! Very few movies have that effect on me nowadays.The directing is top-notch. I found it interesting that in the most violent scenes of the movie, the camera went somewhere else, or shifted to the person doing the violence, rather than actually showing the bloodshed. So all you gorefans out there won't be impressed with the little to no gore in this film. I love gore as much as the next person, but I didn't mind the limited blood. It was the content of the film that impressed me. This isn't "Natural Born Killers," folks, but it's still an amazing film.So, in final summation, any horror fans want a movie to get under your skin and stay there a few hours after you watch it? Then see this film!! It's a masterpiece of modern horror. It's basically "Last House on the Left" meets "Desperate Hours," meets "Cape Fear." Out of Five Stars: Five stars!! This film is not for everyone, but see it anyway for its sheer thrills and raw intensity!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even those who haven't seen the film will have associated it with the word "violence". I had read many reviews on this movie and all of them were overflowed with this word, not unreasonably. Don't expect bloody scenes (there is one or two but not exaggerated), or wild fighting but a kind of oppressive psychological violence. The whole concept is like a nightmare: you don't know when exactly the nightmare begins but suddenly you are inside it and you don't know what (worse for sure) to expect. This is exactly where the plot is based upon. A latent fear, at first for the bad thing to happen and then for the worst.I've seen it 3 times, each time feeling the same stress as the first time. In my opinion a must see. 9/10 SPOILER ALERT - MAYBE: As for the so much debated "remote control scene",for me it was like an interval to the extreme pressure I felt as the plot moved on.</fullReview>

The perfidy of all this is, that the whole scenario plays in down to earth real world, a beautiful lakeside estate somewhere in Austria and death comes by the hands of totally ordinary young men.What the audience hopes for is, that there has has to be an escape - in the end you most definitively know: There is none.</fullReview>

Two teenagers break into a house, torture the family, disturb the audience; It is an easy recipe.There are some intelligent and well-done scenes in the film. Some scenes are unnecessarily too long, total silence and nothing happens for minutes; it is annoying. A situation which can be told in 30 seconds is told in about 5 minutes. This film shouldn't be 108 minutes.As a result, Funny Games is an independent anti-hero film which kind of makes fun of hunt-becomes-hunter movies of Hollywood. But still it doesn't bring anything new or original to the genre except the remote-control scene which is quite stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does this film only play well in Europe? I can't see why anyone else would be "shocked" by this. Other reviews here will give enough insight regarding Funny Games' "comment on the violence in cinema," (although I WILL say that the comment is not particularly original and the vehicle, the film itself, isn't very interesting) but for American audiences, or potential audiences, I would advise you to take the "See it if you dare!" advertising with a grain of salt. Simply put, this is almost like a PG-rated version of Last House On The Left. Very little actual violence and wholly NON-threatening "villians." When was the last time you saw two young men kidnap a family and take over their home armed with little more than impolite behavior? This family is apparently made up of robots, people who are so easily manipulated that they actually deserve to die. The more assertive villian weighs approximately 120 pounds and the meeker one looks like one of the guys from Men At Work. So the reviews on the box that compare them to Hannibal Lecter or Max Cady are laughable. You will find yourself wondering why someone (the father, the mother, hell even the 10-YEAR-OLD) doesn't just leap up and beat either one of them during the many opportunities they have to do so.Be forewarned; nothing really happens here. There is practically NO suspense, there is no gore (if that's what you're looking for), and there is no one to root for. There is, upon watching Funny Games, only the desire to have the girly-men villians enter your OWN home, so you can snap their necks and get on with your life. The Germans need to get back to making movies like Nekromantic or Schramm if they're trying to shock anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engrossing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, entertainment value is of prime importance and the deciding factor in assessing a film.. This film really has it.Held hostage in their own holiday house, Georg and Anna with their son Georg Jnr are terrorised and humiliated at the hands of a couple of neighbouring vindictive brats who like to play games with their innocent victims. May be this is not a new scenario but it's well done. Starting with an argument over some eggs, the tension quickly mounts between the family and the intruders. A golf iron suddenly becomes a lethal weapon, the husband is immobolised and the family's german shepherd is killed. A series of games then takes over as a form of entertainment for the grinning terrorists. First of all the "hot and cold" search game, then a game of check the "flab" on the wife as she is forced to strip off her clothes. This is just the beginning of more terror and more humiliation as the family realises that they are completely isolated from any outside help.This film treats violence in a different way - the director has seen to that. We never see the actual impact of a fist or boot or bullet or the smashing blow of a golf club or the bashing of a fractured leg or for that matter we never see the naked body of the wife. The director takes control of our minds and manipulates us cleverly so that the tears and the pain are horrifyingly real to us. It is also a great credit to the actors in this cat and mouse game that they are able to maintain the atmosphere of terror over such a long period.I suspect that this film is based on a stage play for it is virtually played on a single set with a few outdoor scenes added. The use of the "off stage" technique for the violence is rather unique these days when audiences are fed the intimate details to the last drop of blood. The human mind however is quite capable and is indeed expert at filling in the gaps with moments of violence beyond our wildest dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Anna, Georg and their son are going on holidays. They will be spending a few weeks in a beautiful house near a beautiful lake. Not long after arriving at their destination a young man knocks at the door. He asks Anna if she can spare four eggs, a request he is fulfilling for friends of Anna and Georg's. After Anna gives the young man the eggs he leaves the house, dropping them on the way. Anna then gives him four more eggs, this time wrapping them up in paper, and he leaves. Then a different young man, more older, is at the door with the young man Anna gave the eggs to. It seems as if Anna and Georg's dog has jumped on the young man, breaking the eggs. And now they would like four more. Then things start to go bad... Taking the family hostage, the two young men begin a series of games, 'funny games' if you will. Although there is nothing funny about the games they play. I enjoyed "Funny Games" quite a lot. There were many moments where I was on the edge of my seat, although I feel the movie is not trying to be an everyday thriller. It is trying to convey a message about violence in movies, and I feel it worked somewhat well.*** SPOILER ALERT *** A lot of people are shocked by the violence in the film. But why? It's only a movie, right? Maybe that was what the director was trying to say. A few times Paul (the older young man) interacts with the audience, he winks at us, looks at us and talks to us. And then there is the "remote control" scene. It was always a movie but the movie is telling us it is a movie we are watching. They are actors, it is scripted, it is all fake. Paul even makes a joke about the length of feature films. Yet people get upset when faced with the violence in the film. But wait a second! There is hardly any on-screen violence at all. Maybe what the film's message is that it hardly shows any of the actual violence, but we know it's going on, and our imagination takes over. We imagine the horror. But a lot of people have never experienced anything like what is in the film. Well not in real life... but in the movies is a different story. *** END OF SPOILER ***I liked the credit sequence at the start. I wonder whether it was intentional or not to have the credits fit almost perfectly around the families faces. Whether or not a message about violence in movie's is understood by the viewer won't ruin the film if the viewer is expecting 'just' a thriller. And although the family don't have much depth to them I still found myself caring for their outcome, or at least being disturbed by the idea what if I was in their place. Towards the end there are some dull bits that drag on too long, but on the whole I really enjoyed this film. A lot of people will be confronted by the violence, but if you feel you are up to it I highly recommend it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy stories about youth that are foreign to me, so it is no surprise that the Austrian film "Funny Games" is just such a film. Michael Haneke is an amazing film director, and uses music very effectively, and the viewer is treated to the beautiful sounds of John Zorn's Naked City. The film is essentially about a weathly family spending time in their summer home. The classic Husband, Wife and child. We watch the family peacefully settle in for a long summer stay, but then we meet two very clean cut twentysomething college students. They are dressed in rather impressive summer wear, and have a very strange way about them. Director Michael Haneke throws a lot of surprises at the viewer, and that is ultimately what makes the film work so well. It is also in good taste to leave certain things to the viewer's imagination, so that your own thoughts about certain events that take place in the film are far superior than seeing it all spelled out for you on screen. The director takes on the topic of violence in the media and simply has good cynical fun with it. In fact, this film is almost a Science Fiction epic in a way. A horror film if there ever was one, watch "Funny Games!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was subjected to this slow moving movie via my partner's pick. I find it very hard to believe that a wealthy couple would be that stupid to let a stranger into their home just by mentioning a name and a request for eggs. I also find it very unbelievable that the husband would not respect his wife's wishes and not just toss the stranger out with force. To be wealthy enough to afford a home in say Martha's Vineyard type home;you would have to be quick on your feet, hard as nails and a ball-buster to boot. I speak from experience. The only 2 reasons this could happen in my mind is they inherited their money so they don't know anything about what it takes to make that kind of money or the writer hates rich people. That's my story and I'm stickin to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two seemingly well-educated young men, who call each other Paul and Peter among other names, approach a family on vacation. They are, apparently, friends of the neighbors, and, at the beginning, their true intentions are not known. But soon, the family is imprisoned and tortured in its own house violently, which the viewers are forced mostly to imagine and to share a certain complicity with the criminals. It might be some kind of game with the lives of husband, wife, son, and dog, but why are they doing it?I'm perfectly fine with a movie where the goodies is against the baddies. I'm perfectly fine that the film breaks a fourth wall. I'm perfectly fine that the baddies have no motivation to play "games" with the goodies. I'm not perfectly fine that the film is trying to be unfair.Throughout the film, the baddies have the upper hand. You must know that before watching the movie. It's like the director wants the baddies to win. Okay, the movie starts off well. It gets your attention. The second act comes and you're completely surrounded by suspense!Then...when it reaches about an hour and twenty minutes, the film goes downhill. You see the point in the film: The audience will not get what they want. This is not your average goodies vs. baddies film. I've told you the baddies have the upper hand. It's just that the film is not fair that makes the film go downhill.The fact some horror movies are and are not good is not because the baddies win or the goodies win. It's how the movie is shown. In almost every baddie vs. goodie, no matter who wins, they both have a fair chance to win; like 1 vs. 1. This film presents a new plot point: 1 vs. 1000. 1 being the goodie and 1000 being the baddies. I may be exaggerating but you get my point. I would rather have the movie have clichés than making the movie unfair.With great performances, good satire laughs, and a disappointing last thirty minutes, the movie is bad. There's no point to the film at all. The audience gets no rewards at the end. From that moment the credits roll, you'll be thinking, "Is this a joke?" A cop out, you may say OR just completely unfair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give the director credit, because I can understand how he was trying to bring the audience into the movie, which is something that is rarely attempted. However, it did not work. The director should have concentrated more on the film than the audience. There were some extremely long cuts that were completely pointless. I would not be surprised to see this same incredibly well done story remade into an American version some day down the road. We can only hope that when it happens that horror in it doesn't become "Americanized" to make people jump, but live a long lasting psychological horror that is hard to come by this day in age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to disagree with the comment posted complaining about this film. I thought this film was deeply disturbing and it actually is the kind of thing that could happen to any one of us at any time. If you watched the whole movie then you would see that the impact of violence was extremely strong after they left the house for the first time. Screen shot of the room with the family left torn apart and it stayed as a still image for a few minutes, giving you the time to take in what had happened and I think the mother and father left alive and their son dead is a good example of victims.... After all, people do say that to lose a child is the worst thing ever and thats exactly what happened here except they give you a long time to think about it before moving onto the next part of the movie.Before people make wild assumptions about movies I think it is better to watch the whole movie first and make up your mind before mouthing off your opinion, this film gets 10/10 from me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The whole movie is a TEST on the viewer. ***SPOILERS****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! Most people would agree that this movie was completely bleak, ugly, violent, depressing, and scary. This is my theory on the movie: I think the point of it was not to show us something about the characters or the plot but about ourselves, the audience.Paul, the sadistic psycho, addresses the viewer at several points in the movie. The first being when he is playing the "hot-and-cold" game with Anna as she is looking for the dead dog. He winks directly in the camera, almost to say as if, "Hey you're watching this movie, you're in on this senseless violence".Then later on he says to the camera "What do you think? Do you think they have a chance of winning? You are on their side aren't you?" which is another challenge to the audience. Of course we are on the families side (or are we?), who all seem like basically good people...yet we continue to watch them humiliated and degraded in such an inhumane way. Why? Maybe because we think they will escape and the bad guys will end up losing? That seems fair.The next challenge comes when Anna refuses to play the game, and Paul says "Huh, that's cowardly! We're not up to feature film length yet." He looks directly in the camera and say, "Is that enough? But you want a real ending, with plausible plot developments, don't you?" Here I think he is chiding the viewer...why are we still watching is pretty much what he asks? These parents just saw their child murdered and have been put through hell - aren't we disgusted with this movie enough to turn it off. He basically gives us a pass though by saying perhaps we'll have a 'real ending', a relatively happy ending and that's why we continue to watch.Well, that is all shot to hell when Anna grabs the gun and shoots Peter. Finally, one of the bad guy got his, will the other? The family might be saved after all! But no, Paul rewinds the movie to before Anna shoots Peter and he stops it from happening. After all Paul is in charge of the game on the viewer, he wants to see how much we can take..and now we KNOW there will not be a happy ending because Paul is in charge of the movie, and Paul, as we know, is a SICK FREAK! Yet we continue to watch, to see what we know will happen, and it does. Anna is killed, dumped off a boat while she's tied up. There's no way Anna can be saved because she is not in control of the game...Paul is.The last interaction Paul has with the camera is at the very end when he goes to the neighbor's house to borrow eggs and we the viewer knows it's happening all over again, and another family is going to be butchered. The very last shot is a chilling look Paul gives the camera, which to me said, "Gotcha, you watched to the very end." and he has a small smile on his face.So I think the whole movie was actually a game on the viewer, to see how much he/she can take, how much ugliness and violence and hopelessness we can muster before turning the movie off. Those that make it to the end have to ask, "Why did we continue to watch?" Especially once we know Paul controls the movie, the "game", and that it will only be more violence. Do we get some sort of pleasure from this "sadistic voyeurism"? And if so, are we that much different than Paul and Peter? That is what I think...the movie's purpose is basically to make us question ourselves and our own basic humanity. On that level I think it very much succeeds. Scary and brilliant. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise in rampant egoism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS (i.e. "TIME SAVERS")AHEAD Having just viewed "Funny Games" twenty four hours ago and properly digested it, the single most glaring aspect of the overall experience strikes me as simply the rampant egoism of director Hanake. The film itself is not poorly made. It is in fact brilliant at times. And yes, as previously mentioned by others there are elements lifted partially or outright from other and mostly better films. "Last House On The Left" (itself an adaptation of "The Virgin Spring") immediately springs to mind. The unrelenting ending is reminiscent of the original "The Vanishing". But for better or worse, the first thing I thought of when I saw our young antagonist speak to us, the audience, was "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".Admittedly, his use of the technique does beg one to look inward and ask oneself why they thought this would be an enjoyable experience. So there it is on the table, one possible element of Hanake's agenda with this work: to reflect back at us our own love of pop-culture violence. The statement, unless I miss my guess is that we should abhor violence, not celebrate it by watching it. Hanake has begun a meaningful dialogue here on the database, but I doubt that was his intent either. I could point out that he wants his film to change the way we see violence in the media. I could ask the obvious question: what qualifies this guy to tell us what we should or should not find to be appropriate viewing? Instead, I'll delve into even more cynical territory. It doesn't matter to Hanake whether or not we're changed, or what we think period. The reason for this film to exist it would seem, is to put Hanake on the map as a filmmaker. Now don't get me wrong, filmmakers have as much right as anyone to make a comfortable living doing what they like doing. No doubt Hanake could and will make some fine contributions to the film world in years to come. But if ever a particular work was calculated to make somebody a "star", it is "Funny Games". The shock seems to be there for that purpose alone, and that -not anything to do with its content- is what makes this film an abomination. It is no better than the mindless Hollywood pablum it wants to criticize. It's manipulativeness is like a cry for attention, that changes nothing. Hanake may have thought Hollywood would come knocking, as they did for Sluizer with his "Vanishing" remake, but thus far they have not. What we have left is an unfulfilling experience for everyone involved. So the violence is displayed offscreen. This is more likely owing to a lack of decent effects budget than any significant decision on the part of anyone on the production end. The shotgun blast surely sapped most of the films FX funds. An extended shot of a blood-spattered TV screen? Okay, Mikey, thanks for pointing out to us that TV is violent. Our villain rewinds away the death of his partner? How avant garde! The festival critics are surely in ecstasy. And finally, somebody answer me this: how are we supposed to accept that an overweight simpleton and a mere beanpole of a teenager could possibly exert this much physical dominance over our hapless victims? The juxtaposition is nice; I certainly don't expect to see muscle-bound "Death Wish" type punks swaggering into the Austrian countryside, but the plausibility factor is at its lowest with this aspect. I learned more from Ferris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An annoying yawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One have to admit: The plot of "Funny Games" is rather intriguing. Two teenagers take a family hostages and tortures them most delicately. Interesting and strange idea - and does it work?This film has a lot of buzz going around for it. It is 'art', 'shocking' and 'provocative'. But in fact - it is none of these. The shock is never there as the production company clearly haven't had the money to show us the actual physical torture. Instead we hear the noises and see the poor victims afterwards. And it never really surprises us as the eleged evil spirit of the youngsters clearly is being established at the beginning of the film. As for the physical tortures the structure of the family is so badly drawn that it doesn't show us anything but a marriage that never worked in the first place as it never consisted of real people. And that actually does make the tormenting rather tedious.The provocative elements are almost laughable. Of course we have to be terrified with these actions taken by regular young boys, but it never works. And it's even quite embarrasing as Michael Haneke tries to add a patina of existentialistic questions to this absolute nonsense. It is extremely annoying and clearly shows the director's intentions with this film - some intentions that never are fullfilled as the director himself is so focused on the so called 'schocking' elements.To be provocative and thoughtful you need to produce something unexpected and peel it slowly while asking the questions that the audience can relate to. "Funny Games" fails to do either. It is an annoying yawn - a film you only can't miss if you want to play artsy with your friends at the chess club.2/10 ( - and only for the plot. Even the actors are bad).</fullReview>

This provocative psychodrama has the "feel" of typical Euro-hyper-reality films. Cut to an almost real-time piece, the film lags at times and bolts at others and is so unpredictable as to keep the audience guessing. As for whether or not its unpleasant story is gratuitous violence pandering to the worst in us or a parody of the same, no one knows. Perhaps those who speculate are simply perpetuating the game.</fullReview>

Yes, boring, not because once it's clear, it's just a brutal movie. So what? It lacks the twist to make it interesting and unique. Some of the scenes go on waaaay too long.

		<shortDescription>It's 'funny' alright....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny Games is a film that has tried to be a bit too clever for it's own good, but somehow got away it and is still a very good movie. Exactly what the director wanted to achieve with this film is unknown, as there isn't a defining point to the movie; but a 'point' doesn't seem to be important anyway, as this film is all about style. The plot is simple and it follows a family that goes to stay in their vacation cabin. However, one thing they don't count on during their holiday is two psycho's interrupting their fun and imprisoning them in their own home. This sort of film leaves a lot open for inventiveness, and this movie has that. Some of the techniques used are really great and although they don't appear to have much point - like one of the bad guys winking at the screen, for example - it does give the film a nice edge, that separates it from other films in it's class and also shows that director Michael Haneke has something about him, as he isn't happy to just wallow in the clichés of this sort of film.While I do like this film a lot as it's a great ride and one that I very much enjoyed, it has to be said that the film could have been a lot better. The idea of two random people coming along and completely empowering a family their own home is shocking, and the way that the film is very self-aware in that is a movie is good, but if it had added a social commentary that isn't impossible to see, and gave the audience a bit more on the idea of the family home being 'invaded'; it could have been in masterpiece territory. Earlier in the review I said that the film doesn't have a 'point', which seems to be the case; but it does know what it wants to do, and that is shock the viewer. The fact that it has a very defined element of realism helps the film in this bid, and some of the events in the movie really are shocking. The film appears to want to analyse the relationship between the audience and a movie, and it does this by way of having the lead characters ask the audience questions (like "You are on their side, aren't you?"), and this does somewhat work...just not all that well.Basically, Funny Games is a thriller that overstepped it's mark. It has tried to be too clever, and the result is a film that is messy and doesn't really know what it wants to be. However, if viewed as a straight shock-thriller; it will be enjoyed. That is how I recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Benny's games to funny games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The same actor plays Paul in "funny games" and Benny in "Benny's video" ,one of Haneke's previous works.There are some clues in this film:¨Paul directly speaks to the audience at several times (is es genug?)and the remote control sequence will leave you on the edge of your seat.Actually,Paul and his sidekick act as if they are in a play,and they are anyway.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOIERS SPOILERS"Funny games" is Haneke's most accessible work ,far more conventional ,so to speak ,than former works such as "der Siebente Kontinent" "71 FRagments" or "Benny's video".That does not mean it's for everyone:with its absolute darkness,its cold violence,its God-forsaken world (the prayer sequence is telling:is the female character really playing? or does she believe she may get some help from above?)The things ,even if they are now outshadowed by the human beings (whereas ,in "der Siebente Kontinent" ,they were in the foreground),are more important than in other directors works :the eggs ;the gloves the two boys are wearing:why didn't it alarm the naive Hausfrau;and the use of the golf ball can rival with the best of Lang or Hitchcock.Haneke never wanted his audience to be peeping toms :so we never see the forced strip-tease of the heroine (which will remind you of that of Julie London in Anthony Mann's "man of the West,1958);we never see the murders,except the last one during which the dialogue turns so trite it plays everything down.Haneke suggests more than he shows ,like the great directors Hitchcock,Lang,or Polanski.His sense of ellipsis is incredible and gives goose pimples:we do not attend the kid's murder,we're in the kitchen with one of the intruders:just one harrowing scream ,then silence.A fixed shot which lasts several agonizing minutes displays a dark living-room.We know something unspeakable happened.And however ,when they try to regain consciousness,they never speak of the tragedy which happened.And what a tragedy!The loss of a child ,is there anything worse?Are these parents like those of "Benny's video" trying to pick up selfishly the pieces ?Or else,as we wish they could,probably they cannot get it through their heads ,they do not realize what happened to them.Not a word for this unfortunate victim,all they want to do is to escape ,to save their dear lives.This might seem monstrous to some !The killers have some kind of logic which will make your hair stand on end.The hostage-taking of a whole family is not new in the cinema .But Haneke's approach is completely new because the torturers look like the guys next door,because their murders have no purpose no sense :neither money,nor bourgeoisie contemps (as in Claude Chabrol's "la cérémonie" which Haneke's masterwork considerably dwarfs) can explain the two lads' motivation.And in the French director's thriller ,Sandrine Bonnaire's and Isabelle Huppert's crimes were not premeditated.One may regret the tricky end which lacks originality and was used a thousand times or more.But it's only a detail.Haneke's movies are crying to be seen.</fullReview>

The film is extremely confronting in every way (occasionally the leading psychopath will turn to the camera and ask various questions to the viewer), and made more disturbing because most of the violence is heavily implied.

I constantly wanted to scream, "For GOD, sake do something!" I found this to be the hardest thing to bear in the whole viewing experience. As a side note: There is absolutely no reason for the remake of this film besides the American bias toward subtitles.Nor does it make the violence an more unsettling by transplanting it to Amedrican actors. In any language this film is horrifying, disturbing, and unsettling. But, as I said before, would'nt you eventually go all "Charlie Bronson" on these guys? Just me, I guess.</fullReview>

The film is not rated but it is equivalent to an R rating. The film is shocking and I think that an American version of this film needs to be made. The biggest problem with the movie is it recognizes itself as a film by interacting with the audience. However "cute" that may be it does bring the viewer to remember that constantly so in my opinion it is not quite as effective versus non interaction. But the interactive ploy of the film at the same time may be what makes this movie so interesting. It plays mind games on the audience as well as the "victims". GREAT FILM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually describe the plot when I post my comments but with this film I just want to get this over with and think of the next movie I will watch. I understand that the director hates Hollywood films and this is his way of showing that violence has no satisfactory ending to it and a lot of times the good guys don't win. I also understand that this is a film from the perspective of the main psycho who can rewind certain events with a remote control. But I still found this to be arguably the most unpleasant viewing experience of my life. I hate probably most Hollywood films and I am constantly watching foreign and independent films so I'm no shallow prude! As I watched this it dawned on me that the style of this film is that it has no style. Its more of an exercise in being anti Hollywood. Like when the weak and pathetic son managed to get away and couldn't get through the fence! Where are they? Fort Knox? And he didn't just run and get help but he goes into the first house and doesn't even make a decent effort to hide. Films from this part of the world would have been different. The director makes his point but we still have to endure the torturous events to this family. My complaint is that he could have made his point in a more timely manor without making the viewer so aggravated. But I guess the director made his point the way he wanted. Some have called this film compelling but I found it redundant to the point of feeling like my senses were assaulted. It does offer a view point of violence and the way Hollywood caters to the more shallow minded but I still feel that this could have been made differently. Yes, the director made a film exactly the way he wanted and he did make his point well. Which is why I didn't like it!</fullReview>

The story is not even logical, in critical situations the amount of bad luck shown is absurd. If you have seen this movie and liked it you should get some serious psychiatric help. Don't see it. It leaves you with a spoiled day, angry and annoyed. After seeing it I microwaved the DVD, in an attempt to make this world a better place. I advise you to do the same, preferably before seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick film masquerading as high art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FUNNY GAMES is an exploitation film of the worst kind. It pretends to be some sort of statement about screen violence and simply revels in this violence (albeit mostly off-screen). There are no redeeming points in it, except for its technical competence. Imagine the first half of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE stretched out to a hundred minutes minus Kubrick's black comic touch.What is exactly the filmmaker's point? I can't understand some highbrow critics who made it a "cause celebre" and gave this film such big publicity. I guess, the film brings once more the issue of responsibility of a filmmaker and a film critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why oh why did I watch this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly don't truly know how to review this movie. I suppose I might begin by saying this is the worst movie i've ever seen. "Funny Games" was successful at evoking some real emotions from me during the course of my viewing; however, at the end I had one question: what is the point? A friend tried to explain that it is a social commentary on violence, in film, media, and reality. Personally, i feel that any true message in this film is lost in its pretentious, self-indulgent, and utterly boring presentation. If Michael Haneke was completely concerned with getting that message across, there are other, more effective ways of doing that. Specifically, i have several problems with "Funny Games"*SPOILERS*1.The entire movie is disturbing and outright unnecessary. I ask again, what is the point?2.While this is nitpicking, i have to ask the question: Do the antagonists ever sleep? The ending indicates they repeat their actions over and over again.3.If you thought "Requiem for a Dream" was a buildup to nothing, in terms of the ending, this movie follows in the same vein. It evokes an emotional buildup in its audience while lacking a catharsis.4.Scenes in the middle of the film, after the protagonists leave the house, are boring, pretentious, and make the film seem much, much longer than it actually is. I am speaking of the part in which the camera remains on the husband and wife without cutting away, showing essentially no plot development (which was really lacking anyway) for what seemed like fifteen (maybe more) minutes. If you're in film school, you might enjoy this stuff, but for normal people it is just plain booooooring.5.Finally, the whole movie has a tone similar to the torture scene in "Reservoir Dogs." Now, I love Tarentino's work, but that scene really turned me off to that movie, for similar a similar reason as my hatred for "Funny Games," namely, pointless disturbing violence. I have no problem with use of violence in cinema, as long as it makes a clear and valid point. "Funny Games" ultimately fails to accomplish this.*END OF SPOILERS*Ultimately, I hated this movie. If you want to see a movie that mocks the media's glorification of violence, go watch "Natural Born Killers." If you want a movie where violence is utilized for dark and/or comedic effect, watch "Pulp Fiction." I give this a 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God. I don't know what to say. I have heard so many great things about this film, that my expectations were pretty high. It has such a simple, intense plot that could have been SOOO much better. As many people have mentioned, there was really no point whatsoever to this movie. We are basically subjected to two hours of a family being brutalized. Oh, but that is not the problem-there have been many films with this very plot that have pulled it off extremely well. Wes Craven's Last House on the Left comes to mind. The problem with this film is the ridiculous attempt for the filmmaker to make us, the audience, try to be part of the film. He does this by having the villains look at the camera and ask stupid questions about what we think should happen and occasionally pausing the picture for long (and I do mean LONG) periods of time after something horrible happens. I honestly thought my DVD player was messed up! The problem with this comes in the fact that this is suppose to be a disturbing movie (and in many respects it is), but at the points in the film when we, the viewer, are totally enthralled, we are reminded that we are watching a movie by the dimwitted villain. And the remote control/rewind scene was god awful! I'm sorry, but I wanted the mother to blow away the sleazeball! We needed some redemption for what these monsters did to that family! Look, I appreciate filmmakers trying new and inventive things in their films, but they also need to realize that the general public will be watching them. We don't want to sit at stare at a paused screen for 10 minutes because you think it is effective in illlustrating how horrible something is. We also don't want to be tricked by a ridiculous remote-control cop out. I was SO angry at the end of this film and sat and stared at the screen for at least 5 minutes. The film went nowhere and (SPOILER) the fact that the villains kill the entire family and move on to another is totally UNSATISFYING for this picture. The question very well does become WHAT WAS THE POINT!! Please, take my advice and avoid at all costs! 1 out of 10!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not quite sure what to make of this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do know one thing: I've never seen a movie quite like this before. I saw it because John Waters said it was his favorite movie of the year, and also because it was supposed to be very shocking and disturbing.After I watched it, I just kind of sat there thoughtfully, not really knowing what to think. That's not necessarily a bad thing; let's face it, with many movies these days, you forget about them the second they are done. This movie wasn't really what I expected. I didn't expect the movie to have such a cold, flat tone, for one thing. For another, I didn't expect it to be so depressing.The plot concerns a family-two parents, one young boy, and a dog-have recently arrived at their summer home by the lake for a nice relaxing vacation. Two young men trick their way into their home and, for no apparent reason, proceed to play mind games with them, torture them psychologically, emotionally, and physically, and kill them. That's about the extent of the plot.Some people have said the movie is very unrealistic. Those of us who have known someone who was the victim of a motive-less homicide in their own home would disagree. Most killers do get into someone's home by talking their way in, or taking advantage of a situation where someone doesn't want to be rude. I have always been extremely careful, and never open the door of my home to a stranger. After watching this movie, any stranger I find in my home will probably end up being beaten by a pulp to me, even if they turn out to be completely harmless. Also, never trust anyone who is wearing surgical gloves for no apparent reason. Husbands, if your wife asks you to throw someone out of the house, don't ask questions first-just do it. Perhaps the only part I thought was unrealistic was the fact that the husband takes several fatal minutes to try to hear both sides of the story before deciding to do anything. If my spouse walked in, saw two men in our house we barely knew, and me on the verge of tears telling him to make them leave, they would either be gone in less than 5 seconds or something violent would occur.People have called this movie extremely disturbing. I'd give it maybe a 7 or 8 on a scale of one to ten, one being Scream and ten being, say, Man Behind the Sun. What kept it from being all-out disturbing for me? Fortunately, one of the killers frequently breaks the "fourth wall" and talks directly to the camera. (spoilers coming, skip this next and the next 2 paragraphs if you don't want to know). There's also a scene where one of the killers grabs the TV remote control and rewinds the movie for a couple minutes so they can change the outcome. While I admire the film-maker for being original, and I understand the statement he was trying to make with this, it mostly killed my suspension of disbelief (characters stopping the action by turning to the camera and asking the viewer a question will definitely do that). I'm glad this happened, however.However, I'm actually glad those moments were put in (except for the rewinding, because something very satisfying that occurred was 'erased'). Otherwise, this movie would have given me nightmares. Characters you care about don't survive, and in fact, come to fates that you would not wish on your worst enemy. As in life, there's no reason for the crime other than the killer's personal amusement. And as is so often sadly the case, the killers will probably never are convicted (let alone arrested) and seem to feel no guilt or shame. They permanently destroy an innocent person's life as casually as someone would kill a spider.The scene about 2/3 through the movie that people mention as being the most shocking and upsetting was so painfully realistic I had to look away. We don't see the actual act, just the aftermath, which is much more effective. I don't think I'll get the image of Anna on the couch out of my head for a long, long time; the director shot the scene in 'real time', and everything is so still for so long that I actually thought for a minute that my DVD had frozen up.Again, I'm not really sure what to make of this movie, or even how to find the words to describe it. Usually I write reviews fairly quickly, for this one I almost felt like I was back in college trying to answer an essay question. I guess that says something right there.On the negative side, I don't like when directors manipulate the audience's emotions, especially with gimmicks. The plot is very thin, and there is no real 'climax' at the end; something happens and the movie just sort of meanders off. I also felt at times like I was being preached to.I can't really use the word 'positive' to explain the things that I thought were effective, or say that there were things I 'liked' or 'enjoyed'. This is not a likeable movie. Instead, here are the things that I thought worked well or were memorable. The acting was superb; the actress playing Anna was so good that I actually had to remind myself at times that I was watching a movie and not a documentary or snuff film. There's no score. I was never able to predict what was going to happen next. We never see the act of homicide, only the aftermath. This is not what I would call a gory movie, but it is still sickening enough that I couldn't eat while watching. The film never glamorizes violence, makes it look cool, or portrays the slightest bit of likeability in the killers. It has the courage to be utterly downbeat and grim. It reminded me I need to get a stronger chain bolt installed on our door.I don't even know who to recommend this movie to. I'm at a loss, which has never happened before. Adults only. Perhaps people that saw Natural Born Killers and thought Mickey and Mallory were the heros, or people who went out and bought OJ Simpson masks to wear as a Halloween costume should see the victim's side. I know who should NOT see the movie- those who are easily disturbed, worry obsessively about something happening to their family or have lost someone they know to a homicide, or people expecting something enjoyably spooky. If you want black humor, watch Bad Lieutenant or something else. I have a pretty morbid sense of humor at times and I didn't crack a smile once.Till I read these comments by other viewers, I had never heard the directors statement that people that walk out because they can't take the movie don't need it, while the people that sit through the entire movie do. Since I sat through the movie, I really would rather not dwell on what that says about my personality and morals. No thanks, I don't think I'll go there. I think I'll put "Bye Bye Birdie" in the player instead and try not to think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little over a month ago, I saw a film called "Devil". In it, a group of people are stuck in an elevator that has come to a dead stop, presumably because the presence of the devil is in with them. Throughout the movie, the people act dumb and just stand there wondering what to do, as opposed to actually doing anything, getting slaughtered one by one. They just START to act towards the end, and that's mainly when we find out who the Devil in question is.If you're following me, you should have a similar idea of what Funny Games is like.A family of 3 go on vacation to a nearby lake. They're a perfectly happy family, or so it seems. That is until the backstreet boys... whoops, I mean two boys visit them and they're all nice. Apparently the ma has had enough of them, and even getting the pop to remove them won't work. How do they respond? Whacking him in the leg. WITH A GOLF CLUB.The dad COULD respond by fighting back. Instead, he just moans and groans and hugs his leg because he's so scared he's going to get killed by the evil golf club of doom. I will also point out that there are 2 bags worth of golf clubs, but the wife is dumb enough not to GRAB ONE AND USE IT AS DEFENSE.Throughout all this pointless time of fourth wall breaking and pretentiousness, the family could be responding by fighting back, but no, all they can do is weep and moan at the evil golf club of doom. The wife is forced to strip down and the son is blasted away with a shot gun, all because they couldn't do anything to defend themselves.Oh, but then the two creeps leave for a short period of time. Good, they can do something to defend themselves, right? Like, grab one of the kitchen knives, create a barricade,or best of all, GET IN THE CAR AND GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE, right? No. NO. Capital N, Capital O.Instead they spend what seems like an hour blowdrying a phone. When they can use it, instead of saying something like "911, police!!! Two crazy teenagers are invading our home!!! Please get to (address) as soon as possible!!!", they spend what seems like an eternity shouting "HELLO???? HELLO????" into the phone. And because of it, when the two psychos come back, it's back to the game.Oh, I will give the mom credit for manning up and grabbing the gun!!! Oh wait, she only shot one of them and because she apparently, for unknown reasons to the viewer, can't shoot the other, the other grabs a remote and rewinds it. I KID YOU NOT.I could go on and on, but I'm just getting angry about it. I, for once, am getting tired of movies where a group of people is terrorized and they aren't smart enough to defend themselves. Apparently this was the intention of Haneke, as he usually beats his viewer over the head with the theme because we're too dumb and can only watch a simplified story. Either way, avoid this trash. The only thing more terrifying than two teenage boys terrorizing a family with a golf club is a house full of morons who aren't smart enough to defend themselves.</fullReview>

As some other reviews here said, this movie doesn't make you happy - it depresses and shocks you.However, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The acting is very believable and the characters, especially the two psychopaths, are very interesting, although I wish we would have learned more about them. But I guess this movie isn't really meant to give us insight into human psychology.This movie is unique. I've never seen a movie of this style before - it's totally different from Hollywood stuff.I wouldn't recommend this movie to people with a faint heart. If this doesn't apply to you, then I'd recommend this to you. I think this movie is quite amazing! (I gave it a 9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>priggish, self-righteous and trite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really flabbergasts me how any movie buff could possibly rave about this trite would-be educational piece of would be art. What is Haneke's message? That we have become oh so much desensitised towards movie violence? That all kind of horror movies is disdainful? Sorry, but i won't put up with his stance. Funny how any movie critic could praise FUNNY GAMES as a radical masterpiece when in fact it is grist to the mill of all those right-wing forces that have been trying to censor art as allegedly being "immoral and harmful". According to Haneke's "logic" all movie violence is superfluous and dangerous to society. Yes, we may not shriek out loud every time we see a dead body in a movie. So what? We know it's fiction. Are we so jaded and walking around like lunatics killing people? Of course not. I opine that our world has never been more peaceful. We have human rights, we even have animal right. We respect the environment and live in a quite peaceful world compared to past centuries. In ancient Rome people were killed and devoured by lions in stadiums to entertain the masses. That violence was not fake. THAT was despicable! And not fake violence! Horror movies can never receive too much praise. Unfortunately Haneke fails to see this aspect. Thrillers confront us with our fears, with death. Violence is ghastly. Hence we watch horror movies. We need to experience fictional violence in movies or novels in order to grasp what life is all about. How precious life is. How fragile life is. How swiftly our lives can be over. But if we follow Haneke's point-of-view horror movies have no contribution to make to society and whoever watches horror thrillers is a voyeur watching trivial violence and listening to "trivial" and "hazardous" heavy metal. Haneke discriminates against all the thriller buffs. And we're supposed to buy into his thoughts. Instead Haneke is so presumptuous that he really assumes that he's the only legitimate person to employ violence to get his intention across. As if all other directors use nothing but gratuitous violence. It's such a shame that such a priggish and right-wing flick was mistaken for being seminal and progressive when in fact it wants to turn the clock back to those days when movies had to be withdrawn from the movie theatres because of one single harmless kiss on the lips. Shouldn't all those critics that applauded Haneke for FUNNY GAMES maul PSYCHO at the same time for being violent and vapid? 1/10 for priggish, presumptuous, discriminating and vacuous content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pair of polite, bland-ish German teenagers encounter a woman, her husband and son in a remote lakeside cottage, then spend the night terrorizing them with "funny games." The set-up is identical to that of Elia Kazan's THE VISITORS, both versions of DESPERATE HOURS, and many other claustrophobic thrillers; but the feeling of the picture is that of a hundred-minute-long extended dance remix of the ear-slicing in RESERVOIR DOGS. The writer-director Michael Haneke has one ace up his sleeve: the handsomer of the two sociopaths is given asides to the camera, on the order of, "You are on their side, aren't you?"The point of all this, apparently, is that the audience is implicated in the action, because we, as pop-culture consumers, consume torture and protracted murder as entertainment. But there's a flaw in Haneke's logic: the only time we consume torture and protracted murder as entertainment is in recondite European art films like I STAND ALONE, MAN BITES DOG, and FUNNY GAMES.This is the kind of picture that gets bluenose types all huffy, and prone to pronouncements on the order of, "This is the most repellent movie ever made!" I'll stay off that high horse--but I will say, a few hours after seeing the picture, that there is something singularly loathsome in the hypocrisy of Haneke's coating a suspenseless piece of fictional snuff porn in the sanctimony of its being a Statement on Violence and Media. Haneke makes the victims as dull and uncharacterized as the victors; removes just about any plausible means of escape or table-turning; and subtracts any reason for us to care about the outcome, except our desire not to witness hideous suffering. What's left--an orgy of S&amp;M-like abuse--certainly does make the audience squirm. But so what? So would a videotape of anonymous torture, or the capture and abuse of an animal. FUNNY GAMES doesn't exist on a political or philosophical level (like I STAND ALONE); its attempts at mordant humor are collegiate (unlike MAN BITES DOG); it certainly doesn't hold up a mirror to a junk-food culture (like NATURAL BORN KILLERS). It's a wallow. And you know what side the filmmakers are on when one of the sadists terrifies a little kid by slipping on a CD in a neighbor's house the kid has escaped to, and the music is that well-known favorite of middle-aged bourgeois people on vacation...John Zorn and the Naked City.This kind of Extreme Cinema has worked much better when practiced by artists in totally disreputable sub-pulp forms--like Lucio Fulci and Ruggero Deodato, whose sometimes almost unwatchable films engage in a spiritual wrestling match between the desire to go to the limits, and the conscience that watches over the mayhem. I was shocked to discover that Haneke is nearly sixty--this picture has the sensibility of a kid turned on by the autopsy pictures at Amok Books. As he sticks bamboo under our fingernails, your mind is so unoccupied it asks other questions. Like: Why would any sane family entertain for a minute two young strangers wearing fingerprint-proof gloves in the middle of summer? And: Is the actress playing the mother this terrible because no one else would take such a degrading role?</fullReview>

There are no good special effects, the soundtrack is horrible (i don't know what they were thinking with their trashy metal music), the acting itself wasn't even that great.

		<fullReview>Although I consider this film to be one of the most disturbing of its genre, it makes a critical error which is becoming rampant in modern cinema. The key to the effectiveness of any film, particularly horror, is the ability to suspend the disbelief of the viewer. One has to be able to forget he is watching a film in order to truly empathize with the characters and, in horror, feel their terror. But at multiple points in the film, our lead sadist turns to camera to address us which manages to completely pull the viewer out of the terror and remind him that he is watching a film. I understand the appeal of post-modern film-making, but itreally has no place in horror. Absent this handful of scenes, however, this film is very convincing, brilliantly acted and is a must see for anyone who wants to be disturbed.</fullReview>

The whole idea that a living person created this badly influential trash is obscene. The antagonists show no mercy whatsoever, they are truly psychopathic -in the real sense of the word -without conscience. The division between victims and victimizers is way too wide. A decent and even happy family unit is tormented, tortured, humiliated and eventually murdered.Frankly this sad excuse for a story is terrible, and painful to watch. As far as production goes it is not bad, but for entertainment value I give Funny Games (what a stupid name for such a horribly cruel film) zero. Typically people in the western worlds today are sadists, way too comfortable and bored in their lives and so create their own forms of misery to thrive on.

There are no gore scenes in it, but it would have been a much more sincere film if there were some. It is a movie made according to the tastes of some sick high-class European bourgeoisie which dare not watch porn or gore films; nevertheless, they do like this film, because it is awfully sensationalist and morbid but it doesn't make them feel guilty for watching it, as it is supposed to be art.</fullReview>

Two intellectuals terrorize a family on holiday with the usual results. Its all been done before and much better. The filmmaker fails to see that what makes a shockingly disturbing movie watchable is making sure it aint so damn realistic! Cause nobody wants to be subjected to that. Nobody sane at any least. While the violence is mostly implied, omitting it only adds to the realism by forcing your imagination to fill in he missing pieces. Graphically displaying violence, as American audiences and filmmakers know cartoonizes it, makes it almost a joke, a walk through the haunted house at the carnival. It would seem this film bends over backwards to do the opposite by giving it an almost documentary if not snuff feel. The director tries to amuse us and remind us we are at the cinema by having the villains talk, smirk and joke with us. The old fourth wall gimmick. Not that it ever suceeds, but here it completely backfires, as it instead makes you an unwilling accomplice to their atrocities. This just may be culture gap, for all i know it won the Austrian Oscar, but my advice is spare yourself the bother. see Hitchcock's Rope instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain films that use extreme violence to paradoxically sensitize us to the effects and causes, as well as the ugliness, of violence. Then there are films that use the above as an excuse to indulge in violence simply to satisfy a perverse lust for sadistic self-gratification. This film falls into the latter category.Actually, this film is in a league all it's own. Imagine what a film made by young Nazi hipsters who get their kicks out of torturing and murdering Jews would look like. Then multiply that by 100 times. You'd be somewhere near the sickening moral black hole this pretentious "film" is. Unlike most IMDb users, I reserve 1's for movies that are beyond bad and into truly diabolical. So it is extremely rare that I give out a one. But there is no number you can put to how revolting this movie is. It literally made me sick for days and plunged me into a severe depression. And that's from someone who thinks Natural Born Killers is a masterpiece. This movie took a part of my soul away. It is a nihilistic "f**k all, but look how cool we are in doing it" masturbation-fest. Oh, but don't you get it? It's SO ironic.Please do not see this movie, unless you are a big fan of the Hitler Youth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A violent and uninvolving film is still just that even if you dress it up in snobbish, European comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna and Georg take their young son and go up to the family cabin for a vacation. When there they meet the neighbours, including the mysteriously gloved but quite ordinary Peter and Paul. However when Anna asks the two young men to leave, they refuse and she calls for Georg to help her. Peter and Paul hit him with a golf club and take the three of them hostage in their home. As the day winds on, they play increasingly sadistic games with them.I wasn't sure what this film was when I taped it, it was only after I had seen it did I become aware of the media attention on it. However, what was obvious (very obvious) was that this film was trying to make a comment about the violence in films and how the audience encourage it by our blood lust. The two cruel young men often turn to camera, involving the audience directly in what they are doing - however their victims have no such luxury. The film wastes no time in getting Peter and Paul into the house and letting the tension slowly build up. It uses the tension well with the brutality (much of which we don't actually see) to create a film that is quite gripping as you hope that these `bad men' will get what's coming to them and the family will somehow survive.During the film (and most obviously during the absurd `rewind' scene), you realise that this is not what the film is about - there is no story that will come to an end, there is only the brutality itself. Once you spot this, the film really takes a dive as you have to accept it for what it is actually trying to be. What it seems to be doing is attacking cinema for it's violence, it's pleasure in suffering - like the games Paul &amp; Peter play, the film is saying that many films just exist for audiences to feed on violence and suffering of characters who barely matter. This may be true of course, but delivering this message in a violent film is not a good way to do it - I would not attack a racist film by making a racist film poking fun of it, likewise this film smacks of hypocrisy. Not only that but it is rather unoriginal - we have had plenty of better films that this making the selfsame point.The violence is not so bad as it is mostly off screen; but what is difficult is the sheer brutality of it all. The cruelty dished out is difficult and it is impossible (despite the film's inability to really give them personalities) not to feel for the family involved. But again the film isn't interesting in any emotion the audience may feel - it just ploughs ahead where it was going. This very fact seems to destroy the very point of the film; I was not enjoying the violence, I was emotionally involved - I was not on the side of the men, I was not baying for more gore. Yes, there are action movies that do this, but plenty of films uses violence as part of the film - few use it for it's own sake in the way this does (and is criticising).The cast are pretty poor and are betrayed by a film that uses them as props in a grand message rather than people. I was made to feel that I was wrong for feeling for them - what a cold film! Lothar is pretty poor as the mother, but Muhe delivers at least some emotion as the father. Of Frisch and Giering, the former is the better, delivering a cold hearted and stone faced performance. However I disliked both of them and I think it is impossible not to hate them here - again undermining the very point the film was trying to make.Overall, if you are looking for a slightly snobbish European film that looks down it's nose at violence while it gleefully dispenses torture and stares at a blood-soaked television, then this will be what you want - but there are better out there. However if you want a film that involves, has emotional buy in, characters, story etc then you should by pass this one. I was left cold by a film that seemed to be confused as to what it wanted to say but, whatever it was criticising, the film had a smug air to it that somehow it's blood, brutality and gore was somehow better than other film just because it had based it in comment. Worth experiencing once but ultimately a redundant film that only serves to harden.</fullReview>
