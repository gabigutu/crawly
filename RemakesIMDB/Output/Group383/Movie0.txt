		<fullReview>In the summer of 1956, American-International Pictures (AIP) had scored big with a double feature of GIRLS IN PRISON and HOT ROD GIRL, and followed it up before Thanksgiving with a couple of similar titles, RUNAWAY DAUGHTERS and SHAKE RATTLE AND ROCK. DAUGHTERS shares director Edward L. Cahn, writer Lou Rusoff and two actors, Adele Jergens and Lance Fuller, with PRISON. It also contains the same sneering attitude, to the third power.RUNAWAY DAUGHTERS tells the story of three teenage girls with bad home situations; Audrey (Marla English) has parents who throw money instead of love at her; Dixie (Mary Ellen Kaye) was abandoned by her mother, and her father keeps her on a short leash to prevent her from becoming a tramp; and Angela (Gloria Castillo) has been abandoned by her parents and decides that life is only worth living if you're drunk and cheap. Angela's role model, unfortunately, is a brother who's a one-bit heel (he's not even good enough to be two-bit), Lance Fuller, who spends half his time planning heists with his cheesy companion, the delightful Adele Jergens (in her last screen role), and the other half getting his greasy fingerprints all over good-girl Audrey. After problems with parents, brouhahas with boys, tempests with teachers, and clashes with cops, our three vivacious vixens steal a car and head south to L.A., city of hopes, dreams, and ten-cents-a-dance sleaze joints. One unwanted pregnancy, one near rape, and one fatal auto accident later, our trio of troubled teens head for home, sadder but wiser. Well, one of 'em does, anyway.DAUGHTERS has the usual AIP formula: angst-filled kids, condescending adults, and a mixture of young faces (besides those listed above, you'll find familiar AIP stars Frank Gorshin and Steve Terrell) and old veterans (Anna Sten, John Litel, and in cameos Kermit Maynard, Snub Pollard, and Edmund Cobb; in fact, according to Sam Arkoff, Cahn fought to have Miss Sten, a studio joke back in Sam Goldwyn's heyday, given top billing). At a running time of approximately 94 minutes, however, it's much more leisurely paced than most AIP fare of the time, which is not a bad thing. I found myself even more involved in the girls' story than I had been when watching, oh, DRAGSTRIP GIRL or BLOOD OF Dracula, two other kooky she-teen movies from AIP. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AIP were capable, (when they wished to be) of investing this kind of pulpy hokum with enough technical and pacing panache to keep their drive-in audiences involved.Unfortunately, they didn't bother here.Thus, unlike "High School Hellcats" and more especially "I Was a Teenage Werewolf," both of which benefited enormously from shadowy, film noir lighting schemes, and (fairly) well dressed settings, "Runaway Daughters" looks all of $2.98 cents.This can be OK when the lackluster visuals are counterbalanced by an arresting storyline. But alas, the story here is little more than a synopsis of something probably rejected by the "Police Gazette".Here goes: three teenage girls from different socio-economic circumstances link up to run away from home, in this case to LA, where they quickly become "dime a dance girls" (under the tutelage of Minksy voiced Adele Jergens--"on a good night you might clear $12.00" and "watch out for cockroaches").Apart from the fact that taxi dancers were already way out by the late 50's, the script is handicapped by more serious problems, chiefly the fact that the girls don't run away until 2/3 of the way into the picture. Thus, we sit through multiple scenes of them sulking and arguing with their respective families.These altercations include one in which one of our anti-heroines decks a 70 year old schoolmarm onto the lawn! Stereotypically, adults are all misguided at best in this, and of course, the blame for the youngsters delinquency is laid fully at their doorstep.And what parents!--(if you have been pining away to see 30's film stalwarts, Anna Sten and John Litel, perform a drunken Charleston, then this is your film).As previously mentioned, production values are lamentably skimpy. For example, the fabulously wealthy Marla English character lives in what appears to be a typical 50's subdivision tract house, with cut rate Danish modern furniture, and nary a hint of a servant.For Frank Gorshen and AIP completists only</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wittier and snappier than most kids!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amazed at how droll, urbane, and witty the kids were presented as being, It made me realize that these films really aimed to speak to the teenagers and articulate their frustrations. I much prefer this film to other AIP fare which lacks character development. Fairly ordinary cinema style. Its a time capsule film that explores the burgeoning permissiveness of the late 1950's.The parents of one girl are verging on being bourgeois-bohemian, having parties and drinking booze all the time. Another girl has a bitter hyper-conservative catholic single dad whose domination of her is almost a bit creepy in an incestuous way. Whilst the angry uber-sarcastic and highly enjoyable girl (definately too sophisticated to be realistic) is simply left to fend for herself by some terrible mother who has gone abroad.Other great characters such as the con-man brother, the streetwise grifter, and maternal and tough private dancer... The film seemed to be struggling with the fine art of pleasing the teen and parent viewer alike, which makes it a curio... so much so that the typical moralising end seemed beleaguered</fullReview>
