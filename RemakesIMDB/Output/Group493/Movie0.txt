		<fullReview>This is an astonishing film: a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot, brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images, almost every scene has echoes of another. This is a story told in light, in colour, in many almost-parallels. Every time I watch it, it fills me with delight.The acting is great too. Romane Bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role to his part in La Haine; but no less excellently: shifty and sympathetic at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - ah!, Monica Bellucci, well, put simply, she plays (is?) the world's most perfect woman. There's one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile; yet in that instant, says more than hours of Hollywood junk.One cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb, sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle in turn. But if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, it's the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement, the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story. Yet when the moment comes, it is handled so delicately, so briefly, so deftly, that on reflection it makes you gasp. Only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point. But the confidence is justified. Cinema doesn't come much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be misled by "the French Single White Female" tag. This is a fascinating romantic thriller in the Hitchcock tradition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew nothing about this movie after being recommended to watch it by a friend, but I decided to take a chance on it as I have come to really like Vincent Cassel ('La Haine', 'The Crimson Rivers', 'The Brotherhood Of The Wolf'), even if I don't always enjoy the movies he's in (e.g. 'Dobermann'), and the added attraction of the beautiful Monica Bellucci, Cassel's frequent co-star and former wife, didn't hurt any either. The packaging proclaimed 'The Apartment' to be "the French Single White Female", and while there is SOME comparisons between the two movies I think it gives the viewer quite misleading expectations, and is probably best ignored. 'The Apartment' is more of a mystery than a thriller, and doesn't rely on shock tactics. Fans of Alfred Hitchcock, especially 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo', which it deliberately references, will really appreciate this movie. It isn't as blatant a homage as say, Brian De Palma's 'Sisters', 'Obsession' and 'Dressed To Kill', but the influence is obvious. Cassel plays a man on the eve of his marriage, who unexpectedly finds himself pursuing an old flame (Bellucci) that he has unfinished business with. His search for her eventually leads him to what he believes is her house, but he is then surprised to find it is a case of mistaken identity, and a completely different girl (Romane Bohringer) enters his life. Things however are not what they appear to be, but to reveal anymore of the fascinating twists and turns in the plot, most of which are revealed in flashback, would be extremely unfair! Suffice to say this is a multi-layered, consistently interesting mystery romance which I found to be entertaining and unpredictable. Bellucci looks wonderful, but acting wise Bohringer is the real find here, while Cassel continues to impress. He has genuine talent and charisma and seems destined to become a major international star one day. I believe an American remake of this movie is due anytime now, but I seriously doubt that it will be half as good as this, so try and see it if you can. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fabulous film. The plot is a good yarn, and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view. What was deliberate, and what was coincidence? Who is in love with who? You get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn (sometimes literally), and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth. With a bit of effort following the twists and turns, you can understand each of the characters; and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people. Take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema; it looks good on the big screen. More than keeping you guessing, the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds - I defy anyone to predict! But more likely you will need more than one viewing - I saw this at the pictures on its original release three times, and it got better each time. The acting was very good, with a standout performance by Romane Bohringer as Alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble. A classic. The second-best film of the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"L'appartement" has to be among the best French films I have ever seen (along with "Hatred", also starring Vincent Cassel, and those great Gerard Dépardieu/Pierre Richard movies). Cassel and Bellucci are amazing in the leading roles. Aside from "Brotherhood Of The Wolves" and "Dobermann" I have not yet seen a bad movie with this couple. "L'appartement" sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you thrilled until the very end. Fragment storytelling really hasn't worked this well since "Pulp Fiction". Let's just hope there won't be a godawful American remake of this unique romance/mystery-thriller. (EDIT: Guess what! A godawful American remake has been made!)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the recent dire American remake which sadly tarnished the reputation of the French original by virtue of the director's involvement in both. This is a deftly- drawn romantic 90s noir with many twists and turns. It works best as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's Rear Window, because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that fires the intricate screenplay. The story is stunningly realized, like a Picasso painting, offering multi-perspectives on the same event and demanding the viewer's participation throughout. The settings, music and haunting score are wonderful as well as the excellent contributions from the cast. Watch it more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love French cinema,vraiment,but this sort of slop gives it a bad name. For every zingy,stylish Diva there are sadly many more turkeys like this. Firstly,as others have pointed out,the actors are more given to pouting and exuding existential angst than actually filling out believable characters. I couldn't have cared less about a single one of them,which is a fatal flaw in any film in my book. Implausible,unsympathetic and nauseatingly narcissistic. Worst of all is Monica Bellucci ("ooh,isn't she so yummy?") who swans through the film to no great effect,her role merely to be absurdly gorgeous and act as a hollow erotic talisman for the archetypal passionate yet soft-headed French romantic lead,played by the gormless Cassel. God,I bet they made a riveting couple when they were married. I watched the movie over several sittings as it just did nothing to hold my interest. The flashbacks and changes in perspective succeeded in alienating me and muddying the already creaky plot and were presumably stuck in there to earn the director "cred points" rather than for any coherent artistic effect. Subsequently when it thankfully drew to its close,I was none the wiser about who did what and to whom. Or more importantly why? We are supposed to buy that old French canard (geddit?) about men and women losing their heads pour l'amour. Then again did Max ever really love Alice/Lisa/his fiancée? How did everyone afford to live in such high Parisian style when none appeared to do much work? Where did Alice get her money from anyway? Oh yes,she was a sometime actress as we saw in that superfluous sub-plot about the Midsummer Night's Dream production. Talk about cynically pandering to amateur critics to facilitate guff about " plays-within-plays" and so on! More proof of a director too interested in ticking "art-house film" boxes and flattering the intelligence of his overawed audience. Before the final conflagration in the eponymous flat,I still wondered if perhaps it was I who'd failed to match up to a fine and complex,multi-layered piece of movie-making. Then when I saw the vacant look on Lisa's face as her bloke torched the place followed by the clichéd slow-mo of Max's mate going backwards through the café window,the man behind the curtain was cruelly shown up. It wasn't me after all-this so-called art film is as much an imposter as Alice herself. And it should be put on a plane to Rome one-way forthwith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before...There are more than a dozen modern stunning French films from en couer de hiver to the three colours trilogy and all of them are special. This film is one of them. A true delight with so many great things going for it from the homage to Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in Romane and Monica. While Monica is very beautiful, Romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabits.I am not sure why people think this film is convoluted as the scenes are such a perfect blend of past and present acting as a counterpoint to the characters' own remarkable journey that the film simply flows and you barely realise that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the viewed enchanted and bewitched. Like most French and European films this story would never translate across the Atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without throttling the life out of it with the Hollywood bleaching common to most movies that become lost in translation. Americans make brilliant films, but not of this type... perhaps if they let someone like a young Polanski work on it then maybe they would not totally butcher an English version...For those who do not watch subtitled films you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss. For those who can read then you would be spiting yourself to miss films like this...I would describe this as Neo-Franco-Noir, but only to cheese off the reviewer who called this film elitist. I think I saw him doing an add for four-and-twenty-pies. He thinks Romane Bohringer is a type of French Mayonnaise...It is arty in the way that Pulp Fiction is arty...but with more Gallic savoire faire...10 out of 10 with every viewing...and has anyone got Romane's phone number...she is the perfect French Salad Dressing...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: "How complicated!" And she is right, of course. When you are used to simple, one-linear plots, especially violent hero vs crook schemes, L'Appartement is hard to follow. A couple of the negative reviewers here also have missed one or more important points. Other whine about the confusing flash backs. Come on! This is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. This one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. Then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all scenes.The first 3/4 of the movie centers about the question: why did Max and Lisa split? The film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. Having experience with French movies, I predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and I was right. In the end of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know, that Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know, why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to Paris. The only one who did was Alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut.After both Max and Lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed.Many European movies use a story telling technique I fully enjoy. There is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. Instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half Alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure.Acting is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret.The only reason I did not gave it a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfying end. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events Max is exactly on the point where the movie begun, only wiser and sadder. Alice has paid for her sins. But still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial. Max too easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice too easily decides to reject Max, who has been her dream for so long; Max too easily returns to his fiancée. But then again, I don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tangled tale worth unravelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylish, erotic and complex, Gilles Mimouni's only film to date appears at first sight to be quintessentially French, but has links to American identity-themed, noirish thrillers, such as Preminger's Laura and Hitchcock's Vertigo. (I'm also not so sure as other postings that all the locations and interiors are actually Parisian; the credits indicate that a lot of the movie was made in Spain.)Max (Vincent Cassel) is a successful, young executive, engaged to be married, who catches a fleeting glimpse of an ex-lover, Lisa (Monica Bellucci), and immediately drops plans to travel to Tokyo, in order to find her. But, instead, he finds another woman (Romane Bohringer), bearing a resemblance to Lisa, with whom he starts an affair, while still hoping to find Lisa. The story is told in an extremely fragmented manner, jumping backwards and forwards in time, with hair-style, clothing and sometimes weather providing clues to the sequence of events. By the end of the film almost every i has been dotted, and t crossed, so that theoretically it should be possible to re-edit the movie so that it is linear. But as well as being a duller movie, this would lose what I see as one of its main themes - that memories, fuelled by imagination, can be more powerful than mundane reality. Another theme seems to be that not everybody gets what they deserve, and life can be cruel. Generally, I see the film as being bleaker and more amoral than do some IMDb postings. The acting, camerawork, sets, music and, of course, the editing are all first rate. This is a perfect film to rent, so that baffling bits (or all) of it can be replayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters. So, there are a lot of flashbacks, of re-shooting of the same scene. But, it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result! And it would worth it, because it's for me, just one the best French movie ever made! It has everything: Cast: first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for a hard-of-hearing! It's symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie!Directing: his camera is bright, alive, plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long close-up "? la David Lynch".Cinematography: the light is beautiful, between gold and rust, like their love!A never-seen before Paris: It's a Paris out-of-time of more accurately, a composite of a lot of districts! Huge search here! It's look like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! Music: Not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames. And the song of Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! Ah, ? the story! As I said, it's a love story but rather tragic: Saying that love can be for nothing, that it doesn't make all people happy or isn't guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message isn't often told! Love is passion, which is derivative from the Latin "pain". You can suffer a lot when you are in love! Because of the Why .. ?, of the endless waiting, the lack of courage, the indecision. And when you can ease yourself, fate, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back , just because you arrive too soon or too late, and above all, because love means 2 in a world of billions! A lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written! So, what's love? Personally, I lived some moments like this: in a car with the dear one. Her mobile rings and you know it's her "special friend" whom she kisses goodbye (and not you, even if we are always together). So, you want to go out of this car to leave them together, to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can't, because an amazing hard rain just started! I found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-SPOILERS------------ I am a fan of 60's-70's french cinema but not necessarily of the more modern,so to be honest i watched this because of Bellucci.She is very young here,extremely beautiful and on top of this supposedly this movie is where they met with Cassel,so it gives it some extra importance.The movie begins with a very nice style reminiscent of DePalma.Then suddenly we are thrown to flashback,and the back and forth goes on which gets tiring.I don't mind one flash back,but do it and get it over with man!!!Anyway,the movie is still interesting to me until a point when the first and definite hole in the plot,that allows for the rest of the story,never lets me enjoy the rest.I can allow for little holes here and there,but not to base an entire plot on hot air.This is the story of a man who is literally searching for an old flame.This is the main plot.I will go along,when the story at some point will convince me that there are really mysterious things going on,but in this story there's nothing really mysterious.Bellucci-Cassel are a couple ,then Bellucci urgently has to leave for some job in Italy(not the farthest place on earth from Paris)and she leaves him a message,which for reasons later explained he doesn't get.OK,so what?Don't these people have phones?Supposedly she was away for 2months(not a century exactly) and wouldn't she call her boyfriend in Paris to see how he's doing? Of course not.Instead,even after she gets back she forgets all about him.And thats fine,but later in the movie she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life.Yet she failed to give him a call for 2months and then never tried to get back with him.And what about Cassel's character?He was supposedly unable to locate her in Italy,really hard to find someone in Italy,its probably like Siberia,especially an actress who is probably listed even in the arts papers.And after 2months when she would be back,really hard to find her and ask for an explanation. One thinks she wanted to avoid him,but no,we find out they simply couldn't meet.So hard to meet in Paris. OK,i don't need to go further,because this is the incident where the entire movie is based. What is even worse,Bellucci is not really the star of this movie but this other girl Bohringer is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rear Window meets Rashomon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In three words: Sophisticated, sexy, smart. In one sentence: What a script!This is s very daring film. It actually imagines that the person watching is paying attention and willing to be enthralled by an exceedingly clever story. If you are seeing it at home then don't go and grab something from the fridge without hitting the pause button. If you do you won't understand it at all. You can't miss anything, right from the seemingly unimportant opening scene in a jewelers shop on the phallocentric Place Vendome (think Freud via Hitchcock) with an exposition on three engagement rings, up until the credits. This film will take you one way, double back on itself, then dig an escape tunnel right under your nose. You can't tell much of the plot without giving some of the game away so as to the story let me only say this: The worldly Max (Vincent Cassel) is about to be engaged to Muriel (Sandrine Kiberlain). He is also heading off to Japan on a business trip and prior to catching his plane makes a visit to a café and overhears a voice speaking on the telephone who he suspects is a woman he once knew: Lisa (Monica Bellucci),. This triggers an old obsession in him and instead of taking his flight he follows a trail of clues in the hope of finding this former love. We are treated to his relationship with her in flashback. But if you think you know what is going on don't rest on your laurels. A third and even a forth strand of the story will be revealed to you (but not to Max) in poignant fashion. Think of Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo crossed with Kurosawa's Rashomon and treat yourself to having the action happen in Paris with the achingly beautiful Monica Belluci, a passionate Romane Bohringer and that unwitting, lucky bastard Vincent Cassel who gets to smooch with both of them. There is a slight misjudgement in pace two thirds through but keep watching as you can't take for granted where the story will go. And as it seems Vincent Cassel is on the brink of making a second grand career on this side of the Atlantic this is an excellent place to start your homework on the man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing Encounters, Obsession and Serendipities with a Disappointing and Incoherent Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two years working in New York in the 90's, the successful executive Max Mayer (Vincent Cassel) returns to Paris and will sooner get married to his fiancée Muriel (Sandrine Kiberlain). He has a meeting in a restaurant with Japanese executives and then he will travel to Tokyo. However, he glances at a woman leaving a telephone booth and he believes she is Lisa (Monica Bellucci), the greatest love of his life who had disappeared years ago. He finds the key of a Parisian hotel room in the booth and he calls off his trip to Tokyo trying to meet Lisa in the hotel. He sneaks into the empty room; finds an obituary and goes to the cemetery expecting to find Lisa. Then he follows the stranger Daniel (Olivier Granier), whose name he had overheard in the booth cabin, and finds an apartment that he supposes is Lisa address. Meanwhile Max recalls his romance with Lisa in flashbacks. Max borrows the car of his best friend Lucien (Jean-Philippe Écoffey), who is in love with his girlfriend Alice, to go to the apartment wait for Lisa. However, he finds another woman also called Lisa (Romane Bohringer). The mystery is clarified through the flashbacks."L'Appartement" is an intriguing thriller about missing encounters, obsession and serendipities with a disappointing and incoherent conclusion. The non-linear screenplay keeps the mystery until the very end. The performances of Vincent Cassel, Monica Bellucci and Jean- Philippe Écoffey are excellent, but the sexy Romane Bohringer steals the movie in the role of an outcast woman obsessed by her only girlfriend. Unfortunately there are many flaws and holes in the story. The first one is indeed a continuity mistake, with Max's scarf vanishing when meets Lucien in the stairway and in the restaurant, but back around his neck when he goes to the airport. There are questions not answered: Why Lisa had lodged in a hotel in Paris if she has her own apartment? How Alice financially supports herself? Why Max stays with Muriel in the end? Why Lisa trusted on a single letter, instead of looking for Lucien and asking Max's address in New York and send an ultimate letter?My interpretation of the plot is that the lonely and needy Alice is obsessed by Lisa and creates all the missing encounters to avoid Lisa to meet Max and leave her alone again. But in the end, she finds that Max desires and loves her and she unexpectedly falls in love with Max. Therefore, she does not need Lisa anymore. However, my interpretation seems to be wrong based on the reaction of Max after reading her diary. But again, Alice is a manipulative woman and the viewer never knows neither what is written in her journal (maybe the real feelings of the true Lisa) nor her conversation without audio with Lisa. Further, Max is a romantic man that has never acknowledged the love of Lisa with him and believe his feelings are unrequited love. There are references to "Rear Window" and "Single White Female", but nevertheless, the terrible conclusion does not make any sense. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Apartamento" ("The Apartment")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original to a much better remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering this film was launched in 1996, I would have to say it's the French original based on which Wicker Park was made. With a cast of French and American actors, the story seemed peculiarly familiar to me, having seen the American version first. But when the restaurant scene started it all came back to me. If you've already seen Wicker Park, I don't recommend this movie. First because you already know all the plot turns that make the story great and second because - I never thought I would ever say this - Diane Kruger is much better for the part than Monica Bellucci (and this comes from a man who is a big fan of the latter). Furthermore, it is my opinion that Cassel - again, comparing him with Mathew Lillard in Wicker Part - played his part like a stiff. I haven't seen many of his movies, but from those I did see I can safely say he didn't commit to this role. All in all, I give it 5/10 because the story was ruined for me and because the lead actors, though all good ones, did not impress me in this production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mimouni's 'L'Appartement' seems to have garnered plenty of recognition simply for its style and suggestiveness. It is a stylish film indeed. Not in the Hollywoodish sense but rather in its storytelling and use of camera-work. The film has a simple natural French look. There are no ultraglamourous people or lavish-looking sets. It's set in the simple yet stunning Paris. The apartment that plays the title role is quite marvelous. The exterior and interior designs are superb.The story is very labyrinthine but unfortunately not very layered. Mimouni uses a very narrative approach and fails to delve deeper into the characters themselves. Moreover, I found the ending very disappointing and the characters' actions out of sync. Many seem to have come up with their own explanation for the conclusion in an attempt to make sense of it and maybe that was Mimouni's intention (which makes this a pretentious film) but for me merely rationalizing that a character is a 'flawed' human being isn't enough to explain an action that is completely out of place. I'm not saying that I would have preferred a happy ending (certainly not the usual Hollywood ending) but at least something that made sense of the character.Vincent Cassel, Monica Bellucci and Romain Bohringer deliver first rate performances. Cassel and Bellucci's scenes are among the best sequences in the movie. Their electric chemistry sizzles on screen. Meanwhile, Bohringer terrifically gets under the skin of bad Alice.'L'Appartement' has a very enjoyable first 1 hour and 15 minutes. Mimouni's labyrinthine gets a bit confusing in places but soon picks up. He also references to several classics, especially to Hitchcock's movies but reference alone does not solidify great work. Had it not been for the disappointing ending and lack of consistency, this could have been a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in Korea back in 1999, and it lingered in my mind for a while after viewing. It was also my introduction to the hauntingly beautiful Monica Bellucci (HER face could launch a thousand ships).The twists and turns and bizarre ending makes this a must see. I hope they release an uncut DVD version as I own the Korean release that had three minutes cut out.Highly recommended and a film you can see more than once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly French twaddle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very confusing film with nods to Hitchcock, some very good photography and little else. The plot involves the Hitchcock staples of obsession and paranoia but lacks the ultimate touch of the master - suspense. I was told that this film was a 'must see' and how great it was and how wonderful the structure was and how engaging it all was. Well, do not waste the time because this film is a pretentious, overlong piece of French 'style' - lots of visual cleverness and moody pouting (called great acting when it is in a French film) but little substance. At the end you could not care less what happens to these self-obsessed characters and I must have had a bad day because I could not follow a lot of this. The film uses a fragmented narrative by presenting the sequences in flashback and in no particular order. We are shown scenes several times and with new perspectives each time so we can try to make sense of the story, if one can call it that. I had to resort to looking at the characters' hair in order to figure out when things were happening. There was also a great deal of symbolism - red rose, white rose, red walls, white shirts, long hair, short hair, red shoes and on and on and on until I yelled enough! The symbols, of course, go nowhere and are presented in sledgehammer fashion so that we can marvel at how clever it all is even though it makes no sense. This is "Single White Female" meets French pretension made by a director who has studied too many Hitchcock films but failed the exam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romayne Bohringer creates a tangle of several romances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"L'Appartemente" is a neo-noir included in critic John Grant's list. This owes to the character of Romayne Bohringer who disturbs several romances that center around the character of Vincent Cassel. She is the femme fatale.This is basically an okay romantic movie, but it has some annoying faults. One plus is that it has a very clever and intricate story. But this story also has big plot holes, the main one being separated lovers who know the approximate locations of each other and do not re-connect.The movie just about wore me out, what with length, flashbacks, and choppy editing. There was a little too much of clever failures to see each other at one point. Cute, but somehow annoying too. The screenplay seemed uneasily to mix an attempt at lightness in the old Hollywood style with its neo-noir deceptions. At times, the music was lifted directly from A Bernard Herrmann score for Hitchcock, and the actions paralleled Hitchcock movies at times.Getting into these characters was a challenge. I sort of went along with them but not deeply. I didn't think that Cassel was as good as usual. Bohringer had a very challenging role, in which she wasn't made at all sympathetic, and she seemed unable to shade her character and overcome the script limitations. Bellucci had a much easier time of it and handled her part with aplomb. The fates of the characters in the final sequences didn't seem right. One minute Cassel is going in one direction, and the next minute he's going in another direction. Bellucci's fate was extreme, given the character of the story.I was glad when the movie finally ended. I liked it well enough, but it felt herky-jerky and manipulated. It may go down easier the second time around, but I'm not sure it will. It was awfully slow in getting around to the first big twist or revelation, having to do with a letter that Bellucci asks Bohringer to deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winding, twisting tale of deceit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All credit to writer/director Gilles Mimouni who fashioned this winding, twisting tale of deceit and betrayal. While keeping the utmost control, he maintains the audience at arm's length, never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on. Even his clever denouement has you guessing.The three central performances are also top class, with Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role. To give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair.Thierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma, and Cardine Biggerstaff's editing keeps the story a step ahead of us. The theme from Peter Chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script.Many may say Gilles Mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love. For me this is simply a haunting, elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web. Only the French are capable of such tantalisation. Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending.Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts CroydonNo-one does thriller quite like the French. When they get it right, they really get it right.Vincent Cassell is intriguing as the deceptive Max, Romane Bohringer obsessive as the new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot from Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires.All credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot, and the performances from the three leads. As Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional.Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video</fullReview>

Remarkable playing by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris portrayed from the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD are the french one and the English. Directed by a controversial artist as Gilles Mimouni, it could be considered a little homage to the Cinema masterworks. It is a french movie, and as all of them, not for all, we could say a d'essai cinema. Even if not so publicized, it could be remembered for several reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot has already been written about the film itself, so instead of adding to the noise I just want to say a few words on the two female actors.It has to be a daunting prospect for any actress to star, in a sense, versus the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer pulls it off to sensational ends. A film starring Monica Bellucci where I fall in love with the other girl?? That's not supposed to happen.It's been said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci strikes the saddest figure in modern cinema. I have never before seen such innate sadness.

		<shortDescription>Complex and involving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this tense and character-driven romantic tragi-comedy, we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething Parisians. At the centre is Vinz Cassell's portrayal of Max. A starry-eyed Romeo, he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his put-upon best friend Lucien (Écoffey, in an understated but effective performance), he wins her heart and they live happily ever after... that is, until the scheming, neurotic and obsessive Alice (the versatile Romane Bohringer) becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three.The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble, and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw, the eye-candy of picture-postcard Paris at the heart of it all. The use of colour does not go unnoticed, particularly in Lisa's spectacular apartment (presumably accounting for the film's title), where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust.The audience can relate to Max: he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it. In one memorable scene, our fated lovers (agonisingly separated by a 'choreographed' misunderstanding) narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them. Independent of one another, they travel to the same destination: her on the Metro, him in a taxi, practically t?te-?-t?te. Yet fate seems to have it in for them, and the audience is captivatingly teased.The performances in this film are really what make L'Appartement stand out. I still cannot understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. He has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's real-life spouse at the time of writing) has recently found fame in the Anglophone film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true, she is divinely beautiful, but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic 'leading-lady' style, which many British and American actresses dismiss in favour of the all-too-easy 'subtle' approach.All in all, watch this film! I doubt you'll be disappointed. It is gripping, satisfying, amusing, sad, lavish, and a lesson in artistic film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie was being shown on TV late in the evening, and thought "there's usually a good reason for it, when they show French movies on this channel", and BOY am I glad I saw it! L'Appartement deserves a remake, just so that a wider audience will go to the theatre and enjoy this enthralling storyline (Although watching it in its original language doesn't sabotage the story). You may recall movies like _Nightwatch (1997)_ (qv) and _Vanilla Sky (2001)_ (qv) which are American remakes of their Danish (_Nattevagten (1994)_ (qv)) and Spanish (_Abre los ojos (1997)_) counterparts. These 2 movies are quite different, but they have one thing in common: a GREAT story. Just the same with "L'Appartement", the story lifts it up higher than any superstar-acting or ILM special-effects ever could.Not saying that there's anything wrong with the acting, it's actually perfect in my opinion. And special effects really wouldn't help this movie in any way.As another commenter noted, this thing has more plot-twists than _Wild Things (1998)_ (qv). I would go so far and call them insane plot-twists. Not that they aren't plausible, they just change the plot like you would never guess. I dare you: guess the ending... Okay, you might guess correctly 1 plot-twist ahead, but I swear that'll be it!This is indeed a movie for the smart audience...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie two days ago and still can't stop smiling about it. This is a stunning film which excels on all of the many levels it works on. It gains the momentum of a suspense thriller, while also being a mystery, a very beautiful love story, a drama of emotion and deception, and a study of obsession. It also may be the sexiest movie ever made. Monica Bellucci is simply beautiful, and enchants the eyes in every scene she is in. The elegant and frequently tricksy camera work is never done just for the sake of it. Everything reinforces the film's themes and intentions. This is a movie supremely confident and thoroughly fulfilling its objectives. The character of Max is especially well observed, since he is not classically handsome, but charming, with a wonderfully expressive face. Watch for the delicious moment where he flirts on the telephone with Alice before he has met her! His friend is also spot on as a wry, detached and apathetic man who learns about love the hard way. Reflecting the drama through the production of A Midsummer Night's Dream was a lovely touch and the conundrum plot never gets confusing because of the simple but perfect devices of differing hairstyles to assist the viewer. It's seeing a film like this that reminds you why you first fell in love with cinema. And it reassures you you are never too old for a film to affect you like that, and that there is always another great one waiting to be discovered.</fullReview>

As I've only seen about twenty French films, I can't say whether they are prominent characteristics in French films in general or just this genre.The film's comments on the whimsical nature of love and the constant, almost vaudevillian near-misses where the characters come within echo the shenanigans that go on in Amelie when she's trying to chase down Nino.I don't know why I'm babbling on about this anyway, it's pretty irrelevant. The point is, that The Apartment fulfilled everything that I want in a film. Great directing (although the time-jumping might bother some people), acting and an overall tone very similar top Amelie, which I thought was fantastic.I also liked the obvious 'play within a play' scenario. While on the stage, Alice was playing out Helena's role in A Midsummer Night's Dream, almost exactly the same situation was finding it's own course around her.See it if you can.

		<shortDescription>The Best French Romantic Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film again, I believe for the sixth time. I will doubtless see it many more times. This is one of the most brilliant French films ever made. Although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director, Gilles Mimouni. For ten years he has not made another film, and this was his only one. The story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect, and it is clearly paying homage continually to both Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The split-second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on Keaton in 'Steamboat Bill Junior', and he is only not killed by inches. In this film, people stoop and turn and pass one another unawares, and if they had been one second off, they would have collided. The storyline thus walks a tightrope of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond, or you will miss something crucial. The haunting, albeit intentionally repetitive, music by Peter Chase is reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and the whole film has the same eerie quality, but whereas Hitchcock had one woman be two women, Mimouni has two women be one woman, thereby inverting the plot structure. There are passing references to other Hitchcock films, but it is 'Vertigo' which is central to the inspiration of this film. The theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love, but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. Everything is hyper-charged with passionate love and desire, but the desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object. That is why it is so easily transferable from Lisa to Alice, when it is realised that it is Alice who is more mysterious than Lisa, and it is Alice who truly embodies the Eternal Mystery. The film is ultimately 'made' by Romane Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she outshines Monica Bellucci, which is really something to pull off, considering that Bellucci is a knockout beauty, whereas Bohringer is what the English call 'plain'. However, Romane Bohringer had even at this early date more than mastered the art of 'personality dominance', whereby beautiful girls fall by the wayside and don't get noticed because Romane is being so fascinating you can't take your eyes off her long enough even to look at the beautiful girls, and you end up only thinking of her. Most of us remember, I'm sure, her father Richard Bohringer lying in a bathtub listening to opera in the film 'Diva' many years ago. I would rather watch Romane than Richard lying in a bathtub, but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating, because Richard Bohringer is spellbinding too, and he isn't even a woman. Romane looks as if she may turn into Anna Magnani when she is much older, and that means she will get an Oscar, if someone can only write another 'Rose Tattoo' for her. The girl has so much passion inside her, she could set the Seine on fire. Wouldn't it be wonderful if she and Julie Delpy teamed up? This film made wonderful use of Paris locations. But where is this 'square in the Luxembourg'? It looked like Place Furstenburg to me. Maybe I missed something. I must watch the film another six times, just to study the precision of the timing and who brushes past whom, and make sure I've got it right. The whole thing is like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games played blindfolded by a grandmaster. How thrilling it all is! Romane, you can look through my window anytime! Mimouni, come on over, let's discuss impossibilities, unlikelihoods, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is going on that is invisible and how it effects the visible. And once again, we have here the spirit of Breton's novel 'Nadja' embodied in a great French work of art. More! More! More!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I didn't see that coming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So here's a bit of background on how I came to see this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French film, that was then remade (quelle surprise) by Hollywood as Wicker Park. Well I avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released, simply because, a) I knew it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park, and living in Chicago, I didn't see why they called it that - it was filmed in fricking Canada for a start! - b) I have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes, done purely because Hollywood thinks we're too bone idle to read a few subtitles (I am dreading the remake of Infernal Affairs by the way) and c) I can't stand Josh Hartnett, 'nuff said there. However, I came across WP on TV the other day, probably about half an hour in, and I have to say initially, it made no sense at all, until about half an hour from the end, when it started coming together. By the end, I was really surprised to find myself really into it, and then the ending just seemed so good - a perfect combination of story, passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices I've ever seen (heard??).Since then I've heard a lot about the L'Appartement vs. Wicker Park argument and looking at WP, I still say it has bugger all to do with Chicago, but there seemed something about it that I liked, so when it was on again, I watched it again - unfortunately, still missing the first chunk (I've still yet to see it!), and I still thought it was pretty good. Heck, even Josh Hartnett seemed good! But I was curious about L'Appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So I waited and waited to catch l'Appartement somewhere somehow. Netflix let me down, so I ended up getting a copy from some website in Ireland. And I've just watched it. It's really kind of weird, but a good weird. A classic French film. Great acting, Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she acts Monica Bellucci off the screen in every scene. Vincent Cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works. And I've seen Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in a lot of movies and I just love him - the scene where Alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his puppy's been run over was excruciating! But, I can honestly say, having seen WP and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy (as about 75% of the rest of the movie had been - maybe in a different order, but come on, the scene with the coffee in the glasses?? Word for word!!), you can imagine my surprise when I watched the ending of L'Appartement!! I can literally say I was blown away - hmm, a bit like poor old Lucien was through the cafe window really! So, be prepared, if you've seen Wicker Park and you fancy taking a look at the original like I did, do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie, because you'll either be disappointed, or exhilarated at a piece of French movie history - a prime example of how you can watch a movie, think you're going to watch a pithy happy ending, and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end. Definitely catch this movie. Oh and while you're at, maybe not too near the same time, but down the road, take a look at Wicker Park, it'll surprise you too.</fullReview>

The cinematography is beautiful and the design of the actual apartment is mesmerising. The screen play never talks down to its audience and really makes you think you through plot developments and to question the logic of events. There are many jumps in time which are thankfully made easy to pick by the use of, what appears to be older film stock, or over exposed lighting. (I'm not sure which technique)You see the anguish, vulnerability, stupidity and humour in Vincent Cassells's character in every scene. Romane Bohringer gives an equally perspicacious performance.

It sounds like a good premise for a French comedy but this one is serious - except that it's laughably bad. The plot is so convoluted, with repeated flashbacks and events unfolding from multiple points of view, that it becomes tiresome keeping track of who's doing what to whom in which time frame. The script, direction, and editing are so sloppy that it's not surprising that this is writer-director Mimouni's only film. The ending is ludicrous. About the only reason for sitting through this turkey is Bellucci, although she isn't given much screen time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved everything in this film, the colors, the acting, the camera work, the script, the flat (I want a flat like that!!)... Vincent Cassel is, as always, superb and Romane was a surprise to me. The script is very well written. Lots of twists, funny situations, a chain of events in a spiral that hooked me in completely. I loved how destiny didn't let them be together, how they were so close and yet never met. Isn't life sometimes this strange? And his confusion. How to choose? I mean, we all experience that, some times in our lives, it's not easy once we get involved to just leave it behind... The camera work is at times brilliant and the colors are just perfect! I can't believe how this is the only film directed by Gilles Mimouni... Nic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless tale where Shakespeare meets Hitchcock ... in Paris!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie by chance as a friend of mine who lives in Paris recommended as a way to see Paris in a different way. And I got much more than that! Precise direction, great acting, and carefully engineered storytelling with the charming but non-touristic Paris as background.Without giving too much up, you will need to watch this movie when you are in the right mood for it. In a dark room, paying attention to the details. I was surprised how I got hooked by the story, which is a combination of "Midsummer Night's Dream", "Rear Window", and 1940's noir movies (North by Northwest for example), but in a colorful palette.Brillian start of careers for Cassel and the young French actress Romane Bohringer (who plays Alice). Belucci, despite not being a powerful actress, steals every scene she is on even when she does not say a word.Finally, I felt something that I had not felt in a while with movies: to be in the shoes of the character - and this is because of the sublime direction, without weird techniques and slowly building the climax everyone starts anticipating since the middle of the movie...But until you get there you will need to go through some not-so-predictable twists until you are back to reality. That much more than overcomes small holes in the plot that I consciously chose to ignore.Enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic movie with depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting movies that I have ever seen. I experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as I was gunning for the two leads to reunite. That never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end. But the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. It is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people. As of now I haven't rewatched the movie and I don't think I will.The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is engaged to be married to Muriel. He remembers his old girlfriend Lisa(he considers this the love of his life) as he listens, by accident, to Lisa talking on the telephone. Thus he tries to find Lisa. Here starts his extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many layers to this movie. There are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. There is also another character called Alice who is involved in the whole confusion. The movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways. It is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner. It has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience. The main character, Max, has shades of grey and I felt the ending was perfect. I don't think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with Alice.The character of Alice is even worse. Her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers(that is the point, I guess). The scene where she breaks down in front of Lucien really shows another facet of her character. It shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life. In the end, she understands that she needs to get away from it all. The ending lends a cynical touch. Because it seems as if Max's love for Alice is temporary and fake. It is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option(i.e Muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting(i.e Lisa or Alice). In many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance(in a way).The performances deserve high praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives a great performance. He perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement. His geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly. But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice. Her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max. The scene where she screams "I am a nutcase too" really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her.Btw I also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie. Alice's actions can be explained in many ways. And her unreasonable obsession with Lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It may be far-fetched considering she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. She also avoids questions from Lisa regarding a boyfriend. She spends a whole lot of time with Lisa and she is happy during that time. That may lead many to question her sexual orientation.Overall I would give it a 9/10. I think it deserves it but I subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor. I think it is a perfect movie otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toujours Le Vent, le Tourbillon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>L Appartement sways me like the wind. In fact, it sweeps me off my feet like le tourbillon; a passionate whirlwind. Since I first watched this film in 2000, I had always treasured it. It is the first French film I've envisioned as having genuinely captured my full adoration. Perhaps I can't speak of this film objectively nor want to review it as i would other films, as it holds a certain nostalgic bearing for me- scenes which stir up many memories in me. The film is not perfect, but it holds a special meaning for me. I had always claimed to admire French films but this one whilst being clever and intelligent with the fragmented plot and device twists, was the film that made me really concede that only the French could paint beauty, even in film, so propitiously. To anyone else the film might be opulently pretentious in its vanity, lauding a surfeit of winsome stylistics, and perhaps bound by the malady of having too many plot complications. But for me, the lure of that excessive indulgence and obsession was what moved me. I was captivated by the film's raw beauty- cinematography, Parisian splendour, the mise en scene, and of course the gorgeous cast of Vince Cassel and Monica Bellucci- the epitome of elegant perfection. I am moved by the film's beauty and am not ashamed to admit my infatuation with it, and even in its pretentious obsession with this superficial vanity, I still feel that it is done in too immaculate a manner. c'est doux un vent d'amour, it sweeps me off my feet every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame about the flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well done the IMDB reviewer who noted the play-within-a-play references to A Midsummer Night's Dream. It is only one of this hyper-elegant picture's many internal workings. At first viewing, I was bewitched by the overall calibre of mise-en-scene, and astonished that Hollywood had not instantly produced a clone. Perhaps the producers have not allowed it. Does anyone know? The central plot revelation, half-way through the film, is as delightful as that of The Sixth Sense, which is rating it highly in cinematic magic. (Spoiler) I didn't care how the girls afforded the flat, any more than how Max could afford not to go to Japan. But I was disturbed when it was casually torched---along with the leading lady. On reflection, however, you realise she had to go, as punishment for sleeping with the wicked Daniel and, ultimately, for letting Max down in the first place. In contrast to a couple of other IMDB reviewers (surprisingly few of them in all, by the way), I thoroughly enjoyed the spiralling complication of the ending, with its deliciously ambiguous fade-out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Commentary Of Today's Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot. The film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor's innermost feeling. Max, who has lived in New York for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there, comes back to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend. Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well. The three women Max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations. His fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see. She gives him also no love but only stability. True love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex-girlfriend. Merely a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable. The one who really animates Max's life in fact is her best friend. The equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because Max has understand much more about his innermost feeling. The nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated. Not equally ingenious as "Pulp Fiction" but things seem much more natural in "The Apartment". Max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to Romane Bohringer. The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful. A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing. </fullReview>

Utterly lacking coherence or tension, it dawdles aimlessly between mystery and 'comedy' without ever achieving either. Scenes are choppy, dialogue is stilted and flashbacks are particularly irritating, denoted as they are by giving the lead actor a laughable haircut. However, he is unlikeable in any timeframe or tonsure. Quite apart from the dire content, the film looks as though it's been shot on tape by a bunch of refugees from a Human League video.

		<fullReview>Naivety can be touching or naivety can be exasperating. Here it simply ebbs and flows between dully and dumbly exasperating.I almost watch it till the end but I could stand it no longer at 93 minutes out of 111. Not that it became worse but it didn't improve, it went on mechanically unreeling its protracted plot and I was no longer expecting it to have something looking like an end. Or worse if possible: I was fearing some kind of an über-melodramatically-tragic ending (please don't tell me, I don't give a damn). Grumf! it's not often that I'm so bored that I dare be impolite enough to leave before the end.Simply put: the director is really really bad, hence performances are always bordering pathetic. The plot structure is... (well I'm not sure somebody understood plot structure on this production) loose thus lousy. We first come to learn the setup through a series of flashbacks which only dilute the exposition over more than 30 minutes (you're speaking of an ordeal!) when nothing moves forward. So we know everything through Max's POV, which is nothing compare to what happens when the director switches (by mistake I guess) to another POV where we know exactly what happens. And the director still thinks he's clever, unveiling new bits and parts of his beloved flashbacks that fill in the blanks. I heard of a director dubbed the master of suspense; please meet the master of procrastination.At least there's one good thing in this overblown mess: art direction and location scouting in Paris are great.(note to self: never buy a DVD for 3 bucks again)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playboys, manipulative women, and foolish baits - how much is real in a game of relationship?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a clever story about relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the game of relationships: playboys (Max), manipulative women (Alice) and the fools who may be indeed in love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien).Max and Alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters but who are always in control in the game leaving their partners around in the dark. But as the profusely discussed ending tells us, as veteran players as Max and Alice were, they would be happy to part ways anytime they see fit as if the game was just announced to be over and each one of them could not care less to get on with his or her own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented itself. Lisa, Muriel and Lucien might be the ones who felt like investing something real in a relationship, only not being able to realise that they were the baits in the game and the ultimate losers (as far as what we were shown is concerned....who knows if they are also advance players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us on screen).This is a very fast-paced, delicately crafted and seductively witty story with an enticing execution by the cast. It also deserves some deeper thinking: how much is real in a game of relationship?</fullReview>

However with that said, I was really disappointed in l'apartment's ending. In my opinion the ending didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and it basically destroyed the story that was being told.You spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the final 2 minutes of the movie would have impacted majorly on everyones character but the movie ends and leaves it all too wide open.Overall though this movie was very well made, and unlike similar movies such as Serendipity all the scenes were believable and didn't go over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analytical, also from entertainment perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I analysed this film with regards to the following; genre, mise-en scene and montage. The genre I believe is a mixture of suspense/mystery/romance. It uses so many narratives through internal repetition that it could be described as being all of these. The way in which Mimouni has shot the film is the mark of a genius. The film is reconstructed from its simple paradigm into a complex syntagm. And it done so that the audience is thoroughly engaged and entertained by the events as they unfold.Mimouni has used the locations of the character's haunts as a tool for unravelling the story. There are certain things, particularly Muriel's mirror, which initially are satellites but eventually become kernels in their own right. There are many examples of this throughout the story. Another aspect of L'Appartement is Mimouni's use of Hitchcock techniques as seen in Vertigo and the Rear Window. An example of this is evident throughout the film as Muriel/Lisa stalks Max.The montage is essentially the story. From repetition and the mimetic analepsis of the long/short hair of Max/Alice and Muriel the story itself transforms. It combines to form a superb example of film technique and semiotics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Convoluted Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>L'Appartement is a French film that stars Vincent Cassel, Monica Bellucci and Romane Bohringer.It was directed by Gilles Mimouni.The movie follows the romantic obsession of Max (Cassel), a young corporate hotshot who leaves his successful new world behind to search for his elusive lost love Lisa (Bellucci). His mad quest begins after he accidentally overhears Lisa's melodic voice speaking in the phone booth next door. But before he knows it she is gone. Still, he is so elated that he abandons his plans, lies to his fiancée, and after leaving his luggage with his pal Lucien, sets off to find her. The hunt leads to a fabulous apartment, where he saves a girl from a suicide thinking that she is Lisa. But this girl, Alice is as drab and mousy as Max's Lisa is beautifully feline. Max becomes involved with Alice, unaware that she also dates Lucien. Meanwhile the real Lisa attempts to break free from her obsessive rich lover who may have murdered his wife. For this reason, she continues to avoid her apartment, which she has generously loaned to Alice. When these characters collide, the stage is set for a tragic denouement.The Apartment is more intriguing in terms of its technical attributes than anything else. The convoluted plot ensures that the viewer is kept at arm's length throughout the film and although everything comes together fairly well in the third act, the overly deliberate pace and seemingly aimless vibe make it difficult to actually care once that happens. That being said, there's no denying the effectiveness of the performances and the film does seem as though it'd improve on repeat viewings - yet in terms of its ability to make any kind of emotional impact on the viewer.</fullReview>

I don't agree with some other critics that it is pretentious because it is very original, well-made and arty. But without wanting to spoil it, the plot is deeply unsatisfying. I feel compelled to write this review because you have to be warned that just because 8000 people rate this as 7.5 it doesn't mean you will like it.

		<shortDescription>Slick film but confusing flashbacks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where Max is choosing a ring in a jeweller's shop. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's "A Mid-summer Night's Dream" in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's girl-friends. Here Max and Lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. On top of the merry mix-up, Max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago. And because Max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another,too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film , I wasn't quite sure if I was in the present or the past.There is much running down corridors, stairways, through doorways, into elevators etc. I accept all that in a fast-paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other? After four collisions it ceases to have any impact, if you'll excuse the pun. High marks for art design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor, but I do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in Paris. Saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when Max almost exits at the same time. However a kiss or two soon makes him feel better. If you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks, you'll finally find yourself at the airport where Max's devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss. It can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love, like Puck in a "Mid-summer Night's Dream".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The badness of real estate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An uneasy, probably lightheaded young man, portrayed with the right anxious anchoring for us viewers by Vincent Cassel, has a chance encounter with the voice of his great love that abandoned him mysteriously two years ago; I say his voice because he overhears a conversation and then just sees his love from the behind running away. He has the good luck of finding her hotel room keys and embarks on the dangerous, mysterious journey of discovery interspersed with the flashbacks of his earlier amorous journey with that woman that explains his infatuation, builds up the mystery for us, is not without its whimsical french humor, and shows him as a lightheaded younger version of himself contrasting with his more respectable, as in lawyer, version, which displays no french revolution ponytail.This is a hard cocktail to pull through. The writer/director makes this half of the story a Hitchcockian pot-pouri that ranges from Vertigo (as Scotty gets on tracking down Madeleine so Max here follows the car in an almost copy paste manner, and we also have the scene in the flower shop repeated with the same color-range) to Rear Window (the theme of voyeurism) to North by Northwest (the theme of identity, mistaken, searching in a hotel for a ghost of a person), to name what was obvious for me.Then the film shifts gears into a different cinematic spectrum. What does an apartment have? Well, it has a tenant - and that is the synopsis of the film: from building up a hitchcockian mystery it delivers us to the grotesquerie of Polanski's half-psychological tales. That for me is unworkable; except for Repulsion, that is mainly for Deneuve's performance, I do not care much for Polanski's oeuvre: there is always something rancidly overworked in his films - so, when you pass form Hitchcock's imperturbable style to something self-conscious, this brings the house down. Even if Belucci's beauty lures us or we find her acting puffy and with a distant core, she still has underdeveloped her star radiance for her to truly matter; even if Cassell plays his antics with more insight maybe than the film allows and his comedy is spot-on and intuitive and makes one certain this works as a comedy only, even if it is close to a delirious, masochistic conception of cinema as joke on the director's part, it is mainly that shift in tone that makes the film flop and exposes its weaknesses: as a thriller it has too many improbabilities; as a comedy (watch how the music in the film works towards that direction: the opening credits are more pop and pun than a thriller would allow as the delicious, and one fears consciously cheesy and sarcastic repetition of Aznavour) has a too serious structure; it works best when one conceives it as rancid commentary on French connection, to put it that way. (It has the same analogous relation watermarked de Palma has with watermarked Rorty in the States around that time masking aversion to theory as pragmatism once more; as in France with the "nouveau philosophes" and their awkward rediscovery of Kantianism, the way the nineties rediscovered noir with neo-bourgeois results.)It may be interesting to see what the director/writer did as producer with the American remake of the film, but then again it may not be that interesting.PS Bohringer gives an almost powerhouse performance, but is constantly at odds with the film. This could have been superb, if one could be persuaded that she is elusive as any version of noir allows, the way the scenario handles her nevertheless makes her presence in the end irrelevant, which is all the more pitiful, irrelevant as a bad parable for french social security, I am tempted to say. As in the meantime I have discovered, Romane was named after Roman Polanski! Now tell me this has nothing to do with the film; it is as if Mimouni wanted to revive the french genre of roman (pun obliged!) a clef in cinematic terms, which turns him into a mad prankster, and explains the enigma of his hapax cinematic endeavor in a most unfavorable light.</fullReview>

The one who really animates Max's life in fact is her best friend. The equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because Max has understand much more about his innermost feeling. The nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated. Not equally ingenious as "Pulp Fiction" but things seem much more natural in "The Apartment". Max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to Romane Bohringer. The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful. A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.==Monica Bellucci is still so pretty especially in IRREVERSIBLE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good story marred by miscasting, none more so than Vincent Cassell as Max, around whom the plot swirls. The fact is that Cassell just can't cut it as a romantic lead, his natural habitat is the slasher movie. Like Robert Ryan and Richard Widmark, both apparently born with a built-in sneer, Cassell LOOKS vicious and not the kind of guy you'd want to encounter in the proverbial dark alley. Unlike Ryan and Widmark, consummate actors both and both capable of non-violent roles, Cassell can't even do that, the expression is too mean, the eyes too cold for anything that doesn't involve kicking someone to death. Similarly Monica Bellucci is all chocolate-box beauty a la Manu Beart without Beart's second string, an ability to act (Beart has, in fact, been featured in films such as La Buche and Les Egares where he natural beauty has been played down and she has been allowed to act without distracting the viewer, something inconceivable given Bellucci's acting range of A to about G). With someone like Daniel Auteuil or Andre Dussollier as Max, Audrey Tautou as Lisa and Mathilde Seigner as Alice this would have been a force to reckon with, as it is it just about eclipses the American remake Wicker Park.</fullReview>
