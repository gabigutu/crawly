		<shortDescription>A glimpse of stalking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just come back from seeing what I think is one of the best movies of 2004. I found the story fascinating, the look stylish, and the music haunting."Wicker Park" is a tale of obsession on many levels. It is told partly in flashback, so that you have to piece the events together and figure out how far back the action of the film began -- what is now and what was then. The director uses split-screen techniques that enhance the look and feel of the film, lifting it from the realm of the ordinary to the plane of art. A haunting theme weaves its way through this labyrinth of lies, leading to a satisfying (because inevitable) conclusion.I saw the film with two friends who were of a very different opinion. They found the film "convoluted" and "clichéd". I disagree. It was easy to tell what was flashback and what was here-and-now. But the story is complicated (not convoluted) and does require some sorting out. As for being cliched, I found the film quite the opposite. It could have gone in some trite, hackneyed directions but didn't. And while some people might think the ending is the cliché of all clichés, I thought that, emotionally, it was absolutely right and the only possible way to end the film.I loved "Wicker Park" so much that I would willingly see it again, to get a better sense of how the story is put together, and just for the sheer pleasure of its look and sound. You might say I too am obsessed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An surprisingly good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a lazy Sunday night and the only movies playing were Wicker Park and Super Babies Baby Geniuses 2. Well, I picked the film with a more attractive cast.After about the first thirty minutes of Wicker Park I was laughing because it seemed like this was the most absurd movie I had ever seen. However, as the film progressed the laughter subsided and intrigue ensued. By the last thirty minutes of the film I was hooked. When it was over, I was surprised that a movie that had started out so poorly ended up being one of the better films I have seen in a while.If one sees this film, I recommend he/she be patient. I found the overall experience, despite the bad beginning, to be quite good.4/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard of this film before seeing it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was suspenseful, even "gripping", with a touching and romantic plot. Overall, a movie definitely worth renting.The film begins a bit slowly but picks up very nicely about 30 minutes into it. There are a few twists and turns that will keep your attention. The acting was quite good, albeit with little-known actors except for Josh Hartnett of Blackhawk Down. The best part of this film was the clever way the story all comes together towards the end, including the flashback style which was very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Wicker Park worth your money?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker Park Pretty much keeps you guessing the whole time.When your watching the movie you would think you have it all figured out you'll be surprised how wrong you could be.This is one of the best movies i've watched this year. The most entertaining movie i've watched this year is most definitely this one it actually keeped me guessing up till the end.Even though this is to be a physcological thriller it is also funny here and there and is also kind of sad.With this said Wicker Park is definitely worth your money.This is not really a family movie but it's good and with Josh Hartnett in it even better.Don't wait to long to watch it,you'll like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie was absolutely beautiful in every aspect of the word.the camera-work is extremely well done, and, despite some comments, the plot has no real holes. everything is revealed with perfect timing, and the songs absolutely heighten the emotion of each scene. the characters were eccentric and go to such great lengths for love. i love that. not only do we end up seeing that Alex has motive, we can almost relate to her....although we do not agree with her actions, she becomes more vulnerable and human to the audience.the best thing about this film is the intensity of the love we feel between matthew and lisa. the anguish they have felt the past two years from being unknowingly torn apart by a vindictive and crushed "friend" of lisa's.and the end of the movie is perfect, when they see each other for the first time in two years, after a desperate four day search.....she turns, there is the feeling of disbelief, realization, then they just melt into each other and take it all in. i loved it.this was the first movie i've seen in the theaters in a long time that i came away with SO much more than i had expected. i've recommended this movie to everyone i know, and everyone who's seen it who i know has felt the same way i do....maybe not with as much passion as i do.....but similar.quality, quality film....ahhh, the day it comes out on video, i'll be the first in line to buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exceeded my large expectations. One of the best films of 2004 with my personal Oscar win for Best Actress. It's an extremely compelling and unique mystery thriller with intricate characters and a storyline that could easily become absurd and convoluted but feels natural and McGuigan allows the viewer to be fully aware of what's happening. It never gets too far ahead of the audience but it doesn't drag for a second. The editing is flawless and meshes the present with the not-so-distant past perfectly. Josh Hartnett delivers a surprisingly emotional performance and adds another strong performance to his recent resume that has really transcended him from the horrific heartthrob clique he was placed in when he first came onto the scene into a serious, talented actor. But the real star of the film is the beautiful Rose Byrne who, as always, delivers a knockout performance that is easily one of the best of the decade. She takes this psychopathic character and somehow makes her immensely sympathetic. I actually found myself rooting for her to be with Matt. Simply with her eyes she portrays this wounded, internally saddened character effortlessly. As I always am when seeing her act, I was completely entranced and amazed. A stunning performance in a brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing surprise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie on its face and found myself wanting to watch it again upon its conclusion, which very rarely is true for me. Most movies, including the ones I consider amazing, require the passage of several years before I might entertain the idea of watching them again. This was different, and will perhaps be better understood once you have seen the movie. It's like a puzzle I want to put back together on my own.***SPOILERS*** Part of what I found most wonderful about this movie was that I was able to walk away from it not really considering ANY of the four major characters as "the heavy." Also, some preconceived ideas I had did not come to pass. For example: MATT: Throughout the film you see him balancing his value system against his desires, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, but I got a sense that this guy wanted terribly to do the right things. Matt's going to see the play with Luke just because it mattered so much TO Luke is but one example LISA: Didn't want to like her, didn't want to understand why Matt's feelings for her were as strong as they were. I had believed it would just be a sexual pull she exerted on Matt &amp; this was not the case--I got it.Luke: Played appropriately in places as almost shallow &amp; buffoonish, I still got a sense that this guy was a truly good person &amp; despite his fumbling hipness, he really wanted to be a great friend and to care about someone at a much deeper level than it appeared at first glance. I liked his forgiveness of Matt for having been out of touch for 2 years.ALEX: Her conflict throughout the movie could have played well to her ultimately being labeled a psycho, but I felt great empathy for her (especially toward the end of the movie) at having been caught up in an emotional roller-coaster that drove her decisions throughout the movie. In one of the final scenes where she confesses her sins, so to speak, to Lisa, I felt especially rewarded that she was so much more than just a lunatic--and was, indeed, NOT crazy-- and that the character was an Anybody who could have been caught up on the thorns of an overwhelming desire.Also, I enjoyed the friendship between Matt &amp; Luke and how it remained intact and viable throughout the film. I think Matt's losing touch with Luke for 2 years was also symbolic of his having lost touch with himself.And the final scene between Matt &amp; Lisa was satisfying to me--I REALLY wanted them to find each other again, and the emotional elements of this moment in the characters' lives was depicted beautifully.Finally, what a painfully lovely moment with Rebecca, when Matt is telling her what has happened, and what has been true for him since he thought he'd lost Lisa, when she said (and I'm DEFINITELY paraphrasing),"You want me to...know WHAT? That I'm not the girl who can break your heart?"Haven't we all felt THAT before?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie that works in spite of itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WICKER PARKCast: Josh Hartnett, Rose Byrne, Matthew Lillard, Diane Kruger. Director: Paul McGuinan.***This is a movie that works in spite of itself. It was marketed as a Single White Female type thriller, but it's really more of a somber reflection on obsession. If the main characters had email, the movie would be over before it started, but the character study and emotional investment by the actors overcame the convoluted plot.The movie goes back and forth in the timeline, cutting between present day and two years ago. Two years ago, Matt (Josh Hartnett) fell in love at first sight with Lisa (Diane Kruger), and he would follow her for a while before he had the courage to approach her. In the present, Matt is engaged to be married, but when he thinks he sees Lisa across a crowded room, he loses her, but he skips a business trip to try to track her down.As we watch the two timelines, we're left wondering. Why did Lisa disappear on Matt the first time? When finally does find Lisa, it's a different woman. Have we entered Mulholland Drive territory?Josh Hartnett, whom I can take or leave depending on the movie he's in (I took him in Black Hawk Down, I left him in Hollywood Homicide), brings a real sincerity to his character's inner struggle. Rose Byrne is also really good as the dark-haired Lisa. Matthew Lillard is effective as the wise-acre best-friend, showing subtleties the role of Shaggy would not permit. Diane Kruger, the blond Lisa, is about as forgettable as she was as Helen in Troy.Once it was all over, I'd say a good 25% of the audience was laughing at the plot contrivances, but sometimes a movie can overcome obstacles as basic as its story. Rated PG-13 for sexual situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the most unique films i have seen in quite awhile. I really liked the way it was portrayed. It was a very good storyline, from the previews it almost seemed confusing but it wasn't confusing at all.The scenery was excellent. It was a top notch performance on everyones part. It kept you guessing until you didn't know what to think. It was a thriller, yet had a comedic spark here and there with a twist of romance and a dazzle of drama. It was by far one of the movies that stick out this year that i've seen. Josh Hartnett played his role so well, and the 2 females i wasn't really familiar with their work but they did a fantastic job as well as Mathew Lillard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie on cable yesterday during my traditional "its New Years day and lets watch the worst movies on HBO that you can stand" day. I am a sucker for a bad movie and this one is one of the crappiest movies I can stand -- try watching "the hazing" with Brooke Burke that is currently On Demand on Showtime, I think. I couldn't get through more than 45 minutes of that stinking pile...Anyway, I'm a fan of the original French version of this movie and I wanted to see how crappy we Americans could remake it. It turns out we could do a pretty crappy job! For starters, the original is a much darker tale that is interesting to watch and even more interesting in its ending. Wicker park removed the elements that made the original movie work: a faked suicide, love lost NEVER rekindled, love destroyed, love broken. Do you catch it??? This was a tragedy in the Greek sense and thats why it was fantastic. It had its balls ripped off in the American version.This movie is a distinctly French movie, too. Its creepy (in a bad way) when Josh Harnett breaks into a woman's apartment. Its creepy (in a "whats happening next way) when Vincent Cassel does it. It's out of place when Diane Kruger climbs out of her window to break up with her boyfriend into her neighbors and seems dysfunctional. I question the type of men she dates when this happens and wonder whether or not Harnett would slice her up like in "Boxing Helena" if she hadn't got away when traveling to Europe. When Monica Bellucci pulls this same move in the original, I think to myself "this girl is tough!" This movie works in France because the French, god bless them, can do these things without looking psychotic. In fact, I think some of this drama is expected in their relationships.And I don't mean to nit pick, but there are many Air France offices in France because it's the state run airline! Those commies have to go stand in line to buy a ticket... but here in the US, who has even heard of an American Airlines office?! Let alone actually going to purchase a plane ticket at one! No one because they don't exist! And if they do, as an American you are an idiot if you stand in line at one of them. Book online at Orbitz or show up at the airport! The only way this movie could have work "as is" if it was a soft-core porn. It was low budget and had that feel to it. Plus, all the scenes would have made lots more sense if there was more skin. Watch "the First 9 1/2 Weeks" to see what I mean. I saw that many years ago and it was a nonsensical film that had the same feel to it...only in the end you saw some skin. Maybe I could have handled it if this was the case. However, if you looking for some payload like this, you will be sorely disappointed.If, instead, you are looking for your thesis on the difference between French and American film, then this movie along with "L Appartement" is a requisite. We take real film and turn it into castrato.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>grave violation of the original version L'appartement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i rented Wicker Park (WP) because of Harnette was in it, i didn't know that it was the remake of my most favorite french film, L'appartement which stars Monica Belucci and her husband, Vincent Cassel.Since the opening dialog, WP brings the spirit of L'appartement with it, so I cannot help comparing the two versions. For those who have not seen the original version would probably think that WP is so original on the story and performance. But it is far from original.I got so disappointed as i watched further, when I see see the actors in WP do not play as good as the original version. Matthew was supposed to be extremely sad when Lisa the mysterious girl left him, and he was supposed to be very curious when he finds out that Lisa is only a phone booth away. But Harnett fails to do so.And in this case Diane Krueger doesn't have the mysterious personality, smile nor face that could make Matt wonders where she had gone to for the past 2 years, while Monica Belucci's acting was definitely up the film.Something is missing in this film, and the actors seems like they don't understand about the plot either. And I think is WP took out the most important thing of the story which is about Matthew's attraction to the fake Lisa a.k.a Alex. In WP, it seems that Alex was the one who seduces Matthew, and that Matthew was forced to attracted to her in the first place. And since WP eliminates most of the substantial details from the movie, (such as the diary which Alex wrote that explains her actions, Lisa-Alex's friendship, and the suspense of Lisa's rich boy friend Danniel) it successfully turns WP into a puzzling unworthy romantic film with Hollywood ending. Especially when Matthew dumps Rebecca on the airport. Like it is so easy to tell your girl friend, that you have been not yourself for the past 2 years.I suggest to watch the original version first. But then it would probably blow you away and makes you don't even want to watch any future remakes of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Romantic Thriller ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have watched this film numerous times and it just keeps getting better every time. Have never seen L'Apartment but it must be some film if it's anything like this. I must say that you don't get this kind of film made very often and frankly this film has changed my life. The soundtrack suits the action brilliantly and who ever worked on the score deserves some major credit. Before I thought Josh Hartnett was as wooden as affleck and other such actors but he show here how good he can be, but Rose Byrne really made the film and I don't know where she's from or what she did before but she buts on one of the performances of the decade in this film. In conclusion this film is brilliant and anyone who says otherwise just didn't get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wicker Park: Wicked Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have any expectations about this movie before it started. In the beginning it seemed like an ordinary movie to me, a little boring even. Just another love story. But then I got confused because of the scenes following each other like they were put in a random order. After about an hour and a half I regained my grip on the story. That was the moment I started liking the movie, because (I assumed) I understood and wanted it to end happily.This movie reminded me of Hitchcock's "Vertigo", because of the confusing sequence of scenes. Also "He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not" popped into my head, when after the first hour and a half things were clarified by, paradoxically, putting scenes even more out of chronological order. The last movie I had to think of was "Vanilla Sky", with its similar confusion about two different girls.In my opinion, the confusion and clarifying of the narrative makes this a surreal but satisfying movie. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Wicker Park twice....you'll see a whole other element.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the clever editing and imaginative photography within this film very enticing. When I first watched Wicker Park, I was taken by the twists and turn of the plot and the characters' journey throughout the film.However , on second viewing I started to appreciate the cleverness of the way the reflections,lighting,and editing really tell their own stories within the plot of the film. There are cinematic clues all throughout this film which really aren't apparent on the first viewing , primarily because they become obvious only after you know the plot.Also the special features with the audio commentary available on DVD are really worth looking at. The director has some unique viewpoints about the Wicker Park story that I found interesting.Absolutely loved Josh Hartnett in this film. He portrayed the whole aspect of maturing into a man versus a boy intelligently and I was genuinely moved by the longing and nostalgia he managed to convey.I think this movie has been seriously underrated in general and deserves to be appreciated as a really quite artistic, clever piece of cinema.Was very disappointed that here in Australia "Wicker Park" was released as DVD only. Would have loved to view this on the big screen..the lighting is second to none.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inferior Version of a Much Better French Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just completed viewing The Apartment (L'Appartement) and Wicker Park back-to-back on the same day and conclude that the original film is almost two times better. I rated The Apartment a nine, while Wicker Park earned a 5 in my ratings.I watch a lot of films, but don't consider myself a film snob. I don't believe that all film must be high art or CINEMA--plain old movies suit me just fine. I will watch foreign films but don't think that they are the be-all and end-all of movies. Some I find to be very boring and pretentious but will watch them nonetheless, hopeful of finding something special and unique. This is how I blundered into The Apartment, based upon the recommendation of another.I like many different genres of film, including what some men disparagingly refer to as chick flicks. I am a sucker for a good love story and have been since boyhood. Like most Americans raised on our Hollywood traditions, I like a happy ending (especially in a love story!). The Apartment does not fully embrace this tradition (Of course real life does. Right?) and there were things about the ending that I would have changed if I could. Soooo...when I learned that Wicker Park was a remake of L'Apppartement I rushed out to get a copy in order that I could compare and contrast the two.What I decided, script concerns aside, this film was miscast. In particular this film's Alex and Matthew are not up to the standards set in the original film. In L'Appartement the two characters (Alice and Max) had great chemistry together (horrors!), almost an equal to the chemistry that existed between the Max character and Lisa. This made for a much more complicated and intense relationship between all of the main characters. I don't get the same sense of obsession and desperation that is a palpable characteristic of the earlier film. I miss it because this provides the level of truth that anyone who has ever been in love is well aware of; Love is hard, crazy and complicated. I find it interesting that in both films the relationship that makes the most sense and is the most logical fares the poorest in the viewer's analysis. Max/Matthew's fiancée should be the clear winner among our choices but garners the least rooting interest. Perhaps we prefer our love wild, crazy and dangerous. Just an observation.This is not a bad film. I enjoyed watching it. However, if you get a chance, rent the L'Appartement and do your own comparison test. I purchased copies of both today, but I know which one I will be viewing most often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning hit with a touch of originality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was one of the best formulated sleeper hits of this year. Finding a happy medium, "Wicker Park" finds a balance between gut wrenching suspense and tension/awkwardness, and one of the most twisted love triangles to hit the silver screen. "Wicker Park" is a love story that elaborates on the crazy insane things we would do for that little taste of heaven on earth...to love, and be loved in return.First, the performances. Josh Hartnett and Rose Byrne. Rose Byrne made this movie what it was. Her obvious...borderline obsessive love for Josh Hartnett, was for once, believable in a film. From start to finish she evolved, created nuances, changed from loving sweetheart to vedictive backstabber and SOLD ME ON HER CHARACTER EVERY SECOND she was on screen. I hope i get to see more of her soon. The creative team. While the script was fantastic, it wasn't the story that was so original. It was the pacing, it was the tension, the emotion brought forth at the times it was brought forth that really made you sure that you were in safe hands investing your time in his script. The Director, while not jumping to any new territory, he embraces his previous works (Gangster No. 1 in particular), and establishes a style that really grows on you throughout the film. This together with the lighting, set decorating, cinematography, there isn't enough i can say about this film. There was one thing that bothered me, but anyone who watches the film will know what it is.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the original french film that was the basis for this movie then please, please, watch that one instead. I wonder what Gilles Mimouni thought of this remake of his 1996 french film, L'Appartement, which starred Monica Belucci and Vincent Cassel. Wicker Park pales in comparison to the original. For some reason, the plot seemed more acceptable in a Paris setting than a Chicago one. And it seemed more believable and intriguing too thanks to the wonderful acting of Belucci and Cassel.Unfortunately, Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger, or even Rose Byrne were no match for their French counterparts. Those who have given this film a rating over 5 most likely have not seen the original. So please see L'Appartement instead.</fullReview>

It will answer all your questions in the end and has some great twists in the story line. The only thing that got to me a little was how sickly Josh Hartnett looked in a few scenes. I thought the characters where good and love the way all four main characters are inter-twined in personal ways with out really knowing about each others involvement. Matthew Lilliard is always fun to watch and I really liked Rose Byrne as Alex. I am seeing more of her in other movies these days,(Troy) and have to say I am becoming a fan. All in all, if you like a movie that makes you have to think, and try and figure out what the heck is going on here? Then Wicker Park is a good movie for you to watch this weekend.</fullReview>

So it is almost putting you into the point of view of the main character, Matt, who is basically oblivious.The ending is one of the best in any film. I'm not normally a sensitive person, but I found myself tearing up. If you bring a female, good things will probably happen.The previews and a quick clip made me think this was some kind of a thriller or something. Then I went and saw it and it was something totally different. I can't even really put it into a genre, except for maybe mystery-romance or something. Simply amazing. This is one of the only must-see movies that I've seen in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>wicker park is such a beautifully crafted movie..it's like an old masterpiece unfold in the modern times but has never lost is classic beauty. the passion is intense and can be felt on every scene, you just feel it as you look closely into the characters that the artist have made themselves of. i love the editing of the movie and how the pictures are arranged to present the plot. it was superb! really amazing! now the movie has made a deep impact on me..i keep reviewing the movie every now and then and will trade anything i do if i have the chance to watch it again. it marks the feeling that love--as we call it, even when lost can still be found and it is the same love that once found--can be lost if it was never meant to be. the more we hold on to it, the more we find ourselves seeking for it and the more we hold it loosely, it haunts us back and all the memories we use to hold on to it. love, in wicker park, is beautiful.and i wanted to truly thank everyone who has come up with the movie and especially the ones responsible for the song, the scientist..it was just the perfect song for the perfect movie. when i grow old and when i want my kids to learn that true love can wait, this would be the perfect movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story but has many plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wicker Park" has the feel of a romantic thriller. The previews make the movie a lot more sensational than it really is. It makes the female protagonist Alex appear like a psycho/stalker/murderer when in effect she is just a more extreme female version of the male protagonist Matt (Josh Hartnett). The plot long story short is about a guy (Matt) who finally catches a glimpse of his lost love Lisa in a restaurant. Two years ago she completely disappears from his life without explanation. She runs out before he has a chance to reunite with her right then and there. Meanwhile Matt is also being chased after by Alex, Lisa's "best friend". The movie parallels how Matt searching around for Lisa is like Alex lying and manipulating in her attempt to steal Matt away from Lisa. Except in the end Lisa returns Matt's affections whereas Matt doesn't not return Alex's feelings. This movie is sweet and nostalgic and that is what covers up all the plot holes. Plothole number one is a shot of Daniel, Lisa's ex standing outside of her apartment watching who he thinks is Lisa (Alex pretending to be Lisa)taking Matt to bed. Someone as jealous as Daniel would later on confront and beat the hell out of Matt but no, this is false foreshadowing as we never ever see Daniel in the film ever again. The second is not so much a plot hole as a criticism. For someone as scheming as Alex how long did she think she could pretend to be Lisa to Matt when she is also seeing Matt's best friend Luke? Obviously eventually they will all meet and Matt will find out the truth. And that is what happens in the film's climatic conclusion. Luke bumps into Matt and finally introduces him to Alex in the same restaurant we started out in the beginning. Everything comes out and Matt sees that Alex screwed her best friend over and pretended to be her in order to steal Matt. The very end is so touching when Matt and the real Lisa finally see each other you could see the pain and longing leaving their eyes as they finally reunite. I would recommend this movie for the touchy-feely emotions it will leave you with but be warned like I said its not perfect with all it plot holes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Square: The Best Film About True Love. Gorgeous And Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When your mind becomes obsessed with anything, you filter everything else out and find that thing everywhere." © Pi (1998)The film is perfect! This is the most exciting film about love. I am ashamed that I had looked so late. I love detective stories. And when they are still developing on the basis of relations - is priceless. The entire film keeps you on your toes. Much credit for this soundtrack. Not often the music in the film bounces in memory, but here is stored everything from introductory Stereophonics - Maybe Tomorrow and ending Coldplay - The Scientist. It is very interesting how the film was shot. We see the fragments of memories, first one character, then another, and all this combined with no less interesting picture of the present. I recommended to fans for original romantic stories.Today it is my favorite movie about love. Writing about it is difficult, even more so that I may be a little naive, but I think it perfect.In the first place - because of the swirling extraordinary story, which was interesting to watch, interesting to guess the riddle that.Second - because of the divinely beautiful and talented Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger, who, in my opinion, constituted one of the most harmonious couple in movie history.Third - because of the wonderful game Rose Byrne, who, despite all the twists and turns of the plot, too, makes us to some extent empathize and sympathize her.Fourth - because of the unique atmosphere, woven from the soundtrack, great camera work and the overall style of the film.Well, in the fifth - because of the extraordinary passionate love story.This is film you want to watch again and again. First, to clarify for all the details of what is happening, to place on the scene, which are scattered throughout the film. And then - just to enjoy the atmosphere, the beauty of the people, music, staff .. I'm doing punctually last 2 years.Josh Hartnett as always great! These movies just for him. The love story twisted abruptly than Shakespeare. At first there was nothing clear and even a little boring. However, lethargy soon gave way to a thirst to know what will happen next. And then to open all new and new details, fueling interest. And most importantly, to me personally, this film shows is absolutely not predictable. I usually guess how the story will turn on, but not in this case.What could be more dangerous love triangle? It destroys lives and fate of three people and rarely leads even to something good. Basically a love triangle - it tears and grief, and rarely get a happy ending ... But it turns out, there is a love square...And it is in this square get Matthew, Lisa, Alex and Luke. And to help the main characters out of the situation can only be sincere and deep love, which is good, is present in their hearts, and helps to overcome all the trials which, I must say, oh how is not easy! I immerse yourself in such a tremendous atmosphere of love and loss, happiness and suffering.Wicker Park - it is an obsession - a movie about intrigue. Alex begins to intrigue right from the start. She has done everything so clearly and correctly that the viewer who saw the situation in the first part of the film through the eyes of Matthew understands that he simply does not have a chance of a happy ending, but Matt does not give up, that does him honor. The viewer thinks that this obsession of love will not to anything good, it will all end very sad, perhaps he would go mad from the senses, but no! It due to his quest Matt and Lisa are reunited, and two hearts, get all what so long dreamed of.I'm not really a professional to judge the acting and the work of the director. I just like the film. For ingenious plot and casting! The film with mysteries and unexpected responses in its atmosphere. But Wicker Park, for me, definitely deserves a higher valuation! A great movie. Wonderful acting. The plot makes frantically to think what will happen in the end. After watching the aftertaste remains, the thoughts that do not come out of your head. This is the most remarkable. Thank all for this masterpiece!I watched the movie several times, and each of my view ends in tears. These are tears of happiness and charm. Great movie, good acting and strong plot - nothing disappointed. I can confidently say that he is one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Write To Defend!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this review not only to tell people how I feel about "Wicker Park", but to also defend it. But I'll get to my last bit later. I MUST warn you, this next paragraph contains spoilers:Wicker Park is about a man named Matthew (Josh Harnett) who is in love with this dancer name Lisa (Diane Kruger). After a while of stalking her, she finally gives him a chance. There both boyfriend and girlfriend until one day, Lisa all the sudden, just disappears. It's been two years later and something happens (it's too long to explain) and he feels he has found her again. Just when he feels he is getting closer, he meets another who claims to be the "Lisa who lives at the apartment". Later on you find out not only was she lying, but she is an actress name Alex (Rose Byrne) who is going out with Matthew's best friend Luke (Matthew Lillard)Personally, I really like this film. I saw it at a Drive In and boy was I glad to see it. I really thought it was fascinating that one man is obsessed with a woman, while another woman is obsessed with him altogether. What really tick me off are the people on here dissing the film because it was a "remake". So what? Just because Wicker Park is a remake from a foreign film, doesn't mean Hollywood CAN'T pull it off. Some people refuse to see it!!!!! Some people don't even know what there talking about. The worse part to me is the original hasn't even come out in America in 9 years!!!!! Come on guys, are we hated that much? I see it as this: When the original comes out in America and/or I get to see it, maybe I can make a determination, but until that day comes, Wicker Park is one HELL of a film!My grade for this film is as it was when I first saw it:10/10Bottom Line: This Park Is Worth Taking A Stroll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 out of 10Wicker Park was definitely enjoyable for me. The main reason being that I felt the pain of Hartnett's character and the joy at the end was so beautiful. Although I don't ever hope this happens to me.I thought Diane Kruger gave a mild performance. I wasn't sold of her love. But Rose Byne did a splendid job. She sold me easily as the crazy-emotionally-wrecked character. Because of this I definitely will go out of my way to see L'Apartment. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that shows how cruel love can be, but at the same time how wonderful love can be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It reminded me a bit of "Lost in Translation" or "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind": quiet, enjoyable, romantic, intelligent, one of those films that keeps you thinking for some time after having left the theater. I liked Josh Hartnett's shy performance of a guy helplessly in love with a girl and even Diane Krueger was okay, since she actually had to play and not just display her beautiful face on a huge screen as she had to do in "Troy". Matthew Lillard in particular is honest fun to watch as he plays his character with such light wholeheartedness and so obviously enjoying himself, it really is a rare pleasure (since he often tends to lapse into behaving like a goof ball). If you look for something entertaining on a higher level, maybe on a cold Winter's evening, that's your movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I admit it. I went to see Josh Harnett be very sexy in Wicker Park. There weren't really good trailers or indications that Wicker Park would be such a sleeper hit. It didn't really do well in the theaters (where I saw it), but it was a movie I feel you shouldn't miss.The movie was very well paced. There's a lot going on and the slow slow quick quick action really made it wonderful to see how life really happens. There's many near misses in life as well as chance meetings which shape our perceptions. Wicker Park is a beautiful testament to that ideal.So if you like movies that really capture the true essence of life, see Wicker Park. If you like to discuss movies for days with a group of friends, see Wicker Park. If you like movies that really make you think, see Wicker Park.There's nothing flashy about Wicker Park. But it's simple elegance is very refreshing. And yes, you will be pleasantly surprised at the way the story unfolds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most excellent romantic movie I experienced in a long time. The unpredictable plot, witch controls the audience 100% and gives in one step at a time, together with the (in) credible acting produces an extraordinary feeling. This movie paints a perfect illustration of how different people can react when they are apart from true love. Matthew's (Josh Harnett) quote ?When you see something from afar, you develop a fantasy. But when you see it up close, 9 times out of 10, you wish you hadn't." is as true as anyone will like to admit. If you liked "Love actually" you will almost certainly like Wicker Park. I gave it 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent story-telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read any comments before posting this.I saw it last night with my wife and I liked it a lot and she didn't like it much. It's kind of unbelievable in parts -- you keep thinking: he has a CELL PHONE!But: "willing suspension of disbelief" and all that -- I sat back and enjoyed the characters, who were fun and interesting, especially "Shaggy," who really brings the movie back into contact with real life when it threatens to escape -- his part in the final scene in Bellucci's when Alex and Matt finally meet is just delicious. And I enjoyed the plot, which keeps developing -- one of those films where people in the audience are talking to the character on the screen (Alex, in this case): "You *lyin'* b****!"What I liked most was the story-telling: the place of Wicker Park really exists in my mind now, with so many associations, going back to their first date -- you know it's their spot, and you know why. The story is revealed in a way that's maddening for a while -- why don't they show us the woman's face as she makes her way around the apartment?! -- but at the end you understand why, and it's very satisfying. What I keep thinking as I think back on the movie is how much like writing it is: I love the split screen and the lack of linearity, which somehow cross the gap between writing and cinema. The way you see a scene and you don't notice something, and then you watch the same scene again, with emphasis on another character, knowing what you now know, and suddenly its import is clear -- that was terrific. Art which is all about the art of making art is bad art, IMV, but art which tells a story and at the same time teaches you something about the making of art is all the better for it. That's how I feel about "Wicker Park."I'm in love with this movie, and can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Matthew is back in town, with a new job and a fiancée. But something is amiss. Matthew had a bad break-up a couple of years ago, and suddenly he thinks he catches a glimpse of his then girlfriend. Feelings hidden and forgotten break through again, and Matthew once again gets caught in the obsession that first led him to meet his lost love. He lies to his fiancée and work, supposedly going to China but staying in town to find the love of his life...Comments: This was a very nice surprise indeed. There were so many levels to like this. What I noticed first is the frequent use and play with mirrors and reflections. Obviously this has a special meaning, I have my theory, but it also gives the movie a special feeling, a special quality. It also highlights the broken up time-line, the use of reflections and memories. And that is another thing that I really liked about the movie. By not telling it in a straightforward way, if that is even possible, it creates a suspense I didn't really realize could fit in a romantic story like this before. Events, causes and reactions are slowly revealed and the puzzle becomes more complete the further along we go as we hears the story from different characters, different points of view. This also give us, the audience, more information than the characters has. Contrary to what one may think, this adds to the suspense, as we can see how close to each other Matthew and Lisa really is, never realizing it. We can also foresee a situation were it will explode, but not when.A different point that I really liked is the meta-story. As the story contains a play, a story, with comments on the story on the screen it also comments and makes the characters reflect upon their situation, without even realizing it.All put together, this movie creates what it set out to do. Emotions. Feelings. It is not hard to identify with all of the four main characters. Even if I don't like their actions I can sympathize with them. I can feel what they feel (I tell myself anyway). And that may be the biggest trick of them all. And that engaged me in the movie - and finally won me over. Totally.In reality a rather simple story, told in a complex way such as life tells them in our own lives. We never have all the information from the beginning. But we might find out. A movie full of secrets, full of emotions and full of suspense. A movie full of reality. A movie that intentionally works on several different levels - all with great skill.This is a movie that I strongly recommend.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of the movie is more than just interesting. You get into the deep trance until the title part and then you realize you have seen something special. This is where two people meet each other and have to deal with the circumstances both because of what they have done in their life and those they have nothing to do with. In my personal humble opinion this is the best role of Josh Hartnett. Once you have seen the movie you will never forget it. And despite the fact it resembles to the French movie "L'Appartement" with Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci, that is far better filmed and it is absolutely out of competition to any sort of the film with the similar plot. The story told here cuts deeply.</fullReview>

It's like a puzzle coming clear with each piece, and we all know how beautiful a solved puzzle is. Josh Hartnett is turning into a PREMIER actor...I felt all of his desperation, hope...happiness. There is nothing more painful than falling out of love, except for losing that one without explanation. The not-knowing and wondering...is devastating. Feeling what the characters feel is exactly what this movie does for you--and that is my mark of a good movie. This was a home run for me. HIGHLY recommended...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm yet to see the French original of this film, Wicker Park has safely secured itself as my favourite film, and is among the best films I've ever seen. I can think of no faults with this film. The acting is convincing and the storyline compelling, and Cliff Martinez's music is perfect for the feel of the film. At its heart, Wicker Park is a love story, but this only adds to how great it is. The plot is just complex enough to enthral the viewer and not confuse them. The soundtrack is also good, and fits the film very well. This is a stylish, modern and ultimately moving film which would leave a smile on the face of even the most cynical of viewers. I would highly recommend Wicker Park.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Acting, Awful Directing, Awful Soundtrack. A Disastrous Remake of an Amazing Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where can I being?!? When I first heard that this was Hollywood's remake of the French Film L'appartement I was thrilled and excited to see it. I was never a fan of any sort of Romantic Films, but the brilliance of L'appartement changed my mind. However, it's an unfair comparison since Vincent Cassel is one of the best International Actors who is capable of playing a vast rage of characters from a Russian Mobster in Eastern Promises, to a clueless Jewish Teenager in La Haine to an egomaniac complex criminal in L'ennemi Public Numero Un and finally a concerned lover in Irreversible. Monica Bellucci is possibly one of them few women who remain beautiful regardless of age, let alone having a great acting abilities.First, the suspense. Wicker Park lacks the suspense and the ability to keep you involved in the story. Second, the acting. Horrible, emotionless and far from convincing. Third, symbolism. Wicker Park lacks the symbolism and the artistic moves that infused the original title L'appartement. However, I can hardly blame the director since the film is aimed at a far less sophisticated demographic "American Viewers" VS the original "French,Italian,Spanish and Francophone Audiences". Fourth, the soundtrack is mediocre at best. The original soundtrack is mind blowing. A very haunting and beautifully written classical music that compliments the suspense and unpredictability of the events.In conclusion, don't waste your money on this Film. Instead get a copy of the Original Title L'appartement, buy some alcohol, invite your best friend or your girl/boyfriend and enjoy the original masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the longest movie i've seen in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect anything exceptional when i rented this movie. However, being (i admit) Josh Hartnett's fan i thought i'd give it a try. It was boring, took forever and I couldn't believe it ever left the cutting room this way.. I don't usually like people trashing movies when reviewing them because that seems really mean to all those who contributed to the process. I don't think anybody would start working on a film thinking: 'hey, let's make something stupid, boring and fundamentally flawed'. Unfortunately, that's how many movies end up to be. Wicker park is a very good example. It gives the impression of being all arty and smart but in fact, it will bore the crap out of you. Cinematography in the first part pretends to be kind of inventive (breaking the screen in different angles), yet somehow it stops in the middle of the movie. The plot is confusing, not in some intriguing way but because you quickly realize all the flaws. The cast did OK, yet I wonder when will Hartnett finally fire his agent. Few years ago, he appeared to be really talented (first 'The Faculty, then 'O' or 'Black hawk down' comes to mind). Add that voice of his, and you wouldn't think he ends up taking parts in 'Hollywood homicide' or '40 days and nights' and other regretful films. Seems like a waste to me. Disappointing.</fullReview>

Every scene is just so full of crappy played out dramatic irony of the worst kind. The guy can't find the girl when she's standing right next to him, which makes you scream at him, which would be fine, if it happened maybe once or twice, but it happens over and over and over. He's helplessly in love, but can't find the thought processes to find the girl. It's character flaws, plot flaws, and just a flaw itself. Then when he finally finds the girl after 2 hours of audience hell, he stands there and looks at her. It takes him almost 5 minutes to tap her on the damn shoulder!!! I had to run out of the theater during the last scene to keep my sanity. This flick is just plain burned out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great a mystery as it is a romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story opens up very fluidly, building up the mystery very well with the flash backs of the past romance. But then the revelations from the perspective of the perpetrator open up all the things, including revisiting all those menial things like bumping into other people. And that makes the movie very interesting as the message of the true power of love conquers all deceits. The very details are superbly designed in this movie, particularly the last minute "Rebecca moment". One things strange for me is instead the title, since the Wicker Park itself only take a less significant meaning other than what Lisa and Matthew conversed about. The acting department is very much a great job in overall. Josh Hartnett really did a good job in delivering the gentleman who tries his all out at his love. Diane Kruger sweetly compliments the romance angle. Matthew Lillard did a great job in acting out the sanguine character who doesn't realize what he's mixed up in between. But the highlight for me is Rose Byrne. She did her role very nicely giving all those assortment of expressions needed to act out the envious possessive psychotic who cleverly handles the contingent situations. Also for me she looked very beautiful here, much more beautiful than her other roles. Her hairdo really help in emphasizing her lovely face here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a psychological and romantic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker park? I didn't have a lot of expectations about this movie before it started. I thought that was an ordinary film. But it became one of the my favorites. Especially, if you like drama/romance film, it should be watched absolutely. The passion of a woman is perfectly expressed in this film. The story is very complicated but it makes me wondered. While watching this film, i was always excited about love of Lisa and Matthew. It isn't clear if Matthew find true Lisa or not, on the other hand Alex's love totally turned the obsession and this is very danger. In this film acting is really good. After Pearl Harbor, such a hard film, Josh Hartnett is surprisingly suitable for this role. Also Rose Byrne is certainly belongs Alex's role with her physical appearance and secretive glance. Especially the last scene of the movie cast, story, direction and others are excellent. It makes feel like the true lovers come together inevitably. Although the movie seems like a ordinary love story , flashback styling makes it different even in this aspect this film can be liken with Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Unfortunately the movie wasn't attracted attention so much in our country because it's released in 2008. . The film is a remake of the 1996 French movie L'Appartement.It was nominated for the Grand Prix at the Montreal Film Festival, the city in which the movie was partially filmed. The film could not become candidate for any award because there are many films that are better than it as production like Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King , Clint Eastwood 's Mystic River. The songs of the movie also are great, firstly Stereophonics' song maybe tomorrow plays and at last scene the film finishes with Coldplay's Scientist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some may call it stalking, they call it love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last month I was in Chicago and staying in an apartment near Wicker Park, so I snagged the DVD from my local library. It was fun seeing some familiar Chicago sights, although I don't believe the park featured in the movie is actually Wicker Park just a couple of blocks off the EL line.Josh Hartnett is photographer Matthew, working at the Wicker Park camera repair shop, and one day while looking to fix a customer's video camera that didn't have sound, he falls in love with the image of the young woman he sees.The young woman is pretty blond Diane Kruger as Lisa. When the camera's owner returns to get the camera, Matt sees Lisa across the street and follows her to a dance class. Is he stalking her, or is he in love? When she comes into the shoe store while Matt was visiting his friend, he fits her with shoes as a way to meet her.Lisa's friend who owns the camera is Rose Byrne as Alex. She is an actress, and Matt's friend, the shoe salesman Matthew Lillard as Luke, is falling in love for Alex.As the story develops it turns out that Matt, Lisa, Alex, and Luke are all connected in various ways, and not all is revealed until the final scenes.Another complication is Jessica Paré as Rebecca who appeared to be headed for marriage to Matt, but it is clear to the viewing audience that Matt is not at all sure he loves her.Are the various characters just well-educated stalkers, or are they simply following their "love" instincts? There is a really good speech near the end by one character that addresses this, and we wonder what is really fair in love? This is not a movie that you can view casually, while reading or answering phone calls, because it demands your attention to every scene, every bit of dialog, otherwise you will NOT understand the movie. The way it is edited it sometimes is in the present but often parts of the back story are told gradually as flashbacks, in such a way that everything comes together at the end ... but only if you have been paying attention.Good movie. My wife and I enjoyed it.SPOILERS: Before Matt met Lisa, Alex actually had her eye on Matt. She developed a relationship with Luke as a way to stay close to Matt. But she was very disappointed when Matt took an interest in her friend Lisa. By all accounts Matt and Lisa were in love but when Alex failed to deliver a note, and when she purposely erased phone messages, Matt and Lisa were headed for different directions, she to London and he to China. But when Alex pretended to be a "Lisa" when she was staying in Lisa's apartment, Matt exposed the ruse when he found the shoes he had sold Lisa were too big for this "Lisa." In the end, Matt and Lisa managed to meet up at O'Hare right before she was to leave. Their stalking turned to love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best one of all films I have watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched a lot of romantic film before. But of course every film is not very impressive. This film is one of the best films for me. It is not just a romantic film. It is also very complicated and exciting film. There aren't scenes about just romantic scenes. While watching it, you are always curious and thinking about what will happen then. There are a lot of attractive scenes in the film. The acting was very good. Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger were wonderful. I watched Josh Hartnett in Pearl Harbor before. He is really good. When Matthew saw Lisa, he falls in love with her. And he started to track Lisa but he met another woman who introduces herself Lisa. During the film, Lisa was seen as a mysterious woman as if she had been dealing with other problems which are different. But she is dealing with another woman's problems. Another woman is very dishonest. She deceived everyone in the film. She was the lover of Luke who is Matthew's close friend to be close to Matthew. I think she sometimes behaved like a mad in the film. With time thanks to the woman's attention-grabbing behaviors and clues, Matthew realized she hadn't been Lisa. He couldn't already believe she is Lisa. When he tracked the clues, he found Lisa. In the film there are very good fictionalized turns which attract you and let you be curious. We can feel the love and the feeling of being lovelorn. The scene which another woman who is lovelorn spoke about love at the restaurant near Matthew and Luke was really good. I feel pity for her because she is lovelorn. But she hadn't right to deceive everyone. I thought that in the end of the film when they wanted to meet at Wicker Park, they would meet there. But they couldn't and the film gets more excited. I started to think they couldn't meet anytime. But the end of the film was wonderful, it was a happy ending. Like usual, love won. Matthew's and Lisa's love for each other was very represented very well. I have watched once but I can watch it again to track the clues more carefully. It was really good. The songs in the film were also very good and attractive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good romantic movie Wicker Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absoulately this film is one of the best romantic movies I have ever watched. When at the beginning of the film I could not easily understand what is happening. It was a little complicated and slow. Although first I felt a little bored, I wonder what will be. Also, it was a gripping film. It has a mysterious event. And it has been acted perfectly. The mix of past an present and the transition between them was wonderful. The love of Matthew and Alew was wonderful. There was a misunderstanding and Matthew did not know that. But his love to Alex was indispensable and he did not forget Alex. Also Alex was not aware of what is happening because of Lisa. The events that Lisa made them is not acceptable. Also Lisa's love is not real. She just want Matthew, I think she is a real envious person. Apart from this perfect love there was an important fact, that was the friendship between Matthew and Luke. Firstly everyone can think that Luke was not a good person but I think he is a good friend and he is trying to find real love. He thought Lisa to be his love but Lisa was absolutely a selfish person. She lied to everyone without thinking nothing. Just think she knew was Matthew and having a love with him. But I am sure nobody can believe that her love is not real. But if there was not a character of Lisa there would not be any event. Also Alex had so many questions on her mind but in the end she found the right way. A person who watch the film can have the three feeling first part s/he can bored, after a little time passes s/he can feel gripping, and the final part s/he can really love this film. I really love this film. And &#x131; recommend it all of my friends.</fullReview>

Although, in the beginning it just looked like plain; but it worked for the better of it, 'cause you really cannot tell where it would take a turn. But surely you would be hooked, from the point onwards, where let's say Matthew's search ends.The storyline from there onwards is fascinating. I liked Rose Byrne's portrayal of Alex. This movie just brought out so many emotions, contradicting one-other at the same time. Also, I could surely well understand and empathize about yearning for something/someone so much, that you could get out of your ways for it, when presented a chance. The confusion of feeling happy or sad. But at the end, its upto the destiny. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watch the original french movie "Appartement, L' (1996)" yet but I have already seen "Wicker Park" twice having being the first one 2 years ago, and in this opportunity I liked it the most. I think "Wicker Park" deserves 8 stars and not its 6.8 that is why I give it a 10.I liked the performances of the four main characters specially of Josh Hartnett (even though I never liked much his work) and Rose Byrne who was excellent as Alex.The plot is about how obsession can make a person do things he or she could never have thought to do for being attracted to someone. In "Wicker Park" we can see the relationships between 4 people specially the one between Matthew and Lisa (the beautiful Diane Kruger)who were a couple once until their relationship ended in a rear way, now 2 years later they have a new but a complicated opportunity to resolves the estrange end of their relationship and being together again.Now I wanna watch the original french film because original versions are better in general than remakes and because of Monica Bellucci. Having said this I recommend you to watch "Wicker Park", you wont regret it.</fullReview>

Perhaps the setting could have been a bit different - Chicago in the winter, wasn't conducive to the depicting the overall ambiance that the writers were trying to convey. Too low budget for quality of story line. This film is a refreshing look at destiny and fate, and the paradox that surrounds the human action versus the destiny that always brings us back onto "its" road... A good V-DAY film... but it will take u on a roller coaster ride, so be ready, if u are one of the sensitive romantic types.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fatal" Marketing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for "Wicker Park" invites immediate comparisons between this film and "Fatal Attraction," and even the DVD cover promises a "sizzling, action-packed noir thriller." That, coupled with a cast of young stars and almost universal panning by critics, created expectations that this film would be 2004's "Swimfan." The film does indeed feature characters who possess unhealthy romantic obsessions, but these characters are not presented here as cartoonish psychopaths. Instead, they are presented as otherwise reasonable people compelled to do things that are less-than-reasonable, but understandable. Accordingly, the "action" here is not of the harpy-with-butcher-knife variety: "Wicker Park" builds excitement cumulatively, in the manner of a good mystery, as the complete picture coalesces through events revealed in a non-linear structure (reminiscent of several sequences from "The Rules of Attraction"). The acting appropriately lacks flashiness (with the exception of comic relief, Matthew Lillard), which grounds the film in a more believable reality. These things said, one's enjoyment of "Wicker Park" may owe in great part to knowing to which genre this film belongs. Hint: It does not follow the rules of "Fatal Attraction."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard the name, I was totally unsure whether to see the movie or not. But after seeing the casting, I decided to give it a go. And, from the very first scene, I was IN the movie. The emotions were so perfectly played, shots and angles are so perfect, editing and background compositions make it whole. Each character was very nicely played. The climax and tension sets an example that even romantic movies can make us shout. When I watched the movie, i was literally shouting at the characters like "go .. run, talk to her .. please turn back .." etc. It's one of those movies, that will really make you blend into the theme and into the emotions. It will make you cry, will make you laugh, make you sad and make you happy.. After a very long time, I met my inner-self again when i watched the movie ..After a very long time, I actually FELT these emotions seeing a movie ... a MUST see for all those guys and girls in love..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film yesterday (22.06.2008) Although I'm very interested in films and I know most of the films released even I don't watch it was interesting that I never heard of this movie. Also I bought this film incidentally from the video store, so I had absolutely no idea about this film except its name and Josh Hartnett being in this film.Generally I like sci-fi films,series not the ones with the aliens but the ones with good scripts. If there is not a fantastic, interesting part in a movies I generally get bored easily. And firstly I can say that there is nothing interesting about this film at first glance.I dislike about telling and reading important clues about the film here because I find it a disrespect to the script-writer and the audience. I think surprise must stay at the film not here. Well what I can say as a big surprise about this film its script. It's absolutely perfect. As a man who generally doesn't like "romantic" films I loved this film very much. Actors, actresses are playing very well but even if there were different players in this film I would really enjoy it...All clue about scripts is flash-backs. So you can easily understand there are flash-backs. But flash-backs are designed so wisely and lovely that you always stay curious about everything about past,now and then.Lastly I got curious and wanted to learn rating of this film in IMDb when I saw 6.8 I really got puzzled. Nowadays I'm watching so ordinary films who get scores more than 7 and is this film just regular? And I'm sometimes suspicious that are companies entering IMDb with fake identities and pushing up the scores for crap films? As a summary... Watch this one! Another note to submit. I'm a man who loves sci-fi and don't like romantic films. For sure watch it! After reading my comment if you decide to watch and dislike this film I'll do some thing you wish if I can to compensate your hours...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first it seemed kinda like a 'chick flick'. I suppose it isn't, by any stretch of the imagination, an 'action' movie but there's enough camera work to keep it fast paced. The main motivation of watching stems from the Chicago setting, my 'hometown'. But the characters are very appealing, the sets are authentic &amp; modern &amp; the storyline is unbelievably captivating. Besides seeing the snow falling on Chicago's Water Tower, the interesting interiors, airport scenes &amp; reflections throughout, the movie generates a magnetism rarely found. I'm sitting in Australia at 72F but busted out in shivers watching these poor people freezing in the cold! It's immediately my favorite 'Love' story. If you don't enjoy the misadventures of Matt &amp; Lisa &amp; their weird friends, there's simply no hope for you at all! I'll borrow my bride's and render four thumbs up on this one!

I found myself screaming at the T.V at the end, she was just so convincing the way she shuttled herself into matt's life trying to erase her friend from his memory. It was heart wrenching that all the lies and torture she put upon him were all because she loved him so much from afar and it was just chance that he saw Lisa first. It's such a twisted circle of relationships in this movie. I was so intrigued and was actually happy with the ending although it could have been crazy if matt and lisa had never found each other again.

Make sure to bring a blankie and a pillow tho cuz in the first hour you will probably fall asleep. Be sure to set your alarm to wake up for the 2nd half because that is when it finally becomes watchable. Josh Hartnett was a big bore as the main character as was Diane Kruger who played his leading lady. Rose Byrne did very well considering what she had to work with and although she was suppose to be the "bad guy" at the end of the movie you are completely on her side and want somehow for her to be the "winner" so to speak (not saying much considering the boring prize) Matthew Lillard was a necessary yet wasted addition. He made the movie watchable, but he just wasn't in it enough. This movie had a good premise but the beginning was to slow and to confusing and just couldn't make you care. Seeing how it all came together and how they inadvertently avoided running into each other throughout the film was probably the best attempt by the writer (Boyce) to make the movie interesting or good, and although it did help, it was to little to late. Overall this movie was about a 4.</fullReview>

Josh Hartnett play a romantic guy who fall in love for Diane Kruger and who could blame him. She's pretty and have a unique personnality. But one day, he would'nt find her as she is nowhere to see but he found something else at her apartment. This is a very strong and rich story, for sure, it's a remake but an interesting one. In the plot, they put the musics at the right places like the Coldplay song at the ending, the theme with no lyrics just before, the independent bands. Plus, this movie was done in my city, i am so proud of it. So when I look at the movie, I can see where in Quebec this place is. Except the airport, it's in Chicago, Ill. Good piece of movie and great cast, this is a movie you should watch. I fall in love with that movie because it's well done and it's a beautiful story on how you can do for love!

Similar like in Mulholland drive, the story is being told "the other way around", but here there are lapses in the story, the existence of the fiancée Rebbecca is not explained, also not the existence of a "yelling boyfriend in Lisa's apartment" ( she actually must have two apartments, one right next to Alex's and the other one, in which Matthew finds Alex),and also not why Matthew's friend greets him in the beginning commenting that it had been 2 months since last time...totally against the story. also ridiculous is the reaction of the characters on various events. A man who is so obsessed with his girlfriend that he misses his plane to china certainly would not go to bed a couple of hours later with a person he met in her apartment and whom he does not know at all...all this being engaged to a third woman. nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shallow and Corny Remake of a Great French Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Chicago, the former photographer and presently advertising executive Mathew (Josh Hartnett) is closing a business in a fancy restaurant with a Chinese representative, when he sees a woman that looks like his former passion Lisa (Diane Kruger). Two years ago, Lisa and Matthew had a love affair, and Lisa simply vanished when Matthew invited her to move with him to New York, where he had the invitation for a better job, and Matthew is still obsessed for her. Matthew decides to follow Lisa, and when he meets her, he realizes that Lisa is indeed another woman (Rose Byrne) with the same name. Matthew stays in Chicago with his friend Luke (Matthew Lillard) and decides to investigate the mystery.On 16 October 2005, when I first saw this remake, I wrote the following review:Although having a confused screenplay and too much coincidences, "Wicker Park" is a reasonable tale of obsessive love. The script, with many flashbacks, has many flaws and coincidences in a huge city like Chicago. The character Daniel is badly developed and disappears from the story, without any explanation whether he killed his wife or not, how he involved with Lisa and their relationship. The two lead actresses (Diane Krueger and Rose Byrne) are extremely gorgeous and together with Josh Hartnett, they show a great chemistry and make the romance work. The music score is great, and in the end, this film is a good entertainment. My vote is six.Yesterday (08 March 2011) I saw "L'Appartement" (1996) for the first time and now I have a totally different opinion:"Wicker Park" is a shallow and corny remake of a great French film. The screenplay resolves some points that are not clear in the original movie, but the adaptation of the story is developed in fast pace and loses the mystery and the romance of "L'Appartement", forgetting details and characters.The worst of this remake is the detail of communication. "L'Appartement" is a 1996 film in Paris, meaning neither cell phones nor e-mails were available at that time. Therefore, communication was based on phone booths or letters. This remake takes place in Chicago and the characters have cellulars. This single premise would be enough to destroy this remake. But the screenplay writer needs to provide explanations and give a happy ending, destroying the puzzle and discussions about the European film.Comparing the two films, I dare to write that "Wicker Park" is a "fast food" and "L'Appartement" is a refined feast. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Paix?o ? Flor da Pele"("Passion Near Skin")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mystery about a missing woman that turns out to be a psychological drama rather than a thriller like FRANTIC or TARGET. THE FACULTY's Josh Hartnett thinks he spots his lost love exiting a cafe one night and the chase is on. German actress Diane Kruger plays the missing woman, and Australian actress Rose Byrne is a woman bearing the same name and apparently the same distinctive pair of shoes. Don't ask, just go with it. But guys, beware: this turns out to be a chick flick in disguise. Hartnett is way too weepy and girly-acting, as is best pal Matthew Lilliard. And Kruger, seen in spurts, is not terribly unconvincing as Hartnett's great love. However, Byrne is terrific as a woman with a hidden agenda and the movie turns out to be hers as much as anyone's in the end. If nothing else, WICKER PARK (a place in Chicago) is a good date flick. Decent location photography is a plus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love makes you do strange things.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of drama / romances but I saw that it was also a mystery movie so I gave it a shot. And I'm really glad I did because Wicker Park is above good. In the beginning it was slow and I was wondering if the story was going anywhere. You constantly wonder what's going on between Matt (played by Josh Hartnett) and Lisa (played by Diane Kruger). They clearly like each other, and so far there is no mystery. It's when you add Alex (played by Rose Byrne) and Luke (played by Matthew Lillard) that it's getting interesting. You have to concentrate from the beginning to understand everything but it certainly is worth it. I didn't see it coming, so you could say the second part of the movie was a surprise, and it was a good one. Good actors, and an even better story makes Wicker Park a most enjoyable movie. One of the better movies I saw lately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know much about Josh Hartnett until I caught a part of Bunraku, that's one strange movie but I liked the way he played in it, so I tried this one out. I was initially intrigued, it is sort of a romantic Pulp Fiction with the flashbacks, but the bottom line was I didn't really connect with anyone in this except for Rose Byrne, who was just fantastic in the only good role. Kruger was sort of one dimensional, don't know if that's her or the script, she certainly shined better in National Treasure. And Hartnett just sort of mopes through the entire movie, again not sure who's to blame, him the script or both. The backdrop of the Wicker Park area of Chicago was very cool, but the bottom line was this had some promise but didn't deliver for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wicker Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twisty, flashback(and forth) "romantic" (well, sort of) melodrama has Rose Byrne stealing the film as a lovestruck theatre actress doing everything she can to keep performance artist Diane Kruger and ad exec Josh Hartnett apart. Responsible for the distance that kept Hartnett and Kruger from living together and continuing their romance, Byrne wants Hartnett for herself, seemingly living in a fantasy where she might have him if her efforts pay off. It gets complicated when Byrne enters a relationship with Matthew Lillard, Hartnett's pal! It seems Byrne will do whatever it takes--including using the best friend, leading him on to believe there's a possibility of love and romance--to secure Hartnett, but will she be able to continue the deception? The film is challenging, taking us backwards and forwards to show us how Hartnett wound up with the sister of a colleague he works for at his firm, why he is so determined to find Krueger, how he first saw Krueger and fell in love immediately, how Byrne found Hartnett and fell in love with him immediately, the steps Byrne took (like erasing messages on an answering machine, holding onto a letter, using phone calls to draw Krueger away where she can't be seen by Hartnett, sleeping in Krueger's place and taking her name to keep Hartnett from knowing she had returned from Paris, etc) to try and maintain the separation Hartnett and Krueger have, how Lillard is kept in the dark regarding Byrne's attraction to Hartnett and why she is so elusive towards him emotionally (Hartnett doesn't realize Byrne and Lillard are dating, either!), and how Byrne became associated with Krueger (adjacent apartments).All four performers put forth all the effort their talents could afford, with Byrne positing all the anguish and heart-felt desire her lovelorn character goes through. The obsessive quest of Hartnett to find his beloved (before and after he gains her love) can be borderline creepy at times (in her apartment, for instance or watching her while she trains at a gym), but when Coldplay starts up at the end, you kind of can't help but celebrate their coming together. But Byrne's aching is palpable?she does some horrible things (as she attests to at the end) but it is because she adores Hartnett so much (even if it would never be returned in kind). Lillard, unfortunately, is stuck as the odd man out who was being led around for no purpose other than to be dumped when the time was apt. The difficult labyrinthine nature for which the plot is told could frustrate some, but I found the direction rather compelling in how Byrne, in particular, unfolds before us as a bone of contention against Hartnett and Krueger. The Chicago/Montreal location work and the affluent side of the city (cities) gives the plot extra pizazz. Unconventional storytelling that toys with missed opportunities and serendipity gone awry. Although it is extremely difficult to make her unglamorous, Byrne is presented early on as less than desirable (she's rather drab, with unsophisticated eyeliner), but after some time it is quite clear there's a lovely woman underneath the humble looks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Love makes us do crazy things"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2004, "Wicker Park" is a drama/mystery/romance about a young Chicago advertising executive (Josh Hartnett) who falls in love at first sight with a woman (Diane Kruger), which leads to a growing relationship that abruptly ends. Meanwhile his best friend (Matthew Lillard) starts dating a woman (Rose Byrne) who is more ? or less ? than what she appears. Jessica Paré and Christopher Cousins have small roles. This is an extremely well-made movie with a "hip," kinetic flair, but a convoluted, non-linear story that makes your head spin. While it's not as effective as other non-linear movies, like 1994's "Pulp Fiction," the last act ties everything together and is pretty impressive, but it's almost tiresome till then, although things perk up when Rose Byrne appears early in the second act. Anyway, it's just mind-boggling to think of all the details the filmmakers had to keep track of to put the story together and make it make sense in the end. The movie explores the "love at first sight" phenomenon and the crazy things love or obsession make people do. The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in Chicago, Montreal and New York City. GRADE: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review contain a bit of spoiler. I don't know this could be spoiler. Anyway, a bit is exist. I love this movie. This is incredible. I love the opening OST stereophonics' 'maybe tomorrow' It is my favorite song. The lyric is great. And before I watched 'l'appartement' which is original movie. So I already recognized about the story. However, I could feel this movie is better. Matthew loves Lisa. And he tried to find where she is. But Alex interrupted their relationship. While watching movie, I was upset about her acting, because it is really mean. However, I understand her intention a little bit. At last scene, I totally understood her mind. Unfortunately, it wasn't love. She did cling to him. I don't know whether it is love or not. Anyway, She looked so vulnerable and weak. I wanted to she acting more aggressive, but it makes drop in value of movie. I want to see another version, just like women cling to some guy.or the opposite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blown away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2006 I worked in a video shop, and then I saw the poster for this movie. Don't know why, but something catched my eye (maybe the fact that Diana Krueger appeared in the movie). Since then, I wanted to watch it, and every time that almost succeeded in doing so ended in failure. That was until recently, and I must say, I'm glad I waited all these years to watch it.The movie has everything: a perfect cast (Diane Kruger, a goddess as always; Josh Harnett, pulling it up pretty well, this guy deserves much more attention!), very good and emotional music, fitting the scenes almost as if every song was made for the movie; the story, just awesome. Who hasn't been tangled in the webs of love, desiring, being unloved and all of that? The theme and how its handled keep me rooting for everyone during the film. I been in their place during the years: obsessing, loving, suffering, and all of that. The pace of the movie and its timing its perfect, although you will need patience before finding the answers to the movie questions. In the end, all will be solved and clarified in one way or another.As for the downsides, maybe the theme of coincidences and how we see them in the movie is a Little bit phony. Nevertless, they are easily forgiven for the sake of entertaining. Many here complaint about certain lack of realism about some aspects (the cellphones most obviously) but let's back out a Little bit: Its a movie! It doesn't have to follow the rules of strict realism.Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely. It has romance, thrilling and emotional moments, eye Candy (for guys and girls no less). But above all, a powerful message that, if you blink you will miss it: love is something very valuable. While a Little few can enjoy it, most of all the people will chase smoke most of the time.Everyone, please enjoy it. Also an apology for my atrocious English (it's not my mother tongue)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the (highly regarded) original French film "L'Appartement" of which "Wicker Park" is a remake, but there is one specific plot point - the non-use of cell-phones - that seems to be carried over from the 1996 film and is much harder to swallow in 2004. Also, the ending is a tad conventional. Other than that, however, "Wicker Park" is a very good movie: visually hypnotic, emotionally compelling, and intellectually challenging. It is put together like a puzzle, jumping back and forth in time, with a remarkable attention to detail; midway through it even shifts perspectives and makes you re-consider who is actually the main character in the story! Josh Hartnett is fine, but Rose Byrne steals the show with her affecting performance. An underrated film. *** out of 4.</fullReview>

I enjoyed this movie so much that I rated it 10/10 because it has such a captivating story. I don't think Matthew Lilliard or Josh Hartnett are such amazing actors, but in the roles they played, they did quite well. Diane Kruger did a very good job, but Rose stole the show. She really made me want her to get hit by a bus being such a conniving and treacherous feline. I won't give any spoilers away other than the one I just did, I will say that I will definitely watch this movie with my wife and I'm sure she will love it. I certainly hope you enjoy it as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why on earth didn't I hear of Wicker Park before? I couldn't stop asking myself this after I saw this Paul McGiugan movie. It just... Blew my mind!With great performances of Josh Hartnett and Rose Byrne in their obsessed and (somehow) disturbed characters, this thriller combines a tragic ambiance with a love story in a way I hadn't seen in a while. Some made- to-be-classical scenes can be spotted, too: That fabulous moment when the camera shows us in reverse "Luke's girlfriend" undoing her makeup... Woa! Unforgettable! For some reason, I couldn't help myself of thinking in the remake of Sleuth, or even in Hitchcock's Vertigo...However, I can understand why Wicker Park isn't that well-known. If you have seen it, you'll agree that this movie is WAY too confusing. Personally, I didn't quite understand it completely until the second time I watched it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time I watched this movie, I slept off. I couldn't understand what was going on. It was too boring. But some days later, on a very lousy day, I had nothing to do. Then I thought I'd give this movie another try. It was still the same. I didn't understand what was going on in the first 1 hour or so. Then the mystery started unfolding one by one. Some shots in the first half were shown again, but this time from a different angle which reveals quite a few things. Then some flash backs. All of these will make you seated on your chair till the end. And a special mention of the climax scene. It is gonna give you goose bumps for sure.So my advise. You may feel bored or sleepy in the first 1 hour. But all you need is a little bit of patience. Wait for the second half to reveal things out. Then you will realize the purpose of those boring scenes in the first half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone has seen the phrase, "Passion Never Dies". It is clear to me that everyone has some sort of passion that can lead them to do horrible things to others. And because of my experience of watching "Wicker Park", it also taught me that that passion, can turn into obsession. Wicker Park was an amazing experience. This movie changed the way you would see love for the rest of your life; moreover, changing the way you would see some people in your personal life. It showed me that true and passionate love still existed in this world that we live in. I don't know where, but it's out there...somewhere.The cast was absolutely perfect for the film. Josh Hartnett(Matthew), playing a person who is caught in an obsessive search to find his past love that had disappeared. The thriller is mind blowing and would be a tragedy not to watch.Wicker Park is the best film experience I have ever had, and 10 out of 10 stars, is not enough!!</fullReview>

Initially I thought the guy was a possible perv &amp; quite obsessive but after discovering their mutual love in the flashbacks, it made sense. This movie invoked a lot of emotions from me &amp; I was on the edge of my seat cheering him on &amp; even though I am VERY against cheating, I was so annoyed by his fiancé who popped up in the dramatic scene in the airport &amp; was telling her to go away! That's not like me but I am believer in love &amp; what they shared was true &amp; deep, what he had for the fiancé was shallow &amp; safe. LOVED the music &amp; camera work. I have most of the music on my computer &amp; "The Scientist" song at the airport made me cry... so perfect!! The flashbacks gave this love meaning &amp; helped you understand so much PLUS the viewer has no idea this background "stuff" was VERY important! I love this movie, own it &amp; love showing ppl this movie for their first time! Love is very powerful &amp; we see this on all ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Wicker Park'' is one of the most romantic and dramatic movies of this decade.&#x130; watched this movie for my phonology course but i liked it.i don't like romantic movies but this movie impressed me so much.Its so complicated because of the past and present events.Flashback technique is used and it helps us understand the movie but I couldn't understand what is happening in the beginning.At first the movie bored me especially like the scenes that are seen as unnecessary but when the movie continues we see each scene has an important part in the movie and it starts to amaze you.I never heard about the movie but i thought i wish i watched it a long before my task.The movie and the cast shows us what the real love is.The passion of women is perfectly shown.Josh Harnett(Matthew) and Rose Byrne ( Alex) are perfect for their roles. The character Lisa(Diane Kruger) has an important role in the movie because if she is not in the movie there wouldn't be any event.Especially the last scene was wonderful and I'm sure many of the audience who have watched this movie cried. The story is quite good.It can be real and can happen to each of us in real life.The songs of the film are also attractive.Coldplay-The Scientist helps the movie become amazing with an amazing soundtrack.I watched that scene again and again.The words of Alex "Love makes you do crazy things, insane things. Things in a million years you'd never see yourself do. But there you are doing them... can't help it" has a part in my brain.I recommend you to see this movie.It is really worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely beautiful but &#x131; prefer the L 'apartment which is original version. I think Hollywood didn't scupper at this time. I watched this movie a few months ago and &#x131; like it so much especially josh Harnett. He played his role so well and other females did a good job &#x131; think. The movie gives two times past and present. So you guessed all the time. The film shows that how to people obsessed when they fall in love or broke up the lover. Wp is psychological drama. it is about the obsessive relationship. Wp starts with past how Matt recognize Lisa and how they start with their relationship until Lisa leaves Matt without any explanation. After two years Matt returns the town with new girlfriend who is name Rebecca. At the restaurant he sees Lisa then he tries to find her. He is totally obsessive with Lisa. Then he meets a new girl who is name Lisa she smells like Lisa. Matt hangs out with this new girl because he dreams that she is Lisa but she isn't Lisa she is Alex. She is neighbor Lisa. And she loves Matt so much and also she wants to try to stop Matt to find Lisa . I think women are the most dangerous creature in the world especially when they fall in love=) Some way Matt understand Alex 's plan finally Matt and Lisa find each other at the airport. This last scene is wonderful especially with the Coldplay 's song . Notably last scene affects me so much . WP shows that obsessive personality how people being to obsessive someone or something and when people love someone madly it is driven her or him crazy. It is the scope of the film. I think it is so irritating. Still i like WP as much as l'apartment movie. I offer to watch both of the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie the scene are so effective. You can even enjoy by looking the backgrounds, soundtrack and the scenes which have been shot in a right place.Also in the some scene you can see the both character and the reactions of them. In the movie you can find, sometimes a montage, there a story, here a dream, a memory.... we feel things deeply in life, then this movie is a work of art. However,the thing which makes me think about in the movie the communication(cell phone required). Even if I have questions about the last scene of movie, it has great series of events. With the writers powerful talents the scenario is almost perfect. With the great acting of Josh Hartnett you can believe the love. But the movie starts a little bit slow and at the ending everything becomes so complicated and so fast. The storyline is very clever and while you are watching it gets your attention and curiosity so you don't want to miss any scene of it. The stories "bad guy" Rose Byne did a splendid job. She is good at acting easily as the crazy-emotionally-wrecked character. Sure the girl was acting in a totally selfish manner,with an obsessed love, but I really believe that she really did love Hartnett's character. Before I started to watch this movie I thought it was a usual romantic movie. But the story is not a usual romantic event. In the movie the characters are struggling with a platonic love. In the movie communication has a great importance. With its soundtracks, scenes, acting, dialogs and directing this is a marvelous film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wicker Park is a superb movie. Highly impressive! Even if there are missing and disconnected parts in the storyline, you will watch it excitedly and impatiently from beginning to end. The story is mostly told with flashbacks so well. It is one of the best movies which has a splendid setup I have ever watched. Acting is perfect and realistic. It sometimes bored me as it goes on slowly but after a point the truths are uncovered and the movie draws the audience. Especially last forty minutes with surprises, mystery, excitement are worth seeing. Complicated situations are enlightened one by one. In the meantime, I have to say that soundtracks are awesome. "The Scientist" and "Maybe Tomorrow" are emotional songs. You want to listen to them again and again.Unfortunately, there is something silly that I must mention. Are these people not aware of communication age? How cannot Lisa and Matthew reach each other? How cannot they hear from each other? It does not make any sense. By the way, only Alex has a mobile phone. My poor lovers, you don't still have a mobile! I really don't understand what the scriptwriters thought about this situation while creating the story. They should have probably aimed to present an atmosphere of mystery.As for the performers, I would like to congratulate Josh Hartnett (as Matthew) and Rose Byrne (as Alex) for playing their roles very well. Their performances are perfect. I have always been a fan of Josh Hartnett. It was probably the first movie that I have seen Rose Byrne's acting. I really liked her expressions. She represents her character very well.In addition, the final scene is excellent. I think it is one of the most impressive scenes. By the way, I will never forget the words of Alex : "Love makes you do crazy things, insane things. Things in a million years you'd never see yourself do. But there you are doing them... can't help it". This movie is really worth watching. I recommend you to see it. You will be definitely impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wicker Park is a decent drama with thriller elements from director Paul McGuigan whose admirable in making this movie about a man who becomes obsessed and puts his life on hold in order to find his long lost love. The cast are good in their roles including Josh Hartnett, Rose Byrne, Matthew Lilard, and Diane Kruger but some of them lack screen time. The movie does have some suspense, mystery, and surprises as Hartnett's character desperately tries to find the girl of his dreams played by Kruger. The pacing was a little slow at times and some of the twists were revealed a bit too soon but except for some flaws this film wasn't too bad. It may not be the greatest movie ever made but it's certainly not the worst either. Overall despite some flaws with character development and pacing, Wicker Park isn't that bad of a film. It could've been better but I feel the good outweighed the bad in this one. Wicker Parker has some suspense, surprises, drama, romance, and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie experience not to be missed. The soundtrack is impeccable and adds to the overall mood of the film. Josh Hartnett, Rose Byrne, Diane Krueger are all wonderful in a movie, which keeps you guessing till the end..Many a times, we lose people based on misunderstandings. We feel justified in our actions but never know what our actions might have meant to the other person.The real scary problem comes when someone else uses their proximity to one of the persons to achieve their ends.This is a movie, where Matt and Lisa are pushed to be together innumerable times. However, we know that life does not give us so many chances.Then, there is also unrequited love - Which causes most of the confusions in the story.The movie is superbly directed - Some sequences like the flashback and the climax are standouts, pure eye candy.I am not a fan of either Josh Hartnett or Diane Krueger, but their chemistry works big time in this movie.This is based on a French movie - L Appartmente - Guess this is a superb version.Watch this film to be rewarded with quality entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone watching the portion of the movie where Alex tries to explain her actions and who isn't perfectly captivated by the character that Rose Bryne plays, just isn't paying attention. Her pacing, timing and acting is wonderful...no, masterful. Frankly, for a person like myself who doesn't invest much in movies, Rose's imagery was masterful. Nothing less.It is not often that a woman can embrace a character as well as Rose Bryne, a character that can be so sinister in her intent and endearing in her vulnerable humanity. Did anyone not watch that movie and, even in her most indulgent intent, not want to hug her when everything began to crumble around her? That is the mark of the perfect actress. I am now a confirmed Rose Bryne fan. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is why they should make romantic movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching Wicker Park because I had nothing else to watch. I thought it would be a typical romantic bore specially that Josh and Diane are not the kind of actors to carry on a whole movie, at least yet! After reaching about half of the film, I figured out how my idea was wrong, there is a twist in the middle of the film that turns everything upside down. The film is unexpectedly good, I think there was a problem with introducing this film to the audience by film makers. I guess if it took its good share of publicity, there would have been no doubts about watching it! Shortly, I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic movies, and definitely I would recommend it to someone who likes twists. Finally I would recommend the movie to everyone in love with Diane Kruger even if she can't really act...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Welcome Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, this isn't the type of film I would ordinarily watch. But my friend accidentally left the DVD round my house one day, and that night I decided to watch it.I was expecting a film that would follow the cliché's....a couple, who are deeply in love, are separated by the disappearance. Then the one left goes on a mad hunt for her...probably ending with someone dieing.However, this film is not like that at all, and is a very welcome change because of it. Too many films nowadays seem to think they have to be full of violence or shocks or death in order to entertain. We learn that Josh Hartnett's character has lost the love of his life, and although has tried to move on, he's still in love with her. Then after a fleeting glimpse of a blonde, he thinks he has found her. What follows is a mystery as he puts his career on the line to find this woman. Great performances from everyone...and a nice change to see a mystery film with no violence or deaths.I rate 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When (Matt) he is playing with the video camera at his work, he is wearing a red shirt. Later in the movie they reply that shot from Alex's point of view and he is wearing a gray/green shirt. It's a great movie, loved the. It's one of those movies you just wanna yell at that scummy character then the next minute your feeling bad for her but still wanting the separated lovers to be united! I loved the way the camera shots are unique and how the characters are very realistic. And how you feel what each character does (which makes the movie a roller-coaster) as well as being wrapped up in the story line. I recommend it for everyone, especially if you want a powerful yet unique movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What i liked would be the atmosphere of the movie, it doesn't change, it doesn't have that new reality thing with shaky cameras. It has this mysteries mood through out the movie. There isn't any intense action created my effects or music, the electricity of the moment is made up by the intense emotions of the characters. The actors fit there characters perfectly. The music seams to start and end exactly when it has to, it helps to set the mood but doesn't set it itself, it just accompanies the emotions. The intensity of the movie is magnified by the plot revealing it self just at the right moment giving enough knowledge to keep you interested bu doesn't reveal all to keep it's mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really good movie I recommend. I don't know about the rest of the film, but I liked the editing. After about the first thirty minutes of Wicker Park I was laughing because it seemed like this was the most absurd movie I had ever seen. However, as the film progressed the laughter subsided and intrigue ensued. By the last thirty minutes of the film I was hooked. When it was over, I was surprised that a movie that had started out so poorly ended up being one of the better films I have seen in a while.If one sees this film, I recommend he/she be patient. I found the overall experience, despite the bad beginning, to be quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film and am surprised by the many negative reviews I've read. Most reviews, unsurprisingly, focus on the fact that the film is an English language remake of L'Appartement which was certainly a very stylish, highly original and entertaining thriller. Wicker Park, sensibly, sticks very closely to L'Appartement both in its script and its use of the original movie's non-linear, jumbled-up plot structure, used to similar great effect in other movies such as Pulp Fiction and 21 Grams. For long stretches Wicker Park even takes the form of a shot-by-shot remake of L'Appartement, without really compromising on style or suspense, which makes the negative critical reception of the film all the more baffling. There are of course differences between the two films; the plot strand featuring Lisa's new partner and the death of his wife is all but eliminated in Wicker Park and, linked to this, the endings of the two movies are markedly different. L'Appartement's ending is quite sour and psychologically complex, typically European it could be argued, while Wicker Park opts for a more crowd-pleasing, happy ending, unsurprising for a Hollywood movie. The performances from the four principals in the original film were outstanding and, unfortunately for Wicker Park, Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger, although far from awful, are just not in the same class as Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci. I did however think that the performances of Rose Byrne and Matthew Lillard stood up well. Leaving comparisons aside however, Wicker Park is a stylish movie in its own right, nicely photographed, competently acted and guaranteed to entertain, whether you've seen the original or not. It's definitely a cut above the average Hollywood film of this type, undoubtedly due to the strong source material. L'Appartement is definitely the better film but if you haven't seen the original or can't get hold of it, Wicker Park is a decent enough substitute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good little mystery/romance story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one reminded me of a Hitchcock movie but without the most basic element of a Hitchcock movie which anybody who knows anything about his movies will pick up on right away. The acting is decent from all of the actors but Rose Byrne is the real star of this show not Josh Hartnett or Diane Kruger who were given the top slots because they are somewhat well known to the general public. Byrne had the obsessive ugly ducking psycho role down to the tee she was simply captivating and I enjoyed watching her perform. Bravo I want to see her in anything it doesn't really matter what. I also loved how she played the in-control totally driven female one minute and the next she was the fragile emotional little girl the next. If you didn't know better at the end you would have thought she had a multiple personality disorder which she could have had. I was just waiting for her character to do what I figured she had to do to avoid being discovered and I was anticipating something that didn't happen to my complete astonishment I guess her character wasn't that insane after all just love sick and heart broken. This movie demands your total attention throughout if you head to the kitchen for a beer or a sandwich for two seconds you might as well turn it off because you're gonna be lost. When I saw Matthew Lillard's name at the beginning I inwardly cringed at first but surprise surprise he is fine. He doesn't get carried away or act like a complete boob. This film isn't pretentious or grandiose in any way, shape or form but it entertains and I can't demand anything more from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just loved this movie! I read some IMDb user comments and I first thought it would be kind of nasty. But I was wrong. I agree that the beginning is not very catching... But if you are patient, you will be intrigued by the tons of suspense and how the situation changes. I found the flashbacks very good because it is better to keep the tension(the viewer keeps paying attention throughout the entire movie), although the flashback style was very close to the one used in 21 grams(another nice movie). The love stories were really nice... There is one thing that is too much(way too much): Matt's bad luck! Come on! He always misses her! DAMN! I was betting with myself: he's gonna catch her, nope, he won't! But eventually, the happy end...(kind of crappy :D). All in all, I find this movie one of the best of 2004.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I first saw "L.A. Confidential" I couldn't wait to rewind it so I could see it again. This movie had the same effect on me. It's not as good as "L.A. Confidential", but it's surprisingly good. I had little expectation from it. I remember that so many critics basically killed it when it first came out. I wanted to see it so I could have a good laugh. Well the joke's on me, I like this movie.The camera work in the early part of the movie is worthy of Hitchcock and the whole set up in the beginning makes you feel some big revelation will come at the end. There is a revelation but just not as big as one would hope when you consider the set up. I suppose for most people it would be a let down. For me it worked just fine. I don't know exactly how but this movie somehow managed to be effective.The performances were somewhat uneven. It makes you wonder how much better this movie could be with better acting. Josh Harnett was very effective at playing a despondent character seeking his lost love but seems wooden when trying to woo Lisa in flashback scenes and when dealing with his character's fiancée Rebecca. Matthew Lillard toned down his doofus slacker persona and it somehow worked but the movie might have been better with someone else.The two lead actresses fared better. I would have expected a stronger performance from Rose Byrne. But I suppose the fragile waif she played was better for the movie than say an aggressive woman. She showed so much vulnerability when the story begins to unravel. And Diane Kruger was surprisingly good, all the times I said she was a pretty face that could not act, I take it back.I've seen the DVDs of this movie at the marked down bins in some stores and have ignored it. I might not buy it at full price, but next time I see a copy cheap I'll buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rose?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the remake of the French film the Apartment. It centers around Matthew (josh hartnett) and his lost love Lisa (Diane Krueger.) He ends up in a puzzling plot that has him quite confused as to what happened to Lisa and who mystery woman Alex ( Rose Byrne) is really trying to be.Diane Krueger and Rose Byrne both were in Troy together and make quite a fetching pair. Matthew is played by the super gorgeous gaped tooth semi talented Josh Harnett who is only in bad to mediocre projects. Matthew Lillars of Scream and other forgettable films stars as Josh Hartnetts BF whose name has slipped my mind.Diane Krueger who played Helen in Troy, plays the the beautiful Lisa. She forever has Matthews heart even with her sudden disappearance. She is the pretty blond contrast to Rose Byrne and is obviously the attractive character.Rose Byrne is really very beautiful, she looked so dumpy and lost in this film! I think she played psycho jealous Alex great. She is of course suppose to be the mousy, frumpy, darker coloring to Diane Kruegers Lisa. I think she may not have washed for several days as her skin looked oily and waxy and her hair greasy. She looked quite bad, but it is also obvious that she is a very attractive woman, in fact she reminds me a little bit of Monica Belucci who played the original Lisa in the French version.Josh Harnet is a very good looking male, but he never seems to be able to capture an audience, as I saw this film specifically for him and found the plot pretty engaging the the two female leads far superior to him. He has a very clean look about him in this film and he really looks sad by the loss of Lisa, but he also seems to be the type of guy who falls quickly in love.Good movie, though I would love to find the French version on DVD. I haven't seen all of the original, so I cannot compare how good it is to Wicker Park, but I liked this movie. It was set in the cold, chilly winter months and had a beautiful frosty feel..Excellent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be my new "worst movie ever", and I don't take that title lightly. I actually recommend it to a few people because it's so stunningly bad on every level that it's worth watching. The acting is painfully funny, but you can't entirely blame the actors because the script is just awful. The directing, editing, EVERYTHING is just terrible. On top of that the story is hilariously convoluted (I can't prove it but I swear the time line doesn't make any sense) and the people involved couldn't decide from one minute to the next if they were trying to make a "pouty teen soap opera" or a "wacky comedy" or an "edgy thriller". One minute it's long lingering shots of nothing that make you wish for the pace of "Eyes Wide Shut" and the next it's "CSI" camera tricks with wacky music, still about nothing though. Hilarious.I almost turned it off (which I never do) but I got sucked in to watching this train wreck of a film unfold in front of me. You have to make it past the first 20 minutes or so, which just feel like a slow, boring, badly acted movie. After that it just gets progressively worse, even when you think it can't. I'm not sure if it's 1 star or 8 stars based on that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wicker Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Now you see me for who I am." Investment Banker Matthew ( Josh Hartnett),advertising executive in Chicago, puts his life and a business trip to China on hold when he thinks he sees Lisa, ( Diane Kruger) the love of his life who walked out on him without a word two years earlier, walking out of a restaurant one day.With a little help from his friend Luke, (Matthew Lillard) Matthew obsessively and relentlessly tracks Lisa down and while doing so, runs into another young woman, who is also calling herself Lisa. ( Rose Byrne)I really think that this movie manages to work because of Rose Byrne. A lesser actress would have easily over-acted in the part, but yet, Rose Byrne always manages to make her performances real and authentic... one of the reasons she is indeed my favorite actress. Her character, in Wicker Park, has so many layers: one second she is astonishingly sympathetic, evil, adorable, and exotic in another. Plus, I gotta say that I love those "sad eyes" of hers. She really does deserve some better roles, how long can producers simply keep casting her as someone's girlfriend, etc. Hell, for the scenes in which they were paired she did manage to raise, Hartnett's acting up a little bit.Diane Kruger, is kind of a hit and mess?. I'm not really impressed with her, but I'm not going to say she gives the worst performance ever, either?.. In fact, I loved her in " National Treasure" but she really doesn't do much for me in this role or movie.I think my favorite scene from the film is when Rose's character is drinking all the wine out of the bottle there, and then she says to Matthew, " How's your hand?" There is also one scene where her Aussie accent can be heard distinctly for whatever reason?..I guess they must have missed it! Another standout of the film, is it's music. As it fits in perfectly. For example, Cold play's ' The Scientist' is just perfect for the last moment of the film.Love yah, Rose!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a compelling, intricate and clever film, and I thoroughly recommend it. Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger are convincing and beautiful. The film weaves through time, and uses several cinematic devices to shift between different chronologies. It was, therefore, a great surprise - and disappointment - to discover recently that the story, characters, and even the composition of many scenes, are directly lifted from a French film called L'Appartement, featuring Vincent Cassel. For those who enjoy film, you'll find it a very interesting cultural comparison, particularly as the endings are distinct, throwing a completely different cast over the preceding events of each film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Madness, Machinations, and More in Wicker Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, I must say, ranks as one of my favorite movies of the past 10 years. I'm sure I'll watch it again and again. It's a poem really?on film, looping back and forth, returning to the angst of love, betrayal, selfishness, fear, and the machinations of adults vying for intimacy and meaning in the 21st century.The plot appears to be like a lot of other love stories at the beginning, but its a thriller, so one doesn't know quite where it will take us, and I liked that, there was something different about this story, right from the beginning. When I had finally pulled myself out of my chair (okay, off my futon) and turned the volume on my DVD player off, I realized that this film was a romance which really did mirror the love life of many people today?and movies like that are hard to come by. In this All About Eve meets Dressed to Kill meets The Talented Mr. Ripley scenario, Rose Byrne (Troy, My Mother Frank, City of Ghosts) plays the part of Alex, an attractive young actress vying for a career in love when what she really should be paying more attention to is her thespian career?but is she is somewhat lacking in theatrical abilities on the Shakespearean stage, she surely has no such problems in her personal life, as you will soon notice. She is, indeed, quite the little performer, although her talents as an actress are indeed better offstage, where she draws an unsuspecting, love-struck Matthew (Josh Hartnett?Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down) and Lisa (Diane Kruger, National Treasure, Troy) the object of Matthew's affection, into her little parlor game of madness and deceit, creating a thriller-romance that will have you laughing, crying, and anxiously shoving your popcorn down your throat in a fit of jitters. Diane Kruger (Lisa) and Matthew Lillard, the ever-smiling, ever-hopeful Luke (Without a Paddle, Scooby Doo 2) are two characters chasing the very dreams that the rest of us are chasing, at least on planet Earth: the desire for intimacy. When the characters aren't chasing it, they are avoiding it, and the strategic inclusion of four and not three or five main characters was a good decision, giving the movie and story-line the momentum of a freight train by working the characters off one another. Lisa is in love with Matthew, we think, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's the lead actress. While it would have been impossible to drop Lisa, the wannabe girlfriend, it would have been quite simple enough to pull Luke from the script, however, we would have then been left with the clichéd menage-a-trois scenario. Luke's character gives the movie a plausible and a more sophisticated sensibility, giving us a story which would not necessarily have been possible with only three characters?and the ensuing triangle vignettes.Both Byrne's and Hartnett's performances should win them a few accolades. Both are already promising young actors, who, in many ways, have already proved themselves. My only regret is that I didn't get to see more of the young Québec actress, Jessica Parré (The Lives of the Saints (Canadian TV), Bollywood/Hollywood). I won't give all the details away, but I'll bet you a movie pass that these four characters manage to take you for a wonderful spin around Wicker Park that leaves you more than just a little weak in the knees.</fullReview>

The premise of obsession and a missing person is certainly compelling and fans of such films deserve not to have their intelligence insulted. This film does it big time.

The cast is composed of young artists mostly. Musics also, to explain with one word is perfect. The timing, the process of the events is really good.

Actually, I am not someone who likes romantic movies but Wicker Parker was extremely interesting and artistic movie. Initially, movie is complicated but progressively, the movie is becoming clear. The movie contains very realistic scenes in itself and soundtracks of film are harmonized with film. However the movie is slow in the starting scenes, it gets your attention with its great screenshots. You must watch it from beginning to end to understand it. But I don't like the last scene of the movie. It has not got an efficient end for me the events don't get any conclusion. You actually feel sympathy for the bad character in the movie. Her behaviors can be understood if you really look in her shoes. In the movie there is no cell phone and Josh Hartnett aka Matthew take some help from his best friend Luke for reaching Lisa. At this moment the things starts to become complicated. Lack of communication is the basic thing that causes everything I think. The soundtracks of the movie are great. I mean in the first scene of the movie there is" maybe tomorrow" and last scene of the movie there is "Coldplay's The Scientist ". Rose Byne did a great job in the movie and of course Diane Kruger did a great job in the movie too. Even if the scenes, acting and soundtracks are really great it is good, the last events are not adequate in the movie. Before I watched this movie I thought it was a usual romantic movie. You can enjoy the scenes and the soundtracks and story if you are a fan of romantic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 over 10. Perfect Acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I did not watch this movie, I had heart a lot of things about it. These things were about romanticism and sexuality. Then I watch the film with my classmate. Now I watched and had a comment about the movie. In this movie, the artist whose name is Josh Hartnett (Matthew) was acting great. He was absolutely perfect for the role. It's a little complicated to understand the first time you watch cause there are so many things going on at the same time and it makes the film hart to follow. In the movie, the songs were perfectly chosen. Especially the last song was so emotional that nearly I would cry. If you wonder what the topic is I can explain it for you. The plot is about how obsession can make a person do things he or she could never have thought to do for being attracted to someone. In "Wicker Park" we can see the relationships between 4 people specially the one between Matthew and Lisa (the beautiful Diane Kruger)who were a couple once until their relationship ended in a rear way, now 2 years later they have a new but a complicated opportunity to resolves the estrange end of their relationship and being together again.And in overall, if you did not watch this movie, you should. I is worth?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>W&#x130;CKER PARKIn my opinion, this movie was absolutely beautiful in every aspect of the word. this was one of the first movie i've seen as romantical in a long time that i came away with so much more than i had expected. i've recommended this movie to everyone in my environment especially to my close friends, and everyone who's seen it who i know has felt the same way i do....maybe not with as much passion as i do.....but similar.quality, quality film....ahhh, the day it comes out on video, i'll be the first in line to buy it. I enjoyed this movie on its face and found myself wanting to watch it again upon its conclusion, which very rarely is true for me. Most movies, including the ones I consider amazing, require the passage of several years before I might entertain the idea of watching them again. This was different, and will perhaps be better understood once you have seen the movie. It's like a puzzle I want to put back together on my own. The scenery was excellent. It was a top notch performance on everyones part. It kept you guessing until you didn't know what to think. It was a thriller, yet had a comedic spark here and there with a twist of romance and a dazzle of drama. It was by far one of the movies that stick out this year that i've seen. Josh Hartnett played his role so well, and the 2 females i wasn't really familiar with their work but they did a fantastic job as well as Mathew Lillard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WICKER PARK I think this film was complicated.Firstly,the spectacular don't guess what will happen.I think it is very nice to see both past and present.It is very incredible that every person imagines different ways.For example, I thought ,when I saw Lisa leave the cafe,that she didn't love Matthew, she didn't want to be with him.But then we learned that it was not real,I understood what the reason was. Another interesting part in the film was in Belluchi's restaurant. all of them(Matthew, Lisa and Alice) were there.Moreover, they called each other at the same place.But, the more interesting thing is that Matthew immediately noticed Lisa's voice and her scent, maybe, that was nonsense.Additionally, he noticed all the details apart from one.The most important detail was Alice.But he couldn't understand. Although Matthew broke up Lisa two years ago,Matthew forgot his girlfriend and his job.He didn't think anything except to Lisa.I didn't understand why Lisa didn't go to Wicker Park.Because he wanted to only talk.But, later again I learned that Lisa never know callings. Alice is very vicious woman.Her only aim is Matthew.But,he didn't know that and want her.But as if the film was made of only Alice and her plans.In the film, only someone is guilty. Everybody who watched the film say that the woman, Alice, is very disgusting.I want to kill her.If Lisa and Matthew's love emphasized,it would be better.We always watched running man who didn't know to whether the woman was alive. Sometimes,we saw the same scene.In fact, the most innocent character were Rebecca and Luke.They didn't know anything.Both of them lost their lovers.I think the real characters were them. Because we were used to vicious people and lovers.We always watch basically only one couple.Only they are happy.The single ones immediately almost disappears.We don't know what do the singles and what they do.These were nonsense parts. Finally, it is not bad.Only it could be better.However, I like it.:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movies movie is one of the best! if you want to watch a romantic love story , you will get disappointed. Because, It is not a love story. It is more than that. Wicker Park is a psychological film whose main characters are Josh Hartnet (Matt) and Lisa (Diane Kruger) , Alex (Rose Byrne), and Luke (Matthew Lillard). The movie's scenarist captures the audience's attention, holds it, and moves it to a moving, touchy consequence. In this respect, despite of being different in many ways, the movie is similar with a famous novel which was written by Coelho. Matt is a man who is deeply in love with Lisa. After starting to date, she becomes part of his life. They build a strong relationship between themselves. But one day Matt discovers that Lisa has disappeared leaving no trace. He got depressed, confused, and worried about her disappearance. He asks her friends if she left any note for him before leaving. But he cant find anything as the way he expected. after 2 years, he somewhat moves on. He has a new, beautiful lover whose names is Rebecca. even time brings him much more success. In spite of everything, he still continue thinking of Lisa. One day he has a job interview at a restaurant, he imagines that he saw Lisa. all his feelings emerge again leading him a new, long and tiring search,. But this time he feels happy as he got closer to her again. After that tiring search, he finds himself at a house. But instead of Lisa, he meet someone else who tell him that her name is Lisa. Even though her face is not similar to Lisa, her clothes, shoes are like Lisa's. she wants him to stay the night as she is afraid of a man who has been following her for a while. And he accept the offer. Then the two finish up sleeping together. But later it is revealed that her real name is Alex and she is not a nurse like she said but a theater artist. Alex changes her name as Lisa. Because he is so much influenced bylisa. and she start to copy her. As Matt is apart of her life, Alex wants to have him too. What is more, she destroy the note which was left for Matt by Lisa. this situation makes Matt feel depressed again. But after a long search and adventure, Lisa and Matt meet again. In short, l strongly recommend you to watch the movie. It gives you a chance to be in another world for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wicker Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the best love story film I have ever seen, not only its love story but also its complexity affects me so dramatically. While watching the movie, in first minutes, I thought that Wicker Park resembles the other movies. But, in next minutes, I felt as if I were Matthew I totally focused on the film. I felt like I was fall in love with Lisa and throughout the movie, I wished Lisa and Matt would see each other. The plot is really perfect, I think and the performance of the cast is so successful. With these two features, viewers can easily join the scenario. This is really hard to achieve but, this movie is really one example of the movies which tightly connects the viewer to the film. Links between each scene are smoothly prepared thus the flow between scenes is so comprehensible. Also, movie has many flashbacks and their timing is punctually organized. While watching, you will encounter with these and anything you don't understand will be cleared up by flashbacks. The beginning of the film, Matt's efforts to make acquainted with Lisa, resembles the movie "Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain". In the next scenes of the film, Matt and Lisa's love and their living resembles the movie "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". With all these features, Wicker Park can be seen as the gathering of successful love plotted movies. You feel the love, at first sight, then you feel the togetherness. Later, misfortunes begins, you feel the brake-up. After this bad time, you start to feel the love again. I think the most influential event is Struggles in feeling this love. Wicker Park could gain 6.9 point but I think it deserves above 8 point. With all positive features, I mentioned, this movie totally has the best plot among the love storied movie I watched.</fullReview>

Some of you can say that &#x131; exaggerate this film , but i do not know.. it always make me feel high and cool, &#x131; really suggest you to watch it whenever you find time .so finally it is my one of favorite films.;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Wicker Park film in the listening and pronunciation lesson the instructor of which is Mustafa Tekin for the first time. Wicker Park which is directed by Paul McGuigan in 2004 is a good example of romantic and dramatic film genre. The flashbacks in the film applied very well and the film was directed brilliantly. The soundtracks of the movie were perfectly composed by their composers. The songs absolutely heighten the emotion of each scene. The camera-work is extremely well done. The use of flashbacks helps fill in the details of Matthew (Josh Hartnett) and Lisa's (Diane Kruger) relationship. Probably one of the most memorable scenes of this film for me is the end scene in which Matthew (Josh Hartnett) and Lisa (Diane Kruger) found each other. When I watched this scene, I was stirred but I was so happy too. Some people might think that it seems predictable but I do not think so. It just seems real. That emotion felt with the song just makes you feel for these characters and really shed a tear. One of the other most important things is that although we do not agree with Alex's actions, she becomes more vulnerable and human to us. We understand it with the help of the film flashbacks. All the characters in Wicker Park movie are excellent in their roles. The characters were eccentric and go to such great lengths for love. In my opinion Wicker Park has to be one of the most romantic and dramatic films of this decade. I wish everybody would watch and see it for its beautiful score and direction. Ignore the comments which are negative for the film. Just watch. I really enjoyed and liked it. I am sure that you will like it too! It is worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wicker Park is a difficult film to follow, but not a difficult one to like. Something about it recalls Atom Egoyan's method. The plot, when considered in detail, is contrived, but the movie is directed in such a manner that it feels believable. It is subtle, and toned down, and it gives its characters enough room to breath. It is enough to make us care at least. As a romance, Wicker Park is not great but it is certainly above average. It is unconventional and delightfully devoid of cliché. Josh Harnett, Diane Kruger, and Rose Byrne, are not great actors, but Wicker Park brings out the best in them. I'm glad I saw this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An odd little movie, this film stars Josh Hartnett, Diane Kruger and Rose Byrne. It follows Hartnett's character as he becomes obsessively in love with Kruger's character. Unfortunately for him, Byrne's character becomes involved in the mix when she tries to take on the identity of her friend (Kruger) and get Hartnett's character to fall in love with her. It's a little hard to follow, this is not a movie you can breeze through, and it does require concentration to fully appreciate it. But I would say it's definitely a decent movie. Hartnett is a little wooden at times, and this was Kruger's first major American film. But to me the standout is definitely Rose Byrne. Worth checking out if you're a fan of any of the stars, or quirky more offbeat films.</fullReview>

One day, he meets a very beautiful attractive woman, Lisa, and is getting going out with her without saying to his fiancé. He is so happy to be with her and thinks that's what he wants even he knows he is hurting his fiancé. On the other hand, his friend, Luke, gets a new cute girlfriend, Alex, and he is also happy. But everything is not going well and some mysterious things happen to him. Lisa suddenly disappeared and he just keeps finding her and something else happen around these four people. This one person makes the world around them so confused?.Nobody can expect the ending of this movie. The beginning of this movie is slow and everything is mixed up so we don't know what's going on but the end, everything is connected. You can't miss every single scene. The actors are not that big famous, except Josh Hartnett which is one of the good points of this movie, but their performances are great. This story and their performances attract me into this mysterious world. It's just amazing. I already watched it twice but will surely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can somebody tell me the name of the song playing right after Coldplay's The Scientist. It's when the credits are on. Also when I saw the commercials for the movie,it led me to believe that someone would be murdered or foul play. I should have seen the PG13 rating in the beginning. If this movie were really true, would Matthew tell Lisa he slept with Alex, or did Alex tell Lisa when she was talking to her on the phone at the airport? I also felt sorry for Matthew's fiancé. She had no clue of what was going on. H e would have to do some more explaining, if that were me. If this situation really happened, I doubt if any woman would walk away just like that. They wouldn't give up so easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fascinating surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before i first watched wicker park, i thought it was just another psychological thriller involving a femme fatale. But i was totally wrong, this movie is much more than that. It's at the same time funny, suspenseful and romantic (actually the love story between Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger is one of the most touching i have ever seen on screen). I do not agree with some other reviews saying that the plot is somewhat confused. OK, it surely requires a little intellectual effort because of the many flashbacks and the different points of view. But the informations are revealed with perfect timing and at the end there are not that many holes left. The story is fascinating and surely will keep you hooked until the very end. Besides the soundtrack is wonderful.The only real flaw: Josh Hartnett is as bad as usual. Diane Kruger is not always convincing either (but then again, she is so pretty that one is easily indulgent about her performance...). Rose Byrne, on the other hand, proves that she is a great actress.I think that this film is definitely a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two movies I have recently seen but not paid complete attention. The first one is "Birth", with Nicole Kidman, which I have to rent, intensely watch and write about. The other one is this film, a sort of remake, screenplay-based from a French picture stuff; called "Wicker Park". The title fits with the movie perfectly, and when I think that "The Apartment" could have worked better, I recall that this centers itself deeply on the love story; thing that the other one didn't probably do.I want to compare the film with "The Butterfly Effect", but not because of the confused time-lines and unpredictable story. "Wicker Park" seems like a first feature by a rookie director, but it is Paul McGuigan's fourth shot at directing a full-length project. I don't mean what I said because the film doesn't seem crafted or something like that, I mean it because of the excessive use of style and the selection of something far away from the typical. I have to see McGuigan's previous work, but what I can tell for now is that he has a good eye for main themes, and makes the viewer realize what is that he's treating.Going back to the comparison with "The Butterfly Effect"?The camera moving round and round, you know? The young classified actors that try to make a change in terms of depth, the story that messes with the life of a small group of people. And this is not competition; I'm not suggesting that a movie copied the other, I'm just using the comparison so I can talk about the aspects of it.The young people here are two best friends, Matthew (Josh Hartnett) and Luke (Matthew Lilard), involved with two girls, Lisa (Diane Kruger) and Alex (Rose Byrne); one for a long time now, another one is just starting. Now the movie will find a way to make them go round and round at the Carrousel. Brandon Boyce, creator of the disturbing "Apt Pupil", uses his skills here to move characters from now to then. His dialogues don't always sound spontaneous, and sometimes Boyce surpasses too much for the good sake of the story; alongside the direction, it's an extremely solid work.And the cast is something marvelous to talk about. Josh Hartnett is the main name on the poster, as was Asthon Kutcher in "The Butterfly Effect's". They are looking for people to forget what they're commonly known for. Kutcher wanted us to forget his stupid face and look. On the other hand (although he might not have chosen the perfect movie), I believe Hartnett's in for the growth. He has that special way of talking, rough and softly; which changes between drama and comedy. I saw "40 Days and 40 Nights" and "Hollywood Homicide", then saw "O" and this film: there's a difference, and there's talent.Matthew Lillard lies more in the Kutcher position: He's done some stupid things! He tried to convert the 'funny guy' image with "Thir13en Ghosts", but please. Here you have to recognize he's not annoying. The other two main characters are played by two very beautiful ladies who made their name in Hollywood with the same movie: "Troy". They're both truly great, and there's a lot of way ahead of them. It was hard to accept that the cast was perfect with "The Butterfly Effect", a better movie than this one. "Wicker Park" is a brilliantly acted film that keeps you awake for two hours with love, drama, a dose of suspense and Coldplay's "The Scientist" at the end of its exhilarating journey. Who can reject "The Scientist"??</fullReview>

PLEASE do not think this is a stalker film, cause even though there is a stalker ( 2 in fact, i guess) that is not the what comes across most from the movie. You are totally dragged into the storyline- u have 2 be really, because it is composed of flashbacks. I'm not saying the way the flashbacks are done are totally smooth or the best in cinema- but they didn't affect my enjoyment, despite momentary confusion! Characters are played brilliantly, you get such a sense of what they are like, and i could pick out a few similarities from people i know, they felt so familiar! Josh Harnett is not the best actor, but this comes across as a thoughtfulness in the character, fitting the role. Although a romance, it didn't feel soppy, more tense actually (you end up hitting a lot of things while watching), until the final scene-which gives you a real warm fuzzy feeling! The beginning didn't satisfy me completely, but stick with it. p.s. even better on the second watch!</fullReview>

I love every aspect of drama, deceive, and coincidence in it.Rose Byrne, Josh Hartnett,and Diane Kruger did a terrific acting.Diana Kruger seems very low key and I love it.We feel for them and of course Matt Lillard in very different mode turned his back slightly from comedy and lent his comic talent as this tragic bystander...And Coldplay song in the end, fit in just perfect....Love it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Matthew (Josh Hartnett) is a young advertising executive who begins a fanatical quest when he thinks he sees the woman he takes to be the love of his life,Lisa (Diane Kruger) leave a restaurant one day.And,after starting a new relationship with Alex (Rose Byrne) a woman who lives in his apartment complex,further revelations take him down an even darker journey...I was struck by the concept of Wicker Park for a very personal reason.There's a woman who was in my life five years ago who I wish would come back into my life again,like Lisa does to Matthew in the film.That,I think,would make it a lot easier for me to approach her and talk with her again.I do actually have the means of getting in touch with her again,but,being the coward that I am,I'm finding it impossible to pick up the phone and dial.I do hope I can summon the courage to make that call one day,because,although no one sees it or really knows about it on the outside,on the inside it is driving me crazy and ripping me to shreds and I know my life will never be truly satisfactory unless I at least speak to her again.So I could relate very much to Matthew's predicament on a personal level and that,if nothing else,engaged me in the film.But what also kept me engaged was the story.At first glance,it appeared disjointed,vaguely incoherent and kinda hard to follow,but as it went on,it became clear that this might be a film I'd have to maybe watch a second time to appreciate it on the level it actually meant to be appreciated on.Another bonus is the soundtrack,finely balanced between the moments of high drama and more light-hearted stuff.All the cast deliver excellent performances.Hartnett is entirely believable as the haunted young man,caught up in a whirlwind of romances that threaten to destroy him,with good support from Matthew Lillard as his snazzy best friend,and Byrne and Kruger providing captivating female parts.This can't be described as a perfect film,but,to anyone who can identify with it (as I can) it will certainly interest you and leave you with a number of angles to view from.***</fullReview>

Though not as suspenseful as it was expected to be, it was suspenseful in an emotional way. I fought to hold back tears at the end of the movie, and to be honest, I've never even come close to shedding any tears at any movie anywhere. I think Josh Harnett played a very good part as the good actor that he is, Matthew Lillard also played a very good part, and I thought that in general, the acting was perfect for the type of movie that it is.I found that the plot of the movie was very in depth. The use of flashbacks really gave the movie a realistic feel and also moved the plot along very nicely.

		<shortDescription>Nothing is a Coincidence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing is a coincidence and nothing is as it seems in WICKER PARK, the new movie (based on a 1996 French film called 'L'Appartement' starring Monica Belluci), starring Josh Hartnett and featuring Diane Kruger (last seen in 'Troy') and Matthew Lillard, who is slowly becoming the best actor of the generation, due to prime roles in 'Thirteen Ghosts,' 'SLC Punk,' and even 'Scooby Doo.' I'm not claiming it was good, I'm just saying he was its shining star. Give it a few years and he will be the top of the crop.Now? I saw WICKER PARK on Saturday Night, the 11:30 showing? with a girl! About 20 other people joined us. I saw it because the trailer looked really good and because 'Open Water' was playing too late.What I go was not what I expected. Granted, I like what I saw, but it wasn't a thriller like I was picturing based on the previews. While watching the movie, told in present-day and flashbacks, it seems like a lot of it is based on coincidence. At some point, you think it's far fetched. (I'm trying not to give away spoilers so I might sound a little too vague, but it's important I don't give away plot details). But, as the flashbacks give you more information and the present-day events advance (over the course of about 3 days), you realize that there are no coincidences. In the aspect that the flashbacks are used, the way the story is told is actually quite masterful. However, as I find is the case with a lot of movies that integrate flashback easily (namely, '21 Grams'), I became frustrated and thought to myself, 'Would they just tell me what's going on already!?' It dragged in places as a result, but maybe that frustration is what the makers were going for. Or maybe not everyone gets frustrated easily and enjoys that.It was a really enjoyable movie although starting out, I wouldn't have guessed. Syd Field once said that the first 10 minutes of a movie are the most important because they let you know if you'll like the next 110 minutes. I DID NOT like the first 10 minutes of this movie. It was basic exposition-gone-wrong, and the movie wasn't very good until Plot Point 1. However, it did get really good. BASIC PLOT DETAILS, NO SPOILERS Basically the plot is this. Josh Hartnett (Matty), is an investment banker returning to Chicago from a 2 year stay in New York for his job. He was with a girl named Lisa (Kruger) 2 years ago, before he got a job offer in NY and had to leave. But what happened to Lisa? Why did she disappear? And why does another girl named Lisa (Rose Bryne) have the same shoes in her apartment with the same broken heel? Lillard plays Luke, a smooth-talker who is a typical high-school-guy, just removed from high school and in the real world (aka a shoe store). He is Matty's best friend before and after his move.So Matthew moves away and 2 years later comes back. He runs into Luke (possibly the only coincidence of the entire movie) outside of a restaurant. In the bathroom, he thinks he hears Lisa's voice and goes to find her. He finds a hotel room key and goes to it and finds a ripped up article. Start the cat-and-mouse game.Part of the movie, especially the last 15, 20 minutes, reminded me of 'Serendipity,' in that it was someone searching for someone with nature (or is it?) holding them apart. It's a very high paced ending, and the very end is ruined by a song from stupid Coldplay.I realize this review is kind of weird, but I really don't want to give any spoilers at all. The movie unfolds (and is shot) beautifully and purposely, and I don't want to give details away. Go see it, it's worth it.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible, OK, but Rose Byrne was a saving grace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, yes, I am a guy and yes, Rose Byrne is great to look at, but, honestly? I thought her acting in this film kept me from going off the deep end on its obvious contrivances. But, then again, I also felt like the film wasn't really trying to draw the audience into any strong belief that it was taking itself too seriously. Huh? My wife was taken in a bit by Josh Hartnett, so it was easy for her to stay with the film. Diane Kruger playing Lisa, as the unreachable blonde was fine. I just have to go back to Rose Byrne's Alex who just had me with her passion (if that is what it really was...). I hope more of her films get to DVD status some day. I will hope for the best. Overall, pretty entertaining for a couple on a nice little date...heh heh heh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a refreshing little flick. I mean granted the whole plot of the movie was little stupid in terms of the miscommunication, especially since a little device called the cell phone is in existence. But I liked the unexpected twist, like for the first hour I totally thought cynically about Alex, so I was happy I was totally wrong. The only reason this movie didn't totally reek is because the last 35 minutes is funny as hell and the soundtrack is unbelievable, one of the best this year.The character I loved the most was Alex, and its only because Rose Byrne did a great job, she totally carried the movie. The chemistry between Alex and Matthew blew away the supposed "dying for my love" chemistry between Lisa and Matthew. I dunno, but if Diane Kruger wants a viable career, she should stop co-starring with Byrne. I mean this is the second time she massively out-acted Kruger. I must admit I was totally looking for Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom to make a cameo. Overall, I liked the movie, but its totally a renter...I mean I am so not clamoring to move to Wicker Park if you know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So said a barely-teen girl as she bounced in her seat, anxious for the movie and its star to appear. This audience member had braces, a touch of acne, a frequently chiming cell phone. She sat near lots of same-age, same-gender persons. They all trembled and squirmed and talked and giggled. Heck, the movie hadn't even begun! As for me (a non-teen, non-female), Josh Hartnett did his best acting to date but that doesn't say much. Matthew Lillard plays, well, Matthew Lillard. Diane Kruger and Rose Byrne are wonderful: they balance credible emotions, intensity, sexiness and vulnerability. The cinematography is sharp, ranging from Chicago in winter to wonderfully colored interior shots.Some of the chosen songs really enhanced the visuals. The storyline was intriguing enough but 'Wicker Park' suffered from 'clever auteur' syndrome. It's a shame the movie wasn't filmed by two directors (like 'Expectorcist'): we're stuck with this version. I give the film 2 stars for the wonderful shots of Chicago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this last night and didn't really go in with many expectations. In fact I thought it would be more of a thriller from the one ad I saw. I was pleasantly surprised with the story and thought it came out well. I know it was a remake but didn't know about the original either so I will have to see that at some point. Basically it was a pretty predictable movie, but was shot well and was entertaining. I thought it flowed well and didn't check my watch at all. Matthew Lillard played a familiar role for him, but it worked and the comic relief fit into the flow. It's not a movie where you have a lot of emotional investment in the characters, at least not to me, but still not a bad flick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the advanced screening. There were some moments that were just mind blowing because, dude this is a psycho/thriller/ love story but all the deceit and strong feelings that the viewer is able to feel just sitting there is great. I really liked how the story was told from going past to present constantly and seeing the same story from different people's point of view. The camera work was just absolutely brilliant and there were just moments when you gasped from the outrageous thoughts and feelings, it's just like I said. You're not just watching a story, you're there with the characters and that's very important. Oh and GREAT!!! acting by Rose Byrne and Josh Hartnett, i never saw either of their movies before (weird huh?) but they were so great. As usual Matthew Lillard's character made me laugh even at the most serious moments. I still didn't really get a good sense of how much Diane Kruger is capable of doing. I want to see her in a good role that will do her justice and show just how well she can act. She needs to really put herself out there and show what she can do. I recommend you see it, no it's not one of my favorite movies but it will definitely change your point of view on a lot of things. The movie keeps your brain buzzing afterwards, and props to them for using Coldplay's "the scientist" at the end (i love them lol)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to liking this film. Although the impressive cast all did their jobs very well (even Diane Kruger!), I thought the director and editors did them all an injustice in how they put the film together. It came out very cheesy and sentimental, rather than suspenseful.I found it predictable; and it insulted the audience with VERY heavy-handed symbolism and repeating images to make sure you got the connections, removing all guesswork. There was even a curious allusion to Breakfast at Tiffany's that didn't fit at all. It basically tried to do too much, whereas an interesting plot with just the actors and characters might have been enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wicker Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a life story well spoken. I haven't heard this movie's name before one of my my friends advised me. Firstly, while I was watching the film's first part, I didn't like indeed. After I watched the movie completely, I impressed so much. The guys love really impressed me and deeply effected of my heart. Main topics was first, really stable but, after half of the film I was really shook and rolled.I believe Josh did a great job with this part he played. Matt and Lisa are trying to find each other after being separated quite a long time against their will. I don't think Alex is to be blamed for what she's done because she fought for the same thing, love.I enjoyed this movie so much it even surprised me. Wicker Park was more then just good but this is a good date movie. It is not the best movie out there and could have been much better with more superior writing but it is okay. Part Psychological thriller, part romance it's one of those movies your pretty much riveted by through the whole thing.The photography had a rather dreamy tone which fit well with the story and the imagery was beautiful. For some reason this movie reminded me of really classic romantic films. I really enjoyed How involving the storyline was and how your never quite sure what is going to happen next. It easily could have gone in some worse directions but it never did.The soundtracks are really bad because it was depressed me on watching the film and unfortunately really classic. For some movies classic is good but even if the topic is classic and casts act like a ordinary romantic movie, it is not suit itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average remake with a few good things on its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing you need to know about this movie: it's a remake of an excellent French film L'Appartement. Whether you watched (and liked) the original is very relevant; Wicker Park owes all it's force, originality and quirkiness to it.This is everything but your usual romantic comedy, though the American version (Wicker Park) tries to be that at the end. Matt (Josh Hartnett) is a successful advertising executive who is about to get engaged. That is, until he sees - or believes he sees - Lisa (Diane Kruger), a woman he was in love with two years earlier, and who left him without notice. Apparently, Matt still has some strong feelings for her, so he starts an obsessive search for her. The film jumps between past and present, showing the important scenes from the perspective of Matt and somebody else, painting an intriguing story about the love and obsession.The problem is, while it tries to recreate almost frame by frame the French original (while avoiding some issues that Americans find inappropriate, such as heavy stalking and attempts of suicide), Wicker Park also struggles to find a voice of its own. But there are a few problems. First of all, with all due respect, Diane Kruger is utterly forgettable and bland. She doesn't make us believe a man can be that obsessed with her, while her counterpart in the French original, Monica Bellucci, does that with ease.Josh Hartnett plays Matt as a lonely man longing for affection, and he manages to make us believe he's this average guy so in love with a girl that he can't forget. It's probably worth mentioning he looks quite handsome in this film, maturing from a generic cute boy he was during the Pearl Harbor days. But the best thing about the film is probably Rose Byrne as Alex, the most complex of the characters.Wicker Park also tries to bring a different atmosphere to the story: while the original is darker, quirkier and has more of a thriller vibe, the remake focuses on strong feelings of love, loss and the need to be together with a special someone. This was a clever choice, because it makes Wicker Park's ending (which is much different than the original) in sync with the rest of the film. If they simply recreated the original movie, but with a different ending, it would have been horrible.Still, if you've seen the original, you won't be able to watch Wicker Park without comparing the two; and the original is simply a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was missing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Riddle me this:You are given a movie with an exceptional soundtrack (Even though Lover's Spit did not make the OST cut and *fortunately* the OST version of The Scientist was the Danny Lohner remake), a big -- albeit obtuse -- screenplay, above average acting, and a remarkably cruel and beautiful premise. However, this movie fails miserably in all essences.The beginning is quite confusing and failed to maintain my interest. I continued to neglect to pause when I left the room, which was actually the second bad sign. Bad sign number one: I LEFT THE ROOM. When I couldn't hear the dialog, I would rewind it to find that I hadn't missed anything of note.By the time the pieces were coming together, I had really lost interest in the main characters and their Hollywood oblivious passerby scenes (ecstasy to the droning masses). You watch enough of these movies (MGM lion, jump in the lake boy... just about anything you recognize at the beginning of a movie) and you learn that they aren't going to bump into each other until the most climactic moment in the plot (with only the loveliest of songs playing). It is disgusting how predictable these movies have become.While the characters were believable, the story failed to account for their actions or inactions. I was left with so many unanswered questions about motives because absolutely nothing in the movie escapes the barest and thinnest plot line. no auxiliary plots were present to cast insight into the behavior of the actors. "Simply take it as it is," you are instructed. But, for the house of cards built for the initiation and reinitiation of the plot... well, you simply cannot see their construction (nor can you recreate it without delicate and exhaustive rationalization).I am so sick of this "delineate the plot from the story" philosophy. So it has been successfully done a few times (Pulp Fiction). It has been butchered at least ten fold as many times. It's more used up than a 50- year-old Philipino "call girl". The reason that this was successful in certain movies is because the content within the delineated sections are independently substantial and valuable enough to be taken alone. To use this method just to confuse people is an easy route to abuse the childlike nature of the workaday slug. People see it and think: Mystery! This is no Agatha Christie novel however, and -- like a 10 piece puzzle -- after collecting enough pieces you can easily see where each one fits, but when someone is slowly meting out these pieces, most rational people become a bit annoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had a great film location in Chicago and the photography was outstanding. Josh Hartnett, (Matthew) is an advertising executive and engaged to his bosses daughter and they plan to get married in the near future. However, Matthew one day finds himself looking at girl from a distance and believes she is a girl he was romantically involved with and is still in love with her. This girl is played by Diane Kruger, (Lisa) and once this couple meets again there is no way you can separate this couple and they quickly become very much in love with each other. There is also a young gal named Alex, (Rose Byrne) who is really stalking Matthew without him even realizing what is going on and Alex manages to capture his attention and he goes to bed with her. There are many flashbacks through out this picture and it becomes rather complicated at times until the picture reveals some very dark secrets that Alex has been keeping a secret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In one of these posts, someone asked as to why one of the characters in the movie didn't leave a cell phone number instead of a store number. To be quite honest (SEMI SPOILER ALERT) a lot of the "pitfalls" in this film could have easily been solved with a cell phone, but thats mainly why i enjoyed this movie so much.(SPOILER) In this crazy technologically infested world, you can get so lost trying to talk to people from distant lands and places, yet the one person whom you want to speak to the most; its almost impossible to reach. And whatever it is you do hear from them, from whomever it is, you believe and savor those words like a last meal.I found this movie to be exactly like that; you savor all the bits and pieces of this puzzle until your completely satisfied with the result. But its the ingredients; the sparse words spoken, written, and missed between Matt and Lisa that just keep you hooked. like a new relationship or a crush (or more appropriately, like Alex) we are constantly kept hanging on their every word, just hoping and waiting for things to go our way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "Wicker Park" for the first time in September 2005,and I was truly overwhelmed. Since then, I have watched it over 5 times. I think the best thing that happens to this movie is the ending.After the whole searching process and all the intrigues of Alex's, Matthew finally got a call from Lisa, who then asked him meet her at the park. Matthew didn't make it and he went straight to the airport to catch her.The situation in the airport was a chaos, but Matt still found her. As he walked towards Lisa, everything was silent and "the Scientist" of Coldplay started to play.Matthew knelt down behind Lisa, who just got a call from her 'best friend', Alex. She was definitely stunned to hear the truth. Matt was still behind her, with tears in his eyes. Somehow, she finally noticed that there was someone behind her and when she turned, she saw Matt.Both of them shed their tears, hugged and kissed each other, but no words were spoken, because words just ain't enough to express their feelings. So, the director chose a perfect song for that, "the Scientist". The ending was perfect, except that I think it should take place at the Wicker Park.Anyway, the movie was greattt....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best emotional suspense romantic drama since Match Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my goodness. So I rented this movie just for something to watch. After seeing the trailer I was a little interested but after watching it the trailer really seemed to falsify what this film is actually about. There is suspense, but not as much as the trailer makes out to be. It's okay though.The acting was great. I never felt as if it was forced or melodramatic. The tone is somber, sometimes sad, but it picks up with a few laughs. The mood conveys suspense, you want the characters to succeed and you just can't help but sympathize with all of them. Even Alex (the dark haired girl).As the film progressed I saw the characters become ever entangled in this web of lies and whatnot. The movie builds to quite an emotional climax. I got chills down my spine when Matt(Josh Hartnett) sees his lost love Lisa in the airport. Then when he slowly goes after her and "The Scientist" by Coldplay starts playing I was transfixed. So so much emotion was there. Best ending ever.This is the second time a romantic suspense drama has created so much emotion in me. (Although Match Point starring Scarlett Johannson was pretty gripping as well.) I could have cried (this coming from a guy who enjoys hard hitting action). I just really got into this film. I am going to rush out and buy it. Perfect for watching with your girl, or dragging your boyfriend to see. Watch it once and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dare say this is one of the most enjoyable movies I've watched. I think the majority of people went into this movie having heard a little about it and already seen the trailer (which gives away the entire movie, basically). I was fortunate - channel surfing on cable TV when I came across it. Having no expectations or knowledge of the film, the twists and so on were able to work their full effect on me.There are some times where you think "ok, these coincidences require too much suspension of disbelief" but by the end of the movie, everything is wrapped up and complete. And you can see the entire movie, everything making sense.If you haven't seen it, DO SEE IT! But try to avoid reading the blurb or seeing the trailer, they give too much away.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGH: I enjoyed this movie so much it even surprised me. Wicker Park was more then just good, this was excellent. Part Psychological thriller, part romance it's one of those movies your pretty much riveted by through the whole thing.It was funny to see Diane Krueger and Rose Byrne both from Troy in this picture. They were both excellent. I thought Krueger was a little weak in Troy but then again her part was rather small. She shines here as one of the "Lisas" and Rose is outstanding as the "other one". This movie may appear at times to be a "Fatal Attraction" or "Single White Female" type picture but it is not. It's got a bit more depth and rather then turning into a horror movie it always stays more a drama. The character development is excellent and I was surprised at just how involved I got in wanting Hartnet and Krueger to find each other again.The story, even though it has numerous plot contrivances and is told frequently in flashback is powerful and involving. Many may consider this to arty for their tastes but I'd say give it a chance because the movie's good and the positives really do outnumber the negatives.The photography had a rather dreamy tone which fit well with the story and the imagery was beautiful. For some reason this movie reminded me of something from the eighties or early nineties. I really enjoyed How involving the storyline was and how your never quite sure what is going to happen next. It easily could have gone in some worse directions but it never did.Sometimes It's fun just to enjoy a movie that's a bit surreal and thought provoking in a way that might be psychologically mysterious perhaps but not scary in a "Fatal Attraction" kind of way. Wicker Park tells a story of love, obsession, confusion, betrayal, turmoil and the human heart. It's full of complexities and though aspects of the film are confusing and there are many plot contrivances that wouldn't happen unless they were happening in a movie, it's still a really good movie and a must see. Great song choice for the ending as well! My vote is 8.5 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie, I really have no idea what is thriller-romantic, but Wicker Park give me pretty clear answer. I really love this movie, because it's really enjoyable. All the cast play really good in the perfect portion.Josh Hartnett, plays a character who blind of love, Diane Knrueger plays as the lovable Lisa, Matthew Lillard as the love-loser, and Rose Byrne as the victim of love. at the first 45 minutes, I don't know where the movie will take me, but after that this movie really enjoyable and makes me sit in front of TV until the end of movie, i never saw a perfect movie like this. I enjoy the cast, story, the angle and also soundtrack. And Coldplay's song wrap this movie perfectly. What is hurter than un-reply-able love? Love is the perfect crime!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous and heart-wrenching tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a classic tale of a girl (or boy) falling in love with another who is not aware about the way the other person feels about them. Josh Hartnett plays the guy with whom Rose Byrne's character falls in love with and secretly yearns for, but he (Hartnett) is in a relationship with another beauty (played by Diane Kreuger), who one day suddenly disappears without a trace or so much as goodbye to her boyfriend. Hartnett's character, frantically in love and heartbroken, with the help of his slacker best-friend (played by Mathew Lilliard) begin to investigate. What they find out shouldn't shock you, if you're been suspicious from the beginning but if you haven't, then prepare yourself to be shocked by the lengths to which certain people will go to prove their love for another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! What a beautiful film. I was so surprised at how good this was. A very romantic film in which Josh Hartnett gives another great performance. The film is very smart, with some nice flashbacks that are incorporated throughout the film without warning. I don't really want to say much about the content of the film as I don't want to give anything away. Matthew Lillard's appearance in this film was the most surprising to me. He pretty much plays the same character he always plays but he comes off well as Josh Hartnett's best friend in this piece. Diane Kruger is very good as Lisa too. Her and Hartnett had some really good chemistry. The beautiful Rose Byrne is very good as Lisa's friend and is the key to the whole story. I would recommend this film highly, it is a very powerful, beautiful and romantic film with enough twists and turns to keep you entertained throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography is excellent...CLEARLY one of the best movies EVER. Very similar to the French counterpart, L'Appartement...however the ending is a bit different. Josh Hartnett does a hell of a job playing Matthew....This film, in addition to Pearl Harbor and Black Hawk Down, are Hartnett's BEST OF THE BEST. Diane Kruger is beautiful and really adds to Lisa's exotic European appeal. Alex is just creepy...the American version's "Alex" is a lot more realistic than the French one. Matthew Lillard is funny, handsome, and very likable in Wicker Park. Excellent casting, GREAT LOCATION! CHICAGO IS A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SETTING !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should be honest and say that having seen and loved L'apartment, it was always going to be hard for me to enjoy this film. That said for the most part this film is actually pretty good. As Wicker Park follows L'apartment's story line, it is impossible not to be mesmerised by the unravelling fate of the main characters. If viewed without bias I would guess that Wicker Park could be described as descent love story. Unfortunately for this film however its French predecessor is vastly superior. It has also opted for an ending that for anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing L'apartment will be pulling their hair out in despair. Without giving too much away, this film in its last few minutes takes away the most tragic aspect of L'apartment that quite literally blew me away. The lead actors of this film mostly do a great job in trying to make Wicker Park a good film. I was really surprised to see Josh Hartnett give such a mature performance in this film. I really feared for the film at first because I did not believe anyone could do as good a job as Vincent Cassel did in the French version. However Josh Hartnett does a great job in portraying a man whose emotions are tugged at and toyed with to an almost unbearable level. I also thought that Matthew Lillard was great in his role as playing Hartnett's emotionally vulnerable friend. The biggest problem with this film is Diane Kruger playing the mysterious Lisa. I cannot see that she has the kind of looks and personality that would keep someone like Hartnett's character pining for her for so long. Indeed the film fails to really depict the love that these two characters supposedly had for each other, instead Hartnett almost looks like a crazed stalker rather than someone trying to find and win back the love of his life. For anyone who has not seen L'apartment I would imagine that you will greatly enjoy this film owing to the intense plot and good acting that this film contains, but unfortunately for those of us who have seen the original, this film is really one remake that should be avoided.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superficial copy of L'Appartement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would just strongly suggest seeing "L'Appartement", the original movie from 1996, even if you already seen "Wicker Park".Although the screenplay of "Wicker Park" starts as an down-to-word translation of the plot from French to English, the movie further develops into cheesy and superficial interpretation of the original story. In an attempt to force the Hollywood-style happy ending, "Wicker Park" loses the plot completely and misses the beautiful story of "L'Appartement"'s divine unreachable love.In addition to this, the cast and the setting of "Wicker Park" falls short to the comparison to the original movie - the fantastic play by Vincent Cassel and Monica Belucci is just out-of-league for their Hollywood counterparts, as much as beautiful background of Paris is just incomparable to grayish and trying to look "cool" and "lively" Chicago cityscapes.Hollywood, please stop making cheesy copies of European and Asian classics and let the people enjoy the real art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was absolutely beautiful in every aspect of the word.the camera-work is extremely well done, and, despite some comments, the plot has no real holes. everything is revealed with perfect timing, and the songs absolutely heighten the emotion of each scene. the characters were eccentric and go to such great lengths for love. i love that. not only do we end up seeing that Alex has motive, we can almost relate to her....although we do not agree with her actions, she becomes more vulnerable and human to the audience.the best thing about this film is the intensity of the love we feel between matthew and lisa. the anguish they have felt the past two years from being unknowingly torn apart by a vindictive and crushed "friend" of lisa's.and the end of the movie is perfect, when they see each other for the first time in two years, after a desperate four day search.....she turns, there is the feeling of disbelief, realization, then they just melt into each other and take it all in. i loved it.this was the first movie i've seen in the theaters in a long time that i came away with SO much more than i had expected. i've recommended this movie to everyone i know, and everyone who's seen it who i know has felt the same way i do....maybe not with as much passion as i do.....but similar.DITTO</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a forewarning to those who might want to turn this movie off after it's slow start--Don't! Wicker Park eventually gets going and having turned it off myself I completely regretted it when I saw it the second time because it is simply a great film. Atmosphere, story, acting... every element is fine and the believable performances from the cast elevate this psychological-romance-mystery way above average. Both Hartnett and Lillard turn in decent, mature performances, however it is hard to shine in the presence of scene-stealing newcomer Rose Byrne. Her performance was definitely praise-worthy and I hope to see her in future films. That's all I am going to touch on cause I don't want to spoil the movie for everyone else. My rating is 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting the "Wicker Park" you saw from the advertisements, you'll be sorrily disappointed. Wicker Park is supposed to be about this crazy stalker girl(Rose Byrne) who is obsessed with Josh Hartnett's character, but it is Hartnett who in the "beginning" of the movie stalks Diane Kruger's character, until she goes out with him.I say the "beginning" of the movie because "Wicker Park" is partially one of those annoying flash back, non-linear movies. It just doesn't work. The movie is too contrived and in trying to surprise the viewer, it makes the movie quite clichéd. I managed to figure out most of "complex" story lines half way through.By the end of the movie, particularly the scene when Matt and Alex finally "meet", I was laughing my butt off because it was too ridiculous, too artificial. It made me feel like I was watching a really bad soap opera. I don't want to give too much away.I have seen worse films, but I'd advise anyone out there thinking about renting it: You probably have to be a Josh Hartnett fan to enjoy this movie. And also, if you liked "Gossip", you might like "Wicker Park"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most frustrating movie i have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The previews for Wicker Park really got me excited. Oooo, a woman obsessed with a guy! How scary! Honestly, that's what i thought. I saw the movie on the plane ride to Paris, and the entire time I was mentally screaming at the characters. Over all, it wasn't a bad movie...not The Others or the Sixth Sense...but not a bad flick. I had hoped for something a little scarier, but this movie was a great plane ride movie. If only it wasn't so frustrating! Every time you thought everything would work out, something random would happen and we-the audience, would be back, leaning in the chair, waiting for the next exciting scene. See it, but don't expect a great movie. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this same story on numerous soaps. This movie was billed as being like a Hitchcock film. Far from it. I can't go into depth without giving away the plot, but "surprise" was hardly the emotion I felt when the secrets were revealed. It was irritating and frustrating. Again, this is something soap writers have been doing for years. If you really want to make a suspenseful movie, make sure the audience finds out what's going on at the same time as the main character, not way before. Also, it would be a good idea to have your characters behave, even remotely, like real people would. I spent a great deal of time while I was watching this film asking myself "who would do that?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not with a bang but a whimper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a whole hour, I was wondering why critics hated this movie so much. The direction was interesting, the acting passable, the script absorbing. The movie kept dropping interesting clues: the torn newspaper, the sleeping pill, the recurring Chinese imagery, Shakespeare's King Lear. And the premise of a girl who claims to be somebody else - although used in Hitchcock's Vertigo - isn't so worn out that it's cliché.Then, the movie lost me...first we switch from Josh Hartnett's character in the driver's seat to a peripheral supporting character who drives the second half of the movie up until the terrible last minutes. We learn the source of the "mystery" quickly into the first hour and the movie loses all scope and intrigue from there. Suddenly, the movie starts morphing into Fatal Attraction - so naturally I expect a suspenseful or violent conclusion.Again, the movie drops the ball. About the worst thing this so-called crazed stalker does is attempt to block cell phone calls (doesn't anybody have call waiting?) Then, she essentially ends the movie by apologizing and saying it was all a misunderstanding. We went through Vertigo and Fatal Attraction to get to an afterschool special.I looked at the deleted scenes thinking there must be an alternate ending. This ending can't possibly belong to the beginning of the movie I saw. But, surprisingly, if any major plot change occurred down the line, it had to be during the writing process.I think the main thing is, they saw they had Josh Hartnett in the movie, and felt like they had to sell it to teenage girls, not even grown women who might enjoy a chick flick as a guilty pleasure, but the Disney Channel set.This director seems promising, and I really hope he finds material that's worth his time. Hartnett's not getting any younger either, so I think his scope needs to expand beyond the teenyboppers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like wicker furniture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always thought of wicker furniture as cheap and uncomfortable as compared to "real" wood furniture.And, unfortunately, this movie pretty much comes out the same way when compared to the "real" movie - "L'Appartement", a sizzling thriller with characters that were much more interesting (particularly Monica Bellucci).The film starts well and is stylishly directed and fairly well-photographed, but loses its way quickly and never generates enough power to feel like anything more than a late-night, direct-to-video erotic tease. Why? Because a movie like this needs certain things to keep the viewer in tow with the winding plot - striking visuals, profound moments of symbolism, and an ensemble cast whose characterizations create a mesmerizing ebb and flow of alliance and conflict.And unfortunately, this fairly interesting cast is unable to rise above the banal script and plot implausibilities. And really, so much even for the eroticism - there's not a lot of chemistry between star-crossed lovers Josh Hartnett (playing the confused Matthew) and Diane Kruger (the elusive Lisa). Kruger, probably best known for impersonating Helen in the bomb known as "Troy", weakens the film in particular as she seems to struggle woodenly with the English language. Rose Byrne, cast in the femme fatale role that Romane Bohringer essays so well in the original movie, is not particularly believable as she stumbles onto the scene about midway through and attempts to play catchup with the plot as it slowly winds its way down the drain. Matthew Lillard was much more enjoyable playing Scooby-Doo's buddy Shaggy than passing as the movie Matthew's hapless friend.I'd give it about 3-3.5 stars out of 10 and recommend that you see films such as the original "L'Appartement", "Diabolique (1955)", "Body Double", "Crimes of Passion", and/or "House of Games" before even thinking about taking this off the video rack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the storyline for the film was solid enough perhaps a little unoriginal but none the less adequate. What I really did not like about the film were the numerous flashbacks. It would at times get confusing and it was hard to pick up from an event right after a flashback. It was like the scenes were scattered like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, which unfortunately was a lot of pieces. I was really expecting a better ending to film. I was expecting a chaotic or at least a livelier end to the film.The director also used quite a lot of split screen shots that seemed rather awkward. There were also a lot of shots that were shaky and could have been done better.In terms of the acting performance, I thought that Rose Byrne shone the brightest among the three lead actresses. She really fit the bill as the villain in the movie and was very convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really was disappointed in "Wicker Park." The previews made me think it was some sort of "Swimfan"-esque movie where a girl goes crazy and takes another girl's identity and tries to steal her man. But in actuality, Rose Byrne's character of Alex isn't even introduced until about 45 minutes into the film. And to make matters worse, leading up to it you'll find yourself saying, "I don't follow this at all..." because the filmmakers were obviously going for an avant-garde feel by making the movie a disjointed mess. It's really confusing and although it somewhat comes together at the end, the plot holes are enough to drive a truck through. Matthew Lilliard as Luke and Josh Hartnett's wife in the movie are basically forgotten about at the end and left to be miserable as the audience is supposed to feel happy for the ending...sorry, I didn't feel it at all. The only upside is that Josh Hartnett does a decent job playing the man that everyone wants, yet he still seems tormented over it. Boo hoo. This won't make it on anyone's top 10 list for best films of 2004.</fullReview>

The only reason why the movie kept my interest and had me wanting more was when Rose Byrne entered the scene. I think she is one of the most beautiful women I have seen in a long time. She reminds me of a young Sophie Marceau. This isn't a bad movie if you can be patient enough to wait for the events to be explained. It is definitely a dating movie.

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that is unlike anything you have seen before, and I'm a big fan of the unpredictable, even when simple. It's a step in the right direction for film, and for people who love to think about film.This movie breaks things open, it looks inside. A film; sometimes a montage, there a story, here a dream, a memory.... we feel things deeply in life, then this movie is a work of art. There was a scene near the end, when he goes to meet Lisa at the park, and you're so sure this is it, the movie is only a drawn out diatribe on the pointless futility of romance - and soul mates.. finding true love... but yet again, the minute we become linear the movie cuts deeper, and we are shown a complexity, both raw, and beautiful. This movie does this on several occasions, we get our first taste early on.The directing, music, acting, dialog, are all exquisite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, superb suspense but as said takes a while to get going</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi I am only 15 and I thought this film was great. Although as stated above it does take a while to get going. As said I'm only 15 and I understood the plot so for you dummies who say you got confused you might want to pay attention. It's as if someone has written a clever story, cut it up and then mixed all the pieces around.As someone said the only possible floor is the fact that a simple mobile phone (cell phone) wasn't used is quite annoying. However I don't have a mobile and I am at the peak age for having one. Not all people have them and it is not necessary for everyone to have them. Plus for the amount of near misses that occur during the film. Especially the scene at the end with the engaged phone etc then it is highly likely that something would have happened to stop them getting in contact via mobile phone (cell phone) anyway. That is another good point I thought you Americans could put people on hold. Rather than getting engaged. Surely if this is true. Matthew could have talked to Lisa when talking to Alex etc.Although this film isn't really targeted at my age group (well apart from the appearance of Josh Hartnett for the girls) I still thoroughly enjoyed it and so did the three girls who were with me. Who being honest aren't exactly very clever and yet TWO of which understood it fully. So don't make excuses for your lack of attention and understanding, this film is fantastic.Best film since I Robot definitely maybe better. I Like they way that both are mystical and yet have no floors.Recommendation - go and see this film, would love to watch again. Along the lines of Bourne Identity and The Matrix. That took a long time to get going and yet that is one of the most celebrated films ever.Rating: 8-9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stinker - very slow - not worth $7</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie trailer a few months back really made this movie sound like a thriller, very suspenseful. WRONG! It was so slow and there were so many flashbacks (not confusing though) that I just wanted to scream "get on with it!" and I wasn't alone. I have to say that no one walked out on the movie so I guess we were all a bit intrigued to see where this slow mover would take us. In the beginning of the movie, you hear that Lisa (the love of his life - Josh / Matt) is having an affair with a married man, we don't know if she knew he was married or not. At some point soon after you see that the married man (who seems obsessed with Lisa) is down on the street watching Matt and Lisa (he thinks) about to make out upstairs and you think maybe he's going to go up and stop it or attack Matt (and be part of the plot), but you never see him again or find out why Lisa was having an affair with a married man?? Maybe I just missed that part. Anyway I'll cut to the end of the movie...When Matt (Josh Hartnet) finally sees Lisa (not sure how he knew it was really her since her back was to him) he goes up behind her. She is kneeling on the floor and he does the same, she with her back to him. He starts crying and can't or won't say a word - keep in mind she still does not know he is behind her - and the theater broke into laughter (I kid you not!) and when she turned and saw him, my husband and I left. PLEASE! This movie was a big waste of money...and believe me I love movies and spend a lot of $$ on them. If you really like Josh and want to see it, make it a matinée or rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What started my path to Wicker Park was an interview I read in Instyle-zine about Hartnett. I almost skipped the pages because I've never seen any of his movies. His responses were interesting and made me want to see what he could offer. He offered and I accepted his performance.I was already informed that this was a French-remake, and actually had to retell the tale this morning (not easy to do because you start to confuse yourself just trying to explain it all).What made this movie even more interesting was seeing Lillard two days after watching his performance in "Love's Labour Lost" where he sings and dances in one of the very few non-tragic Willy Shake's conceptions.So being a Euro-remake (of which I haven't seen) piqued my interest and I went although the previews were giving me the creeps. And so blaaah (what I say when I could go on for days because there's so much to say).Movies are made to escape reality. In fact, this movie, on some level imitates life. There are those small details that live unknown to those to which it would matter most and keep them apart, and this movie floats on this reality. Although this was helped by an obsessive heartbroken individual.The effect this movie had on me while viewing was very active. I am usually quiet and require silence. The twists and turns kept me going. This movie actually shook me off it's trail. Heavy reliance on foreshadowing helps me predict most movies, but initially I was thrown off.My top three fav parts: 1. Hartnett's tears when he truly believes he's been abandoned. 2. The last scene with the Coldplay tune and the look on Hartnett's face like he's breathing her in and is afraid to even touch her. 3. The look on her face as if she feels him behind her is PERFECTION.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matthew (Josh Hartnett) sees Lisa (Diane Kruger) on a camera's videotape that was left by a customer to be repaired at the photo shop. Lisa has a mesmerizing effect upon him, and when he sees Lisa window-shopping across the street, he follows her to find out who she is. He meets her in a shoe store and gets a date. They soon fall in love, and it changes his whole life, because now everything is perfect. She is a professional dancer, and whenever she gets time off, they meet in Chicago's Wicker Park. One day after he wants her to move in with him, Matthew goes to Lisa's home and finds that Lisa has vanished without leaving a message or calling him. Matthew gets a job in New York and tries to forget Lisa. After two years, Matthew has moved on, and now he is about to be engaged to the boss's sister. Matthew's job is now located in Chicago, and he runs into his best friend in front of a restaurant. A few minutes latter, Matthew thinks he sees Lisa in the restaurant, and it triggers his emotions. He puts his life on hold to search for her. He must discover the reason she left him two years earlier. For a love story, the movie is a little boring. The story has many twists and turns that reveal the truth through flashbacks. You will have to concentrate to keep track of what is happening to whom with so many flashbacks. They could shorten the movie, because I looked at my watch 4 times. (MGM Pictures, Run time 1:54, Rated PG-13) (3/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it can pass for a good movie, this is a just a poor remake of L'appartement, staring Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci, with (of course, because this is Hollywood, not Europe) a happy ending. This just shows the lack of creativity in American movie industry. The producers and the director did not, even, have the courage to keep the original ending. They changed it to make sure people came to see it. In doing so, they just made a chick- flick. When I saw it, all I felt were things in my stomach and they weren't butterflies! If you liked Wicker park, check out the original. Much better! A real romantic thriller. But this can still get by as an OK pass-time, can't say that it's all bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good guys" and "bad guys"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that in so many Hollywood films I am routing for the "bad guy"?This is one of those films. The "good guy" is supposedly so wronged by the "bad guy", the good guy is of course entitled to feel this way because he is naturally without fault or just enough fault to appear human. Not. The good guy in this is deceitful from the start and yet he gets off very lightly in the end.The plot is mostly transparent. I am left with the impression that there was a reasonable idea here for a story which could have been carried off far better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overbearing and glossed up to the max, but pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is ideally a romance/mystery type movie for the soft of heart, and it does what it intends to do very well. If you're the type of person who needs a lot of sappy, heart-to-heart, weepy romance films in your life, then this movie is definitely one you should check out, because it's actually a very good weepy romance movie. The love-square that erupts through the course of the film is a complex one, but it doesn't feel fake or contrived, so they get points for that. Director Paul McGuigan is certainly intriguing in his methods here; choosing to tell the story in a half-Memento-esquire enigma, veering back and forth between flashbacks and the present day. It's initially extremely confusing, but you get the hang of it about halfway through and realized what has been going on. Very cool style of directing, and it would work a lot better with a five-star film.If I had to pick at something, it would be the fact that this film is absurdly pretentious and showy, with little reason for it to be such. The minute I saw the words 'film noir' written on the back of the DVD box, I figured there would probably be some level of self-gratification somewhere in this movie, and I was right. It's not necessarily a detractor, and it might seem odd to some people, but Wicker Park carries with it a 6 inch thick sterile, polished gloss over everything else. This movie really wants to impress you, and it really wants to show you how cool it can be with the stylized and pompous style of storytelling and the overly dramatic and emotional performances, but it just doesn't work for me that well, not like it tries to.There are several plot-holes, as well, and that certainly doesn't help much. This is a confusing movie, and even though most of it makes sense by the end of the film, some things are just left as dead ends. For instance, what of this "Daniel" character? I don't think that was ever revealed, even though his name was mentioned several times throughout the film in different contexts (Lisa's ex-boyfriend, then someone she needs to call, and also Alex/Lisa's stalker?). They could've just left his name out of the movie, but in the typical Memento fashion (though botched here), they left it open-ended and confusing as hell. Also, the number of coincidental ways our two lovers never meet up is staggeringly high, and one is left wondering how it was so hard for the two of them to find each other in a modern day world of computers, email, and cellular phones. I could go on and on, but the plot-holes here make the movie far more time-consuming than it should be.But overall, if you're not a critical person, and you just want a good romance/thriller type flick to curl up on the couch for on a lazy winter evening, then this is a good pick. It's not the most solid film, and it definitely relies on style more than substance to create it's palette of ideas and emotions, but it's interesting and nothing too bad at all. Recommended if you think this is your thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this could maybe be described as a "chick flick" and I'm actually surprised that I made it through to the end on this one, but I'm glad I sat through the whole thing. It was an odd movie. It really tested your "suspension of disbelief" and used some odd camera shots, especially in the beginning for no other reason I could surmise but to prove that the director was going to be taking some risks in the movie.I had no idea what this movie was supposed to be when I watched it, and that's a good thing. It could've been a murder mystery, could've been a romance, could've been some kind of psycho-drama - I just didn't know. Suffice to say that it actually had elements of all of these and more, and the acting was actually quite good. Josh Hartnett really tried to give an emotional performance without over acting and it really did work. I was very impressed by Rose Byrne, and the rest held their own. We were certainly expected to allow for a great deal in the way of "coincidence", so just do so (I mean we give Shakespeare a lot of latitude when it comes to that sort of thing, so why can't we in a modern movie?) and I think if you are willing, you will be happy with the ending and the movie overall. It's far from perfect, but I actually enjoyed the movie a great deal.</fullReview>

But the thing was, that according to Alex's flashback/ story, she was on the street with Lisa when Matthew saw Lisa and followed her. And she was on her way to bring the soundless tape to get fixed.Alex hadn't brought the soundless tape in yet while Matthew saw Lisa on the street, but according to Matthew, the soundless tape event occurred before the on the street event.you kinda get me?But seriously, the time line.

		<fullReview>First of all, I would just like to say that I don't believe this movie was marketed well. What the advertisements led you to believe, is not at all what the movie is like.While, I suppose 90% of the movie does keep you intrigued, it only does so because you figure that you should at least find out what in the world is going on. In the end, I was left with a feeling of excruciating anger. I did not feel any sorry for any of the characters except for perhaps Luke, Josh Hartnett's best friend in the film.In the end, the first comment out of my mouth was, "None of this would have happened if that stupid girl, Lisa (played by Diane Kruger), could just deliver messages by herself."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware Hollywood Remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To this day I have refused to watch the Hollywood remake of Taxi (France 2000). How it was ever thought that this classic film could be improved by moving it to NY with Queen Latifah on board, I'll never know.Unfortunately, I have not been spared this remake of L'Appartement (France 1998). Unlike the original, with it's ingenuity, clever twists, and sensual acting, this americanized version has none of these. Okay, the twists are still there, as this IS a remake after all, but the film overall lacks that Je ne sais quoi.Josh Hartnett is as wooden as wood can be. Matthew Lillard plays his usual geeky character, but the girls are pretty.If you like classy films, watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleah! Bad Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I go to a movie I usually look it up on the internet or in a magazine, just to check if it's worth seeing. I read interesting things about this one: a beautiful woman that mysteriously disappears and mysteriously reappears... and stuff like that. Besides, it said "thriller". So I figured I'd see it. Biiiiig mistake.The movie was a huge disappointment. I had expected it to be full of tension, suspense and maybe for some of you watchers out there it really was. I didn't see it that way. Maybe I asked too much from it. But I had expected something spectacular, some shocking explanations for my questions. And in the end it was all so simple and uninteresting...The first five minutes bored the hell out of me. Then it all becomes so sappy and cheesy and over-emotional starting with the moment he sees her dancing right to the point where she says: "Take my picture, I feel beautiful tonight!" Oh give me a break! We all saw "Love story", we were all moved! Now give me a barf bag! Anyways, she disappears. So we all suppose that she's involved in I don't know what obscure situation. That she needed to run. That she was chased, threatened! This guy appears, Daniel, who's wife oddly died in a bizarre accident. Then we find out that she had an affair with him. So maybe he killed his wife so he could be with Lisa... a lot of ideas come to our mind! Something odd is going on here! Must see what happens! Chill, everyone! Nothing happens! He appears in this movie only so Matt can find Lisa's apartment key. That's his whole meaning. And this is the end of the amazing thriller. That's all.Then we start to find out the whole story: How Alex was in love with Matt, how he kept them apart! That seemed to me the most annoying part of the movie! A stupid game of circumstances where they both love each other and they both think they've been abandoned by each other. Frustrating and sappy. For we find out that Lisa really loved him! And she really wanted to be with him. And she cries (for me, that ruined the whole Lisa character), and he cries, and Alex cries. And they're all sad and they cry. Which brings me to another question: if Lisa believed Matt to have cheated on her, how come she forgave him so easily? The best scenes were the "coffee in a champagne glass" scene and the scene at the restaurant when Matt meets Alex, which was so funny that i couldn't stop laughing! Oh, and I really did appreciate the Coldplay song at the end, it's one of my favorites.So all in all, the movie bored me. The memory game was indeed very well done and "Matthew" is indeed really good looking but that isn't enough to make a good movie.But why believe me? Go ahead and see it! Maybe you'll like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this one in a movie preview, but it didn't have a title then. It's a great story and I would definitely recommend it. My only qualms with it, and I wrote this in my review when I was at the preview was at there was totally unnecessary nudity. This would be a great movie for teens and students, but the nudity would make me regretful of showing this to minors. Who knows though, maybe they listened to my comment and edited some of it out. I hope so. I am not against nudity, but it was totally pointless in the movie from my point of view. I will go see it again when it comes out and it will be interesting to see how its changed, if it has. But even with the nudity, the story makes up for it big time. I only say that if you want to take younger people, just be on the ball, and when you see something that looks like it might get frisky, just cover their eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wicker Park tries to be dramatic...but isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tries very hard to be suspenseful, dramatic, and/or mysterious. But it tries too hard, and ends up being none of those things.The actors are not good. I had higher impressions of Josh Harnett than this...definitely not his best work.The plot is see-through and predictable. Every step of the way, you see a 'dramatic' element that is entirely, blindingly obvious.The direction is not good. In fact, at times the movie falls over itself, with accidental exposures that seem out of sequence. At one point, we see Josh's character driving around in a car. Several scenes later, he asks to borrow the car from his friend, and his friend gives him the keys...to the same car...how did he get it the first time?Again in the blindingly obvious, still using the car sequence, the friend tells him that he can borrow the car, if he has it back by 6pm. You KNOW he won't have the car back on time...and he doesn't. Wow, a surprise that isn't, because we already know Matthew is unreliable. It would have been more surprising (and perhaps make us like the character better) if he had made the effort to get the car back on time.It is easy to predict when you meet the second 'Lisa' that she's a psycho. Of course, Matthew ends up falling for Alex's (the fake Lisa's) machinations, and even ends up sleeping with her. Of course, he is in love with one girl, engaged to another, so we like him even less. Sadly, by that point you dislike both characters, so you don't really care what happens to them. Alex is stringing along Matt's friend...but he's a pathetic loser, so you don't care about him either.We find out just how psychotic Alex is...through a thoroughly unbelievable set of circumstances, she keeps the two love interests apart.And thus, the entire movie drags on. Right to the scripted end where the main 'love interests' keep missing each other (using more coincidences), just to meet at the very end and fall in love again, in true movie fashion.</fullReview>

The triumph of love in this movie has heightened meaning for its redemptive value.

		<fullReview>(may contain SPOILERS.)I actually enjoyed the film. Well, probably because I walked in it not expecting anything because originally I wanted to watch something else.I like the way the story is told. It stimulates thinking and analyzing, and besides, it's the type of narration that, as one user already noted, demands your attention. However, the transitions between these scenes aren't exactly smooth, and may leave a viewer lost and confused (like my poor seatmate. i can hear her say every 10 minutes, "i can't understand anything!")The notion of a person driving two people apart is already cliché, but the director and the scriptwriter were able to give a new perspective to the film, in my humble opinion.Many users find the last scene sickening, but I found it sweet. I was convinced with the look of longing and relief and happiness in Matthew's eyes as he watched Lisa turn around. It's the same emotion one feels when one is watching a beloved sleep. Paired with the soundtrack, the scene gave me shivers (in a good way).The biggest mistake i made is that i watched this film alone. I highly recommend watching this movie with another person so that you can both love it or criticize it.Apathy is not for Wicker Park.

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Once again, we have a movie that is more exciting in its basic ideas than satisfying in its execution. But those ideas are worth exploring: telling a story through character-imagined flashbacks where all the major characters are creative artists. Each of the characters presents according to their narrative constraints. The guy is a photographer, so works with movie- based images. Indeed the whole thing could be seen as a movie fantasy played out in a glance at a video shop. The original love is a dancer, and is limited to a narrative bound by physical presence.The alternative love is an actress playing an actress. More, just as Josh's film (and drug haze) is folded into this movie, so is Rose's play within the play - which happens to be Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night' where lovers' identities are switched... and which contains its own internal folding. It is a sweet construction that is more of a complex idea and incomplete sketch than a mature narrative. But it has some strong moments when the Shakespeare play is happening (and unhappening as you see Rose remove her makeup in a backwards application). In comparison, the shoe thing is clumsy.As it unravels, it becomes a mere con for love. The end is unsatisfactory, radically compromised to be 'happy.' But who loved the strongest? Not the dancer who gave up when she moved away. Not the (very much prettier) boss's daughter who seems resigned to marrying the firm's new blood. Instead, it is the one who commits everything.Love is always having to say you're sorry, but never needing to.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie whose premise is better than the actual movie itself. In the opening credits of this book, this movie is an adaptation of a French movie or a book. I don't know how the book or the previous movie were, but this movie sucks. This is a convoluted story with an ending that left me with the attitude---who cares.*********possible spoiler***********Story is about an aspiring actress/bookish woman who lives across from a vivacious dancer. This actress is in love with a guy/aspiring photographer who is working at a camera store. She, however, never acts on this unrequited love. One day, the dancer argues with her boyfriend and escapes to the actress' apartment. They become friends and actress takes out her camcorder and films the dancer. Something in the camcorder goes wrong and actress takes it into the camera shop whereupon the photographer instantly falls in love with the dancer. He spies the dancer across the street and pursues her and dates her and they fall in love. Actress is devastated and jealous. At least several months into their relationship, he ask dancer to move in with him, she tells him she will answer him later. But before she could give him her answer, she is hired by a dance company to Paris. She leaves immediately but gives actress a letter to give to the photographer that she will move in with him. Actress sees her chance and destroys the letter and erases all messages on his answering machine from her. He does not know what happened except the dancer left him to Paris without any explanation. He becomes angry and hurt and takes a job in New York. The actress tells the dancer, who is still in Paris, that she saw the photographer in bed with another woman. Dancer cannot believe it but actress is persuasive.Fast forward 2 years and photographer is back in his hometown and is now engaged with a girl whose brother the photographer now works for. All three is at a restaurant when he sees a girl he thinks is the dancer but cannot be sure. At the same time, the actress sees the photographer who is now dating photographer's long lost best friend. And this goes on and on, and on..........*************end spoiler******************As you can see, the story is convoluted and seems interesting from the scenario I stated above, but when you are actually seeing it, it really is not good. Performance by the characters are fine but nothing great. The characters are not well developed and you feel no connection with any of them, save the actress in the end.

		<fullReview>Somehow the remake of a better French film should have been avoided at all costs. This film has a disorienting feeling the creators have given it as the action takes place in a period of two years. Some viewers will be lost as they watch the story unfold backward, then leap forward without making a lot of sense.The story of Matt and Lisa is told in flashbacks. Matt's obsession when he sees Lisa again, after some time, proves to be too much for him, as he has to go back and find her. Matt, who is going to marry the ambitious Rebecca, falls into a trance like state when he follows the clues that will take him back to Lisa. The fact that Alex, a woman who likes to impersonate a friend who has been too kind to her, plays into the plot until everything comes together when Matt finally finds the love of his life."Wicker Park" directed by Paul McGuigan sets the action in Chicago during the winter. Josh Harnett, Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne have some good opportunities in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Josh Hartnett's unibrow ensues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What exactly is Josh Hartnett's appeal? Ever since I saw him in Halloween H20 he's been spitting out one wooden performance after another, and his role in Wicker Park is no different. All he can do is squint his eyes, talk in a deep voice, scare us with his unibrow, and attempt to look like a young Tommy Lee Jones.His bland, monotone performance had a lot to do with lessening my enjoyment of this film. Beware, throughout the movie you'll constantly be reminded that he obviously graduated from the Keanu Reeves/Paul Walker school of Surfer Voice Acting, and unfortunately, it's sometimes distracting enough to pull you out of the actual story. What's worse is I didn't find his character to be all that likeable. In the interest of fairness, Stephanie (who is not a Hartnett fan either) thought he did all right here. She actually started to feel sympathetic to the character. I, on the other hand, thought the guy was a bit psycho and really didn't concern myself with his happiness.Let's see, he has a slight inclination that a girl in a restaurant is the girl he once loved but hasn't seen in two years. What does he do? Well, conveniently for him she accidentally leaves her hotel room key behind, so he decides to break into her hotel room, steal her compact, lay down on her bed, and sniff her pillow. Then, he steals a note that somebody else left under her door, and he leaves his own note. Keep in mind, HE DOESN'T KNOW FOR SURE THIS IS REALLY HIS LONG-LOST LOVE! In my eyes, this behavior is just a tad extreme. In Stephanie's eyes, "Love sometimes makes you do strange things." In the law's eyes, this is worthy of criminal prosecution.You're gonna also want to suspend disbelief for this one quite a bit. Hartnett misses a "very important" meeting in China, and his soon-to-be fiancée doesn't find out? No one would've called? And the way everybody juuuuust misses out on actually getting in touch with each other is a little unbelievable.Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the movie. The story is actually pretty interesting because the mystery of what's going on is handled quite well. A lot of the story is told in flashbacks. Some of the flashbacks go back a couple of years to when Matt and Lisa first met, but I really like how later on in the movie the flashbacks involve a different character's point of view of a scene we saw earlier. If you're not paying attention, then it can be confusing at first. But once you see how everything is coming together, it all makes perfect sense.The only thing I can say without giving too much away is that Hartnett is determined to find out if he really did see his lost love, and then from there you've got five people who are tangled up in a web of complicated relationships where some people may not be who they seem, lots of people are lying, and plenty will end up crying.So basically, Wicker Park is a big jigsaw puzzle. All the pieces are thrown on the table, the corner pieces are laid down first, and then everything else is pieced together in a non-linear fashion. Cool, that's great! But one of my problems is that the director tried to make everything just a little too artsy, and it was obvious he was patting himself on the back after every "artistic" use of slow motion and rotating cameras. You'll have to forgive me, but watching Josh Hartnett dance in slow motion or make out with a girl in slow motion is nothing but fast forward material for ol' Johnny Betts. Girls who love Hartnett will love this sort of thing, but guys like me will turn to their buddy and start making fun of it. The beatniks will stroke their pencil-thin coffeehouse goatees while discussing the symbolism of two characters drinking coffee out of wine glasses, but I just kept wanting to get back to the meat of the story.In my opinion, Matthew Lillard and Rose Byrne turned in the best performances. Byrne does a great job of displaying a range of emotions with her character. I know a lot of people won't agree with me, but I felt the most sympathy towards her. That's all I'll say. And Lillard provides a few nice doses of comic relief during scenes that were getting a bit too heavy and soap opera-ish.All in all, I got into the story once I started to realize how everybody's path crossed. Before that, we are witness to some stuff that appears to be absolutely ridiculous. But you've just gotta hold on for the revelations. The story is told with style, unfortunately, Hartnett doesn't display enough personality to make me root for him to find his true love, and he certainly doesn't need to be attempting any more crying scenes in the near future. Oh, and Josh, razors are pretty cheap; you should look into getting one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BLAH!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the WORST movies I have seen!!! The only good performance in here was Matthew Lillard's!! Even that left a lot to be desired. Josh Hartnett has proved to me, once again, his acting skills need more improvement then a little bit!!!! 30 minutes I was ready to walk out! The only reason I stayed was the person I went with talked me into it. The plot was very very predictable not to mention extremely slow in getting to the point, of which EVERYONE could guess, and waited more than necessary to get to. If I am going to pay these actors my hard earned money, a suggestion to them would be use the money to learn how to act!!!! Good News though, after the movie I did go and let the management know my view of the movie and received a free pass!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>convoluted confused coincidences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Simon (Josh Hartnett) is a NYC advertising executive with beautiful girlfriend Rebecca Martin (Jessica Paré). Returning to Chicago, he thinks he sees his old girlfriend Lisa Parish (Diane Kruger) who disappeared one day. He reconnects with old friend Luke Stanford (Matthew Lillard) and goes in search for Lisa. He is surprised to find another woman (Rose Byrne) who claims to be Lisa. It turns out that she's Lisa's former neighbor and friend Alex Denver.There are a lot of unlikely convoluted coincidences. It's also told in a confused way. The movie is trying too hard to be shockingly twisty. I think Diane Kruger as the dream girl needs less screen time in the beginning. It's a lot to pin on her performance. Matthew is so haunted that he drops everything to look for her. That is a high hurdle to clear and I don't think she clears it. The other problem is that the star-crossed lovers get tripped up by not talking to each other directly. She's the love of his life and he simply walks away from her. It's a thin premise. Rose Byrne is pretty good as the Single White Female character. The more I think about the plot, the less that I like about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Kruger Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker Park (2004): Dir: Paul McGuigan / Cast: Josh Hartnett, Diane Kruger, Matthew Lillard, Rose Byrne, Jessica Pare: Josh Hartnett works at Wicker Park as a digital photographer but the film hardly regards this. Rather it embarks upon the disappearance of his lady love who he discovers two years later. He is now engaged and about to close a business deal but he seeks answers. With striking Chicago locations director Paul McGuigan presents numerous surprises. One of Hartnett's best performances as a guy tortured by the disappearance of his girlfriend and the agitation in his search for answers. In his search he ends up juggling three different women, one whom he desires, one whom his desire long since died, and one whom left him feeling betrayed. Diane Kruger plays his past girlfriend in a role that is mysterious and only figured out in the end. Great supporting work by Matthew Lillard as Hartnett's best friend whom works in a shoe store, and doesn't realize that his girlfriend hasn't the love to return that he has given. Rose Byrne play's Lillard's girlfriend who is a strange theatrical actress, but she becomes involved with Hartnett after one captivating encounter. Jessica Pare plays Hartnett's fiancée who can only suspect that he will not remain faithful and that her life in family union is not for him. Mind bending film about regret and that considered lost. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too clever = confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that works here is Josh Hartnett. I don't know exactly how to explain it, but he just seems real and a really nice guy. Of course, for all I know he's not...but I enjoy watching him in films.The other thing that sort of works here are the other performances. Rose Byrne, Diane Kruger, and Matthew Lillard (in a more normal performance that how we usually see him) all do nicely.But to me, there's a huge problem that overshadows everything else. For me, the key to a good mystery is not making it too mysterious. And here I had the idea that the screenwriter and director were intentionally playing it real crafty, particularly with an excess of flashbacks, to the point that it got very confusing, particularly in the first half of the film.And to top it off, there is one scene that I felt was just one of the worst I've ever seen in any film -- when Harnett cries in a close-up. You can overdo the "he's very sensitive" routine, and that scene did. And, he's supposed to be overseas on a job and is risking that job by his love crisis. Geez! The film is creepy enough to hold your attention, but it could have been done just so much better, with less confusion. I'm tempted to give it only a 6, but tales of obsession are almost always intriguing, so I'll stick with a shaky 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and Boring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film ends up being predictable, downright silly and boring... Destiny makes it so that 2 persons that love each other behave in such a stupid and naive way, that they actually can't find each other, I'll leave the rest of the story for you to figure it out, which is quite easy actually.This film's tempo is slow to a crawl, when you pretty much guess what's going to happen next, the Director tosses around flashbacks to explain the silly way everyone acts in this movie, this makes the story unnecessarily long and tedious to watch, a 30 minute short film would have served the story in a much more respectful manner for the audience and more than enough to convey the general premise. It is quite sad to see Diane Kruger &amp; Josh Harnett on such a weak attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed to understand the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original French movie on a long haul flight in 1997 when I was 11 (captain's pick). I was so confused yet so intrigued when you know what became popular in the early 2000's I looked and found it again on my campus sharing network. The original made me a fan of French movies, of Monica Bellucci. I was also old enough to understand Max's choice in the end. And i was extremely intrigued with a movie that DARED to tear lovers apart. (I guess It's still a forbidden concept in America). Reading the comments here, I think the vast majority do not realize Wicker Park was a remake. It's not 'unique', it's not a 'never before seen concept', its just a remake of all those things. But I dare say it failed. For one the ending was completely changed. Which makes the movie predictable just like the rest. It took away the element of reality, that men actually have the ability to make judgement and not be led by love and obsession. I guess I prefer movies that tell the truth, like woody allen's Match Point, where people do get away with murder. In this sense, this movie took a great classic, made it Hollywood to appease the audience's appetite, but at the meantime destroyed the delicate relationships that intrigued in the original. More and more great modern Europeans movies are being remade in the US, please people, do your homework and at least give the original concept a try before the remake, you will be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit confusing but its quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a mystery romance which is quite interesting but you have to concentrate a bit because of the flash backs that happen quite abruptly. The premise is a recently engaged man sees his former love who who disappeared from his life and then tries to look for her. Diane Kruger is okay. Rose Byrne before she got too thin is quite good. Jessica Pare is pretty. What is strange is why so many women are in love with Josh Hartnett's character. Overall the story is a jigsaw puzzle bit confusing but it doesn't leave you hanging thank goodness and everything is explained. If they didn't it would be too frustrating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible But Engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker Park is a psychological mystery romance film that stars Josh Hartnett,Rose Byrne,Diane Kruger and Matthew Lillard. The movie is about a young advertising executive who thought that the woman he sees in a café is his long-lost love.The film is a remake of the French movie L'Appartement and it is directed by Paul McGuigan.Wicker Park follows a young executive Matthew's return to Chicago life after having dedicated two years of his life to mourning his long lost love Lisa, who'd mysteriously vanished from his life. Things are finally looking up again for Matthew; his career is in full swing, and he's thinking of becoming engaged -- that is, until he thinks he's spotted his former lover in a restaurant. Almost immediately, Matthew puts the brakes on his marriage plans and his career in order to conduct an exhaustive search for his old flame. Obsessed, he barely notices the psychologically devastating trap his quest is leading him into danger that only grows when he meets an enigmatic stranger,Alex.The movie is a one-of-a kind romance that people may find confusing due to how the narrative of the story is being told through flashbacks and in a non-linear fashion.Although the story may seem to be an implausible events with too many contrivances,the movie can be both absorbing and engaging despite the premise of the script. The passionate performances of the attractive cast give life and energy to it despite of the lack of plausibility in the story.It deserves a 8 out of 10 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it is very romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you like romantic, dramatic or maybe sarcastic movies?If you say of course you should watch the movie Wicker Park.It was very romantic I watched this movie on rainy day with my friends.Characters of the movie is very real and lively every people in life want to love someone like Matthew.Whati s happening in the film:Matthew is handsome, young man and believes he find his long-lost love.Lisa is very beautiful and dances very well.And her friend Alex is jealous, liar and psycho-pat.It is good movie but there are some logical fallacy.For example it was directed in 2004 but no one has cell phone or PC and they did not contact each other. When Matthew is confronting Alex in the restaurant when he realizes she isn't Lisa, his fringe alternates from being parted to the side and over his forehead between shots.But the acting is very good. I enjoy Josh Harnett (Matthew)'s work. I especially felt that Rose Byrne's (Alex) performance was very deep and compelling.It is easy to predict when you meet the second 'Lisa' that she's a psycho. Of course, Matthew ends up falling for Alex's (the fake Lisa's) machinations, and even ends up sleeping with her. Of course, he is in love with one girl, engaged to another, so we like him even less. Sadly, by that point you dislike both characters, so you don't really care what happens to them. Alex is stringing along Matt's friend...but he's a pathetic loser, so you don't care about him either. The story is actually pretty interesting because the mystery of what's going on is handled quite well. A lot of the story is told in flashbacks. Some of the flashbacks go back a couple of years to when Matt and Lisa first met.It was very fantastic and this movie of course is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, not very good..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker park.. well this is a kind of good romantic film I've watched. I understood nothing in the beginning. But later it turned out to be good.The plot is quite interesting. Matt tries to find his love Lisa. he really loves her and tries hard to find her. he never gives up. But a woman called Alex loves Matt too. she does everything to separate them. She tries not to show Lisa to Matt. Because she knows that if they come together, Matt will leave Alex. But in my opinion, this is not a right thing. Whatever how much she loves him, she shouldn't do such things. What Alex does is also destroying Alex-Luke(Matt's close friend) relationship. Love makes people some kind of demonic thing! I think Luke loves Alex very much and gives importance. So, Alex tries to escape.'One chases, one runs.. 'it is simple.Why this film is interesting to me is because it happens in real life too. someone loves someone and one person in the relationship cant be happy because of ones ignorance etc. As I've said plot is quite amazing. But there is no action or exciting things at all. This makes the film a little bit boring. And there are limited places. Musics in the film I really loved them. Especially the music in the beginning. What I most liked in the film is Matt's role. He is calm and runs after his love. but what I didn't like is, what Matt did with Alex. If he loves Lisa where is the fidelity between them. Anyway It doesn't matter, this should be done to make the film exciting. But like every other films it ended happily. Matt and Lisa came together again. Ending was emotional. I suppose everybody expected such an ending. I wish happy endings were in the real life too..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wicker park I like the Wicker park movie like every girl. I said like every girl because I think it is romantic movie. At first, it is too complicated to understand. Because I could not understand the Matthew's early life. However, later I could understand. Matthew had fallen deeply in love with Lisa two years ago. But Lisa vanished without any trace. This section upset me very much. I was upset because Matthew was really loving Lisa. However, later parts in movie I angry with Matthew because he had a new girlfriend. His new girlfriend was Rebecca. However, one day Matthew was at restaurant with his new girlfriend and her brother, he thought he saw Lisa. After that, he began to collect some things which possess to Lisa such as perfume, shoes etc.. And Matthew began to search Lisa from these trace and he went to Lisa' s home. After he had entered the home, tha fake Lisa came to home. I said fake Lisa because actually she was Alex. As she fallen in love with him, she acted as if she had been Lisa, and she was Lisa's friend. At that night this fake Lisa wanted stay with Matthew and Matthew stayed with this ugly girl. Alex was acting like real Lisa and always telling lie to Matthew and Matthew's friend in order to stop Matthew finding Lisa. Movie's this part frustrated me very much. I always wanted to kill fake Lisa. (actually, I still want to kill fake Lisa&#xf04a;). Also, fake Lisa didn't give the letter which was written by real Lisa to Matthew. And always lied to real Lisa. But without passing too much time, Matthew began to suspect from Alex. Because he bought a pair of shoes to Alex but these shoes too big for Alex. After this situation he followed Alex and he saw her with Luke. Luke at the same time was Matthew's friend. Matthew talked with Alex and Alex told Matthew everything without lying. After that Matthew quickly went to airport because Lisa was leaving for London. He arrived airport on time and he saw her. He went to Lisa's behind. And Lisa turned her behind and after they embraced with each other. The movie ended up with happy ending. However, the movie would be more beautiful but for Alex and Rebecca. If someone asks me advice about this movie, I strongly recommend it them. Although it is frustrating sometimes, it is very good movie. Sometimes there is exciting parts in movie, sometimes upsetting parts. But for Alex, it can be more beautiful. However, it is successful movie. I like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final twists lead to a dead end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker Park is a decent movie, full of twists and turns meant to keep you guessing. Unfortunately the final twists leave a lot to be desired. Instead of coming together in the end the movie kind of falls apart. It looked like we were setting up for a big, memorable, thought-provoking ending. But the movie takes the easy way out, going for the safe ending rather than a challenging one. Instead of a resounding climax there's a hollow emptiness. The movie sets up an interesting story but they didn't have the guts to go all the way with it. So ultimately the movie fizzles out and you're left with an undeniable sense of disappointment.In order to enjoy the movie at all you first have to accept that the story is pretty much rooted in nonsense. The whole plot could have been unraveled in an instant with a simple phone call between the main characters. What we've got here is failure to communicate. So the story is not particularly plausible. But if you can get past that the movie kind of works. To a point. It's a tale of obsession. The main character of Matthew, played by Josh Hartnett, catches a fleeting glimpse of Lisa, a woman from his past played by Diane Kruger. Lisa is the lost love of Matthew's life, having disappeared without a trace or a word two years earlier, and now he sets about tracking her down. As Matthew begins to obsess a new woman enters the picture. This is Alex, played by Rose Byrne, and it is with this character's introduction that the plot really starts spinning. There are lots of twists and turns, plenty of jumping back and forth in time. Will it all come together in the end? Not really.Ultimately Wicker Park proves to be not nearly as smart a movie as it would like you to believe it to be. It starts with a setup which strains credulity and all the plot's myriad twists leave some rather gaping plot holes. Matters aren't helped by Hartnett's rather bland performance in the leading role. Or by Matthew Lillard's not particularly convincing performance as Luke, the best friend who gets dragged into things. Drama is not really Lillard's thing. When his character is trying to be funny he's OK. When he's trying to be serious not so much. Kruger is fine for what she's asked to do but she's really not asked to do much. Byrne has the meatier female role and she, more than anyone else in the movie, does some very good work. It's a movie which has some good pieces, and it will probably hold your interest throughout. But it's also a movie which has some very obvious flaws. And in the end it's a movie which will probably leave you a bit disappointed. A movie which could have been going somewhere but never quite got there.</fullReview>

Anyway, Wicker Park is full of twists and surprises, but nothing too difficult to understand although at times you are left wondering why people in this film take little regards of others. If you see it you will understand. I don't want to spoil it so won't say anything more. Altogether it was OK. The music is quite good as most of it is from bands from england which are great. An easy film to watch, but if you get the chance try to watch the french version called the apartment as i should have done. oh, and it's true about giving it a chance as the first 40 minutes seem to be a bit preposterous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feeble re-make of a classic French film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could hardly believe how disappointing this was, compared to the genius and originality of the original French film of which it is an inferior 're-make', namely L'APPARTEMENT (1996, see my review). The French film had a brilliant script by its director, Gilles Mimouni, and that basic script was used as a template for the re-make, though with drastic changes which gutted much of the point of the story and changed the ending entirely. Mimouni's name also appears as one of the Executive Producers, though it is doubtful that he had much or anything to do with the actual production. Perhaps, however, he was responsible for the concealed homage to his French star Monica Belluci, for the name of the Chicago restaurant where the American characters continually meet is 'Belluci's'. In the re-make, Josh Hartnett is cast as the young male lead. Although he has many fine qualities, such as a fresh and appealing face and expression, and he works easily on camera, he was mis-cast in this role. Hartnett was at this age simply incapable of even understanding, much less suggesting by a performance, the inherent mystery and 'magic' required for the story. There is no way he could possibly match Vincent Cassell's performance in the original. As for Diane Kruger, who plays the Monica Belluci part, she is striking looking and not a bad actress for an ordinary film, but she conveys zero in this part, since at this highly sophisticated level she has no acting abilities at all and can only fall back on 'looking good' and hope that does the trick. She has obviously looked in the mirror a few times. The only performance in the film which gets anywhere near the requirements of the story is delivered by Rose Byrne, in the Romane Bohringer role (Bohringer having been the most brilliant of all). Byrne 'gets it' and does her best to convey 'it'. The others don't. As for the director, Paul McGuigan, he absolutely does not 'get it', and he has delivered a flat and pedestrian version of a great story. In the re-make, Belluci's/Kruger's rich lover has no point at all, because the ending was completely changed. Having him standing outside in the snow looking up at her in the window with Hartnett therefore was a waste of screen time, as it led to nothing, whereas in the French original it has catastrophic consequences, and the lover's psychopathic jealousy is an integral part of the story. The physical and editing choreography of the intricate scenes where people just miss each other by fractions of a second is done to perfection in the French original, whereas here the results are incompetent and fail miserably, party because the editor could not pull it off (which may be due to a lack of sufficient planning of the shots, as they are so complex that a story-board was really needed to get them right). Wicker Park is evidently a place in Chicago, a city with which my familiarity is limited, though I did recognise that the city was Chicago early on in the film. In the original film, the park is called 'a little park in the Luxembourg', but appears really to have been Place Furstenberg in St. Germain. I note that many enthusiastic persons have written warm reviews of this re-make, and I can only presume that those people did not see the original. If they had, imagine how enthusiastic they would be about the superior version! Why is it that so few Americans are willing to read sub-titles and have to be spoon-fed these inferior re-makes of great European movies? Why not grow up, people?! See the originals! The DVD of L'APPARTEMENT is readily available and is one of the most exciting mystery films ever made in Europe, rivalling Hitchcock's VERTIGO (1958) and indeed partially derived from it, even to the extent of having similar theme music as a conscious act of homage. But as for the disappearing Gilles Mimouni, he has never made another film, and that is a true mystery which I have been unable to solve. After being hailed from all sides as a genius, he vanished. Bring in the detectives! Where is he? When will he make another masterpiece again? As for Paul McGuigan, I suppose he got into this project which was way over his head because he cast Vincent Cassell in his earlier film THE RECKONING (2003), and Cassell may have suggested the re-make to him, in which he had appeared to such glorious effect. I must not be too hard on McGuigan, as anyone who makes a film of a Barry Unsworth novel and also anyone who casts Simon McBurney in a film (I am referring to THE RECKONING) has got to have some sound instincts. So let's all be nice to McGuigan and not blame him too much for not being a genius on the level of Gilles Mimouni.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie goes in three different directions at the same time. It is first presented as a VERY good mystery-thriller. Once the mystery starts to unravel, the film now mixes art photography with romance. The romance portion is the strongest element, and possibly the one which those who adore this film will think of first. Rose Byrne and Josh Hartnett are absolutely terrific in their roles. Matthew Lillard usually plays second bananas in screwball comedies, so it takes a bit to get used to him doing equally well in a romantic role. It is the art photography element which is the least successful, the one which MIGHT have kept WICKER PARK screening forever in art theaters had it been better.When I lived in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, I used the Wicker Park neighborhood for shopping at the Jewel, so I know what Wicker looked like back then. You won't see any street signs or license plates in the movie because it most certainly was NOT filmed in Chicago. There is, for example, a frequent meeting place in the film under a sign marked CHILI DOGS. Chicago used to have its own language, so it would be more authentic for one of the characters to say: "go to twenty hundred for a red hot", which would have been more typical of a Chicago dialect than the way this location is described in the movie. Watch the movie for the romantic element and especially the marvelous performances of Rose Byrne and Josh Hartnett, as well as possibly Matthew Lillad's first serious role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible, terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater in 2004. It is one of the few movies who made my list titled, "Movies I should have been paid to watch." The movie was advertised as a thriller, when it definitely should be in the Romantic (Comedy) category. Romantic--because it is, at the end of the film, a love story. Its comedy comes from the obvious flaws in film. I kept asking myself, "What time period is this movie set in?" It had to be before call-waiting, three-way calling and Cell Phones because no one in the movie seemed to have any of these modern technologies that would have resolved the difficulties in the plot in minutes and eased the viewers angst about the film. I was disappointed that the film wasn't a thriller. But I was angry that the movie contained so many minute issues that fueled the larger conflict. If you are a problem-solving, realistic type of person who doesn't like to let minutia get you down, then you will probably not enjoy this movie. So take my advice, and save your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sympathizing with the beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very powerful, artistic, and gripping to the very last moment. I loved the way past and present mix and how every glimpse backward or forward both complicates the story and explains it. The only thing I hated about the movie was the beautiful/ugly stereotype. The viewers are expected to sympathize with Lisa because she's beautiful, presented as almost "holy", and to not feel the same towards Alex or the hurtfully-abandoned fiancé. This might sound superficial, but I feel that the movie would have been more powerful if there wasn't such a difference in attractiveness between the three women, or at least Lisa and Rebecca, because then it wouldn't send the subconscious message of "the prettiest girl wins".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most annoying movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've noticed that I only leave comments for films that I get extremely frustrated or angry with - and this is one of them. I'd have given it 7 close to the beginning, but as it went on I got angrier and angrier! The times I wanted to shout at the idiot main character to wake up and stop doing stupid things like taking people at face value and throwing keys down drains and sleeping with a strange girl in a strange apartment were innumerable. I could go on, and on and on and on - just like this film did. Watching a recording of it from TV, at least I could fast forward through the last 40 minutes or so.I'm sure I saw the original once upon a time, but unfortunately I don't remember it. However, it HAS to be better than this utter tosh. Four out of ten for being in colour and having sound.</fullReview>

So if he'd gotten hit by a car or some other reason he can't get there, then they'll never see each other again. Or that they supposedly are crazy about each other and because he doesn't call back, she books for two years.Really stupid, but the other girl was an interesting twist and the movie-making was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to me that the writer of the film had to rush to finish the script in time. The plot, while at first unique and, actually GOOD, is rushed, almost as if there weren't enough run time to make it make sense. It's an endless circle, pointless, with a good intention that does not make for a good movie experience. There's nothing you can really take from the film. The beginning makes you think; the end leaves you empty. The entire film revolves around three people running in circles. Almost enough to make you want to throw something at the screen and yell at them to wake up.It was cute if you like chick flicks, but don't expect to take anything away from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting despite ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea what it is about Josh Hartnett, but for some reason I like the films he's in despite the fact that most of them are terrible. Maybe it's because he's always surrounded by good-looking women in them (and there are three relatively good looking females in this although one is often covered in leaking kabuki make-up for a large portion of the film.) It could also be because I like the ideas in the films if not the story lines. (Pearl Harbor: Great idea, bad storyline, hot chicks. Hollywood Homicide: Well ... at least it had Harrison Ford and some hot chicks in parts. Sin City: This one I really really liked and it only had Hartnett in it for a few minutes as part of a promotional short which was tacked onto the beginning and ending of the film. Do I need to mention the hot chicks in that film as well?) So, yeah, I think it must just be the hot chicks.Anyway, the basic storyline in Wicker Park is that three females wrap themselves around Hartnett in an odd love-square. Some of them are blatantly involved (his fiancée and ex-lover are two of them) and the other is not so blatant although she is rather interested in him and his friend. What kind of geometric shape is that? As far as the plot, well, that's about it. You might think I gave something away there, mentioning the eighteen-sided polygon, but the film is so randomly edited that someone that treats their sugar addiction with Meth would have problems keeping up.I think I liked the film because of it's editing style, although that doesn't really give much to a film regardless of how good, or bad, it might be. Memento was edited very strangely but it was still a good flick. The same can be said of Pulp Fiction. Wicker Park is an attempt to take the editing style of Pulp Fiction and make it into a strange-as-hell love story with fairly good-looking people acting in it all around.The biggest complaint I have with this film (Here's the spoiler) is the end. Do not read on if you don't want to 'spoil' this film for yourself. If you've seen this film, you should read just to see if I am full of excrement or not: The ending involves Hartnett going to meet his girl at the park where they had met two years previously. I think, had the director decided to make a cute reunion scene at the park, it would have worked well as the end to a love story. You would not have seen the fiancée get completely angry and in truth that was so glossed over at the airport that is wasn't really an issue for the story. It seems like they tacked on the additional portion of the ending just to give the plot another twist. I would have felt very happy had the ending been at the park with the two lovers meeting and realizing that they could certainly fall for each other again.However, considering the director decided to add the additional plot twist and have him miss her at the park and then go to the airport and bump into his fiancée, blow the fiancée off, and then go and find his girl crying on the floor ... well, I think that was a bad idea all around. Something I like to see in films is the truth of lost love. Very rarely are there second chances to something like love. If you dump someone (or vice versa) it rarely happens that you get back together with them unless you're crazy. If you disappear on someone for 2 years you probably will have forgotten about them (again, and vice versa) after those two years and if you meet again, it will be on a very limited basis. This brings me to my feelings on the end of the film. I think Matthew (Hartnett) should not have seen/found his girl at the airport, although running into his fiancée would still have worked. Heading there to meet the girl of his dreams, he meets his fiancée and after a longing look around the airport for his girl without seeing her, he lifts the fiancée up and kisses her and explains that he wants to get married. It wouldn't have worked with the plot line so well, although the plot could have nothing but improvements. Still, I think it would have given the audience a taste of what reality is after the hour and a half or so of completely random, senseless drivel. This movie is made for watching on movie channels via satellite or cable, not renting or (God help us) buying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waaaay too many flashbacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** This film did so many jumps back and forth tying the present in with the past, that it eventually reached the point where I was saying - wait a minute - did she even know her then? Didn't that happen before that? So why did he do that? I got the gist of the story, but it was a struggle. The idea of telling this story as they did, backfired on them, in my opinion. More linear and less jumping around would have helped this film tremendously--not that it was that great a film anyway.It's a boy loves girl, boy loses girl, another girl loves boy, another boy loves the other girl and two and two isn't adding up to four very often.The main character is Matt, played by Josh Harnett, who looks good enough, but according to this film, he apparently is like honey to bees when it comes to women. Every woman who even lays eyes on him is instantly smitten, even the ticket seller at the airport seemed a little doe-eyed in his presence.Matt was a 10 star beauty, however, compared to his pal, Luke, played by Matthew Lillard. Geez, poor Lillard is so incredibly homely he could stop clocks in the dead of night! Matt is in love with Lisa, a dancer. In fact he's over the moon about her the moment he sees her, and she really wasn't all that.Matt and Lisa's romance is going good, but then Lisa suddenly leaves with no explanation.A lot of Matt's behavior is what I think would probably legally be called "stalking." A year later, Matt thinks he sees her in a restaurant, but doesn't catch up to her.Then through some convoluted reasoning that completely lost me, Matt sees an article in a newspaper about a funeral and somehow he thinks that will connect him to where Lisa is.He lurks around the cemetery, sees a man and follows him. Why he thought this man would be at the funeral or why he thought this man could lead him to Lisa, was yet another thing I never picked up on.Rather than merely knocking on the door of the hotel room where Lisa is, or calling her at the hotel, Matt for reasons that completely baffled me, does more sneaking around.Then he obtains the key to an apartment where Lisa is apparently staying, and again instead of knocking on the door, writing a letter, or doing anything that would make sense, Matt conceals himself in the apartment.There he encounters another girl.Now as it turns out this girl, is a friend of Lisa's. Matt doesn't know this, although he and Lisa dated for over two months, he never met this other girl in all that time? I found that strange.Also during Matt's comings and goings at the apartment, he never encounters Lisa, who is, I thought, staying there as well. Now just where was Lisa when Matt stayed overnight at the apartment? Where was Lisa bunked down? I don't know if it was genuine holes in the plot, or if they had done so many back and forths with the plot by that time that I simply missed the reasons.Like when Matt sees Lisa again, and he still doesn't approach her or catch up to her. Instead, he stops and decides to fish out the key to the apartment, which he threw down a grate. Why? I don't know. After all, he didn't even know Lisa was staying at that apartment at that time, I don't think.We finally learn who is keeping Matt and Lisa apart and who is lying and who is in love with who, and who ends up with who, but the rest of it was just a convoluted mess.4 stars out of 10 and that's being generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Up Unrealistic Jumble with Good Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actress who played Alex (Rose Byrne) is a double for Shannen Doherty. All the actors were perfect in their roles in this mess, this jumble of a unrealistic love story. Good acting in a mixed up movie. A man's girlfriend skips out on him. He never forgot her, meets someone else, yet is obsessed with finding her. Every character in this movie is obsessed with another character, but all are obsessed with Matt, played by Josh Hartnett. He is an handsome guy, but that large mole on his neck stops me cold. It is just too big and it is hard to look at his face with that mole right smack in front of you. It's an OK film, good acting, a jumbled story and a tale of obsession. You can tell it is a modern day movie. This junk would not have been so bad had it been made by someone else years and years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever mix of film genres</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker Park is a difficult movie to classify. Is it romance? Well, sort of. Is it a mystery? Kind of, but not exactly. A psychological thriller? Well, in a way. Is it kind of weird? Definitely.Unique and creative, it's a story of love lost, then found, then lost again. Then searched for. Elements of obsession and confusion weave their way into the plot line, while the movie maneuvers through a series of plot twists.The story may seem slow early on, but that's only because you see so little of the overall painting at first. You are sent a seemingly random parade of present day scenes and flashbacks cut and dealt out in rapid fire. As the main character goes on this quest, he is met with a myriad of bizarre clues, that usually lead him on tangents, or nowhere at all. Just as he seems to figure out what's going on...BOOM! Another twist in the story confuses him (and you) again and again.A clever blend of cuts keeps the story moving, as the maze winds its way around. The movie only tells you what it feels like telling when it wants to tell it. Terrific acting by all, but the best was Rose Byrne. She is astonishingly sympathetic as the enigmatic Alex.There are a few plot holes, if you look for them. But, overall, it's a fun and intriguing story, certainly not your typical, run-of-the-mill standard plot. Mystery, romance, thriller, or some other genre: take your pick. But it's worth watching.</fullReview>

Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci, how can you miss these talented actors? Sorry for saying this, though Josh Hartnett is a handsome face, the casts in the new version is wrongly picked.

		<shortDescription>not as good as the French original</shortDescription>

It is a pleasant film and make my wife happy, however, it is far from as good as the French original. As I remembered, although quite a long time ago, the red color was a strong clue in the French film, or the actress's acting is more powerful in the French one? This American one only presents romance but lacks the emotion and power presented in the original film. I don't like the ending of airport. I can not remember exactly, but I suppose the French film stops at the park and maybe will a remote glance. The extra explanation to his rich-girlfriend make him looked weaker than ever and is a waste of time. By the way, the apartment is not a charming as the French one, same is the hotel they meet.</fullReview>

Some time has to pass otherwise I'll start comparing scenes and trust me, the ending at this point, is really hard to beat.

Too many flashbacks. But at least this one made sense to me. Guy from the Black Hawk Down acted pretty well. Story was a bit confusing to start off with, but picked up pieces later. The only reason I gave this movie 7/10 was because of the song that plays during the airport scene in the end. "The Scientist" - sounded more like a piano ballad from the good old 70s. Given my folk and old music taste, I don't care much for new bands. But Coldplay did a marvelous job in this song. Lyrics were simple and the piano melody was outstanding!!!!!!! This song made up for whatever the movie lacked.! Watch it at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad script, but good acting and interesting plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that critics are gonna hate. First of all, it's a remake of an excellent French movie which has been very well received abroad already. I have friends who refuse to watch this Hollywood remake because they think there is absolutely no way that it can surpass the original. Not only is it a remake, it's a watered down, "Hollywood" version of it. The ending's been slightly altered, and it seems that the focus has been shifted as well; wicker park is more of a romantic, drama genre and focuses on the love stories between the characters, as opposed to being a thriller as the previews promote. Of course, I can't really say for sure because I haven't seen the original, but it's what I hear. There are too many situations that seem rather forced. You can't help thinking, "that's impossible!" Superb acting by Josh Hartnett. I've never liked him before but I'm a fan now. 2 scenes with him in particular that moved me: the ending scene, and the scene where he stares into an empty wall(into the camera) after Lisa's left him. You can really feel his pain. Excellent score. Can't imagine any other song would have better captured the emotions in the ending scene than "The Scientist" by Coldplay. Great editing skills by the director I guess because the movie jumps around the past and present a lot, but the script was somewhere between downright poor to average, although everything else kinda makes up for it, fortunately. Overall I give it a 9 out of 10 despite some of its shortcomings because personally, I just really, really enjoyed it. I would recommend it to any one of my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you view with your head, move on -- with your heart, its a treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie that survives the scrutiny of a microscope or the mind-set that likes to use them. Technically it is flawed and it will leave you dissatisfied if you cannot get past that type of stuff. In fact, read the reviews by the Techo's. They all hate it. A better film would draw less fire from these types, but wouldn't help AT ALL in delivering it's punch; NOT IN THE LEAST. The value of the film is that it is a "Balloon Ride". You have to put aside your critical mind, because it will never let you get off the ground. You are really missing a great ride!We've all become so smart that we forget that this art. It is intended to pierce through the intellect and impact the deeper seeing heart. Yes there are a few flaws in the story line, and blah, blah, blah. If you preoccupy yourself with that stuff enough you will undo the impact of a strong message. Who said life is supposed to make sense anyway? What you call sensible today, even you yourself will find nonsensical in only a few years. Would you trade your viewpoint today for what it was ten years ago? What your heart has determined to be true will last forever. Sometimes I think that the real value of art is that there is an opportunity for someone who sees something clearly &amp; well - to help us. To help us get past that type of mentality that constructs all it's thoughts in such a way to always establish that it is right and everything else is wrong - at all costs. Hearts have an ability to know the truth when seen. And so, good art let's you grow, perhaps without making some of those painful mistakes that usually lead to growth. It still hurts, if you can feel. Minds only see what they want to see. Everything that Matt was doing up to the time he heard Lisa's voice through the vent in the restroom made sense. Then, at that moment, his heart was engaged and began to take control of his life again. That's when the balloon took off. If you missed that, maybe that's why you missed the ride. When you go to the amusement park, you have to get on the ride or you're just wasting your time. If you're too picky, then you just miss out. You gotta commit, like Lisa says, "If you don't commit, you're just a phony." You don't commit with your head; it's with your heart. The shortcoming with Alex was that she was only committed to herself. Hearts committed to sacrifice elevate and ennoble the person. Hearts that are selfish only drag you down.If a head and a book come into collision, and the resulting sound is a hollow one, it is not necessarily the books fault. (Lichtenberg) And we will adapt here. If the film and the heart collide...</fullReview>

I wonder how the story would have looked from the point of view of Rebecca, the girlfriend of Matt at the time he realized he has unsolved issues that should be taking care of. All in all, it's a beautiful, well done story but maybe I am just fed up with all these made to impress you Hollywood love stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"An intricate web of time"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read several reviews that say this movie is just too confusing to understand and/or enjoy. I thought it was, as the official website put it, a movie that was wonderfully weaved together in an intricate web of time, using flashbacks and memories to compose practically the entire movie, and show very little of the movie in actual "live time". I would not recommend this movie for someone who has a short attention span, or someone who, like my parents, thinks that you can always listen to a movie while actually doing something else. In order to really understand and enjoy this movie, have a solid chunk of an hour and 55 minutes to do nothing but sit down and watch the movie. One of the neatest things (I think) about this movie is that, even though I have seen it about 5 times by now, if I really pay close attention, each time I watch it I find or understand something new.I must admit that the only reason I saw it to begin with is because Josh Hartnett was in it. I figured, after seeing him act in Pearl Harbor, I couldn't go wrong with a movie he was in. Now, I don't know if I would really classify this as a chick flick, considering the only reason I cried at this movie is because of the song at the end. I will not tell you what the song was, because that would be the biggest spoiler of the movie; However, I will tell you that if you have heard this song prior to the movie, and have ever really paid attention to the words and the meaning of the song, you will probably cry too. I can remember my exact reaction to the first time I saw the movie, as if I just finished watching it. Knowing the song from hearing it so many times, I was able to "name that tune" before the words even came into the song, and I had to close my eyes (wound up missing part of the movie-not that it was all that important) and cry because they could not have picked a better song for the moment. The song made the movie- it summed up everything the movie was about and everything Matthew was working for- perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting View.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I , like most of other enjoyed Wicker Park . But , i'm not hiding my surprise when I heard that they are remaking my personal favorite L'Apartment by Gilles Mimouni with Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel . I was shocked but also really surprise since I saw a lot of movies by Paul McGuigan and I know what can I expect from him and he didn't disappoint me . This time movie wasn't so bad , but unfortunate I have to admit that L'apartment was a better . Like all French movies are , and were . I really enjoy French cinomateche , most of the American movies are made from French ideas , and movies. But still there are some directors that can beat the original versions like the Talented Mr.Ripley , very good French movie which was really even better remake . But coming back to the Wicker Park , I mainly enjoyed this movie because it's the story about the possibility of love finding a way in the most improbable circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good and twisting movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best romance/thriller movies I've seen. It's very twisted...just the way the movie went from the middle to the end. As you watch this movie, there are so many ideas that come into your head, and it makes you wonder what really happened. The acting is outstanding...and I think they picked the right actors/actresses to play the roles of the main characters. They were excellent. That's why I'm giving this movie a rating of 10, and I think it deserves a 10/10! But, I won't say more because I don't want to spoil it for people who haven't seen this movie. It's a very good movie, and I never get sick and tired of watching it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the name, it really doesn't have anything to do with the movie. Most people wouldn't have idea what this movie is about, neither was I before watching it. But after watching it, I got to say - Hell!!, It is damn good. There is no right way to explain in brief cause it really complicated without leaking the story. Let me tried it :- This is a love triangle story with actually more than threes angles, does that even make any sense?I really enjoy the movie the movie. Though the movie started out a little too slow but the middle and the end of the movie make up for whole lots. It is really fall into place as you go along with the story and the flashback. I love the ending especially it rhyme really well with The Scientist ? Coldplay. It is so emotional.The casting and acting is pretty good nothing extraordinary. At least you will see M. Lillard playing a mature role for a change. Most of all it was the ways the story was being told that actually make this movie so interesting. Without seeing for oneself, you have no idea.Recommendation: I Got The DVD, And It Is One Of The Best I Have Got. Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It - Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mystery within a romantic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Paul McGuigan's previous movie - 'The Reckoning' was a quite successful combination of mystery and medieval stories, with a theater in theater touch. I liked it, especially blessed as it was by superb acting from William Dafoe and Brian Cox. 'Wicker Park' tries something different. Based on a quite good French mystery drama 'The apartment', it keeps the characters and general story line, but replaces the murder crime by an emotional crime - killing of a relationship in the name of love.Interesting premises for a good movie, but the problem is that Paul McGuigan does not go far enough with his vision, as he did in 'The Reckoning'. He pays too much tribute to conventional Hollywood style romantic stories, trying probably to appeal to viewers from both genres. As I am no romantic films fan, I was disappointed by the slow pace, as well as by the acting. Diane Kruger could not justify in 'Troy' a war being started for her seek, here she does not justify becoming the object of obsession for Josh Hartlett. There is no chemistry between the two in the flash-back scenes, and he also looks a few years younger than her on screen.It's not a bad movie, but it does not succeed to be more than a conventional one. Romantic stories lovers may like it, as it has a look different for their favorite genre. I personally hope that the next film of the director will succeed better in creating a vision and being consequent in bringing it to screen.</fullReview>

But I got no chance to watch it until now.I was very excited at first, yet later while approaching the ending part, i was a little disappointed. The basic plot is good, I mean creative. The story goes back and forth, makes you wonder what happened exactly, really attractive. It reminds me of another movie "Memento".But, it's somewhat ridiculous: they live in a modern society with high technology, why not just use cell phone? Because they don't have enough money to buy one? I think this movie can be a very good and persuasive and efficient advertisement to sell cell phone.</fullReview>

I know the final song in the airport scene is by Coldplay. What is the name of the song. There is not a song on the soundtrack by Coldplay.

Decent movie, cute love story, enjoy Josh and Matt if you like them as actors and some better than average acting from the female antagonist. I had an expectation of something moving based on the original screenplay and I was disappointed. I still don't know what happened to a couple of the subplots and... it ain't worth it to go back and find it. So, bottom line for me is 3 out of 5 stars (6 out of 10 here).

		<fullReview>This movie is filled with contrivances. Seriously, don't try to deconstruct or speculate on any of the leads' actions because they won't make sense. Even as parts of the plot unfold, the characters contrive to keep themselves apart. Fortunately, on the way, it plays out as a stylistic movie that keeps you in the flow, suggesting much darker themes than what transpires. The mood sets it apart from the rest of the paint by numbers romantic dramas out there. The theme succeeds, despite constant tension destroying flashbacks. This movie could have really used some better editing.So why do I give this movie a 6? Because the stars are so pretty. And really, isn't that the point of movies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating, contrived but it grabs you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker Park,is a romantic drama about a young man who thinks he sees Lisa, his lost love, in the telephone booth of a restaurant and then tries to find her for almost two hours. He's supposed to be off to China to close a huge deal for his now-fiancée's father's company but can't get Lisa out of his mind. He blows off China and proceeds to follow every avenue to find his lady, if it was her in the phone booth. Chronolgy flits back and forth as we learn of what happened two years ago to their romance and how he happens to be in that restaurant phone booth. He runs into his best friend, who he hasn't seen, since the break up with Lisa and he kind of helps him in his quest but he's ennamored with a lady, played by Rose Byrne, who also seems to like our hero and who makes things quite complicated. Josh Hartnet doesn't move quite as fast as you like him to when a big clue is presented and when the key players happen to keep passing each other busy Chicago streets (which really look like and are Montreal streets)credibility is stretched. But I hung there till the very end hoping Josh will find his Lisa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Wicker Park and read the various posts. There is one thing that I haven't read yet that was the most striking part of the movie.The relationships were so similar, it was intriguing. You have one example where the obsessed actually does make contact with the person he loves and it works for awhile. Later the obsession returns and is finally realized. In another instant, the obsessed wasn't able to make contact but still loved. The only difference was luck. The obsession Matthew had for Lisa allowed him to love her how a person is supposed to love. The obsession Alex had was to be able to love Matthew how she wanted but even then she realized his obsession and out of love, she felt guilty at his unhappiness and gave him the letter. I am generally laid back, which maybe has kept me from loving deeper, maybe I just need that focus........ that obsession shown in this movie. All I know is that it is luck..... or fate, or whatever that defines where that obsession...... that love goes.Oh, Josh Hartnett was very good in Virgin Suicides and O. The acting was great, especially him and Rose Byrne. I recommend this to anyone interested in great storytelling and those who have loved or have been loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Engaging Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the trailer, I had expected this to be more of a thriller. Although it was not entirely as I had expected, it was still an engaging and interesting film.The pace of the film was perfect. A lot of even good films seem to have that mid-movie sag as the plot develops. In "Wicker Park", the plot unfolds slowly and continuously in a way that kept me interested. We learn more of the relationship between the four primary characters as the movie progresses. We also have an opportunity to see that characters grow from there experiences.The direction was well-done. There are some truly compelling images in the movie. There are also a few hand-held shots that are a little annoying and upstage the performances on screen. These are few and not significant enough to substantially detract from the movie.The acting is very good. I enjoy Josh Harnett's work. I especially felt that Rose Byrne's (Alex) performance was very deep and compelling. I do have to point out the utterly bizarre hairdo on Matthew Lillard. What were they thinking! If you like a lot of mystery in your romance, I would expect that you would like this film.</fullReview>

Editing was often confusing and seemed to attempt thriller, suspenseful shots when they were not actually warranted. The movie was not a thriller; it was a love story with a malicious sub-plot. All four major characters,however,held their own and gave great performances in spite of the weak screenplay they had been given. The action did flow and move along quickly with no dull spots, but there were numerous times when one might wonder why the character acted as they did...as in, not believable. The sub-plot script was not completely predictable, although the conclusion was obvious to complete the theme.</fullReview>

Other than that it's not a bad movie.That sounds like a joke, but it isn't. It really isn't a bad movie. It has a very intriguing plot, and the flashback presentation works very, very well. It starts off slowly, but picks up interest and speed about a third of the way through. Definitely worth staying with.Josh Hartnett does a very good job, as does Rose Byrne, who appears to be an up and comer with this role and the role of Breseis in Troy. Matthew Lillard and Diane Kruger are acceptable, but Diane is nowhere near as good as she was as Helen of Troy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie would be another rip off of "Fatal Attraction", but I was gladly mistaken. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat! It definitely was not what I expected. Everyone in the film gives a convincing performance. Josh Hartnett does a great job of convincing you of his obsession for the character Lisa, and Rose Byrne turns in a great performance as a disturbed young lady. In the end, I must say, I felt sad for Byrn's character and Matthew Lillard's. Diane Kreuger is beautiful as ever in this film; although I totally didn't recognize her at first as the woman who played Helen in "Troy." I do think it's high time that we see her doing a little more in a movie than looking pretty and seducing a man. I recommend this film to anyone who is a Josh Hartnett fan and just a fan of great direction, screenplay and writing. Oh, and by the way the soundtrack is hot! "Wicker Park" is a Great Movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think this film is as bad as some reviews suggest. I watched it all, was confused during most of it, and I can't say that I have totally figured it out. The explanation at the end seemed plausible. However, I think the major question is why was this story told in such a fragmented form? I suspect it is because there is a major implausibility lurking somewhere in the middle of the story which would destroy the plot were it not for all of the camouflage. Of course, you have to be prepared to believe that it truly IS a small world. I think the acting was fine (or at least the acting seemed consistent with what I took to be the motivation). I thought this was a minor effort, but I would not want to see it again. If you approach this film expecting a mystery, you may be disappointed because the non-linear narration creates the mystery.</fullReview>

Upon viewing a trailer for Wicker Park, the viewer gets the impression it is some type of supernatural thriller like "The Forgotten." However, it is not this type of movie at all. It is a romantic drama, and a long and slow moving one at that. It can be quite suspenseful at times but never in a scary, heart pounding kind of way. Sometimes I'm in the mood for long drama and sometimes I'm in the mood for thrillers. I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I hadn't been misled. With all that said, this is a nice, original movie with tons of twists and a slowly unraveling ending. Worth a watch at least, but know what to expect :) 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this and have to comment on this. It's not bad per se, but really disappointing, particularly if you were expecting some big mystery...like I was. Additionally if you are one of those viewers, like me, who likes to figure these mysteries out, you will also be annoyed, unless you like big noisy drama.My major issue with this film is the big drama, stalkerish behavior and inability of these people to communicate. At a certain point in the picture I was becoming frustrated with the seredipitious encounters, or more annoyingly, near-encounters. The movie is one big coincidence, which, as my friend said, "Only happens in Hollywood" The movie is also highly anvilicious. Josh Hartnett has gone from an artist (ok photographer) to a corporate monkey who is constantly looking depressed, because he has lost the great love of his life and so therefore his soul...or something like that.The only character for whom I felt any real sympathy was Mathew Lillard's who seems to float above the drama, right up till the end.So all in all, its not a terrible movie, but not for those put off by big, noisy drama!</fullReview>

It's a good idea...I haven't seen the original French version so I can't draw comparisons. It is very stylish and attractive. It is the story itself that is lacking. Nice look, nice cast (not to mention nice looking), but missing the filler. All of this would have been cleared up using cell phones. Although her acting is exceptional as compared to the rest of the cast, it may also be hard to believe that Byrne could be so miserable and overlooked by men. She is a gorgeous girl whose looks are toned down for this part. She is easily quite stunning in her own right. Hartnett makes an effective leading man here. This is a part tailored to his tortured looks and he conveys the anguish and confusion of his character very well. I'm not that familiar with Kruger but she was surprisingly good in the part. This is a good date movie. It is not the best movie out there and could have been much better with more superior writing but it is okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chick flick worth watching!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I typically fall asleep watching chick flicks because they typically don't keep my attention. Either the movie moves very slow and never picks up the pace, or I simply just can't relate to the movie.Wicker Park has changed my view about "chick flicks". It's a movie that has just enough suspense and turning events to keep you thinking throughout the movie. I never dozed off once during the entire movie even after the BIG dinner I had before the movie.The bottom line is that this was a good movie that was very well put together. For all the women out there, make sure you keep a box of Kleenex next to you :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i thought this movie was really amazing i don't know there's just something about it. it takes basically a typical "chick" flick and adds enough of a twist to it to make it appeal to everyone. it does seem a bit slow to get going but i think its a really good movie. and for once I'm OK with Josh Hartnett most of his stuff has been just plain bad this one seemed like a very good role for him. Matthew Lillard bothered me a bit seemed like he was kinda tossed in there and didn't seem to match much to me but luckily his role was pretty small and didn't really hurt the movie at all. this is one i definitely wanna add to my collection. awesome movie imo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good movie in spite of Josh Hartnett</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only real problem that I had with this movie was that I really liked and ended up rooting for Rose Byrne's character Alex. Sure the girl was acting in a totally selfish manner, not to mention borderline psychotic, but I got the sense she really did love Hartnett's character. As for Hartnett, could this guy be any more wooden in his acting? Flaws? Not many, although the movie did leave me with some questions. Among them: wouldn't Hartnett's Matthew be pretty ripe after spending two or three days running around the city chasing a girl while never changing out of the same clothes? Think about it.And (I'm still scratching my head over this one), how did Canadian bit part character actor Vlasta Vrana (the Jeweller) get something like fourth or fifth billing in the film's opening credits when he only utters roughly two lines of dialog, all of which are over and done with before the opening credits finish rolling?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie seems really fake. Don't take me wrong, I loved it but at times it just sort of seemed ridiculous!! It's like everyone arrived at the exact time they should have...Everything happened at the right time...Like when Matthew "Just happened to be there" when he wanted to find the key in that hole thing..He was standing right in front of it...I was like...OK? And right when Alex goes into Matthews apartment to leave Lisa's note, Lisa calls. The fact that Alex is Lisa's best friend, and is dating Matthews best friend, I mean, it's so unrealistic! There's so much more and it kinda drowns the vibe of the movie. That's the only thing that bothered me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SEVERE SPOILERS HEREIN!I thought that it would be one of the most thrilling films of 2004 before going to see it. But I was severely disappointed!The story simply goes forever and scene by scene it becomes so confusing that a viewer gets lost very easily. As a matter of fact, in the middle of the movie you don't know what is going on. The scene where Mathew looks for Lisa and hears her talking to phone is repeated so many times that you will be totally confused. The clarification, if any, comes far too late!The script is not very smart. Although some scenes are funny (remember eight and a half?), it did not thrill me in the way I expected it to. Mathew's friend is not very natural, sometimes too ridiculous!The end? Too long. In fact, some people laughed loudly in the movie theater at the way Mathew was coming closer and closer to Lisa and she still does not notice him. Blah blah blah!There is one great thing about the movie. In fact two of them: The cast and the music. The song is wonderful! Diane Kruger is equally good as in Troy. Beautiful and highly talented! The same can be infered about Rose Byrne, however, she did better in Troy.For the sake of the cast and the music, I give it 4 out of 10. Go and see the movie! Maybe you will like it more than me! The film could have been better! I did not mean to discourage anyone to see it. All I said in this review was ONLY expressing my personal judgments about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really got me thinking and wondering where Lisa disappeared to. everyone who watched the film with me had different theories. And that's whatI like about the film, you're left in a maze of suspense and finally and so intricately woven together the truth comes out. The way the movie was put together so intricately and complex was amazing and the actresses and actors did a good job on the film. The music also added to the mood of the movie, like music from the Stereophonics, Mum, Snow patrol and White Stripes. It also has a certain arty appeal (to me anyways), the filming is done in a way that it's compelling to watch. I really enjoyed this film and the ending scene I loved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comments below about the lack of a simple mobile phone ruining the whole plot are true but it must be remembered this is a remake of a French film which was made in 1995 when mobile phones weren't as ubiquitous as they are nowadays. Typical Hollywood laziness that the plot wasn't updated somehow with mobile address book being wiped for instance or phone falling down a toilet even! The fact that when Hollywood runs out of ideas it simply turns to European cinema and plunders it smacks of desperation!If you hated this try the original L'Appartement/The Apartment, or give it a go even if you loved it, 'tho I'm not sure folk that loved it could cope with a foreign subtitled movie lol!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOT CELLPHONES?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually go to the movies to laugh, thus I rarely opt for "suspensful" type movies, which is what the trailers for Wicker Park seemed to suggest that it was. Since I was intrigued by what small clips I saw AND because I am a huge fan of Chicago, I decided to spend a Sunday afternoon taking in Wicker Park...I was quickly sorry I did. This movie began slow, drug on for what seemed like hours, and had me more confused than I have been in a looooong time! Few plots have seemed more contrived and less realistic than this one. The fact that the whole situation (and about 20 scenes)could have been avoided by the use of a simple cell phone is what made this movie so annoying. I found plenty of other things wrong with it, but have decided to just chalk up the wasting of 2 hours and about $30.00 (by the time I had popcorn and a soda) as one of life's little disappointments. One last comment to filmmakers out there...don't insult the intelligence of the American public! If you're going to make a movie about 2 people that are hopelessly in love and frantically searching for one another, don't have it take place at a point in time where it is technologically possible to reach someone all over the universe at any time of the day or night!!! This plot might have been more believable if it had taken place in a different era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie and thought it really was a waste of money. The movie is confusing throughout the first half, and then they quickly give a rundown of the little things you missed in the first half at the end. The twists and turns are very strange once you see it all put together for you. Not really a sensational thriller as shown through the trailers. It was lacking the edge. Acting was really good though. Josh Hartnett put on a good performance. As well as Matthew Lillard's. He brings the comedy element to the movie of course. he ending itself was sweet.... but still, I would recommend you wait to rent it and watch it in the company of your own home where there is a stop button.

		<fullReview>I had read the reviews on Wicker Park before I saw it but they did not prepare me for how truly awful this film is. First of all, if you have an aversion to MTV, then don't see this film. There are 4 or 5 rock videos throughout this film and it completely destroys any momentum or continuity the film might have had and this is a film that desperately needs some. The soundtrack is the worst I've heard in any movie in recent memory. This film should have used the music in the way Vertigo did. Instead, it just fills the spots where there isn't any talking. The dialog is dull, stilted, and completely forgettable. The story is actually okay but the dialog has no finesse whatsoever. The lead actor, Josh Hartnett, has no screen presence, no expressions, and no acting ability that I could detect. I will never pay to see another film where this guy is the main actor. He is in virtually every minute of this film and he is like watching paint dry.The first hour of this film is completely dull and several people sitting in front of me walked out. Unfortunately, I could not keep track of how many people walked out behind me. The first half of the film really could have been cut down to 5 or 10 minutes. The real story does not start until Rose Byrne appears. She is the only good thing in this film and she has all those qualities that Josh Hartnett lacks. She can convey her character by facial expressions, which is mandatory when the dialog is so poorly written.Unfortunately, she isn't in the film enough. The other supporting rolls are serviceable but unimpressive. The photography is nice but not good enough to save this mess. Some people might be offended at the message this movie conveys at the end. It seems to say that if a man stalks a woman, it is true love but if a woman stalks a man, then she is a crazy psychopath. The first half of the film gets a 1/10, the second a 5/10, for an overall score of 3/10. If you are stuck on a plane and this is showing, skip the first half and Rose Byrne's performance makes the second half watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much build up for nothing to happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker Park is one of those types of movies where you hope something terrible will happen to one of the characters. The plot was pretty good although you expected to find out that his girlfriend was either dead or not who she claimed to be. In every scene there is a build up of anxiety thinking "Oh no she's going to kill her" and then nothing. Next scene "She's going to kill him" and then nothing. It was boring! The girl even clears her conscience in the end. What exactly is the director &amp; writer trying to tell us? Josh Hartnet was great! All the acting was superb. I just couldn't get into the movie itself. I kept expecting something really disturbing to fulfill the idea of this being a thriller, and nothing happened.</fullReview>

The movie goes on and you find out that he used to date her and bits of pieces show up here and there. You kinda get the picture but you are a little confused... Thats what i didn't like about this film.. Most of the film i was trying to find out who is who and whats going on.That's probably what the directors wanted.But not explaining a bit is one thing,not explaining everything is disaster. Towards the middle i kinda got the picture and the movie turned out hilarious to me more than sick and twisted backstabbing.That's just my personal opinionOverall i gave it a 6/10 I think it was a great story idea But if more explaining was done in the beginning It could've turned out better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much ado</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Montreal-made American version of the French film L'Appartement (Gilles Mimouni, 1996) is named after the star-crossed lovers' Chicago trysting place. The plot of the piece is tricky and so is the exposition, which has to go back over all the early scenes once we know what a certain person has been up to. Young Matthew (Josh Hartnett) is a photographer who sees and falls in love with Lisa (Diane Kruger, the unimpressive Helen in this summer's blockbuster Troy) shortly after another girl, (we learn later from flashbacks) has fallen for him. Complications ensue. Somehow Mattie gets cut off from Lisa just when things are getting really romantic, and both he and his best buddy get involved in meaningless stopgap relationships. Or so it seems. But anyway, never mind: impossible to relate the plot without giving away too many secrets. I'm told that L'Appartement has a murder in it. Wicker Park doesn't. That's a big difference, and the lack of such a central event would explain all the excitement and hurley-burley that seems so egocentric and absurd in Wicker Park. It's hard to comment further on the differences between the two when I haven't seen one of them but there's not so much a lack of clarity in Wicker Park as a lack of understanding on our part about why all this running around is going on. Of course it's a Hollywood thing to have no end of plane trips made or cancelled in the interest of romance, but Mathew certainly gets ready to go to China an awful lot of times, without going . The movie ends at O'Hare, appropriately enough, with another character probably about to cancel a flight abroad. It's not that Josh altogether falls short. He's an appealing mixture here of burgeoning suavity ? la Peck and puppy-dog confusion ? la Perkins. It's just that he gets no chance to exhibit the gift for physical comedy he showed in Hollywood Homicide and 40 Days (even as far back as The Virgin Suicides) because this is a straight romance; but, apart from the soulful eyebrows, that physicality -- the goofy doubletake, the ambling walk -- is his best feature. About that one person, who shall be nameless here, who seriously sabotages things: is she a bad egg? an example that people in love, as she defensively claims, will go to any lengths? or is she in fact a dangerous nut case? These are issues the American screenwriter doesn't seem to have worked out in detail. The rest of the cast does an adequate job. Rose Byrne, a more interesting Troy alum, is, er, interesting as Alex, and Matthew Lillard is engaging if a bit old as Mathew's best buddy Luke. These details will matter little to Josh-watchers, who will simply be pleased to find that his pretty face, eyebrows and all, occupies about 98% of screen time.Use of a shoe store and a pair of high heeled red Italian shoes as a dating device makes it look like the authors of this 'romance' have been staying up late watching softcore pornmeister Zalman King's 1992 Red Shoe Diaries.No doubt something, perhaps something quite essential, was lost in translation from the French original because this movie has a lot of frantic activity but doesn't deliver the situations to justify it.</fullReview>

Anyway, hot chick magnet Josh Hartnett (as Matthew) is engaged to marry juicy Jessica Paré (as Rebecca), but sees delicious Diane Kruger (as Lisa), an old flame. So, he has second thoughts. Mr. Harnett decides to track down Ms. Kruger. So, he runs into ravenous Rose Byrne (as Alex). Matthew Lillard (as Luke) is a pleasant on-screen pal. Harnett's women are a handful. The wintry location (Chicago, and Chicago-like Montreal) and Peter Sova cinematography are the main strengths.***** Wicker Park (2004) Paul McGuigan ~ Josh Harnett, Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne</fullReview>

Deux sometimes works wonders : "Vertigo" is the best example.But a non linear narration is not enough.Blending present and past (and future? who knows?) when you don't have ,say,Terry Gilliam's genius ,can do nothing but give you a terrible headache.To crown it all,an almost unbearable Matthew Lillard tries to steal the show from Josh Harnett.But is there anything to steal???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept hoping that "Wicker Park" might develop into an interesting film. But every scene seemed so artificial that it was impossible to get engaged in the "passion" of the love triangle.Overall, this was a film "exercise" more than a "drama." The plot twists were not convincing, and it was especially difficult to believe that the main character Matthew would renege on his business trip to China and spend 100% of his energies in stalking his former girlfriend.The cast of "Wicker Park" tried hard to salvage this mediocre idea. But even the scenes from the play-within-a-play (Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night") staged in a strange, quasi Kabuki concept, were lackluster. From start to finish, this was a highly contrived exercise in film style more than a thoughtful character study or romantic drama. It seemed more like a film school project, as opposed to a feature film. And the final grade assigned is a C-.</fullReview>

The girls are mildly hot, the acting is very poor, and there is no plot. I thought this film would be a suspense. It wasn't, I guarantee yeh! Well, there's more hating to this movie for other reasons: such as the film editing, the movie was out of order like Slaughterhouse Five, the screen was blurred and cut in half constantly, and the weather in the movie made it all the worse. The movie was too predictable, and lack of entertainment. I guessed the first thrity minutes of the movie of how it would turn out. 2 out of 10.

		<shortDescription>"Single White Female" a la Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WICKER PARK (2004) **1/2 Josh Hartnett, Rose Byrne, Matthew Lillard, Diane Kruger, Jessica Pare. (Dir: Paul McGuigan) 'Single White Female' a la Hitchcock.Hitchcock should be receiving residuals from beyond the grave at this point since filmmakers today have been borrowing liberally from the Master since his demise nearly 25 years ago and the latest attempt may have even had Hitch shaking his head in disbelief.Hartnett (perhaps the most plastic actor since Keanu Reeves) stars as a semi-successful junior ad exec who is about to be married to the gorgeous Pare but things take a sudden change for the indifferent when by a chance glance Hartnett sees what he believes to be his real true love some two years past who inexplicably ditched him in the snowy environs of the titular Chicago offering.Instead of going to China on a very important business trip Hartnett decides to try to track down the mysterious woman who he is convinced is Kruger, who came into his life as sudden as her disappearance. Obsessed is hardly a convenient term to try to attempt to explain the offerings at hand as Hartnett traipses all over the Windy City in his vain lunge at a romance long past. Is she a figment of his overworked and stressed imagination or the real deal? Enter Byrne as another mystery woman ? or at least the one Hartnett has tracked down ? who has her own designs for the clueless protagonist which results in series of flashbacks the likes not seen since the hey-day parodies on 'The Carol Burnett Show' whenever they aped a soapy potboiler. Byrne you see is in love with Hartnett unbeknownst to him and figures largely in the chicanery on display.To see it is hard to believe it yet somehow this hodgepodge of inept acting and too-pleased with itself camera-work and editing trickery makes it work! I know, I was equally baffled in the first half of the film saying this is so gonna suck and then when Byrne makes her unannounced entrance the film turns itself inside out and runs the gamut of hard to swallow plot contrivances but I'll be damned if it didn't get my attention and wonder just how the heck this was gonna get resolved.Based on the French film 'L'Appartement' screenwriter Brandon Boyce makes the ridiculous sublime ? no mean feat ? and director McGuigan (who helmed the crafty 'Gangster No.1') builds the suspense(ion of disbelief) nicely.Although Hartnett's quizzical bland looks (he reminds me of the idiot jock in high school the class brain would be saddled with to tutor trig to) he is ably supported by Kruger (late of 'Troy') who shows she is a pretty decent actress and not just a pretty face; Lillard at his goofy amiable and Byrne (who I nearly forgot she too was in 'Troy') who resembles Winona Ryder, is the best thing about this film as the head case who makes Glenn Close look stable in 'Fatal Attraction'. Enough said; wouldn't want to ruin it should you venture out to see it (on the next flight you take that is).A guilty pleasure rental for future romantic masochists; you know who you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love drives some people to do crazy, insane things in Scottish director Paul McGuigan's new movie "Wicker Park," a confusing, often exasperating, flashback-within-a-flashback, pseudo- erotic thriller about relationships that relies heavily on mistaken identities, improbable coincidences, and unrequited romance. Grim and humorless throughout its maudlin 115- minute running time, this over-heated heart-breaker about twentysomethings who think with their hormones might have succeeded splendidly as a madcap, door-slamming, bedroom farce. Unfortunately, acclaimed "Gangster No. 1" director Paul McGuigan and "Apt Pupil" scenarist Brandon Boyce miss the mark with their heavy-handed handling of these comic shenanigans. The action wanders aimlessly for about an hour and the dramatic pay-offs yield few surprises. Inexpressive heartthrob Josh Hartnett of "Hollywood Homicide" chases statuesque "Troy" beauty Diane Kruger, while chameleon-faced Rose Byrne tries to sabotage the Kruger &amp; Hartnett duo. At the same time, she dates perennial best friend character actor Matthew Lillard and devastates the chump. Not surprisingly, the lanky Lillard steals the show as Luke. He plays the stereotypically wacky, whiny braggart who constantly gets the shaft. Hilariously, Lillard wears his hair as if he were auditioning for the live-action version of "Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius." While I haven't seen French writer/director Gilles Mimouni's 1996 Gallic hit "L'Appartement," the basis for McGuigan and Boyce's vastly inferior "Wicker Park," it wouldn't take much to improve on this lukewarm, lackluster remake set in the Windy City. "Wicker Park" opens in Bellucci's, a contemporary upscale Chicago restaurant, where yuppie advertising executive Matthew Simon (Josh Harnett of "Black Hawk Down") enjoys dinner and drinks with his boss and the boss's sister, Rebecca (Jessica Pare of "Posers"), before he hops a jet to China to seal an important business deal. Rebecca uses the occasion to remind Matthew about their impending marriage. This none-too-subtle reminder unhinges our hero momentarily, and he excuses himself to make a phone call. Finding the phone booth occupied, he enters the gent's nearby and hears the voice of the woman on the phone through a ventilator shaft. The voice reminds Matthew of the girlfriend he hasn't been able to banish from his memories, Lisa (Diane Kruger), who inexplicably walked out on him. Sensitive, lachrymose lad that he is, Matthew never recovered from the shock of losing Lisa. Rushing out of the men's room, he catches a glimpse of Lisa as she scrambles out the door. Matthew checks the phone booth. He has a flashback to their first encounter at a shoe-store where best bud Luke (Matthew Lillard of the "Scooby-Doo" movies) works. In a "Cinderella" like fairy tale scene, Matthew kneels at Lisa's feet and struggles to find her a pair of shoes that fit. Although she doesn't buy any shoes, Lisa dates Matthew, and they become inseparable. She dances in the theater, and he works at a photo-repair shop when he isn't snapping pictures. Eventually, he gets a higher paying job in New York City and asks Lisa to join him. When she leaves without a word, Matthew goes to the Big Apple and achieves some success as an advertising executive. After this flashback, Matthew discovers Lisa's motel room key in the phone booth and races off to the Drake Motel. He winds up narrowly missing Lisa but spends the night sleeping in her bed. Not long afterward, Matthew tracks Lisa down to an apartment and uses another key he stole from under her doorway to get inside and await her return. Clearly, the Hartnell character has gone off the deep end. Earlier, he slept in her bed in the motel and didn't get caught. Now, he invades her apartment and collects her belongings as if they were souvenirs. Suddenly, while he prowls the premises, Alex (Rose Byrne of "Star Wars, Episode II: Attack of the Clones") walks in and discovers him. Initially, she treats him as an intruder and tries to dial 911. As it turns out in Boyce's twisting-turning-turgid melodramatic script, Alex has been pursuing Matthew without telling him about her obsession. Yes, she has a serious crush on him! Not only is she Lisa's best friend, but also she does her best to break up Lisa and Matthew, so she can get Matthew!No sooner has one character experienced a flashback than another character undergoes one, and "Wicker Park" turns into a wicked arabesque of intrigue maze that confuses us as much as the couples. McGuigan and Boyce complicate matters by adopting the "Rashomon" storytelling strategy, where each character gives an account of the story from their perspective. Originally, the Hartnett character was bound for China, but he hangs around Chicago after he spots Lisa. Striking Australian actress Rose Byrne's haunting portrayal of Alex's character resembles a mild version of Glenn Close's villainess Alex Forest in "Fatal Attraction." No, dear sweet devious Alex in "Wicker Park" doesn't cook any rabbits. By far, Rose's Alex ranks as the most compelling and responsible character, though never as amusing as Lillard's snake-bitten Romeo. Tiresome and tedious at best with its inevitable sappy ending, "Wicker Park" qualifies as a substandard soap opera.</fullReview>

I was shocked to see a rating of 6.6 for Wicker Park! This movie is absolutely terrible. I think it was worse than Cat Woman. Wait, I can not post my review unless I write ten lines?

		<fullReview>Love drives some people to do crazy, insane things in Scottish director Paul McGuigan's new movie "Wicker Park," a confusing, often exasperating, flashback-within-a-flashback, pseudo- erotic thriller about relationships that relies heavily on mistaken identities, improbable coincidences, and unrequited romance. Grim and humorless throughout its maudlin 115- minute running time, this over-heated heart-breaker about twentysomethings who think with their hormones might have succeeded splendidly as a madcap, door-slamming, bedroom farce. Unfortunately, acclaimed "Gangster No. 1" director Paul McGuigan and "Apt Pupil" scenarist Brandon Boyce miss the mark with their heavy-handed handling of these comic shenanigans. The action wanders aimlessly for about an hour and the dramatic pay-offs yield few surprises. Inexpressive heartthrob Josh Hartnett of "Hollywood Homicide" chases statuesque "Troy" beauty Diane Kruger, while chameleon-faced Rose Byrne tries to sabotage the Kruger &amp; Hartnett duo. At the same time, she dates perennial best friend character actor Matthew Lillard and devastates the chump. Not surprisingly, the lanky Lillard steals the show as Luke. He plays the stereotypically wacky, whiny braggart who constantly gets the shaft. Hilariously, Lillard wears his hair as if he were auditioning for the live-action version of "Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius." While I haven't seen French writer/director Gilles Mimouni's 1996 Gallic hit "L'Appartement," the basis for McGuigan and Boyce's vastly inferior "Wicker Park," it wouldn't take much to improve on this lukewarm, lackluster remake set in the Windy City. "Wicker Park" opens in Bellucci's, a contemporary upscale Chicago restaurant, where yuppie advertising executive Matthew Simon (Josh Harnett of "Black Hawk Down") enjoys dinner and drinks with his boss and the boss's sister, Rebecca (Jessica Pare of "Posers"), before he hops a jet to China to seal an important business deal. Rebecca uses the occasion to remind Matthew about their impending marriage. This none-too-subtle reminder unhinges our hero momentarily, and he excuses himself to make a phone call. Finding the phone booth occupied, he enters the gent's nearby and hears the voice of the woman on the phone through a ventilator shaft. The voice reminds Matthew of the girlfriend he hasn't been able to banish from his memories, Lisa (Diane Kruger), who inexplicably walked out on him. Sensitive, lachrymose lad that he is, Matthew never recovered from the shock of losing Lisa. Rushing out of the men's room, he catches a glimpse of Lisa as she scrambles out the door. Matthew checks the phone booth. He has a flashback to their first encounter at a shoe-store where best bud Luke (Matthew Lillard of the "Scooby-Doo" movies) works. In a "Cinderella" like fairy tale scene, Matthew kneels at Lisa's feet and struggles to find her a pair of shoes that fit. Although she doesn't buy any shoes, Lisa dates Matthew, and they become inseparable. She dances in the theater, and he works at a photo-repair shop when he isn't snapping pictures. Eventually, he gets a higher paying job in New York City and asks Lisa to join him. When she leaves without a word, Matthew goes to the Big Apple and achieves some success as an advertising executive. After this flashback, Matthew discovers Lisa's motel room key in the phone booth and races off to the Drake Motel. He winds up narrowly missing Lisa but spends the night sleeping in her bed. Not long afterward, Matthew tracks Lisa down to an apartment and uses another key he stole from under her doorway to get inside and await her return. Clearly, the Hartnell character has gone off the deep end. Earlier, he slept in her bed in the motel and didn't get caught. Now, he invades her apartment and collects her belongings as if they were souvenirs. Suddenly, while he prowls the premises, Alex (Rose Byrne of "Star Wars, Episode II: Attack of the Clones") walks in and discovers him. Initially, she treats him as an intruder and tries to dial 911. As it turns out in Boyce's twisting-turning-turgid melodramatic script, Alex has been pursuing Matthew without telling him about her obsession. Yes, she has a serious crush on him! Not only is she Lisa's best friend, but also she does her best to break up Lisa and Matthew, so she can get Matthew!No sooner has one character experienced a flashback than another character undergoes one, and "Wicker Park" turns into a wicked arabesque of intrigue maze that confuses us as much as the couples. McGuigan and Boyce complicate matters by adopting the "Rashomon" storytelling strategy, where each character gives an account of the story from their perspective. Originally, the Hartnett character was bound for China, but he hangs around Chicago after he spots Lisa. Striking Australian actress Rose Byrne's haunting portrayal of Alex's character resembles a mild version of Glenn Close's villainess Alex Forest in "Fatal Attraction." No, dear sweet devious Alex in "Wicker Park" doesn't cook any rabbits. By far, Rose's Alex ranks as the most compelling and responsible character, though never as amusing as Lillard's snake-bitten Romeo. Tiresome and tedious at best with its inevitable sappy ending, "Wicker Park" qualifies as a substandard soap opera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been very good,but bad writing gets in the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicker Park is a movie that starts out promising,but ends up becoming a convoluted mess.the actors all do fine jobs with what they are given,but the writing sinks the film.the movie has some degree of realism and logic in the earlier stages but then quickly bogs down in one implausible scenario after another.the movie is a suspense thriller and it does deliver on that count,but who cares,if you can't follow the movie.if you are left scratching your head at the absurdity of it all,the movie loses its initial appeal.wicker park won't be the worst movie you've ever seen,by a long shot.but it will end up hurting your brain trying to decipher,who's doing what to who,and why.this movie had so much promise,and with a better script,who knows how much better it could have been.instead of being above average,the movie is choked by mediocre writing and ultimately fails. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't get past all the confusion at the beginning. I was just wondering what the heck was going on? And where was this movie going? It wasn't too bad. After all, I did like "Vanilla Sky". But you spend most of the movie just frustrated. SPOILER!!!!Josh Hartnett is Matthew. A guy from Chicago with a future and a life ahead of him. He has a wonderful fiancée. She does absolutely nothing wrong. He lies to her about his business trip to China. He instead stays in Chicago to see an old flame. And as it turns out his old flame's best friend is keeping them apart. The best friend is Alex. She is also in love with Matthew. But Matthew's best friend is in love with her.It gets more confusing. I did get it. But I'm not going to see it again.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wicker Park: 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll bet that everyone's been wondering what good IL' Josh Hartnett has been up to recently. No? Me neither. But ever since Pearl Harbor, he's been caught in some sort of hell, where he never gets good parts, which really shows what a difference a summer blockbuster makes. Struggling studio MGM obviously didn't think that Wicker Park would be a summer blockbuster, therefore releasing it in the loser movie month of September. MGM, with recent box office duds as Sleepover and Soul Plane, seems to not be able to release that great of material. They just need one critical and financial success and then stuff like Wicker Park won't be coming out anymore. But I suppose we should try to support MGM, and that may actually be one of the reasons I saw Wicker Park.Matt (Hartnett) is an up-and-coming investment banker in Chicago, who's almost engaged and is about to take an important business trip to China. However, he thinks he sees his long-lost love Lisa (Diane Kruger, the face that launched 1,000 ships in Troy). He cancels his trip and goes around looking for her. Obvious clues are left along the way for Matt to get to Lisa. When Matt breaks and enters into an apartment he thinks is Lisa's, it turns out to be someone else's whose name is also Lisa (Rose Byrne). They become involved (so that's three people in one movie, in a span of a few days?).The direction and writing usually go hand in hand in movies, but here in Wicker Park, they couldn't be any more different. The writing, by Brandon Boyce (whose only other script was Apt Pupil), is laughable bad and absurd. It seems like the script tries to be all Tarantinoesque by having various flashbacks that come in at various times, for various lengths, and often tell us things that we already got. Before the first flashback comes, we see that Matt obsesses over Lisa, but why? We barely even see her in times that aren't flashbacks, so why are we supposed to care about Matt's obsession if it takes too long to find out anything about Lisa, their relationship, or even Matt? And the plot is construed in such an indecipherable manner, it's impossible to place order, unlike, say, Pulp Fiction. Events occur in random order, whether or not they're flashbacks, which leads up to the audience just not caring what happens. And then there's a completely implausible "confession" scene at the end (actually, like five of them), which definitely wouldn't happen in real life, and probably didn't happen in L'Appartement, the film on which Wicker Park is based.On the other hand, Paul McGuigan handles the awful material like a pro. The opening credit sequence is annoying, but there's a good amount of amazing camera shots, and some very cool, subtle split-screening. McGuigan meticulously works with the script to make it work as well as possible. He obviously doesn't want to screw around with it, but he does what he can, and pulls it off spectacularly. He makes some semblance of everything, and keeps some mystery of what will happen into it. Not much, because it's pretty obvious, but some nonetheless.Hartnett puts in a performance that seems straight out of acting school. His hand gestures are deliberate, as are his vocal inflections. Balancing him out was the spectacular Byrne, doing a chilling job, although she'll be forgotten because of the absurdity of the material she had to work with. And in the middle was Kruger, putting in an average job, but looking pretty hot nonetheless. The acting was like the rest of the movie: some was great, some was awful, but I doubt any part is good enough to recommend the movie.My rating: 5/10Rated PG-13 for sexuality and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much ado</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Montreal-made American version of the French film L'Appartement (Gilles Mimouni, 1996) is named after the star-crossed lovers' Chicago trysting place. The plot of the piece is tricky and so is the exposition, which has to go back over all the early scenes once we know what a certain person has been up to. Young Matthew (Josh Hartnett) is a photographer who sees and falls in love with Lisa (Diane Kruger, the unimpressive Helen in this summer's blockbuster Troy) shortly after another girl, (we learn later from flashbacks) has fallen for him. Complications ensue. Somehow Mattie gets cut off from Lisa just when things are getting really romantic, and both he and his best buddy get involved in meaningless stopgap relationships. Or so it seems. But anyway, never mind: impossible to relate the plot without giving away too many secrets. I'm told that L'Appartement has a murder in it. Wicker Park doesn't. That's a big difference, and the lack of such a central event would explain all the excitement and hurley-burley that seems so egocentric and absurd in Wicker Park. It's hard to comment further on the differences between the two when I haven't seen one of them but there's not so much a lack of clarity in Wicker Park as a lack of understanding on our part about why all this running around is going on. Of course it's a Hollywood thing to have no end of plane trips made or cancelled in the interest of romance, but Mathew certainly gets ready to go to China an awful lot of times, without going. The movie ends at O'Hare, appropriately enough, with another character probably about to cancel a flight abroad. It's not that Josh altogether falls short. He's an appealing mixture here of burgeoning suavity ? la Peck and puppy-dog confusion ? la Perkins. It's just that he gets no chance to exhibit the gift for physical comedy he showed in Hollywood Homicide and 40 Days ? and even as far back as The Virgin Suicides -- because this is a straight romance; but, apart from the soulful eyebrows, that physicality -- the goofy double-take, the ambling walk -- is his best feature. About that one person, who shall be nameless here, who seriously sabotages things: is she a bad egg? an example that people in love, as she defensively claims, will go to any lengths? or is she in fact a dangerous nut case? These are issues the American screenwriter doesn't seem to have worked out in detail. The rest of the cast does an adequate job. Rose Byrne, a more interesting Troy alum (she was the feisty Berseis), is, er, interesting as Alex, and Matthew Lillard is engaging if a bit old as Mathew's best buddy Luke. These details will matter little to Josh-watchers, who will simply be pleased to find that his pretty face, eyebrows and all, occupies about 98% of screen time. Use of a shoe store and a pair of high heeled red Italian shoes as a dating device makes it look like the authors of this 'romance' have been staying up late watching softcore pornmeister Zalman King's 1992 Red Shoe Diaries.No doubt something, perhaps something quite essential, was lost in translation from the French original because this movie has a lot of frantic activity but doesn't deliver the situations to justify it. But situations and actors provide some degree of charm and this is a watchable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh...114 minutes of my life I will never get back!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie alone, as all my friends decided to go camping and I just wanted to enjoy a show on my own. It is 114 minutes of my life I will never get back!!! EVER! It was a terrible movie. I haven't seen the original, but since I am not the biggest fan of a lot of Hollywood cinema these days, I would bet the French knew what they were doing.First thing I did after watching this movie, was wish that I could get my money back, then call a friend to tell them how horrible this movie was. I never do that, but I did that day. Hartnett was unconvincing, and just didn't pull it off for me. Lillard was more creepy and would have made more sense to be cast as the creepy-stalker guy, but since Hollywood sees it best to cast what they consider the "better looking" leading man, as opposed to casting appropriately, we get Hartnet, who just tried to look pretty in front of the camera. Reverse that casting, and you may have had a better movie.The experience of seeing this movie in the theater haunts me to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>McGuigan's romance/thriller about a young Chicago advertising executive who believes a woman he spots in a cafe is his long-lost love. Hartnett is decent in the role, a bit better than his other work, but nothing special, i still have not too much good to say about this actor. Meanwhile Lillard was decent here, though he does overact and tend to get annoying, though Diane Kruger was very good, an underrated actress. The film was done decently, the direction was not bad, but it appeared confusing at times, with the cluttered script, thus the atmosphere was not anything special, though it should have been. The film could have been much better, but ended up just being so-so.--- IMDb Rating: 6.6, my rating: 7/10</fullReview>

It's a waste of money, and i don't understand how this director gets credit. it is as stuipd as vanilla sky, but vanilla had tom cruise so it made money. this movie is going to lose so much...above all, they cut the nudity so it will be pg-13 and all the teens could come watch josh...well he is one of the worst things in this movie, he looks so stuipd! ho i hate this movie, cant wait to see the reviews</fullReview>
