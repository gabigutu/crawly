		<shortDescription>"Good night, Lina."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That could have been Cary Grant's most chilling line in his long career.*SPOILERS*Except RKO didn't have the courage of its convictions. Having bought the rights to Francis Iles' novel, and despite Hitchcock's insistence on sticking with the original ending, neither preview audiences nor the studio were ready to accept Cary Grant as a murderer. So its present ending was hastily written and shot. It completely subverts all the fine work that's gone before.Joan Fontaine was a brilliant actress and valiantly, passionately, breathlessly tries to make the shockingly amateurish dialogue in the final scene work -- "Oh, Johnny! You were going to kill yourself instead of me, like the audience and I have thought for the last 90 minutes! Oh, Johnny! It's as much my fault as it is yours! Oh, Johnny! I was only thinking of myself . . . ," etc.Cary Grant does his best with this final abomination of a climax. "Lina! Lina! How much can one man bear! When you and the audience thought I was in Paris murdering Beaky I was really in Liverpool!" Etc.Huh?In other words, this beautifully produced, directed, acted and written psychological suspense thriller turns out to be about a charming lazy n'er-do-well who's sponged and embezzled his way through life, who marries a beautiful but neurotic aristocrat who, from day one, increasingly assumes the worst about her husband -- convincing herself (and us) that he's killed before and now is about to kill her?"Just kidding," the tacked-on final scene says. "It was all innocent. You eating popcorn out there in the dark, and Lina, should be ashamed for even THINKING such things! Go home now." It helps, out of self defense, to watch "Suspicion" with the original ending in mind. Yes, the milk is poisoned. Yes Johnny killed Beaky in Paris. Yes, he's a psychopath who lies, cheats, steals and kills. Yes, Lina believed him and loved him deeply -- the only man she's ever loved. Yes, her life is no longer worth living, now that she knows the truth about Johnny. Yes, she rightly suspects that milk is poisoned. So she writes a letter to her mother, telling the truth about Johnny's exploits, and that he is poisoning her as she writes -- and that she intends to die. She seals the letter and gives it to Johnny to mail. She drinks the milk. Johnny leaves and unknowingly drops Lina's letter into a mailbox, thus sealing his fate.THAT'S a rewarding ending.It also makes everything that's gone before (including writing, directing, performances and cinematography) plausible. It gives "Suspicion" a reason to exist.But that's the novel's ending.The film's "Lina and the audience are just paranoid" ending makes fools out of all the talent on display here. And of us.Hold mentally to the original ending and you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sustained Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While in many respects one of Hitchcock's lesser films, "Suspicion" has some good performances and a degree of suspense that is as sustained as in any of his films. The movie gets quite a lot out of a relatively simple plot.Joan Fontaine gives an excellent performance as Lina, a quiet young woman who finds herself swept away by, and suddenly married to, the charming but irresponsible Johnnie, played by Cary Grant. Not long afterwards, she begins to question his behavior and his intentions, and soon she is terribly afraid, both of what he might have done and of what he might do. Whenever she manages to overcome one of her fears, no sooner does she do so than her husband gives her a new reason for suspicion. There really isn't much more to it than that, but Hitchcock gets a lot out of this basic premise. The tension keeps building, and Fontaine's performance allows the viewer to feel all of her fear and anxiety. Not everyone likes the way that it all ends, but it is worth seeing and deciding for yourself what you think about it.The rest of the cast have mostly limited roles, but give good performances that add to the portrayal of the main characters. Especially good is Nigel Bruce, who provides a few lighter moments as one of Johnnie's old cronies.While lacking the complexity and excitement of Hitchcock's best pictures, "Suspicion" is still a good example of his ability to keep the audience in lasting suspense. Most Hitchcock fans will want to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slight thriller with star power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant (Johnnie Aysgarth) was 37 when this was released and perhaps at the pinnacle of his sexual charm (but not at the pinnacle of his career by a long shot); and Joan Fontaine (Lina Aysgarth--not "Linda," as the video jacket mistakenly has it), 24, was fresh from her very fine performance in Rebecca (1940) alongside Laurence Olivier, also directed by Alfred Hitchcock, for which he garnered his only Best Picture Oscar. I don't think this film is nearly as good. It is saved from being something close to annoying at times only by the star power of the leads and a fine supporting cast, especially Nigel Bruce (best known perhaps as Dr. Watson in a number of Sherlock Holmes films) as Cary Grant's friend "Beaky."The problem with the film lies partly with the casting of Cary Grant, although not in his performance as such. He was seen as such a valuable property by the studio that the proper ending of the film was considered inappropriate and so it was changed. Along the way we see a lot of mixed foreshadowing so it is impossible to tell whether his character is that of a loving husband who is a bit of a rogue or a cold-blooded murderer who married Lina for her inheritance and intends to kill her. We can see how the latter possibility might not work so well since she was only getting a subsistence allowance from the will of her father who disapproved of the marriage. And there are all those dark scowls that Grant manufactures, somewhat awkwardly I must say, to keep us in doubt. What is apparent is that Hitchcock had one ending in mind and then had to change it and wasn't able to redo some of the earlier scenes that worked better with the old ending.At any rate, Joan Fontaine is very good, lovely, graceful and focused. With this performance she went one up on her older sister Olivia de Havilland by winning the Best Actress Oscar. And it is a bit of a spicy treat to see Cary Grant as something of a heavy, at least part of the time. For most of us, who have seen him in many films, his character has always been sterling.I must also note that some of the production seems a bit unnatural. Grant wears his suit and tie all buttoned up even when visiting Fontaine in their bedroom (carrying the infamous glass of milk, which I understand was backlighted with a bulb inside the glass to make it almost glow). Fontaine's Lina appears mousey and bookish at the beginning (it is suggested that she was in danger of being an old maid!) but later develops a more sophisticated style. And I don't think Hitchcock or Grant really gave her enough cause for the sort of fear she experienced. The final scene with its quick about-face was not entirely convincing or conclusive either.Contemporary audiences might wince at the plodding direction by Hitchcock. They might even wonder why he decided to make a movie from such a familiar and lightly plotted tale not far removed psychologically from a romance novel. But Hitchcock always erred on the side of giving the mass audience what he thought they wanted. What they wanted here was Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine together romantically with some mystery and doubt along the way.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>I Suspect a Cop-Out Ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it weren't for the Code which did not allow murderers to get away with it at the end, or the apparent miscasting of Cary Grant as the ambiguous husband, SUSPICION would rank higher as a subtle masterpiece of sheer, romantic suspense.Over the years many critics have stated that Grant, in his first collaboration with director Alfred Hitchcock, doesn't quite convince much as a man who progressively seems to have ulterior motives with the people around him, most notably his wife. I personally believe that evil is best expressed under a facade of deadpan deceptiveness, such as the friendly neighbors in a similar thriller, ROSEMARY'S BABY. Of course, you might think: isn't this film completely different from SUSPICION? Not really. Strip away the Satanic plot and all you have is a growing sense of paranoia surrounding a similarly mousy wife who slowly realizes her husband and everyone around her is not what they seem. And we know how that film ended.Grant is a perfect choice to play Johnnie Aysgard. He has the dark, handsome looks, that gleaming smile and loving charm and he literally sweeps spinster Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine, Oscar winner for this role) off her feet. His presence only vaguely suggests the menace hidden underneath and this is perfect for a convincing psychological, cerebral thriller. If Lon Chaney, for example, had played Aysgard, or Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, or even Basil Rathbone for that matter, it wouldn't be hard to yell at the screen and pinpoint the villain in the story. Grant, however, is so completely at home in his ambiguousness that even in the climactic scene where he drives Fontaine to her mother's home, we still can't quite decide what his intentions are even though every added piece of evidence leads to the mounting horror that he is about to kill her.And his presence is the reason this movie works as an excellent psychological thriller even if the ending is a letdown. Using an actor like Grant misleads the public into being sucked into the lighthearted tone of the first third of the story. Introducing the most trivial of incidents surrounding his playboy-like character, which gradually lead to more sinister ones does the tone darken and before we know it we're in the middle of a tense drama of wills between husband and wife and staring at that ghostly glass of milk, wondering if to drink or nor to drink.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mysterious Cary Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the very first time, we see a mysterious side to Cary Grant. Up until now, Grant played the Romantic Comedy actor with a few acrobatics roped in from his days on the stage. Even his tears in 'Gunga Din' and 'Penny Serenade' did not lift him into the category of a serious actor. In 'Suspicion' however, Hitchcock takes Grant's career to another level by setting up in the audience's mind the suspicion of whether or not he is a murderer. Although the plot is overly dramatic and revolves around the suspicion of whether or not Grant is a murderer, there are other redeeming qualities that lift it out of itself. Frank Waxman's score for one was nominated for 'Best Score', and was part of an early alliance with Hitchcock which led to him scoring 'Rear Window'. The all star cast of Grant with Fontaine, Cedric Hardwicke, Nigel Bruce fresh from the 'Sherlock Holmes' films. And the opportunity in Grant's career to be seen in a different light. Unlike 'Rebecca', this was not a Selznick or even a Hitchcock film, it was a Cary Grant film that gave him a depth of mystery in his profile which was beautifully articulated in 'Charade' 22 years later where you weren't quite sure whether or not he was a crook or a protagonist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch's sacrifice for acceptance in Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Lina "Monkey - face" Aysgard and her husband Johnny is from a novel by Francis Iles called BEFORE THE FACT. Hitchcock liked Iles' novels, which were unusual because the heroes were actually anti-heroes. Johnny is an upper class wastrel who is not unwilling to swindle or kill if it benefits himself. He is responsible, actually, for at least three deaths in the story. Interestingly enough, Hitch always wanted to do Iles' "Black Comedy" novel MALICE AFORETHOUGHT, as a film - possibly with Alex Guiness - wherein the anti-hero Dr. Bickley (based on Dr. Crippen and Major Herbert Armstrong) poisons his wife and several others in a charming little village in the English countryside. Unfortunately, Hitch never got to do MALICE AFORETHOUGHT (but it has been done on BBC television once or twice).He had just pocketed the "Oscar" (for the only time in his career, by the way) for REBECCA - his first American film. Hitch apparently thought he could do anything. He was now to discover he could not do everything.To begin with, Iles' novel ended with Johnny facing the loss of his wife (but in a curious switch - Lina willingly takes the poison he brings her, and actually destroys him emotionally because Johnny was secretly ashamed of this crime - he really loved Lina and she kills herself to help him out). If the Hays and Breen offices had any imagination they would have realized that the film would have been so far better and more moral if they had left the ending alone. Johnny would have been too cowardly to ever kill himself, and would have gone to his grave realizing what he threw away. It would have been a worse punishment than if Johnny had been hanged.But the censors would have none of it. If Lina died Johnny must be punished. Hitch played around with changing the ending (he did this frequently in his adaptations of novels). He would have had Lina write a note to her mother, explaining that she knew Johnny was going to kill her, but she loved him and would let him. Johnny would poison her with her evening milk, and then (while happily whistling) post the letter to her mother (Dame May Witty).Here he came acropper with another portion of the Hollywood scene: Cary Grant's agent and RKO Studio. Both were very image conscious, but that image was comic or dapper or likable - but not murderous. Grant himself would have enjoyed the change (ten years later he might have tried to do it with Hitch that way*). But in 1941 too many interested parties were opposed. As a result, Grant's part had to be rewritten. (*A few years later, Grant appeared in MR. LUCKY, as a gambler who decides to commit a fraud regarding a war effort charity. He does use violence several times in the film, but he reforms against his partner in the fraud - though he violently kicks him in a fight - and ends up enlisting in the army. That and his role as Ernie in NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART were the two closest negative parts he had after SUSPICION, and neither is a total villain.)Johnny remains a charming wastrel, who loves gambling, and who depends on others to pay for him. But he is struggling to try to go legitimate, and in his best scene in the film (when he is trying to get financing from Nigel Bruce for a building project) he shows a sense of reality that is just missing from most of the film. He turns on Joan Fontane, who thinks Grant is planning something crooked at the expense of his friend Bruce and begins "gumming up the works" of his business deal. Actually one sees there what the film might have been like, but it was a rare moment of real juice in the movie.Grant does as well with the part as he can, as does Fontane (who won the Best Actress Oscar award). But it is a hollow victory in the film. Best are Nigel Bruce as Beaky Thwaite, Johnny's close, doomed friend (and in the novel his victim). Also in a brief role is Leo G. Carroll as Johnny's cousin and employer who is swindled by him. Carroll only has one brief scene, but is memorable as one of the few outsiders who calls Johnny's character correctly.In later years, after he showed his box office success, Hitch would be able to make his central figures negative ones. As pointed out elsewhere on this thread, Joseph Cotton would be "Uncle Charlie" the murderer in SHADOW OF A DOUBT within two years. Later on he would do THE PARADINE CASE, where defendant Alida Valli was guilty, and STAGE FRIGHT, where suspect Richard Todd lies partially about the crime to the audience at the start.I have one particular complaint. Johnny borrows a volume from the Notable British Trial series from a neighbor who is a mystery novelist. It is the trial of a 19th Century poisoner who once killed a victim by betting the victim that he could drink a bumper of brandy without stopping for breath. This (when Fontane hears of it) resembles the death of Bruce. This actually happened in the 1850s to a notorious poisoner who was a gambler. He was Dr. Palmer of Rugeley. And there is a volume of the Notable British Trial series about Palmer. But it was Dr. WILLIAM Palmer historically. In the movie the volume is clearly labeled THE TRIAL OF RICHARD PALMER. Somebody did not do their research properly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspicious Minds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Hitchcock thriller from 1941, early in his American period, and earned its star, Joan Fontaine, an Academy Award for Best Actress. She's excellent in the leading role, though her performance isn't quite so fine-tuned as the one she gave in the previous year's Rebecca, which this one in many ways resembles. As her gregarious and engaging gambler of a husband, Cary Grant overwhelms her in the acting and charisma departments. This is more or less Fontaine's movie, but Grant steals it with his charm.The story is is old one about a woman who marries a mysterious and handsome gentleman who's up to his ears in dark secrets. There's not much more to it than that, aside from the little issue of whether or not he's going to murder her for her money. When a close friend of the husband dies under mysterious circumstances, the wife's suspicions begin to literally enshroud her, enveloping her in a haze of nervous expression. Hubby's strange behavior and dark glances don't help matters.Adapted by Anthony Berkeley and Samson Raphaelson from a novel by Francis Iles, the movie suggests rural England better than most American films; and the supporting cast, which includes Dame May Witty, Cedric Hardwicke, Leo G. Carroll and especially Nigel Bruce, are all fine. Bruce plays Grant's old school twit of a friend, and the scenes of the three of them,--Grant, Fontaine and Bruce--have a rare intimacy, as we really believe that these characters care for one another. The movie's ending was controversial at the time, for a number of reasons. It works well enough for me, but then again Hitchcock generally does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needed A More Plausible Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's 'Suspicion' starts off as a slow moving silly romantic comedy before switching to a thriller. Hitchcock's style of narrating the story as the events unfold is brilliant as usual. Cary Grant turns on the charm button but it is Joan Fontaine who steals the show. Lina's increasing suspicion, confusion and despair as she discovers Johnnie's deadly secrets are skillfully displayed. Hitchcock maintains the element of suspense and increasing tension very well. However, it is the ending that is a let down and the only reason I can think of why such a closing was chosen was to fulfill the Hollywood 'happy ending' standard. 'Suspicion' could have been an excellent dark thriller had the ending been more plausible and made sense of all the preceding events. Yet, it remains a good job mostly because of the crafted way Hitchcock builds tension throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I was kind of undecided. I had taped an Alfred Hitchcock marathon on TV and I only watched it for the sake of watching another Hitchcock film. The second time though, was in the back seat of a conversion van on a LONG road trip and I had a lot of time on my hands, so the more movies I had to watch, the better.I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having read about the movie, I knew that the ending wasn't Alfred Hitchcock's first choice, but I thought the final shot was very beautifully filmed, and the ending was ok with me.Of course, the whole movie is beautifully filmed in brilliant sunlight. I think the only really dark scene is the milk one. However, the theme of a woman suspecting that her husband is a murderer is indeed dark.The movie is about Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) who marries the rascally Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). She slowly begins to suspect that he is plotting to murder her for money, and it certainly doesn't help when his best friend dies under mysterious circumstances. Fontaine is excellent in her role and she certainly deserved her Oscar.The movie is really quite entertaining. Many people consider Rebecca or Notorious Hitchcock's best movie of the 40's. I like both films a lot, but something about Suspicion makes it my personal favorite of the decade.This is a must-see for Hitchcock fans. Full of classic performances and of course, suspensefully directed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In earlier comment I speculated on the difference between the ending of the film itself and the novel on which it is based, "Before the Fact", by Francis Iles. According to the eminent film historian David Shipman, the book was about a woman who gradually realises that her husband plans to murder her, but who is so much in love she does not mind. He quotes Hitchcock as saying the inappropriate ending of the film came about because the producers, R.K.O., would have refused to let Cary Grant be a murderer.

		<fullReview>Lina McLaidlaw is a bright, solitary young women who falls unexpectedly in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly eligible bachelor with a penchant for losing money. They get married, but almost at once Lina is subjected to Johnnie's addiction to lying, gambling and getting into debt. Despite his flaws, she is unable to resist his charming manner, until she starts to suspect he may be harbouring murderous thoughts toward her ...This is a good movie, well-made, with an attractive cast, a good script and possibly the single lousiest ending in movie history. Okay, that's maybe going too far, but not by much. Lots of films change the ending of a book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc) but the last two scenes of this one not only manage to be horribly lame, but also render the entire preceding plot completely meaningless. The story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral lacking - and what she knows about him - to kill her. It should end (as it does in Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley's book Before The Fact) with him attempting to murder her. The reason it doesn't is that the studio forced Hitch to reshoot the ending, one of the first examples of the godawful process of preview audience testing. Hitch was canny and did what he was told (this was only his third film in Hollywood) knowing that if he played the game, sooner or later he would gain creative control of his films, evinced by his masterpieces of the fifties. But that still leaves us with a turkey of an ending. This is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme - does anyone really know their husband or wife that well ? The script is excellent, with many off-guard moments (such as when Lina's father dies and Johnnie assumes she's crying about it), a finely-judged performance by Grant (who never played a villain again) and fine photography throughout, culminating in the famous glass-of-milk shot. Fontaine won an Oscar for this performance, although personally I prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier victimised wife role in Rebecca. I would like to rate this movie higher, but I really can't forgive that ending; this is what happens when movies are made for money, not love, which I guess is curiously the theme of the film itself. Look fast for Hitchcock's cameo as a man posting a letter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Argue With Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock always dismissed his work in Suspicion. There was too much interference from the front office at RKO Studios which demanded a happy ending here. They also demanded an ending in which Cary Grant is not exposed as a calculating murderer.As it is Cary Grant is poaching on Tyrone Power territory, doing one of those hero/heel roles that Power specialized in over at 20th Century Fox. I would not be surprised if an offer was made to Mr. Zanuck at Fox for Ty's services. But after Marie Antoinette, Ty Power never did a film away from Fox until 1952's Mississippi Gambler. Grant's Johnny Aysgarth is what could be now described by that antiquated word, wastrel. He doesn't work, lives off his parents and has a bad gambling habit. He meets, woos, and weds the very prim and proper Joan Fontaine, daughter of Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Dame May Witty. Hitchcock builds this up the way it was built in Night Must Fall for Robert Montgomery to be the murderer. In that film, though Montgomery got an Oscar nomination, the public repudiated the picture. No one wanted to see Montgomery as a murderer.Seeing that you can't really blame RKO for interfering, but the film was ruined for posterity.Joan Fontaine won for Best Actress in Suspicion as the wife who gradually comes to suspect Grant has plans to do her in. In many ways her character is similar to the one she played in Rebecca the withdrawn girl who the evil housekeeper wants to harm.Rebecca was a much better film than Suspicion and it won for Alfred Hitchcock his only Best Picture Award from the Academy. Fontaine got her first really good notices for Rebecca and got overlooked at Oscar time.As is a tradition in Academy voting, they made it up to her the following year with Suspicion. Fontaine's rivals that year for the Oscar were Bette Davis for The Little Foxes, Barbara Stanwyck for Ball of Fire, Greer Garson for Blossoms in the Dust and Fontaine's sister Olivia DeHavilland for Hold Back the Dawn.In fact DeHavilland was the Las Vegas oddsmaker's favorite that year and Fontaine's win was one of the biggest upsets in Oscar history. The sisters had a history of feuding and this one really stoked the fires of resentment.As for Alfred Hitchcock, he was able to cast against type a year later another popular leading man, Joseph Cotten, as a murderer in Shadow of a Doubt. I guess Cotten hadn't been around long enough to typecast at the time.But you can't argue with success and who was Hitchcock to try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They don't make movies like this anymore. It was a delight to watch this classic by Hitchcock. I rank it high alongside North by Northwest, Vertigo, Spellbound and Birds. The story takes place in British countryside and brings back the memories of colonial gentry. I am not sure if everyone understands how high a position it is to be a General in British army as skillfully portrayed by Cedric Hardwicke. It surely is way above comparable ranks in the US army both from the standpoint of class and money. Cary Grant is a playboy who takes an interest in the General's daughter much to the chagrin of her family. Joan Fontaine is at her best as the General's daughter, though Cary Grant's performance is slightly comic. I never thought of Cary Grant as a great actor (his best performance was probably in North by Northwest). But don't let this slight weakness discourage you from watching this gem. I have watched it over a dozen times and still get excited watching it.</fullReview>

Cary Grant's rogue is charming and amusing but simply unconvincing as a possible murderer and Joan Fontaine frets, dithers, and whimpers so long and so feebly that no sensible audience would vote to keep her alive past the second reel. In short, the movie simply goes nowhere.This is simply a directionless film with no ending and not much point.

		<shortDescription>Is this Movie not aging well or was it just plain bad to begin with?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a seriously talented director. Many of his films are undeniable classics that have stood the test of time and are highly watchable to this day. This list could include The 39 Steps, Rear Window, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, Vertigo, The Birds, Shadow of a Doubt, and a few other films.However, "Suspicion" is not aging well at all and is really so unwatchable that it seems to me that it was probably a bad film even by 1941 standards. The list of scenes that work well could be listed on a matchbook with a crayon. The script is loose and ridiculous most of the time, but the acting seems so forced and wooden and borderline amateurish throughout, that it is almost unbelievable. Joan Fontaine tries to shore things up but she is on a slippery slope and Cary Grant doesn't provide much assistance. His acting is so bad at times that I have seen better performances in high school plays or college Theatre Experience classes where a Chemical Engineer is acting for the first time with no formal training.After about 30 minutes of watching this film you may find yourself reaching for the DVD sleeve in the dark to see if you accidentally picked up some kind of special edition version that was cobbled together without any editing.The subject matter is serious, yet the film has a silly and trite feel to it that just seems so out of place you become numb with perplexity."Suspicion" is basically unwatchable and another very very very overrated BAD movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very low quality from Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't dislike Cary Grant but I've found his performances annoying in enough films to notice; this, Arsenic &amp; Old Lace and Bringing up Baby. I don't dislike him in North by Northwest but I really find that movie unbearably silly. On top of that I find the endless raving about Grant's class tiresome. I don't have a clue what his class does for the viewers who herald it. It doesn't do a thing for me.In the behind-the-scenes feature included with this DVD Patrcia Hitchcock says that Grant was her fathers favorite leading man; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better leading man in a string of better Hitchcock movies.With it's ruined ending this is really half a movie and doesn't bear discussion, and can't support the high ratings it's getting. Even if the movie had it's ending intact there's not much to it. Fontaine is a completely unsympathetic sucker. She has to remain numb, inactive, and unwilling to contact anyone but Johnny for the whole movie, in either ending, for his ploys to work. That's not much to work with. Cary Grant begins every line with "Monkeyface..." until I wanted to strangle him. He says it about sixty times. It's positively grating. Hitch's technique here is shockingly shallow. An endless succession of rooms/sets have a phony skylight projected on the rear wall as a spiderweb effect. And a light-bulb in a glass of milk may make fans excited, but it can't save a movie this poorly made.Peter Bogdanovich should retire if he does one more Hitchcock/Cary Grant imitation on a DVD. I think that's his whole career now. As soon as I saw him, I thought, oh crap, here comes an imitation that only he's impressed with. Instead there were two! oh joy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Suspense-Packed Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mood at the beginning of this Alfred Hitchcock classic is rather playful and humorous but as its story develops the atmosphere becomes more and more tense. The subtle way in which this change happens is very impressive and just one of the reasons why this psychological thriller becomes so gripping. Based on Francis Iles' novel "Before The Fact", it recounts a series of incidents that lead a newly married woman into suspecting that her husband could be planning to murder her. Is she really in mortal danger or is she just neurotic? Dowdy,bespectacled, Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) meets the debonair Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) on a train and helps him out of an awkward situation when the ticket collector points out that Johnnie's in a first-class compartment and only has a third-class ticket. Lina's also intrigued when she notices his photograph in the society magazine that she's reading. A little time later, Johnnie goes to the English village where Lina lives and engineers a meeting with her. He's very persuasive and charming and very soon they elope together. After a wonderful but extremely expensive European honeymoon, they return to their large country house to start their new life together.Lina's shocked when Johnnie admits that he's absolutely penniless and persuades him to take a position he'd recently been offered at his cousin's estates office. Shortly after Johnnie begins his employment with Captain Melbeck (Leo G Carroll), his best friend "Beaky" Thwaite (Nigel Bruce) comes to stay. The very jovial but tactless Beaky tells Lina that he'd seen Johnnie at the racetrack in the previous week and later when she discovers that her new husband has sold the two antique chairs that they'd been given as a wedding present by her parents, she presumes he'd done so to pay off his gambling debts. Lina soon realises that Johnnie is a compulsive liar and subsequently discovers that he'd been fired from his job because he'd embezzled ?2,000 from the firm. Melbeck tells Lina that he'd given Johnnie time to pay back the money to avoid having to prosecute him.Shortly after, Johnnie tells Lina that he's planning to embark on a large real estate development and that Beaky has agreed to invest a substantial sum of money in the project. His na?ve friend trusts him implicitly but Lina is convinced that Johnnie will simply use his friend's money to pay off Melbeck and so discourages Beaky from continuing with their plans. Johnnie gets angry about this and abandons the whole project. Beaky then decides to go to Paris and at his invitation; Johnnie agrees to go on part of the journey with him. When Lina is informed by the police that Beaky died suddenly in mysterious circumstances in Paris and Johnnie tells more lies about his whereabouts at the time, she suspects he may have killed his friend. Then when she discovers that he'd also made some enquiries about the possibility of raising money on her life insurance policy, Lina starts to fear that he's also planning to murder her.In "Suspicion", the audience is taken on a suspense-packed journey that leads to a denouement which arrives very unexpectedly and provides a complete anti-climax. Fortunately, the journey is so good in this case that the ending (which had to be modified to meet the requirements of the studio and the Production Code) doesn't detract too badly from the enjoyment of watching this movie. Cary Grant is superb as he makes his character's unusual mixture of charm, wit and ambiguity come to life so convincingly and Joan Fontaine, in her wonderful Oscar-winning performance, makes Lina's vulnerability, shyness and anxiety very real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm surprised so many people are disappointed with this movie. It doesn't seem to me more unreal than any other Hitchcock film. As always, the highlights are those moments when we get a glimpse of someone doubting what someone else is saying. This movie specializes in such moments and, inasmuch as doubt is Hitchcock's stock in trade, I can't find anything wrong with SUSPICION. It's playful, scary and, yes, escapist. Hitchcock never made a realistic movie, and I thank him for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Hitchcock but not great...flawed by flat ending...(possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RKO was so convinced that audiences wouldn't want to have Cary Grant depicted as a murderer that they changed the ending of the film--the result being that all of the tension and suspense leads to an unsatisfyingly flat ending that seems a real cop-out. Other than the false ending, 'Suspicion' is highlighted by the performances of Fontaine and Grant--both excellent--with Cary showing us the darker side of his nature and Fontaine showing a stronger side that was glaringly absent from 'Rebecca'. Nigel Bruce does some nice emoting as Cary's friend.The ploy of having a wife suspecting her husband may be a murderer has been explored in many a movie but not with the subtle Hitchcock touches that make this film so absorbing. Tension builds slowly as the audience is led to believe that Grant indeed may be a man with murder on his mind.Joan Fontaine won a Best Actress Oscar (she lost the year before for 'Rebecca'), and is thoroughly convincing as the uncertain woman who begins to wonder about the playboy she so impulsively married. Grant, of course, is perfect as the devilish carefree wanderer who seems strangely unaffected when his friend suffers a heart attack. His character is not as clearly defined as Fontaine's--purposely, so that the audience will wonder about him. An especially interesting scene has him carrying a glass of milk on a tray to his wife's bedroom--just one of the Hitchcock touches that gives the film a subtle hint of suspicion.Nicely photographed with an appropriately suspenseful score by Franz Waxman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Miscellaneous Hitchcockian Nuances In Serious Need of a MacGuffin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What kept me intrigued throughout this thoroughly disappointing venture from the Master is apparently precisely what kept it from being genuinely realized at the time it was made. That is that the profoundly charismatic Cary Grant is required to play two wholly contradictory characters simultaneously. Most of the time, this is executed by having him be his light-hearted, jaunty self on screen and learning suspicious things about him when he's offscreen, until a handful of crucial but ultimately anti-climactic moments at and toward the end. Speaking gingerly of which, a crucial aspect of Hitchcock's genius was that he could make movies where something so not only everyday but so kindly as a glass of milk could become a threatening and ominous peril. In Suspicion, it only makes me wish I were watching another Hitchcock film.Suspicion is about a bashful and unrealistically fragile young woman, played with unseemly melodrama by the otherwise incredibly graceful Joan Fontaine, who marries an enchanting gentleman, only to increasingly suspect him of attempting to kill her. Whatever the truth of the matter should turn out to be, it should be earned through a genuine character arc, not an utterly transparent contrivance rooted in either the audience's unimaginative inability to accept, or the studio's ignorant presumption of the audience's unimaginative inability to accept a likable star playing even a potentially menacing character. Either cast this story in a way in which it can be done, or don't do it. If you have to cheat those of us who are mature enough to undertake it for its authenticity in order to appease those who staunchly prefer you take the easy way out, and you are the Master, I would expect you would be prepared to take your artistic integrity seriously enough to evaluate whether or not you're passionate enough about this material to get it made and, if so, fight for it.Hitchcock was the leading exponent of Hollywood and, though not to the brash extent of Preminger or Lang, had the ability to smuggle themes and subjects past the censors, constantly trying the perimeters of the Hays production code, as well as portray themes and subjects in ways so uncanny that the only way they register is purely in the minds of the audience. Watch Revenge, the Hitch-helmed first episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, or reflect on the true nature of the relationship between John Dall and Farley Granger in Rope, to see the zenith of this talent. Even here, in Suspicion, he has the unmarried female mystery writer come for dinner with the Haysgarths one evening with a female companion who wears a manly hairdo, clad in a suit and tie. No reference is ever made of who this character even is or why she's even present; she has no function in the story, hence it's plainly cued that she may be the mystery writer's lover.This is why I can't understand why Hitch could end up with such a compromised, jagged piece like this. I won't criticize it for being light-hearted in tone, because that is what pulls us along, up to a point. By us I mean we the contemporary audience who is so familiar with Hitchcock's sleight of hand, whether or not we were around when he was still presently releasing films, that his ruse is not just a ruse but a way of cluing us into the fact that there is a ruse afoot, that the wool will be pulled from over our eyes in a matter of time, gradually or suddenly. Potentially, there was a great effect that could've been had in Suspicion by luring us with the pretense of a blithe romantic plot before the rug is pulled from under us to find sinister goings-on, almost akin to Oliver Stone's use of genre-linked tone in setting up Born on the Fourth of July. Alas, no such luck. What results is a set-up with no pay-off because various people for various reasons felt we couldn't handle the pay-off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is often criticized for its cop-out ending, but even worse is the beginning. The introductory scenes are sloppily constructed and the characters are annoying. Grant is a broke, lazy, and deceitful cad (these are his good qualities; he may also be a murderer) who somehow manages to move about in high society. Fontaine is beautiful and supposedly intelligent but marries Grant after about five minutes of courtship. Bruce is a blithering idiot but somehow has millions saved. The film gets better after Grant stops behaving like a buffoon and there are some nice Hitchcock touches, such as the classic scene with the glass of milk, but it is not enough to save this from mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what 'Suspicion' was about when I sat down to watch it, so it was a pleasant surprise to have this story unveiled before me.It begins telling a story of love(or obsession if you will). It is one of the finest depictions I have seen of what being in love with someone you've only spent brief time with can do to you. Hitchcock depicts this all-to-common aspect of life beautifully.The film then delves into the suspicion that forms in Lina's mind. All the time still paying attention to the initial love that gives strength to the movie. Hitchcock, doing what he does best, builds the suspense. Cary Grant plays this character very well, and I know from the beginning that something fishy is going on with him. I found myself sitting forward, wondering what exactly was going to happen. Was he going to kill Beaky? Was he responsible for her father's death? Would he indeed kill Lina? Thanks to Hitchcock, I didn't know, but I knew it very well could happen.Then came the end. I honestly wish it ended with Grant throwing her out of the car, or at least attempting to. The movie built up too much to that point to settle for this ending. It doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the film. However, the film was very enjoyable throughout that I don't mind it so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A neglected gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ridiculous ending for this film is probably the reason why it hasn't been as popular as Notorious or other 40s Hitchcock films. 'Tis pity indeed, for this is otherwise a very good film. The use of light and dark, continued in Strangers on a Train, Rope and Vertigo, is displayed here to great effect, with the famous sequence with the glass of milk and the light from the window a standout. The performances are all brilliant, and Nigel Bruce is as likeable as ever as the ill-fated friend. The tension builds well, and it reaches breaking point at a dinner party where Cary Grant asks some pretty incriminating questions about poisons to a pathologist and a crime writer.One thing about this film bothers me. On the wall by the front door of the house is a Cubist painting. It looks like a still life of fruit on a table. In the scene where the two detectives visit the house, whenever anyone looks at the painting a bizarre little piano "sting" plays, indicating it is of some significance. However the picture is never mentioned again. Is this a red herring, or was it of some significance to the original ending? Whatever, it's a weird little detail that you ought to look out for.When the film started off as a rather dated love story I was doubtful, but the compelling performances and the nice touches of humour made it surprisingly enjoyable. 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strong Psychological thriller from Alfred Hitchcock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. Its really fast. Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine did a great job doing their roles. As for the ending, I really liked this ending far better than Hitchcock's ending. The audience simply refused to accept Cary Grant as the murderer. So RKO didn't want Cary Grant to become a villain in the end.So Hitchcock ended up making a different ending where Cary Grant is not guilty. It does make more sense than the original ending, because everything we are watching in the movie is in Lina's point of view except the ending. When the current ending was added, I think the film ended up becoming more of a psychological study on Lina.I think Johnnie is more like a ghostly figure to Lina with many roles. For Example, he suddenly appears to Lina after Lina writes a letter that she is leaving him in the middle of the film. Another Example is Johnnie (door scene) suddenly appears to Lina and Beaky when they are talking about the corporation. Another scene is after Beaky's death. Johnnie suddenly appears in front of Lina right after she finds out that Johnnie left the club yesterday morning.There is another major question that we should look into. The question is "who is Johnnie?" We see him in different roles throughout the film. We see him as a playboy, romantic person, a good friend to Beaky, Immature and lazy husband, mysterious husband, a thief, and as a murderer. But which will you pick? This also gives a psychological question to the audience - who are you? That is why I like "Suspicion" far better than the book "Before the Fact".But I don't believe he is a murderer. If he was looking for money, then he would have married a woman who was far more rich. Not only that Lina's father didn't like Johnnie. And Johnnie knew that.We even see Lina saying this in the beginning of the movie "Oh, I know you didn't marry me for my money. You could have done much better elsewhere." Beaky knew that Johnnie lies. But he knew that Johnnie is a person who doesn't destroy the lives of others. That is the reason why he visited Johnnie often. Not only that, Beaky was a good friend of Johnnie since his childhood. And Johnnie was broken all of his life financially. Lina's suspicion starts only after their marriage. If Johnnie was responsible for the death of Beaky, then he would have been focusing on getting the profits from Corporation. The Corporation is still in place, because Beaky wasn't able to sink the corporation. So if he was the murderer, he wouldn't have applied for a "loan" out of Lina's life insurance policy.If Johnnie isn't a murderer, then what is the reason for the increase of Suspicion?Lina's Suspicions increase only after her father's death. Her father's death was very shocking for her. So this might have been one of the reasons that led to the increase in her Suspicion. The audience should also notice that it was Lina, who bought "Murder on the Footbridge." And it was Lina who spelled "Murder" (Anagram). And Suddenly, she started imagining Johnnie killing Beaky.Audience completely travel with Lina after that. In Lina's mind, there is also an internal conflict between her and her father about Johnnie. Lina's father didn't like Johnnie. Even Johnnie mentions it in the beginning of the film (Portrait Scene after the Hunt Ball). And Lina was against her father. This conflict continues even after her father's death. For Example, Lina talking to her father's portrait - "He didn't go to Paris. He didn't go to Paris. I tell you." She fears that her father's opinion on Johnnie may come true. This may have been a major reason for the increase of her suspicion. As for the testimony of the waiter, it isn't clear if Johnnie is the murderer. This is because French waiter only has a slight understanding of English. So its also highly possible that Beaky was talking about Old Bean, but not talking to Old Bean. French Waiter says "Old Beam or Holby" referring to "Old Bean." So we know how much he understood the conversation.If you like suspense movies, then this is a great movie. It confuses the audience a lot. And this movie had great influences on thrillers like Vertigo and Psycho.I will give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, to be swept up in Cary Grant's arms and never to be let go. That's the heroine's fantasy in this classic Hitchcock suspense film. And who among us would not share that fantasy despite the fact that Grant's character, Johnny, seems to use his impetuous nature to cover up the fact that he's more than a bit shady around the edges.After all, if you have spent your life being a Plain Jane, and a smiling Johnny (Cary) calls you "monkeyface" with adoration in those handsome brown eyes, why quibble with details? -- Besides, didn't Cary prove that your money is not at the root of his love when he married you anyway even after your father cut off your inheritance because of his suspicions of Johnny.Joan Fontaine deserved her Oscar in the film's central role. And it has always resounded with me as sort of a personal theme piece --- always having been attracted to men with a bit of a dark side.Hitchcock's masterpiece and Fontaine's fantastic acting allow you to identify with her thoughts and emotions before she thinks or emotes them. This is an all-time classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film's director Alfred Hitchcock must know a thing or two about building suspense. I must tip my cap to old school movies such as this effectively tugging on my emotions. -And I thought they were primitive?-sentiments revoked. Anyways, the acting in this film is exceptional. Joan Fontaine's character has an effective hopelessness throughout the movie; constantly putting up with her husband's lies and lead ons, until finally her suspicion overcomes her. The above-mentioned husband, played by Cary Grant must have been a cultural icon. The slyness that he brought to the table persisted throughout the movie, and often left the viewer wondering what he was going to do next. All in all the film was a quite entertaining suspense. Provided sufficient comic relief, and left somewhat of a cliffhanger-which was appropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A WARNING TO CONSUMERS: Avoid the colourised version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel as though I've just committed a mortal sin. Having just watched 'Suspicion (1941),' my latest in a long list from the Master of Suspense, I've come to consider it one of the director's weakest. There's not really anything particularly wrong with it: there are two excellent performances from Joan Fontaine, lovely as always, and Cary Grant, debonair as ever. The story, adapted from the novel "Before the Fact" by Anthony Berkeley/Francis Iles, has shades of 'Rebecca (1940)' about it, with Fontaine as a newly-wed young woman having difficulty assimilating into a marriage in which she can never feel comfortable. What went wrong, then? The best way I can describe it is that the atmosphere and tone of the picture was completely askew; it seemed odd that Hitchcock would choose such a dark and shadowy mystery for his first venture into Technicolor. It wasn't until the film's conclusion, after I had decried the incongruity of the washed-out colour photography, that I realised I'd been watching a colourised version of the film. Had I known beforehand that the film was supposed to be in black-and-white, I would most certainly have delayed my viewing until I could find a genuine copy.Perhaps misguided by the cheery, dazzling colours of the 1980s "restoration," the film's opening act struck me as being very light in tone, akin to the screwball comedies that Cary Grant had been doing for several years, and not at all like the vaguely-ominous shadow of fate for which, I'm sure, Hitchcock had been aiming. The film slowly develops some wonderful suspense when Lina (Fontaine) begins to suspect that her gambling playboy husband (Grant) may be plotting murder, though, once again, I fear that the vivid colours distracted significantly from the desired atmosphere. The film's conclusion, drastically altered by the studio from the original novel to avoid tarnishing the public image of their star actor, is an unfortunate letdown ? when they lost their nerve, they also lost a very powerful ending. Of course, my criticisms of 'Suspicion' turn out to be rather hollow, and I couldn't possibly review it honestly without viewing the film as Hitchcock had intended it. Nevertheless, my experience can serve as a warning to other cinema enthusiasts, and as a stern criticism of the cultural vandalism that is film colourisation.</fullReview>

It is only after the honeymoon that she discovers his true character and she starts to become suspicious when Johnny's friend and business partner, Beaky is killed mysteriously.A slight thriller with star power. Alfred Hitchcock at his best. But however, this movie is a methodically slow, generally engrossing but somewhat overlong Hitchcock thriller. His directorial precision is evident throughout, but the abrupt ending doesn't really reward you for the attention that you've been paying until then.Rated PG for Profanity.</fullReview>

In this film he seems to be this poor lost soul who can't get a grip on life. Which was a different feel for Grant. I loved the character of Lina, I thought Fontaine did an excellent job of playing her as a shy and wary person, but with a strong side to her as well. I liked the story idea, I thought it was clever, but consistent with the style of Hitchcock. I liked the cinematography, I thought that it had beautiful scenery and locations. I loved the camera work with shots and angles, there were some really great close-ups that showed Lina's expressions of complete shock or horror (mostly just from her thinking too much) that had a great affect on the mood and tension of the film. Clearly a great move on Hitchcock's part. Great film really enjoyed it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another of Hitchcock wartime pictures, when he was really in a transition phase between his British and US periods, with some of the styles of both eras mixed together. He returns to an English setting, but this is moving much more towards the feel of his American pictures.Hitchcock really gets to develop and splash out on one of his key themes ? the red herring. Suspicion is really a film entirely based upon misleading the audience. Then again, upon a second viewing you will see there are as many subtle clues as to the actual ending as there are obvious red herrings. Hitchcock also seems to want to be reminding us of his last film of this type, Rebecca. The set-up of the romance in the first twenty minutes of the film bears some similarities. They even have their honeymoon in Monte Carlo, where the de Winters met each other in Rebecca. This was presumably a deliberate ploy by Hitchcock to make the audience think of the extremely troubled marriage of the earlier film.A nice Hitchcock touch on display here is his way of starting a scene with a burst of music and a revelation, such as when the two leads take that first walk together, and it suddenly looks as if she is struggling in his arms on the cliff edge. Making a scene burst in like that was pretty daring and unconventional at the time but it really makes the audience sit up and take notice. There are a fair few expressionist touches as well, the most obvious example being the immense shadow of a circular skylight which dominates the Aysgarth's house, and looks like a giant spider's web. Joan Fontaine is consistently shown in long shot dwarfed within this shadow.I have to confess that neither Cary Grant or Joan Fontaine are actors I'm particularly fond of, but they are well cast here and they do a good job. The real treat though is seeing character actor Nigel Bruce (who had a small role Hitchcock's Rebecca) in a slightly larger part as Cary Grant's bumbling best friend Beaky. He is simply the archetypal jolly, blustering upper class Englishman, and he provides some much needed comic relief.Perhaps the greatest strength of Suspicion is the way in which the audience is forced to travel with Joan Fontaine and share her doubts and suspicions. Cary Grant comes across as genuinely untrustworthy, and the only one who trusts him is Beaky who is so na?ve he actually reinforces the suspicion.Suspicion is not a bad film. Hitchcock was really beginning to consolidate his style here, especially the part that he referred to as "playing the audience like a piano". But still, it's a minor Hitchcock really. I've never really been sucked in by it. It has all the elements that should make it a classic, but none of them are turned up to eleven, so to speak.</fullReview>

This is consider a minor film, but despite the fact that the topic and the movie seems today old , the film is pretty , the photograph is beautiful , it has a grate suspense and you can feels Lina desperation. At the end of the movie, Cary Grant kill his wife, but later producers change the end, so because of the new end, some people considered Suspicion as a minor piece. From my personal point of view it is one of the British Director more subvalorated films This movie was important for Cary Grant, he won his first Oscar nomination, he made here the transition from being a comedian to being respectable character actor, and also was his first collaboration with the master of suspense. In the movie was excellent as the charming aristocrat who prefer murder someone to find a job. Joan Fontaine (at that time with Bergman, David O. favourite actress) is believable as the neurotic and placid wife, she deserved the Oscar from Rebecca and her job here justified her Oscar. She is my favourite Hitchcockorean blond girl, because she seems more human than the other actresses, that they are cold , she is not, her performance is lively. Sorry Grace and Ingrid you are grate actresses but I prefer Ms De Havilland. I could not understand why in Hitch one hundred years, moviemakers and critics prefer to invite Tippi Hedren and Janet Leigh as Sir Alfred's vocers, than these wonderful Japanese-British actress, that from my point of view have more interesting details of Hitch life than Melanie and Jamie moms, specially relation with the master of suspense relationship with Selznick and with Alma. To sum up, even these movie now at days seem old fashion, so is impossible to make a loyal remake, But movie still magical with some romance, well create tension moments and excellent performances I hope that one day I will see the original end</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock attempting to tap into the unsavory side of Cary Grant...it nearly works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Provincial young woman from a well-to-do family becomes infatuated with a shady playboy, who draws her in by keeping her guessing; after they've married and she proposes he find a job, secrets and suspicions about the man's past and personality come to the surface. Sumptuous melodrama-cum-thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock, who lays out the pinpoints of this plot like a series of extravagant desserts--hoping his ingredients will please the masses. It's rather an overripe, overeager picture, better in the somewhat stodgy opening sequences than in the hysterical final reel. Joan Fontaine won a curious Best Actress Oscar as the increasingly-nervous wife, while Cary Grant (in his gorgeous glory years) works seriously to make the disreputable lout of a husband into a charming cad. Flimsily entertaining, though hardly anything more. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A timid, attractive young girl named Lina(Joan Fontaine) falls in love with John(Gary Grant) an adventurer, wealthy man. Her parents( Dame May Witty and Sir Cedric Hardwicke) are opposed about the relationship. However, they early married ,living in Sussex . Then she gradually realizes and suspects that her hubby is allegedly a murderer and that she is the intended victim . Lina fears may be next on his list. After 39 steps and Jamaica Inn Hitchcock was encouraged to go to America and promptly won Oscar to best picture for his first film there, titled Rebeca. Later,R.K.O, Radio Pictures offered him the direction of Suspicion. The picture packs tension , thriller,suspense and excitement. The film is one of the splendid thrillers with 'imminent danger' as its theme, achieving the maximum impact on the audience and containing numerous exciting set pieces with usual Hitchcock touches . The movie is full of lingering images as the glass(Hitch put into the object a light) of milk and shot of the characters upstairs pacing up and down with shades on the walls. The casting is frankly magnificent .Gary Grant, actually named Archibald Leach ( born in Bristol,1904) in his first Hitchock film is excellent. Joan Fontaine as the timid, shy bride consumed with fears is awesome and won a deserved Oscar to best main actress. First rate secondary cast constituted by Nigel Bruce the famous Watson who worked in Rebeca too ; Dame May Witty (The lady vanishes) ; Cedric Hardwicke(The rope)and Leo G.Carroll a habitual in Hitch movies. But to Hitch didn't like the film for the cutting out the ending, due to production's insistence to retain the sympathetic image Gary Grant, the most attractive of all Hollywood actors ; however Hitch will let ultimately to remake his movie .The motion picture is based on a novel titled : Before the fact and screen written by his familiar brain trust, his wife Alma Reville and Joan Harrison. Also shown in computer-colored version though best avoid it .It's remade in an inferior version by Andrew Grieve(1987)with Anthony Andrews and Jane Curtin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie features a fabulous cast, including Joan Fontaine, who won an Oscar for her role as Lina Aysgarth, I think it's Cary Grant who steals the show in "Suspicion." Grant is magnificent as Johnnie Aysgarth, an irresponsible yet dashing scoundrel. You truly believe through the entire movie that he's trying to kill his wife, Lina. Then, in the explosive final minutes....well, I won't give it away! =)Masterfully directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this movie belongs on a top ten list of Cary Grant's best films.

		<fullReview>This movie, as with "Spellbound", doesn't seem to be aging very well unlike "Notorious" which remains highly watchable. Some scenes work well, others just labor on. A tighter script would have helped things keep moving along but Hitch apparently liked pictures with long, drawn out conversations. I think that is actually one downfall to his movies being seen today by a new generation. Unless you're a true die-hard fan, some of his movies have a snooze factor built it in, including Vertigo. This doesn't attract new viewers who's attention spans can't go more than a few seconds without seeing an explosion.There is a lot to like here, and the second half of the movie moves right along. It is unfortunate that Cary Grant's image was such that people wouldn't believe he was capable of murdering his wife. This would have been a much more powerful, and interesting movie if they had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Suspicion" is a classically Hitchcockian film, with Joan Fontaine as a woman who marries a charming scoundrel, played by Cary Grant, who she begins to think might kill for money. Parts of the film, such as Grant's "courting" techniques, seem rather dated, but the tension builds well, and my interest was held throughout. The ending, however, seems tacked-on and very unsatisfying in execution, even if not in content. This seemed to me to be a lesser film than the best of Hitchcock's output during the 40's, such as the earlier "Rebecca" (also with Fontaine) and the later "Notorious", but anyone who enjoys Hitchcock's films in general will likely enjoy this one as well.Overall Rating: 3 stars (out of 4), or 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspicion starts out like a nice romance. You wonder where the typical Hitchcock mystery and intrigue are going to arise from. Cary Grant meets Joan Fontaine and seems to immediately like her. He's charming and very forward and pretty soon she seems to fall for him as well. Still, the whole thing feels a bit rushed and really they don't know each-other that well, which is probably asking for trouble. In real life, I've often found people end up not as perfect or as nice as you thought they were once you get to know them. Cracks start appearing in their personality, little nasty or hypocritical things about them.Well, perhaps Grant's character is not so flawless after all. What's good about the movie is that we can strongly relate to Fontaine's character. She starts to become ever more concerned and frustrated at her husband's behaviour. She comes across as intelligent and perhaps her only weakness is how much she loves him - she may be too forgiving. I can't say much else, but the movie cleverly leads us to feel more and more suspicious without ever revealing anything explicit. We can never be sure, there is always some doubt.Joan Fontaine won an Oscar for her performance (the only ever acting Oscar won for a Hitchcock movie) and perhaps it was also a nod to her acting in Rebecca (1940) the previous year. But she is very good in this film as is Cary Grant. I found Grant funny in a lot of scenes but then started to feel uncomfortable about him. It is a scary situation to be in, feeling afraid of someone but having no solid evidence of misdeeds and having no good excuses to behave any differently from normal. He appears cold at times but we don't necessarily know exactly why.Suspicion reminded me of The Prestige (2006) in that I wanted to discuss it with other people afterwards. It engaged me, put me through some emotional ups and downs and left me feeling a bit confused and unsure. But that can be good. It's not predictable and there is certainly some amount of ambiguity by the end. But because of that, it stays in your mind and you keep pondering it, analysing it.There are parts that are truly haunting and also heart-breaking. The main characters really do appear to be in love. But one of them has bad habits and a tendency to be manipulative at times. Maybe he can't help it and maybe he can change. Maybe it's not worth the trouble for his wife but then can't love conquer all? Her suspicions feel justified but could he really be like that? I think we are much more vulnerable to those we love and to even suspect them of something can cause immense pain. Joan goes through these feelings and so do we.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Is More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's best movies in my opinion. It predates and foreshadows a number of later movies, such as Gaslight, The Two Mrs Carrols, In a Lonely Place etc. The balance between comedy, drama and thriller is great, and a bit unusual for its time too. It's possible that with another lead than Cary Grant, Hitchcock would have pursued a more horror-oriented course: Grant played rather a screwball character here, also in comparison to his roles in Notorious and North by Northwest.The two most memorable sequences concern a glass of milk and a policeman's starring at a (bad) Picasso replica. The latter has been discussed here on IMDb, and is in my belief merely one of the director's many whims. Besides, he did fancy Spanish painters cf Dal?'s participation in the making of Spellbound. I do not find it likely that Hitchcock by this scene wanted to comment on the state of the female protagonist's mind, or to make a reference to the glass of milk scene. Why in heaven would he had thought that to be necessary?!(Being the most influential director of all times, Hitchcock frequently has to be over-analyzed. For instance, the brief close-up of a record label in Psycho, showing that Norman Bates was listening to the Beethoven Symphony called 'Eroica', has been interpreted as a sexual reference - 'Erotica' - to go with Bates's weird persona. On the other hand, the word 'sexual' actually occurs overtly in the movie: the psychiatrist says it when explaining that Bates is not a transvestite. So, why would Hitchcock have to subtly use a Beethoven title to bring on the subject?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would you care for a glass of gloomy milk?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I nearly haven't seen all of Alfred Hitchcock's films, I can almost certainly say that this is one of his lesser efforts ? primarily due to the tremendously unsatisfactory, dumb, cowardly and upsetting finale. But, first and foremost, it has to be stated clear that the ending was imposed by production company RKO because they feared any other (and more exciting) denouement would have damaged the reputation of protagonist Cary Grant. And, secondly, even a less memorable Hitchcock is still a very solid and exemplary thriller and there are numerous aspects that make "Suspicion" a worthwhile and even recommended viewing. The script, adapted from a novel by Anthony Berkeley, is quite familiar and rudimentary. Intelligent and independent Lina falls head over heels in love with the irresistibly charming Johnnie Aysgarth and marries him, also because she doesn't want her parents to think she'll be an old spinster. Lina quickly discovers her husband is a swindler, a gambler and a bona fide liar atop, but she's madly in love and blindly forgives him all the little missteps. But when Johnnie sinks deeper and deeper in debt, Lina begins to fear he might even be a murderer. In spite of the clichd plot, "Suspicion" often is a gripping domestic thriller with a handful of tense highlights and superior performances. The beautiful Joan Fontaine righteously won an Oscar for her stellar performance of the incredibly naive but increasingly nervous damsel and distress, while Cary Grant demonstrates the astonishing ? and pretty unique - skill of being charming and despicable at the same time. There are good comical supportive roles for Nigel Bruce (who can still impressively imitate a duck like he did as Dr. Watson in the Sherlock Holmes cycle) and the fake cardboard English countryside when the protagonists are driving their car. Apart from being the good old master of suspense, Hitch also showcases his sinister and pitch-black sense of humor (notably during the scene when Grant receives a pair of antique chairs as a wedding gift) and his expressionist vision (the famous milk-moment).*edit/update: I just learned that Joan Fontaine passed away at the age of 96; only 3 days after I submitted this review. I really hoped for her to make it to 100, but alas. Rest in peace, Mrs. Fontaine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as intense, but still classic Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rebecca" should have been the film to provide Joan Fontaine her Academy Award, but "Suspicion" suffices. The two films are really miles apart despite coming out in consecutive years in 1940 and 1941, but Fontaine's performance in both highlights Alfred Hitchcock's ability to scout the finest talents in addition to crafting master suspense."Suspicion" is a true romantic thriller that almost exactly like "Rebecca" follows a relatively naive and previously sexless young woman who weds the man of her dreams only to find not everything is as it seems. In this case, the bookish Lina (Fontaine) meets the impressing Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant), who courts her with every ounce of charm. Lina gives in to him in part because of her wealthy and somewhat repressive parents, but ultimately because he's tough to resist.Little could be considered Hitchcockian about the first act of the film. It spends its time building up the romance between Lina and Johnnie so that the impending events will be seen more clearly from Lina's perspective. If any tension can be found, it's due to Johnny's unpredictable personality, not from Hitchcock's direction. Grant's magnetism and his ability to capture both Prince Charming and something more potentially sinister all at once makes him ideal for the film. "Suspicion" was the first of many Grant-Hitchcock collaborations and considering the auteur's penchant for telling stories with people who aren't what they seem, one can see why.As Lina begins to psychologically tiptoe toward the edge, Hitchcock's skills come more into play. Fewer scenes could be dubbed "classic Hitchcock" in this movie than in most, but the feeling that something major will happen never ceases to nag. At the same time, nothing all that big does happen, and for all its craftsmanship, "Suspicion" turns out to be tamer Hitchcock. Blame Hollywood for softening the ending.Still, Fontaine and Hitchcock work together to make "Suspicion" work, enough so, at least, that Fontaine could claim her Oscar with a sense of pride. She's the focus of the film, even though its Johnnie who intrigues the audience the most. Is he just a troubled gambler too proud to admit fault, or does something darker lurk under the surface? The fact that we address these questions from Lina's perspective forces us to observe the film's events (some that are frankly ordinary) with the same paranoia she does."Suspicion" falls under the category of very good films from a director who has done better, which in the case of Hitchcock translates to a great film shadowed by its creator's countless masterworks.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>That ending... really a cheat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent suspenser with only the fatal flaw of that ending. It really defines the words "tacked on".Everything leading up to that misstep points to Johnnie as the... well, you know what he's supposed to be. Cary Grant gives a very adept performance as a the prototypical rogue or slacker, whatever labels you can pin on him. Too bad his screen time is somewhat limited here.The main focus is on Joan Fontaine's character, Lina. Too bad she wasn't a more revered actor, because she really does well with "harder to play, than you might think" character. I believe she won the Academy Award for it as well. I had only seen her in one film prior, coincidentally another Hitchcock show, Rebecca, where she was pretty much overshadowed by the two other leads, Judith Anderson and Laurence Olivier. She looks pretty good too.Back to that ending. It makes very little sense. If they (don't know who was responsible, except it was not Hitchcock), were worried about having a major star look bad, then why did they include the subplot about Grant's friend. That particular plot doesn't get resolved as neatly as it should have been. Another thing is that Johnnie doesn't seem to care much about it either.Anyway, I will recommend this for Grant's very out of character performance and for Joan Fontaine. As said before, she is very pretty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow-burning guessing game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A detailed romance-cum-mystery that sees Hitchcock at his most insignificant and yet watchable. The light, fluffy storyline sees straight-laced Joan Fontaine falling for darkly dashing Cary Grant ? but as their relationship develops she comes to realise that there may be more to her new beau than meets the eye. The first half of the film is the kind of old-fashioned romance they stopped making a long time ago, and you wonder if Hitch's heart is really in it. As the mystery deepens the director (and audience) get more involved, until it all builds up to a fairly tense climax.Cast-wise, the actors do no wrong: Grant seems delighted to get his teeth into a rather murky character, and Fontaine is fine as the reserved churchgoer swept up into a world of double dealings, debt and deceit. The much-maligned Nigel Bruce has an excellent supporting role as a buffoonish friend of Grant's, and once again proves a delightfully amusing screen presence. Look out for a brief cameo from SPELLBOUND's Leo G. Carroll, a director cameo that's almost impossible to spot, and a decent set-piece involving a speeding car.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If you're going to kill someone, do it simply."Suspicion is aptly named. In fact, you could say that the entire movie is summed up in the title. In this Hitchcock thriller, the famed director once again tackles the subject of murder. Through a series of suspicious events and her own intuition, Lina (Joan Fontaine) becomes suspicious that her loving but deceitful new husband (Cary Grant) is capable of murder. Will she end up dead as a means to an end to pay off his gambling debts, or will her imagination end up making her unfairly push away her loving husband?Hitchcock does a good job of keeping the viewer in the dark about Johnnie's true nature until the end, and keeps the movie interesting, as a result. I liked Fontaine and Grant in this, they gave good performances. They didn't surpass their work with Hitchcock in Rebecca and To Catch a Thief, respectively, but I certainly didn't have any complaints. Grant is suitably ambiguous, and Fontaine portrays the see-saw emotions of her character well.&nbsp;Overall, Suspicion didn't blow me away the way that my favorite Hitchcock movies did, but it was enjoyable. Even middle-tier Hitchcock is worth checking out, in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thought of a woman as beautiful as Joan Fontaine having to spend her life as a spinster is pretty humorous. So yes, this is as narratively simple and unsophisticated as they come, but its a good lesson in how a storyteller has to keep his audience engaged. Long before this came out, the world of film was already diverging and expanding beyond the realm of plays. Filmmakers had realized that it was possible to enhance the effectiveness of storytelling using techniques that were impossible with plays. In cinema it was no longer enough to have just "pure" storytelling, or mere filmed-plays. With films you could engineer the narrative in such a way that the viewer is somehow more directly placed within it. Today there are hundreds of such methods. This film (and Rebecca as well) used a trick that has now become the most common strategy to engage the audience : the viewer surrogate. Here it is the Fontaine character. We experience the world of the film through the limits of her vision. In these early films you can see this technique in its most elemental form. And to make it more engaging, the director adds intrigue and suspense in his usual way. Fontaine acts well, and she's lovely. Surprisingly, even a film this old contains self-reference : we have a husband who loves mystery novels, and a character who is an obvious nod to Agatha Christie (who worked in the very same genre of stories as Hitchcock).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unmistakably Hitchcock. Lina (Joan Fontaine), an unworldly bookish spinster, is swept off her feet by the looks, carefree charm and intense attentions of "Johnnie" Aysgarth (Cary Grant) who she (and we) see at the outset is smartly dressed, has his picture in the paper in the company of high society yet is travelling in a first class carriage with a third class ticket and only coins in his pocket (and even less to his name). His serious interest in her is kindled when he learns that she will become an heiress. That he is a charming conman is quickly established, at least by the audience. But it is softened by the arrival of his older friend who knows him yet still finds him a likable, amusing if rather wayward character with an amazing ability to lie and charm his way out of a corner.Each scene increasingly reveals or suggests that "Johnnie" is a far darker character than his friend believes him to be. Lina is no fool and seeks to find out the truth for herself and act accordingly. Only of course "Johnnie" - clearly the most glamorous, charming and persuasive suitor she has known, full well knows how to manipulate her emotions and has snared her. Increasingly darker and darker truths are revealed about him. Is there nothing he would not do for money. Murder? No, there is nothing the man she so dearly loves would not do and that almost certainly includes murder - of her if necessary, and in the rational side to her mind she begins to realise it. It is Lina's struggle to reconcile her feelings for the outwardly charming Johnnie with dread suspicions of a horrible reality that is one moment glimpsed, then like a mirage, disappears.The book portrays Johnnie as a text book psychopath. There is nothing he wont do - a monster with the appearance, at least to people who do not know him well, of an utterly charming and amusing but harmless rogue. The book maintains its integrity in following through in realistic fashion to the inevitable grim outcome. Hollywood, but not Hitcock, was unwilling to risk box-office takings. The textbook psychopath so clearly and consistently signposted throughout the movie is given a get-out clause. The ambiguous ending allows audience members who cannot reconcile good looks and limitless charm with coldly calculated murderous deception to leave the cinema comforted - later perhaps to become victims themselves. The rest will have been thrilled and chilled, and in the process forewarned. Each will leave the cinema, in very different ways, thoroughly satisfied, nobody will want their money back. That part, thorough professionalism, was Hollywood at its best</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suspicion is directed by Alfred Hitchcock, screenplay by Alma Reville, Joan Harrison and Samson Raphaelson, music by Franz Waxman and stars Cary Grant, Joan Fontaine, Nigel Bruce and Cedric Hardwicke.Suspicion features two fine performances from Joan Fontaine and Cary Grant and has a very interesting storyline.This isn't one of Hitchcock's best films but is well worth watching.In a quiet British country town shy and wealthy Lina(Joan Fontaine)falls in love with local man Johnnie(Cary Grant).The two marry and he encourages her to be more open and she is very happy.However she soon becomes very suspicious about his actions and mood swings and when she meets his best friend Beaky(Nigel Bruce)her worries grow stronger.We worry with her is Johnnie a murderer? is she safe?There is enough evidence shown to support her suspicions and enough evidence to prove she could just be hysterical and Johnnie is innocent.This underrated Hitchcock thriller gives us Cary Grant in the role that could have moved his career in a very different direction.In Grant's capable hands Johnnie appears charming and kind yet has enough edge so that Lina's suspicion of him being a murderer are not just hysterical thoughts.I suspect though that the studios didn't want to damage his romantic leading man image by having him play a dark character so perhaps that was a major factor in the ending we are left with.However we are given a glimpse of the kind of character he could have played if given a chance.My problem with Suspicion and indeed for once with Hitchcock,is that it doesn't have the guts to end on a dark and frightening ending.As it is though we are left with a very good thriller and Joan Fontaine is breathtaking as the young woman who becomes slowly more paranoid towards the love of her life.Yet this could have been so much better but don't let that put you off watching this as it is very good and as you expect from Hitch filled with lots of suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suspicion could have been one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. Up to the final few minutes of the film, it's wonderful. I even enjoyed (or at least didn't mind) the long-winded verbal exchanges that some viewers seem to dislike. I'm a fan of intelligent, well-written dialogue and that's what I found for most of Suspicion's runtime. Hitchcock masterfully uses these scenes to build doubt in the viewers mind. Cary Grant is perfectly cast as the playboy husband with more than a few secrets to hide. Could there really be a killer hiding behind that handsome, jovial, carefree exterior? As for Joan Fontaine, I know I'm starting to sound like a broken record by praising performance after performance, but she is amazing. She plays the bookish, timid old-maid so believably. Her character is one who is easy to sympathize with and fret over as you begin to fear for her life. It's very nicely done.It's a shame that Hitchcock was saddled with this ending. It feels rushed, tacked-on, and sloppy. It successfully puts a damper on everything that comes before it. It's something of a cruel joke. I was reminded of the famous shower scene from the television show Dallas when we as viewers are told to forget about everything we had seen. It didn't happen. Doing a little reading since I finished watching Suspicion, I've read the description of the ending Hitchcock originally intended to shoot and use. And I'm in agreement with most everyone else ? the original ending would have been great. It's too bad the studio and Grant's people felt the need to have it changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of SUSPICION is well-known: Repressed, spinsterish Lina (Joan Fontaine) meets a devastatingly handsome man on a train who turns out to be Johnny Aysgarth, a local socialite. Unmarried, Aysgarth excites the desires of every woman who crosses his path. When he and Lina meet again by chance, he becomes smitten. A wary Lina refuses his attentions until she overhears a conversation in which her parents speak of her dismissively, saying that she's just not the marrying type &amp; that they will therefore "have her on their hands" forever. Afterwards, Lina pursues Johnny - in fact, she stalks him, tracking his movements by telephone and obsessively reading everything about him. The ill-matched couple are married in due course, but Johnny turns out to be a ne'er-do-well and a schemer. Ultimately, Lina convinces herself that her husband is a murderer and she is meant to be his next victim until a glass of milk triggers an open confrontation...Hitchcock's follow-up to REBECCA was a huge success back in November 1941 and remains one of his most popular today, but over the years has suffered a decline in its reputation, thanks largely to Hitchcock himself - for decades, he complained to anyone who would listen that RKO studio executives forced him to alter the conclusion. Yes, it is true - the ending of SUSPICION is NOT what Hitchcock CLAIMED he would have preferred, nor is the ending of the film the same as Francis Iles' 1932 source novel, "Before the Fact." In both the novel and the unfilmed ending, Johnny Aysgarth is a cold, manipulative sociopath who does indeed kill his best friend and later his wife. Certainly, the ending proposed by Hitchcock - in which Lina allows herself to be poisoned but not before she asks Johnny to mail a letter for her, a letter which reveals her husband's crimes - would have worked. The fact of the matter is that such an ending was impossible to shoot in 1941, when suicide could not be portrayed on screen. A legend has grown up that Hitchcock was forced to alter the "real" ending after a disastrous test screening, but that particular conclusion was rightly rejected by audiences - in it, Johnny brings Lina the famous glass of milk, then realizes what she is thinking. Stunned by the knowledge that his wife believes him capable of killing her, he leaves her to join the RAF, where he fights bravely in the Battle of Britain and becomes a hero. This ridiculous ending wound up where it deserved to be - on the cutting-room floor! I might be in the minority here, but I love SUSPICION as it is and have no complaints about the ending, which as it stands is one of the most shocking reversals in movie history. Rather than providing us with a tale of a murder from the victim's point of view, the stunning surprise of the ending turns SUSPICION into a tale of erotic obsession and sexual madness. Early memos between Hitchcock and the RKO production staff demonstrate that Hitchcock wished to concentrate on the main female character's inner fantasy life early in the production's development, as several biographers have now confirmed through research in studio archives. In a way, SUSPICION may be the ultimate MacGuffin - the entire movie is a clever bit of misdirection whose abrupt ending completely changes all that has come before. Rather than focus on the problem, "Is Cary Grant a killer?", a more appropriate question to ask oneself might be, "Is Joan Fontaine completely insane?" Despite Grant's top billing, this is Joan Fontaine's movie all the way, and she richly deserved her Best Actress Academy Award. SUSPICION is built around something very unusual in movies of this time - a woman's erotic, desiring gaze. It is Lina who initiates the relationship, staring so hard at Johnny when they meet that he becomes physically uncomfortable. It is Lina who pursues him, and it is Lina who - based only on slim evidence - convinces herself that her man is a killer. Unlike the source novel - which was about Johnny Aysgarth - SUSPICION places its female protagonist front and center. We experience the film entirely from Lina's viewpoint, and so of course we find ourselves believing that "Cary Grant is a killer!" and we are of course frustrated and puzzled to find out that it is all in Lina's mind at the end - because if Lina's perceptions were faulty, then so were ours! Bad vision and inaccurate perception are major themes in the film right from the start: Lina's myopic gaze - she cannot truly SEE what is right in front of her - becomes a metaphor for her character's inability to leave her dream world and perceive her husband and his actions with accuracy. Instead, Lina prefers the fantasy she has constructed inside her warped mind. Underneath its lush, glossy surface (few Hitchcock films are as physically beautiful as this one), SUSPICION takes us on a dark and disturbing journey into the mind of a madwoman who succumbs to paranoia and fear. Ironically, the reaction of so many to this film - a response based entirely on "what-might-have-been" fantasy rather than an unbiased look at the film as it really is - merely confirms the power of Hitchcock's scenario! If you fall into this mental trap, you are behaving exactly like Joan Fontaine's character in the movie! When you change the way you look at this film and accept it for what it is, the real brilliance of the story and the ending becomes apparent - Lina MIGHT be correct after all, but of course we will never know!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm honest because with you, I think, it's the best way to get results."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just about everything works with "Suspicion", except of course the ending, not so much that it negates everything we've come to know about Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant), but in the way in which Lina (Joan Fontaine) simply takes it on faith that what Johnnie reveals is true. Johnnie the schemer, Johnnie the conniver, Johnnie the rogue; 'yes dear, I was going to kill myself because I can't pay back my debts'. Then they proceed to drive home to live happily ever after, except of course, nothing's changed. Johnnie still owes on his gambling debts and the embezzlement at Melbeck's, so how exactly is everything now hunky dory? The explanation of course lies in the fact that Hitchcock's studio restrictions wouldn't allow him to portray Cary Grant as a murderer. It's too bad since having Grant play some of his scenes with an uncharacteristically dark edge revealed a side to his acting that wasn't often seen up till then. Contrast that with the sublime beauty of his new wife Lina (Joan Fontaine), and you had the makings of a real thriller, but the 'huh?' ending we actually get made it less than satisfying for this viewer. Especially after 'murder' in the scrabble tiles, 'Murder on the Footbridge' and murder in the milk glass.Up until the ending though, I found the principals quite credible. Grant and Fontaine take their portrayals through convincing character arcs that build suspense along the way. I particularly enjoyed Nigel Bruce as Beaky; as Dr. Watson in the Sherlock Holmes franchise he's much too restrained. Here he's affably jovial and offhandedly self effacing, as in the scene where he makes himself stand in the corner; that almost took on the appearance of an ad lib and it worked wonderfully.Over the past year I've seen a number of Hitchcock's early British films, and one can note the progress in his story telling style. Now with back to back viewings of "Strangers On A Train" and "Suspicion", it's apparent that not all of his American movies were an unqualified success. In a way that's O.K., since it prepared him for his later masterpieces, notably "North by Northwest" and "Psycho".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's legendary troubled film..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was one truly amazing director; in his long career he created masterpiece after masterpiece with an ease rarely seen in an artist. In the 50s he gained a lot of power due to the economic success he gave to the studios with his movies, however, he also had some troubles, specially when he was still an ascending Hollywood star after his arrival to America."Suspicion" is probably the most remembered of this "problems", as his original idea for the movie gave him trouble when the studio disliked the way he was handling the film. The main problem was that Hitchcock had his lead actor, Cary Grant, as an ambiguous character who was the suspect of a murder. People and the studios weren't happy with this and demanded a lighter tone, mainly for the core details of that suspicion.Cary Grant plays Johnnie Aysgarth, a charming Bon Vivant who spends his life gambling, womanizing and having a good time every time he can. all this changes when he falls in love with Lina MacLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine), a shy rich woman who apparently, has won Johnnie's heart. Due to his husband's erratic behavior and reluctance to get a job, Lina begins to suspect that he is planning something dark and deadly. Her suspicion goes as far as to believe he is going to murder her. But, is Johnnie really capable of such a thing? The movie is a great take on a person's paranoia, Lina's suspicion begins to grow to a sick point, and we the audience follow her descent into madness as well. Jean Fontaine gives a remarkable performance in this movie as the shy Lina whose paranoia is only equaled by her love to her husband. Contrary to what the studio believed, Cary Grant is perfectly cast in his role, with his charming image being a plus for the character rather than a bad thing. Nigel Bruce, as Johnnie's best friend gives that dark humor touch that the master always liked to put in film.Alfred Hitchcock was right at home with this tale of obsessive behavior (one of his favorite subjects), and carefully planned the plot of this story based on the novel by Anthony Berkeley. the sad thing is that the studio was so displeased with the idea of having Cary Grant as possible murderer that they forced Hitchcock to tone down the dark parts and even change the ending he had envisioned for the movie, opting for an anti-climatic that brutalizes what was accomplished at that point.Nevertheless, the master of suspense manages to keep the movie at the right tone and gives great moments thanks to his expert eye with the camera and his ability to tell a story. The haunting image of a glass of milk speaks more than a thousand lines in this movie.While it must had been a real pain for Hitchcock to have his first movie with Cary Grant (his favorite actor according to some sources) altered so severely in such a hideous way; he really made up for it with "North by Northwest". While "Suspicion" may never be appreciated as it should, it still is one of the master's great movies, and one that every Hitchcock fan should see at least once. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, not faithful to the literary source, but Grant is in top form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewing older movies like this is essential for appreciating how much movie-making has changed. It is a rather simple movie, but Hitchcock keeps us guessing until the end, which he is forced by the studio to water down for the viewing audience. Cary Grant is superb as Johnnie Aysgarth, dedicated playboy who never seems to have any money but always seems to get what he wants. Joan Fontaine is Lina, well on her way to becoming a spinster lady, working and still living with her parents. Can Lina and Johnnie get together? Are each of them what they seem to be? That is the movie, worth a watch for Fontaine and Grant.SPOILERS: Lina and Johnnie meet on a train, he happens into her first class compartment but he only has a third class ticket. He has to borrow from her to make up the difference when the conductor comes around. Johnnie's whole lifestyle is a series of 'cons' and gets Lina to marry him after she overhears her parents saying they didn't think she would ever attract a man. After an elaborate honeymoon they return to a lavishly furnished new house, and Johnnie announces that he is broke, big smile on his face. So the playing out of the story is to see if Johnnie is really a thief and murderer, something the viewing audience is led to suspect. The original story had him as a murderer, but Hitchcock was forced by the studio to soften it up, so we see him remorseful for his having stole from his employer, and willing to face prison if necessary. Which is fine, but the main of the movie was made with the more sinister ending in mind, so in the end it doesn't all connect well. Still, a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****SPOILER*******SPOILER************SPOILER***********Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion is the story of a timid, plain, conservative woman named Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) falling in love with the irresponsible, handsome, charming Johnny Aysgarth (Cary Grant). Using their relationship, Hitchcock develops the theme of obsession within the film. A theme is defined as, `a distinct, recurring, and unifying quality or idea.' With the aid of music, framing, and clothing, Lina's obsession with her husband and the idea that he may be a killer is intensified. This is the central theme of Suspician.Lina is introduced to us as a librarian-type woman with her nose buried in a child psychology book. The book is the first clue to her obsessive nature. Hitchcock develops this theme immediately. While reading a magazine at her house, Lina's friends and Johnny arrive. Upon seeing him, she swiftly rids herself of her unattractive eyeglasses. From the start, she is obsessed with him. She wants to impress him. Hitchcock uses a prop, eyeglasses, to indicate to the viewer Lina's state of resistance. The eyeglasses are Lina's defense. In the first scene with her on the train with her book, she does not remove them. She is not yet ready, nor willing, to expose herself to Johnny. However, now very taken with him, she removes her glasses, symbolically offering herself to him. Hitchcock has used eyeglasses before, specifically in The Thirty-Nine Steps. When we first meet Pamela (Madeleine Carroll) she is wearing eyeglasses as well.More evidence for Lina's obsession is presented when Johnny cancels an afternoon meeting he had scheduled with Lina. Her devastation does not go unnoticed. She slowly returns to the table with her parents, once again reduced to the old-maid daughter. Hitchcock ingeniously uses a point-of-view shot in the scene when Lina finds a photograph of Johnny in a magazine. When Lina finds this photo, she eagerly cuts it out, admitting to herself that she cannot resist John Aysgarth. While viewing the magazine, we sense her excitement. She now is at the point where Johnny's actions have a direct effect on her mood. This is clear in the scene where Lina is telling her mother that she will not be going to the Hunt Ball because she doesn't feel well. However, when Lina receives a telegram from Johnny telling her that he will be there, she instantly recovers and dashes off to get ready. She is completely smitten with him.Once Lina and Johnny are married, Hitchcock proceeds to develop Lina's obsessive nature further by making her extremely suspicious of her husband. Hitchcock foreshadows the nature of their relationship with their wedding. Lina and Johnny elope and are married during a rainstorm. Hitchcock films the couple through the rain, framing them with the window. This framing indicates that one, or both of them, will be trapped somehow. Lina is trapped by her obsessive nature. Her obsession begins when she finds out that Johnny is broke and unemployed. She then discovers that Johnny lost his job for stealing money to pay off his race-track gambling debts. Gradually, Lina formulates the idea that Johnny is plotting to kill Beaky Thwaite (Nigel Bruce) for his money. Hitchcock gives an obvious clue of her suspicion while the three friends are playing a version of Scrabble. The words, `doubt,' `doubtful,' `murder,' and `murderer' are formed. Once again, Hitchcock uses a point-of-view shot to help us sense Lina's feelings. The camera is placed so that we feel it is ourselves who are playing scrabble. Lina's expression immediately changes to exasperation when she realizes that Johnny may be a killer. The audience is then taken into Lina's head where she imagines her husband killing her friend. Hitchcock's use of this overshot increases the audience's suspicion of Johnny . It also makes the audience aware of how serious Lina's obsession is becoming.Later in the film, Hitchcock uses clothing and framing to signify that Lina is certain her suspicions are correct and well-founded. Hitchcock uses a longshot to film Lina in a black dress standing before a window. The dress signifies Lina's dark, terrifying thoughts about her husband as well as the heinous crimes she suspects he committed. The light shining through the window casts a spider web shadow on Lina. She is trapped in a web of suspicion, a web of obsession, and ultimately the web of her marriage.Obsession and suspicion are two central themes in Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion. However, ingrained within these themes is the sense of entrapment that Lina feels throughout the film. Hitchcock's creative use of props, costumes, camera angles, and framework create a subtle, yet effective sense of obsession, suspicion, and entrapment within the film.There has been some debate as to a better ending for this film. I believe that in the novel the film was based on, Johnny kills Lina with a glass of milk...would this have been a better ending?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Suspicion" is pure Hitchcock. He really knows how to build tension in a film, and he shows it here. The suspense keeps mounting until a final sequence where it is so thick, you could cut it with a knife.Grant and Fontaine are both excellent in their roles. Cary Grant plays his character so that you think you know what his motives are, but you really don't. Of course, Hitchcock's usual camera wizardry is present, although it is less apparent than in some of his other films ("Notorious" and "Psycho" for example). However, a script that will keep you guessing right to the very end more than makes up for it. The ending is admittedly weak compared to the rest of the film, but that is the only thing I can think of that is bad about it. "Suspicion" shows once again that nobody makes a suspense film quite like Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>suspense in a sunny setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock may not have been a very nice man, but he was one of the great craftsmen of the cinema and this earlier rather restrained film is a good example of his mastery of suspense. Lina, the beautiful naive daughter of a general falls for a handsome feckless Lagonda driving bounder called Johnny, who, against his better judgment, falls for her too. They elope and marry, and set up house in a pretty Georgian country house in Surrey, but soon Lina starts suspecting Johnny guilty of crimes ranging from embezzlement to murder. Finally she becomes convinced he is out to murder her.Despite the dark plot, in appearance this is a relentlessly sunny movie. It was made in 1941, but there is no war on. The setting is an idyllic Hollywood English countryside of Tudor buildings, lovely gardens, Hunt Balls, elegant people, polite servants and and continuous fine weather. Even Lina's suspected murder scene is the blinding white chalk cliffs of the English Channel. The darkness is confined to Lina's thoughts. Her fear stems from her helplessness. She has left the benign control of one man, her father, for an equally dependent relationship with another, whose intentions are far less certain. Why she is so ready to assume the worst of Johnny, after so many of her earlier fears prove groundless, is an interesting question. Is it subliminal revolt? Is she saying even Cary Grant can't make he a real woman? Alma Reville (Mrs Hitchcock) had a part in the script, it seems.Your correspondent saw this movie once before, many years ago, and remembered two things, the sunny rooms and the shot of the Lagonda's speedo as Johnny, with Lina in the passenger's seat, drives along the cliff top road at a reckless speed. Suddenly, seeing the dial ('50mph'), you are in there with Lina, feeling her fear and helplessness. All done, of course with minimal resources.Well, to a point. He may have regarded actors as cattle, but Hitchcock was obsessively careful in casting, especially with his female protagonists, and in Joan Fontaine as Lina, he found the perfect elegant vulnerable beauty who shines though the picture. Cary Grant was always much the same as an actor but was good at alternating between sunny and dark moods. He was perfect for the ambiguous Johnny. The rest of the cast are stock but superior 1940s English Hollywood - Cedric Hardwicke, Mary Whitty (as Lina's parents) and Nigel Bruce, stealing a few scenes as Johnny's pal Beaky. Hitch even got the car right. Pre-war Jaguars, fast, shoddy and cheap, were associated with cads in general and "co-respondents" (third parties in divorce actions) in particular. Johnny however is a superior class of cad and of course drives a Lagonda, a superior cad's car. Solid sporty types (like James Bond) drove Bentleys, at least before the war.Despite the studio sets, this movie holds up very well after 60 years. The ending is apparently different from "Before the Fact" by Francis Iles, the book it was based on, as the studio thought the original too strong. I haven't read it but I imagine that in the book Johnny, innocent to the last, plunges over the cliff in a grand suicidal gesture (no doubt heavily insured.) The production code prevented the depiction of suicide, at least for financial gain. But it's worth watching - for the suspense, for Joan Fontaine's luminous performance, and that drive along the cliff top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Movies That Might Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lina, a woman on the verge of being an old maid, falls in love with Johnnie and marries him without knowing anything about him. That she did not know he was a congenital liar, compulsive gambler, and embezzler until after she married him might be understandable, but that she did not even know that he had no job nor any intention of getting one is ludicrous. Soon she begins to suspect that he murdered Beaky to get his money and that he will try to murder her for the same reason. In the last reel, we have one of those unbelievable character changes for which Hollywood movies are notorious, in which Johnnie realizes how bad he has been and is prepared to go to prison, after having given up on the idea of committing suicide. And when Lina realizes that Johnnie is not a murderer, the way is open to them to live happily ever after.This might have been two different movies. Most people know about one of them. In this one, Johnnie did murder Beaky and he gives Lina a glass of milk with poison in it. She drinks it, because she does not want to live anymore. But before she does, she gives Johnnie a letter to mail for her, in which she includes incriminating evidence that Johnnie is a murderer. Johnnie drops the letter in a mailbox and walks away whistling, not realizing that he has sealed his doom. There is some debate as to whether that is the ending Hitchcock wanted, but that the studio imposed a happy ending, or whether Hitchcock intended all along to make the movie be about a neurotic woman's overwrought imagination. It doesn't matter who wanted what. This would have been a much better movie.The other movie that might have been would have been one in which there is neither a murder nor suspicion of murder (requiring a different title, of course). It is a movie that would have been unendurable. There would have been no relief from the fact that Johnnie has married Lina for her money and is annoyed to find out it does not amount to as much as he thought it would, especially when her father dies and does not leave her anything more than her usual allowance. We would have been left with Lina's being married to a compulsive liar, who hocks her beloved chairs so he can bet on the horses; who believes he was not meant to have to work for a living, and when forced to take a job managing an estate, soon gets caught embezzling funds; and who cons Beaky into investing in a real estate venture that we know will only result in losing money as Johnnie squanders the investment on loose living. And there would have been no relief from the fact that Lina will continue to put up with this because she loves Johnnie.In other words, we need at least the possibility of murder to be introduced halfway into the movie as a way of making us forget about what a horrible marriage this is. This takes us back to the first two movies, the one that was and the one that might have been. That Johnnie is a despicable human being even if he is not a murderer goes without saying. But there is something disgusting about Lina as well. Her foolishness in marrying Johnnie in the first place is practically an argument in favor of having parents arrange marriages for their daughters. And all that mewing about love as she puts up with Johnnie's abuse is sickening. Finally, Beaky's attitude toward Johnnie, that we must all forgive everything that Johnnie does because, well, that's just the way Johnnie is, is also irritating.They all deserve to die. So a movie in which Beaky is murdered by Johnnie, in which Lina is murdered by Johnnie, and in which Johnnie is sentenced to die as a result of that incriminating letter would have been most satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suspicion is a decent, but forgettable, Hitchcock moment. The cast is excellent and do well with the subtle plot about a woman who suspects her new husband is only after her money and plotting to kill her for it. It is a decent romance/ comedy/ suspense, which starts slowly, and intentionally comically, and then slowly and methodically builds its husband-plots-to-murder-wife plot, but the rug is pulled out from underneath and we're expected to swallow the contrived happy ending forced upon Hitchcock by the studio. Film slowly builds for its 90 minutes run time, but it doesn't build to any big payoff.The happy ending does keep the film from ending predictably, but it insults the actors and filmmakers involved, as well as its original source material ("Before the Fact" by Francis Iles) and the audience itself, by basically saying "We were only joking about him trying to kill his wife this entire time" Carey Grant is a fine actor and does well here, but perhaps his casting in the lead was a mistake? If there had been some other, less known actor in the role, perhaps there would not have been as much pressure by the studio to have it end in such a convoluted, happy fashion?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a flawed ending (imposed we're told, by nervous studio executives) 'Suspicion' is a terrific thriller. It may not be Hitchcock's best movie but it is one of his most entertaining. Cary Grant is perfectly cast as Johnnie Aysgarth, a charming rogue. This was the first of four movies he made with Hitchcock, but it's the performance I enjoy the most. Joan Fontaine, star of Hitchcock's previous movie 'Rebecca', is wonderful as Lina ("monkeyface") the woman he woos. The two make a great couple, and their acting really makes this one believable. Well loved character actor Nigel Bruce (who had also appeared in 'Rebecca', but is best known to most of us as Dr. Watson in the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies) is also brilliant as Johnnie's old pal "Beaky". The rest of the cast includes Sir Cedric Hardwicke ('Rope') and Leo G. Carroll (six Hitchcocks in all). 'Suspicion' is a real treat for mystery/thriller fans. I wonder just how many contemporary movies in this style will be as enjoyable in sixty plus years?</fullReview>

We see just about what's going on in the bigger picture, but there seems to be so much happening behind the curtains - so to speak. The ending, as almost always with this famous director, is of the most expeditious kind.

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding Melodrama with a Tense Finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dismissed by critics as "minor" Hitchcock, SUSPICION nonetheless has plenty to recommend it.Set in a chocolate-box English village reconstructed on the RKO back-lot, full of green fields, mock-Tudor housing, hunting scenes and over-stuffed interiors, the film contrasts the stultifying respectability of spinster Lina's (Joan Fontaine's) life with the prospects offered by chancer Johnnie (Cary Grant).Lina lives in a village world where church-going and hunt balls are the highlights of daily life. Her parents (Dame May Witty and Sir Cedric Hardwicke) spend their days in their comfortable living-room, either embroidering or reading the paper. They have no need for excitement: General McLaidlaw (Hardwicke) has enjoyed a distinguished military career and has now retired. By contrast Johnnie, although reluctant to work, as well as being a habitual liar with a penchant for betting, has that indefinable quality called charm (what else would he be, when played by Grant?) Lina understands what a worthless person he is, but cannot detach herself from him. As Johnnie's friend Beaky (Nigel Bruce) tell her, he can be excused anything.The only suggestion that something might be amiss is communicated through lighting. The two protagonists are perpetually photographed with bars - window-bars, blinds, stairwells being three example - either across their bodies or at the back of the frame, suggesting imprisonment. This is both physical as well as emotional: neither Johnnie nor Lina can be honest with one another. As a result Lina continually suspects her husband's motives.There are continual echoes of REBECCA, filmed in the previous year - not only with the presence of Fontaine in the case, but also with the use of stock footage taken on the coast from the cliffs looking down at the sea crashing below. The final sequence, where Johnnie drives his sports car at breakneck speed, putting both his own and his spouse's safety at risk, recalls a similar moment in the earlier film. The endings of the two films are different, but the intertexts remain.There is one memorable sequence towards the film's end, drawing attention to Hitchcock's penchant for the macabre. As Johnnie is abound to climb the stairs, he is photographed in shadow, picked out against a tight column of bright light. Just what his motives are, we know not; but the visual effect is stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first, it is a real interesting film. because, in many scenes it seems be an experiment to mix different pieces from different genres. it is, in same measure, a dark comedy, a thriller, mystery and quiz. the occasion to discover a different Cary Grant, exploring his art for romantic comedy in admirable manner and occasion for Joan Fontain to guide the viewer on the web of innocence, rumors, fear and need to know the truth. the end is a compromise. brutal, uncomfortable but, maybe, part of experiment, solution to escape from the predictability or the scissor of censors. a strange film because it contains the lines who define Hitchcock universe but, in same measure, seems profound different. and, finally, this is far to be a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the movie "SUSPICION" is concerned, I am almost certain that the director somehow inhibited. In this film Hitch remained incomplete. I was wondering if it comes to interpretation of the novel, actors, censorship or disagreement to the production. The director certainly did not fail in his distinctive segments. The atmosphere is classy, complications are good (maybe a little predictable), suspense and tension are constant. The place is exciting, but abrupt and I think that the director rushed to this work completed as soon as possible.A fruity and cheerful drama yarn in a strong psychological mystery. I doubt that the director ran out of material, because the story is intriguing.Joan Fontaine as Lina McLaidlaw Aysgarth, was shy, but rich spinster who begins to suspect her husband. I am convinced that her doubts about the marriage started an avalanche. For that reason, the end of the film is not logical. Suspicion has changed her personality. Fontaine was good.Cary Grant as Johnnie Aysgarth is charming seducer who is at the end turns out to be irresponsible and wasteful playboy. I think it was Grant better pace in the first part of the film. I am not thrilled with the change in the character of his "hero" in the second part of the film. Grant is well directed acting, but just something missing. Apparently the director saved him at the end of the film.Hitchcock is a little "crooked". Lack of originality. However, this psychological thriller is from start to finish exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grant shines, but Fontaine steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite Cary Grant films, although it is certainly not at the top of my Alfred Hitchcock picks. I thought I had already reviewed it, and was coming on the site to update because I had just upgraded to the new Blu Ray edition. A comment about that first. I do not feel that the upgrade from regular DVD to Blu Ray is, in this case, worth it; the improvement is marginal.Joan Fontaine (Lina) is a bookish, almost spinsterish young woman who stumbles upon an intriguing ne'er-do-well (Johnnie Aysgarth), played by Cary Grant. When Fontaine hears her parents (Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Dame May Witty) in a conversation where they discuss the unlikelihood of her ever marrying, she falls in love with Grant, almost in spite of her parent's viewpoint. But, she soon is in real love with Grant, and they marry rather quickly. Into the picture comes Nigel Bruce as sort buffoonish 'Beaky', whom Grant sort of watches out for...or does he. In one incident after another, Grant disappoints Fontaine: first he turns out to have no job or income, then he gets a job...and secretly loses it, and then he sells her father's prize chairs without her permission. She begins to like Beaky, and it begins to appear that Grant may plan on murdering the silly man to gain his money in a business deal. Sure enough, Bruce dies, and Grant's involvement seems almost a certainty. And then, the question becomes: will he also murder FOntaine...by poisoned milk? Or does he finally become a man?Cary Grant is my favorite actor (or at least tied with Spencer Tracy). And he is perfect for his role here...and plays it to maximum effect. On the other hand, although I don't dislike her, I'm not a fan of Joan Fontaine...but in watching this film this time around, I have to admit that Fontaine (who won the Academy Award for this performance) literally steals the show. Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Dame May Witty have very minor roles here. Important to the film, but very brief. Nigel Bruce's role is more substantial, and he is good in it, but I sometimes tire of him always playing the buffoon.It's difficult to find much wrong with this film. It is in Hitchcock's more subtle career phase...which I much prefer. Apparently the film is MUCH different than the novel; the film leaves out all of Grant's infidelities. And, instead of being a real cad (as in the book), the film becomes more a tale of a woman with suspicions. Today, I'm sure the film would be a very much different one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I suspect this could have been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion starts off in a twee, rather whimsical fashion, as reckless womaniser Johnnie (Cary Grant) romances and wins over reluctant beauty Lina (Joan Fontaine); the director's handling of these early scenes is light and humorous, never hinting at the more menacing direction the film will eventually take. Once the pair are wed, however, Johnnie is gradually revealed to be an even bigger rogue than he at first appeared?a habitual gambler, a serial liar, and a thief, with every revelation pushing the viewer to come to the same conclusion as Lina: that Johnnie would even turn to murder if necessary.Hitchcock's storytelling is brilliant, the director toying with the viewer throughout, repeatedly making us reassess how we feel about Johnnie; likewise, the central performances in Suspicion are superb, with Grant subtly exuding menace and Fontaine giving her character just the right combination of vulnerability and pluckiness. Indeed, Suspicion could easily have been one of Hitchcock's greatest films, if only the studio had let the director have his way and conclude the film as originally intended, rather than making him tack on a lame happy ending that plays the audience for fools by revealing the whole movie has been one massive red herring.Instead of an 8 or even a 9, Suspicion winds up being a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Performance from Fontaine and Hitchcock's reliable signature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspicion, one of Alfred Hitchcock's countless suspense driven dramas that holds a lot of effort put forth by the director. Sadly, it isn't flawless by any standpoint. The film's biggest liability is the jolted screenplay, it's sloppy and disfigured. The clarity that Hitchcock has in his better works isn't present here. Suspicion holds it's focal point from the audience until the third act (the mystery of Cary Grant possibly being a murder). The first act is pushed by the romance and the second act depicts the financial difficulties in a marriage. But when the third act finally comes out with the long awaited plot twist, it thankfully hits hard. From the directorial standpoint, Suspicion never fails. Hitchcock knows the story he wants to tell (too bad the script didn't know the story it wanted to tell). With his films, Hitchcock always has an unusual control over a picture that never smothers it. He controls his storytelling world, but allows the actors and the technical professionals to put their own spin on his vision. The story is about doubt, Hitchcock creates just as much doubt in the film with Joan Fontaine's character as he creates for the viewer. We are on our toes once Cary Grant's actions become questionable. I was intertwined in just as much paranoia and psychological mystery as Joan Fontaine's character. The musical score is expectedly scorches your stomach inside out.Joan Fontaine is darling, yet filled with doubt in her starring role. Fontaine owns the fact that this picture's success is on her shoulders. It's a character study of Lina, a self-destructive and distrusting woman. Fontaine's exquisite performance earned her an Academy Award, which many people pegged off as a being a "make-up" Oscar for not winning for Rebecca. Don't get me wrong, Rebecca is an excellent film and Fontaine is very good in it, but there so much more involved in the story with the source material, directing, and other actors in that film. In Suspicion, Fontaine has a lot more to make-up for with her performance. Cary Grant is wild and charismatic in his antagonistic role, too.Suspicion is a atypical structured piece. The romance has life and the first act just fires passion through each breath. The second act is ahead of its time in commenting on problems in a marriage, making the union a financially-aggravated mess of distrust. Suspicion thrives in the third act, as our heads spin as fast as Fontaine's running mind. Suspicion would've benefited from an alternate ending, or at least a more explained one. To be successful with a story arc like they left us with, it had to be thoroughly told to the viewer, but instead its left with a sloppy wrap-up and a ambiguous final frame. Hitchcock famously denounced the studio's ending, I wish they would've went with Alfy's gut. Nonetheless, the superb performance from Fontaine and Hitchcock's reliable signature make Suspicion a solid entry in the director's filmography.Rating: 8/10Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed Despite the Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 100+ reviews, no need to dwell on consensus points. Actually the movie's a psychological drama that's quite engaging up to the end. Poor Lina (Fontaine), she can't be sure of Johnnie's (Grant) romantic sincerity. Just what are his true feelings for her. After all, she starts out as a drab bookworm that few men take a second look at. But then, under handsome, fast- talking Johnnie's attentions, she flowers. Of course, it helps that Dad has a ton of money she will one day inherit. But with Johnnie's carefree gambler's habits, can she be sure of his affections, or is it her money. On the other hand, we have no difficulty detecting Lina's feelings, thanks to her strongly written role and Fontaine's carefully nuanced performance. However, we're not allowed beyond Johnnie's jovial exterior and calculating brain. His true feelings remain an ongoing guessing game?is he really in love with the rather plain, unexciting girl, or is he just using her. On the whole, it must be one or the other since he doesn't seem the kind of guy who suffers from ambiguities.Now this is an excellent set-up. Every time she's convinced of his affections, he does something suspicious that makes her and us doubt his true motives. At the same time, we're pulled along effortlessly by Hitch's fluid arrangement of events. But then comes the climax. The trouble is that the screenplay has set up such a tight web of suspicious behavior and events, that the ending comes across more like a typical Hollywood contrivance than a resolution worthy of Hitchcock's mastery. I suspect the rather incredible explanations for Johnnie's behavior were forced on Hitch by the studio. Anyway, what is otherwise a classic in intriguing psychology ends with an unimaginative climax, a disappointment despite all the many pluses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only one acting Oscar. I'm suspicious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm kidding.Suspicion (1941) is an Alfred Hitchcock suspense thriller/romance/comedy that stars Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. This movie holds the distinction of being the only Alfred Hitchcock movie in which an actor won an Oscar for their performance. Hitchcock made so many great movies with great acting performances from top stars spanning so many years, so I simply find it amazing that only one acting performance won an Oscar out of all the movies he made. Joan Fontaine was great in this movie and deserved the Oscar, but I also think she deserved an Oscar for her performance as the second Mrs. de Winter in Rebecca (1940) a year earlier. I also think Judith Anderson should have won Best Supporting Actress in Rebecca as well. Oh well.Some people have a hard time accepting Cary Grant playing a villain in this movie. When people think of Cary Grant, they think of him playing a certain type of character other than a villain. Myself, I don't have any problem with him playing a villain because what it comes down to is something very simple -- you just need to realize he's an ACTOR, and actors are supposed to be VERSATILE, not one dimensional. Really good actors have the ability to play all kinds of different roles, and really it comes down to just separating what he's done in other movies from what he did in Suspicion and ditching any preconceived view you have of him. It's that simple.This is one of those movies that starts a little slow but gets better and more suspenseful as it progresses. You just need to be patient and let things unfold. So many of Hitchcock's black and white movies from the 1940s are great movies but are often overlooked in favor of the movies from his prime, which I see as the period of time from about 1951-1964.Overall, this is a good movie with a great acting performance from Joan Fontaine. Cary Grant was great, also. I recommend it highly. If you're new to Hitchcock movies, I recommend starting with one of his classics from his prime years, such as Strangers On A Train (1951), Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North By Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963), and Marnie (1964). If you want to start in the 1940s, I of course recommend Suspicion as well as Rebecca (1940), Saboteur (1942), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), Lifeboat (1944), Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and Rope (1948).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are just too many irritants that keep this one from being top tier Hitchcock. The ending is the most notorious but there are others. The "Monkey Face" nickname is used to the breaking point and every time it's uttered it stops the scene cold. Much of the time we are on the side of the doubting, naive, and sympathetic Wife, giving the Husband no chance of possibly being the good natured, lovable, play about because he is just too aloof, demanding, and conniving to be believed otherwise.That being said, there is enough fun and intrigue for this to be an above average Suspense Film with fine performances and a Director who had done much better in the period. But even his lesser accomplishments (you can blame this one on the Studio) are better than most. The aforementioned ending is abrupt, unsatisfying, tacky, and almost, but not completely, make this an unworthy "success".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joan Fontaine won the Oscar for this 1941 film. Why? Bette Davis was far superior in "The Little Foxes." In some ways, the film reminded me of "Rebecca," the film that Fontaine was nominated for the year before, and was so much better in. Note that Hitchcock directed both films. Fontaine seemed to specialize in vulnerable women until she broke out of that vein with Mario Lanza in "Serenade."Then, I was reminded of sister Olivia's Oscar worthy turn in "The Heiress" (1949) where she was also a vulnerable woman who had suspicions about a man (Monty Clift) but actually did something about it.The real kudos here should have gone to Cary Grant's splendid performance as the high flying gambler,a man who married his monkey-face after a brief romance. Fontaine seemed to be settling into a grim spinsterhood which was similar to Olivia in 'Heiress' before the man in her life came along. Compare the mistrust of dad Cedric Hardwicke to that of 'Heiress's' dad Ralph Richardson.Cedric Hardwicke and Dame May Witty played Fontaine's parents in this film and unfortunately were made little use of.The ending of the film did not really serve it well except for the fact of the representation of turning one's life around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a movie with Cary Grant that I have not enjoyed. That being said, I definitely enjoyed the masterpiece that was Suspicion. Joan Fontaine also truly deserved the Academy Award that she won for this movie. I enjoyed this film because you never truly know whether or not to be suspicious of Grant's character or not, even at the end of the film, Lina (Fontaine) seems to believe her husband, but the end of the movie left the viewer's thoughts open ended: being, is he a good guy or is he a bad guy? When Lina and Johnie (Grant) are driving along the side of the mountain and near the water, that scene almost makes the movie, even though it is the ending. The shots of the mountains and the road are beautiful and at that time you are scared for Lina, not knowing whether she's going to survive being on that road or not. This is not my favorite Hitchcock movie, but I would watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directed Suspicion in 1941, a film noir mystery starring Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. Characters Johnnie and Lina are in a marriage filled with deceit, secrets and suspicion. Tensions rise between the two characters and Lina fears for her life. Real issues are displayed in this film such as distrust and suspicion. Hitchcock brings these emotions and issues to the next level, along with some drama and suspense.Hitchcock uses suspenseful music and quick cuts of different angles of the action. The camera-work in this film is unique the way he uses extreme close ups so the audience can't see what's going on behind and to the sides of the character. This technique causes the audience to feel anxious towards what's about to happen. Things like this make him the master of his genre. In Hitchcock's movies the uses of artificiality makes his movies profoundly alarming but are gracefully shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe it has to be said the ending was not a good one. I feel as though it didn't match the movie at all. Johnnie (Carey Grant) basically tried to kill his wife Lina (Joan Fontaine) by speeding up the car at then of the movie. Lina almost flew out of the car and it looked as though Johnnie was trying to push her out. At the last second Johnnie grabbed Lina to save her from falling out and again he was this "heroic" figure. Then, to top it off, they were hugging at the end because she thought it was all in her mind? As if Johnnie didn't just try to kill her. I didn't like it at all. I thought the movie however was very good. It was fast paced and easy to watch. Alfred Htichcock did an amazing job directing this film. As always Grant's acting was beautiful and you could feel his character. I liked the movie very much, besides of course the ending. To my understand as well, RKO made Hitchcock change the ending of the novel where Grant really did kill Fontaine into what it became, which was crap. After the change was made and filmed it was said "RKO- decreed a different ending, which Hitchcock supplied and then spent the rest of his life complaining about." (Wikipedia)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could cute and lovable Cary Grant ever be creepy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock uses his style of directing to make a story completely psychological in more than one way. The movie is mostly told from the perspective of Joan Fontaine's character Lina while she studies her husband and let's distrust get the better of her. Most of the story looks pretty innocent if you look at it the right way, but the music and cinematic tricks make you believe everything that Joan Fonataine believes. This is told from her perspective so well that you feel like you are her. Camera views occasionally look at the world like it is from her point of view like in one shot when she is scared that she will die and you literally see what she sees as you imagine her in danger. Cary Grant gives a good performance as an innocent guy who is more round than most of his bubbly characters that he plays. Other characters give good performances, but Hitchcock overshadows everyone and everything by working around his actors rather than working with them entirely with the actors fulfilling their roles in making a believable story and then Hitchcock would make his own way of telling the story and warp it. I liked the ending especially. It felt like a bit of an anticlimax, but it was a great conclusion that made the rest of the movie better in an instant. I guess I have gotten used to 30s and 40s endings sort of falling on themselves because of how time periods have an effect on story telling, but the end still felt graceful somehow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>suspicion review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a well developed film by Alfred Hitchcock, the movie is about Johnnie(Grant) being this sincere gentleman for the first time in his life and falls in love with Lina(Fontaine). When Beaky, a friend, dies suddenly, Lina begins to believe that Johnnie is a murderer and that she will be the next victim. On a side note, Hitchcock makes a cameo about forty five minutes into the film at the village post office as a man mailing a letter. Anyways, Suspicion is a classic early Hollywood Hitchcock, nicely conceived and steadily performed. But it is so grimly powerful that its Hollywood style happy ending has actually enraged audiences for years. Some have argued that the ending was not up to Mr. Hitchcock's usual style, and the general atmosphere of the picture was far less indisputable than he previously had written. But still he has managed to bring through a tense and exciting take, a psychological thriller which is filled with lively suspense and a picture that entertains you from beginning to almost the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Suspicion" - why torture me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...goes the old Elvis song and that's just what smooth seductive Cary Grant does for most of this film to the demure, repressed Jona Fontaine character in Hitchcock's excellent psychological thriller from his early Hollywood era.I'll be blunt and put my cards on the table in agreeing firmly with those who believe that Grant should have stayed a villain right until the end (as I understand was Hitch's original intention, certainly it would have been true to the source novel). It's a shame the great man didn't yet have enough cache at the time for director-approval, (c.f Orson Welles!) but setting this aside, it's a great, absorbing watch.For me it's ironic also that Fontaine won the Oscar for best actress here when the never-recognised Grant surely should have gained due acknowledgement for his partially against-type playing of the slippery Johnny. Don't get me wrong Fontaine is fine, but the movie is made or broken (it's made, of course) by Grant's superb depiction of a desperate con-man whose only currencies are looks and charm, who'll stoop at who knows just how low to get his next buck. There's good support from the mainly Anglophile cast, particularly Nigel Bruce in a typical bumbling but endearing role as Johnny's best friend and biggest dupe.As well as carrying forward the narrative in characteristic to-the-point style (though perhaps aided unintentionally by the cuts insisted upon by the misguided production top-brass), there are some great Hitchcockian flourishes which true fans will savour, like the cutaway scene on the cliff-top between Fontaine and Grant, (even if placed too early in the narrative) the near-death scene in the car and of course the famous "glowing glass of milk" scene near the end.I'd never seen this minor Hitchcock classic before and really enjoyed it (great musical score too, by the way) while always at the back of my mind harbouring that abiding regret however that we'll never get to see the true director's cut as you surely would with more modern studio-skewered classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Did It! (Gives A Sensational Performance, That Is)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a funny thing about Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock: The last film they made together famously ends with Grant and the girl going into a train tunnel. But their first movie together, this one, starts with Grant and the girl coming out of a train tunnel.There's something spooky about Grant's performance in "Suspicion" that lifts it well above the bulk of his impressive if one-dimensional screen work. As the dapper, dangerous-seeming wastrel Johnnie Aysgarth, Grant had to rely on more than his usual charm, and does so with seeming ease. He has help from Joan Fontaine, delivering the only Oscar-winning acting performance in a Hitchcock film as the sheltered woman of privilege who falls in love with Aysgarth, then worries after their wedding if he is out to kill her for her money. But she can't turn away from him. "I couldn't stop loving you if I tried," she tells him. And she doesn't.The triumph of Fontaine and Grant's on screen pairing rests in the way they stroke the tension between their characters, Fontaine with her lost-deer look and Grant with the way he coils and uncoils the onion of his character.Ambiguity is even more important here than most of Hitchcock's films given the trouble "Suspicion" had with the Production Code. If Hitchcock was allowed to make the film he envisioned, we would have had a stronger ending - but also a great deal more clarity as to what made Johnnie click, thus making the rest of the film a lot less fun to see again.Grant does such a great job keeping you guessing, it makes you wish he let himself play rogues more often. He's utterly brazen with Fontaine's character Lina from their opening scene on that train, hitting her up for change so he can ride first-class, even snatching a stamp from her purse (postal references are a recurring motif in this film, and would have tied in with the ending as written). He treats Lina with high-handed bravado, lies and steals so he can gamble away her money. Yet we also see evidence of deep feelings, and his effect on Lina is unmistakable. The happier she is with him, the more her cleavage plunges, like an arrow to her heart.Lina just thinks he's a child. His pal Beaky Thwaite (Nigel Bruce) suggests she just laugh it off. "You mustn't mind Johnnie cutting up," Beaky tut-tuts. "That's what makes Johnnie Johnnie." Then really bad things begin happening, and Hitchcock ups the ante with serious signs of misbehavior, perhaps murderous in intent. Shadows collect around the front staircase like spider webs as police come to the door asking questions. Johnnie becomes abrupt with Lina. Is he tense about business setbacks? Or is the mask slipping, and his true nature coming out?You have a lot of fun guessing, a game that doesn't really quite end even to the last scene. That the ending doesn't quite work for me has nothing to do with the way it leaves the story as much as the way it was shot, rushed in both the acting and writing departments.Until then Grant and Fontaine develop a nicely off-balance chemistry, Fontaine working her magic as the most beautiful frump ever filmed, while Grant digs deep to deliver a performance of many parts. Facile as he often was, Grant here puts on a clinic on the nuances of film acting, tender when he needs to be, mugging for laughs when he can, and utterly mysterious in a way you don't quite expect from Grant. There's a lot of lessons to take away "Suspicion", but the biggest one for me is not to take Cary for Granted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you, the viewer, suspicious of the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very interesting film on obsession and paranoia. Forget the fact that Hitchcock for certain extraneous pressures changed the ending of the novel "Before the Fact" by Francis Iles to present the leading man in a positive light to American audiences rather than a dark villain. Remember Hitchcock did the same to the ending of "Rebecca" than what Daphne du Maurier had written as the end in her novel. Hitchcock may have been brilliant but he caved in to what the audiences wanted to see.The glass of milk glows eerily as Cary Grant offers it to Joan Fontaine. There was a glowing light bulb inside. In "Spellbound," Hitchcock made one adult character give another a glass of milk laced with bromide to knock him out. Hitchcock loved to repeat his scenes but improve upon them.Unlike some films like "Rebecca" and "Notorious", there is considerable humor in "Suspicion." An unforgettable scene is when the Cary Grant character keeps talking to the portrait of the father of his lady love and says he would like her hand in marriage and touches the painting?and it falls down?the first apparent response to Cary Grant's monologue! It is difficult to guess how much of Iles' novel was changed by the director. The courtship of the two leading characters is superb. It entertains you. Even with the changed ending, Hitchcock leads you on to make you wonder what was true?-the end as in the film, or your nagging suspicion of the truth from the circumstantial evidence. That's entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.. shame though, as the film is compromised by the finale. it's not so much it's a bad ending, as that it's a badly done ending. you can see the director's heart was not in it. how many times have great films been ruined by stupid studios?one particularly amusing scene is Johnny and Beaky's attempts to amuse, with duck noises and funny faces. raised a chuckle.it's still the hitch, and as such worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What does it actually mean when a Hitchcock movie is labelled as one of the lesser good ones from the masters' list? It's the story about a woman who suspects her fresh husband from being capable of murder. SUSPICION contains everything what makes a Hitchcock a Hitchcock and has suspense all over it. Like all his movies you should always pay attention to truly EVERYTHING what's happening: the minor characters, the symbolic hints to other movies or to later happenings in the same movie (in the beginning from the movie when he tries to kiss her, she turns her head away and closes her purse in between them both and the suspicion begins), the place where the furniture is placed (watch the huge portrait of the general) or the requisites (in fact Hitchcock really had ordered to build a little white bulb IN the suspicious glass of milk to pull the attention!). The acting is fairly ok and it's the first time i saw Grant play a character which i really couldn't stand from the first moment. Also the writing didn't cause this movie to be one of the lesser good. A lot of people are complaining about the end which seems to cause all the trouble. It seems a happy end, but i think Grant's character has misled you all like he did with Fontaine's character, aha!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspicion was a decent early Hollywood Hitchcock film that was just a shade below Rebecca, Foreign Correspondent, Shadow of a Doubt, Saboteur, and Spellbound. Cary Grant, who is the epitome of cool, and Joan Fontaine give solid performances, as a matter of fact, Fontaine won an Oscar for her performance--the only actor/actress to win a Best Actor/Actress in a Hitchcock film which I find amazing! The ending is okay, but it's obvious that it was not the original ending. However, if you like Grant, Hitchcock, and Fontaine, you will want to see this movie. This movie also features Leo G. Carroll who seemed to be in every Hitchcock movie in a minor role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Playboy Johnny Aysgarth (Cary Grant) meets quiet Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) on a train. He flirts with her and she eventually lets down her guard. They run away to get marry despite her disapproving father. She starts to discover his true nature afterward. He's a jobless, penniless gambler. He goes to work for his cousin Captain Melbeck after she insists on him getting a job. Johnny's friend Beaky (Nigel Bruce) tells her that he is still a lovable gambler. He got fired for embezzling his cousin and he has sold the family heirloom chairs. Lina's father dies and Johnny is annoyed that Lina gets nothing of value. Johnny talks the gullible Beaky into investing in a scheme. Lina tries to talk Beaky out of it. Later Beaky is dead. Lina has suspicion that Johnny may have killed him and trying to kill her for the insurance money.Cary Grant is so charming that it's no problem to believe Joan Fontaine would fall for him completely. The trick by Hitchcock is throw every doubt on the man. Everything he's ever done is a clue. Did he even purchase the first class ticket in the first place or was he stalking her? Hitchcock makes it easy to believe that he could actually kill. Grant is so charming that every lie is unnerving. Fontaine is reflecting every fear that Hitchcock lays out for the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Directs Another Classic of Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Suspicion", Hitchcock takes the audience on a ride. The story starts by mixing two seemingly incompatible people--Cary Grant as Johnnie and Joan Fontaine as Lina--and making them a couple. She is a studious, introspective, conservative woman and he is an impetuous, impertinent, immature extrovert. Their joining is the recipe for some kind of discord.Lina is the viewer's avatar in the film. Notice how the story follows her point of view. Much of the circumstantial evidence that points to Johnnie's guilt is viewed through her eyes, conveyed through her external clues to inner turmoil in a great performance by Fontaine. Note the way Hitchcock lights the interior of their home--usually with a multitude of shadows. He frames Lina with the shadows of the large window, a cage, making her a prisoner of her own love for Johnnie.The dream of happiness that was the center of their honeymoon becomes a nightmarish roller coaster ride of emotions as soon as they return home. Lina is an amateur regarding relationships, so it takes her a while to understand her feelings and to learn what limits her fidelity has.As the evidence--circumstantial and otherwise--piles up (perhaps a little too neatly), Hitchcock asks the viewer to understand Lina's confusion and her ambivalence. But it is human nature to want to exhaust every last shred of doubt in defending one's love, so we take the journey with Lina until finally there is only certainty. The script is very tight and cleverly written and the score is lush, accenting the emotional highs.Hitchcock wanted a darker ending, but still managed to create an ending that delights in having taken the audience for a ride. He would get his darker ending two years later, with "Shadow of a Doubt". In both cases, note how he uses a waltz theme for the one under suspicion.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is filled with prototypical Hitchcockian elements (e.g. his focus on her hair). Joan Fontaine's performance alone--so nuanced, especially when compared to some other portrayals of women spiraling toward a breakdown--makes the film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion is a movie with a great suspenseful mood where Lina Auysgarth (Joan Fontaine) suspects that her husband John (Cary Grant)suspects that he is going to kill her. Though I really liked the story, acting, writing, and directing. My 2 biggest gripes with this movie is a small part of the story which is that Fontaine's character suspects that Grant's character is going to kill him when she visualized him killing Mr. Thwaite she just faints and just jumps to the conclusion that she may be the next target when she isn't. The ending just isn't an original Hitchcock ending because Grant and Fontaine end up happily ever after (really not like other Hitchcock movies). But in the end it is a well done movie with equally wonderful work from the cast and crew to this movie.On average 9.8/10= 98%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another thrilling mystery from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion tells the story of Lina; a shy young woman who falls for a charming gentleman named Johnnie, ends up marrying him but when his true character is disclosed, she begins to suspect him of trying to kill her.Hitchcock has given us some of the finest thrillers of all time &amp; even though this film isn't close to his finest efforts, it nonetheless manages to create a gripping atmosphere of doubt &amp; uncertainties and wraps itself up on an ambiguous note, thus leaving its viewers with their own interpretation of the ending.Like any Hitchcock film, Suspicion is technically sound and the plot also benefits a lot from good performances by Cary Grant &amp; Joan Fontaine. On an overall scale, Suspicion may not be ranked amongst Hitchcock's finest films but it does work as a finely crafted thriller that will have its viewers guessing from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling romantic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion is a story of an ideal romance turning into a complicated affair. The whole story is told from Joan Fontaine character's point of view. Right after Rebecca, she once again superbly plays a shy woman falling for a completely strange man. First half of the film bears a few of similarities with George Cukor's Gaslight. Movie's huge plus point is the way it transits its characters and focus. In the beginning, Joan Fontaine is a naive woman blindly in love with Cary Grant. She does not see anything else and movie is a romantic treat. However everything changes gradually and film's focus also shifts entirely as it proceeds further. Joan Fontaine brilliantly carries out sagacious lady discovering her husband's different side and she also protects him when required. Cary Grant on the other hand, plays an unlikely character for a protagonist. But still he brilliantly manages this complex part. From a charming and romantic gentleman to a shallow, broke gambler with murderous intentions. His expressions and dialogues seems perfect and as an audience we begin to lay doubts on him just along with Joan Fontaine's character.Movie beautifully demonstrates this complex relationship through usual Hitchcockian elements and excellent BW cinematography. Various situations creates tension and towards the end it becomes more and more intense with a solid climax. The ending surely leaves a long lasting mark in mind. The combination of romance and mystery elements makes it a compelling watch. Can be included among films like Rebecca, Spellbound and Gaslight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Studio interference damages what could have been on of Hitchcock's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cocky and handsome playboy Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) romances the timid Linda (Joan Fontaine) and eventually convinces her to marry him. Her father, the wealthy General McLaidlaw (Cedric Hardwicke), strongly disapproves but cannot stop the two embarking on a very expensive honeymoon, and buying an extravagant home. It is at this point that Johnnie admits he is completely broke, and has numerous gambling debts, and was hoping that Linda's inheritance will eventually sort out their problems. After Johnnie accepts a job working for his cousin, two of Linda's valuable family heirlooms go missing, and the lies and suspicious activities start to build up.Based on the 1932 novel Before the Fact by Frances Iles, Alfred Hitchcock's thriller is notable for the casting of heart-throb and screwball comedy regular Cary Grant as a possible homicidal maniac and compulsive con-man. The man with the longest arms in cinema gives one of his most memorable performances here, morphing himself into an irresponsible, childish and spoilt degenerate with apparent ease. Joan Fontaine won the Oscar for Best Actress (the only one for an actor working under Hitchcock), but Grant has remained strangely unrecognised, perhaps for the attitudes and behaviours of his character. There were stories of a studio fallout during the making of this film, with RKO concerned with the fact that Suspicion may ruin Cary Grant's heroic image, and this led to major changes having to be made from the book-to-screen adaptation, and this is the film's main problem. For such a great build-up, the climax and the big unravelling is just a big let- down, with the studio's influence as clear as day. It also slightly beggars belief how much Linda's character takes from her slimy husband, whether he is a potential murderer or not. She is truly an old-fashioned female character, standing by her husband no matter what, as boys will be boys regardless. As handsome and charming as Johnnie is, it is hard to take watching Linda forgive him almost instantly as he reveals he was hoping her vast future fortune will solve his own problems. Yet this is still a nicely played thriller, with Hitchcock's usual big set-pieces making way for something much more low-key. It has the same kind of money-focused, pulpy feel that the Coen brother's have come to perfect in the last twenty years or so, and would not seem out of place in a Southern Gothic setting. Like most Hitchcock films, Suspicion is effortlessly watchable, but it is a shame that Hitchcock was still yet to become the colossal figure in cinema that would have seen him have complete artistic control over the film, and would have no doubt led to a much more satisfying experience. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>guilty woman/wrong man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's "Suspicion" comes across as a little hokey early on, before it gets going. In a number of Hitch's movies, it seems as though the Sultan of Suspense liked to focus on bored, rich people. In this movie, the daughter (Joan Fontaine) of a general hooks up with a suave dude (Cary Grant) whom she begins to suspect of murder.Among the common themes in AH's films are the guilty woman and the wrong man. If that's the case here, then Lina is guilty of hooking up with the wrong sort of man...or is she? Once the fluffy portrayals of rich, English people subside, the movie definitely turns into a Hitchcock movie. I saw it as a slight precursor to "Shadow of a Doubt".True, this is far from AH's best movie, but there's no denying the quality of the direction and acting. Joan Fontaine definitely deserved her Oscar win.Also starring Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Nigel Bruce (Watson in the old Sherlock Holmes movies), Dame May Witty, Isabel Jeans, Heather Angel, Auriol Lee, Reginald Sheffield, Leo G. Carroll (Mr. Waverly on "The Man from UNCLE") and of course Hitch in a cameo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvellous Hitchcock film, with two brilliant lead performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film last night, not knowing what to expect. Hitchcock is my favourite director, yet Suspicion is not treated among his best work. My conclusion from watching the film is that it is very good, but it is not perfect, and not Hitchcock's best. What let it down? Well, a lot of reviews have said so already, but the ending. For me it was abrupt and felt tacked on and somewhat implausible. Then again, StageFright and the Birds both had somewhat abrupt endings. And I know it isn't the fastest paced of his movies, but Torn Curtain's pacing was disappointingly pedestrian. However, Suspicion has a lot to recommend it. The acting is uniformly excellent, with Cary Grant charming and sometimes chilling as the man suspected of trying to murder his wife, and Joan Fontaine, looking gorgeous as ever even better as Lina giving a performance of edge and vulnerability. Out of the supporting performances, Nigel Bruce is simply terrific as Beaky, Leo G Caroll while in a brief role is memorable as the Captain and Cedric Hardwicke who played Frollo in the 1939 film The Hunchback of Notre Dame so memorably is great as the General. The direction is superb, tense when it needs to be and gentle in others and also filled with the fashionable touches that make his very best films great. The film is shot in a very sumptuous visual style, with beautiful black and white cinematography and lovely costumes and sets. The score from Franz Waxman is simply marvellous; the scoring in the scene when Lina writes the letter is enough to give you goosebumps. All in all, not Hitchock's best, but very good all the same. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Before this film I had only seen him in comical roles. I liked the progression of the story. I thought that everything happened in a logical order and that the amount of time that it took to tell the story was just right. I found it interesting that we got to see the "supposed" killer from the victim's viewpoint throughout the film. I am used to watching films where you know whether or not someone is a killer. It is a good tool to convey suspense. The story was rather convincing in that I thought that he was a killer. I was especially convinced after the scene with Cary Grant talking to the portrait of his father-in-law after he finds out that they aren't getting much of an inheritance. He says something to the effect of her father winning this one. I thought that the acting was brilliant and that the soft light did a good job in conveying the mood of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant's gonna get ya Joan! ....or, is he?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock has made a lot of great movies. So many, that when you see one that isn't quite as great as the likes of 'North by Northwest' and 'Rebecca', it almost feels like a bad film. Suspicion certainly isn't up there with Hitchcock's best work; but it isn't a bad film either. This is quite a different animal to what Hitchcock fans will be used to, as here the thrills come almost completely from the mind. The film is definitely in the 'psychological thriller' vein, and this is both a good and a bad thing. As ever, the master director does an excellent job of setting the scene for the plot, and once the plot starts; it's easy to get into the central idea. However, by the time the final credits role; Suspicion does feel just a little bit underdone. The plot is rather simple, and it follows dapper, yet irresponsible, playboy Johnnie Aysgarth (played by the great Cary Grant) and his marriage to Lina (Joan Fontaine), a young woman that he met on a train. After finding out about just how irresponsible her husband is, Lina becomes convinced that he's plotting to kill her! It is often said that Hitchcock was a misogynistic director, and as far as I can see - this film adds fuel to that fire. All of the paranoia in the film falls on Joan Fontaine's character, and by the end of the film; this fact is really rubbed in by the director. Maybe the ending isn't meant to be interpreted that way; but it's an interesting point. Alfred Hitchcock was a big admirer of Cary Grant; yet he seems to give him the short end of the stick when it comes to leading roles. North by Northwest is an undeniable masterpiece, but after that Suspicion is the second best collaboration between the two, beating the very dull To Catch a Thief and the whimsically overrated Notorious. Still, even Grant's worst efforts are worth watching for the simple reason that he stars; and this certainly isn't one of the worst films that that the actor ever made. Appearing alongside the duo of Grant and Fontaine is Nigel Bruce. I was very pleased to see Bruce in the film, as I'm a big fan of his for his work on Universal's Sherlock Holmes series. The character he plays here isn't a world away from Watson, either. On the whole, this is the Hitchcock film you see when you've seen his best work already. Suspicion isn't brilliant, but it ain't half bad either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compromised film with a miscast Cary Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming a year after Rebecca (1940), this film pales in comparison, particularly in the art direction and production design. If they wanted to do a film with a similarity to Rebecca, just without the budget, the least they could have done was to keep the story daring. The original idea behind it, of a female murder victim telling her story, of how, "before the fact," she started to become dimly aware that her husband wanted to kill her, and that at the end, she was even complicit in it, is interesting. It's unfortunate the producers didn't stick with this original idea all the way to the end. Instead, the woman is not murdered and her husband is never a murderer! As told on screen, the story has several holes, with the motivation of the characters not being fully explained. For instance, Joan Fontaine's character is supposedly so in love with Grant's; why then does she assume so quickly that Grant will resort to murdering his best friend? Sure, he's lied, cheated and stole, but murder? What benefit does murdering his friend give him? Apparently none, since soon after the deed, Fontaine finds out that Grant needs more money and is trying to borrow from her life insurance policy; she then assumes he will kill her! Overall, Fontaine's character and performance are less believable here than in Rebecca.The main problem with the film is the casting of Cary Grant. Through the mid-40s, Grant was known for taking a number of odd roles, roles that were different from his usual screen persona, in an attempt not to be typecast. Sometimes, like in Gunga Din, he succeeded. Others, like in The Talk of the Town, he was merely all right. And still others, he didn't succeed at all. Suspicion falls into this latter category. Grant plays the dark side too broadly. He gives an almost bipolar or manic depressive performance. For the moments where he's supposed to be happy and charming, he's the typical Cary Grant; for when he's supposed to be mean and dangerous, it's obvious he's mean and dangerous; he just clams up and gives an evil eye. A little more subtlety would have helped. Perhaps still have him be charming while being mean and murderous? But another problem was audience acceptance. Audiences probably wouldn't have accepted seeing Cary Grant as a mean murderer. The producers were fully aware of this; hence the compromised solution of making Grant innocent in the end.Thus, with Grant, the film just wasn't allowed to fully realize its potential or original idea. The producers felt the audience wouldn't accept it, and they were probably right. Perhaps with a different actor in the role, say Ray Milland or Fredric March, the audience would have been more willing and perhaps the producers wouldn't have changed the ending of the film, or maybe they would at least have left it ambiguous as to whether Johnnie was a murderer and as to whether or not he did kill his wife. This would have been much more interesting than what we got.</fullReview>

It is one of the best performances of Joan Fontaines career.There are some signs of the criminally cheap budget they worked under making this film. There are several sequences where hair styles change on Fontaine even though there is no logical reason for it to change. There are some minor errors in the film scenes which suggest this was intended to be a B picture when it was released. Because of how good a filmmaker Hitchcock was, it looks more like an A film now.The film is a fascinating study of mistaken impressions which people can readily jump too if they just look at what they see &amp; do not find out why they see it.

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's most underrated films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Fontaine won the 1941 Oscar for Best Actress as the heiress who marries cad Cary Grant and then thinks that maybe he is trying to kill her. Cary Grant? Well, what do you think? This Hitchcock movie is one of his most underrated; it's psychologically taut and it's very entertaining. Grant's innocence is hardly ever in doubt, despite the proliferation of red-herrings, but Hitchcock knows which buttons to push to create suspicion not just in Joan but in the audience.Many thought Fontaine's Oscar was a sympathy prize for having lost the year before for her performance as the second Mrs DeWinter in "Rebecca" and there are similarities between the characters but this is still a fine piece of work, tremulous and steely in turn, an English rose but with thorns. Grant, of course, is magnificent. In a way his performance slightly off-balances the film. Although British, he displays a cocky, brash American charisma that would seem more at home in a Howard Hawks movie and because of it he makes the character of Johnnie ever so slightly dangerous. Psychopathic? Perhaps, which is why Hitchcock probably cast him. Maybe he really was the ideal Hitchcock anti-hero after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Widmark would have been good in this typical Hollywood schizophrenia theme where the protagonist acts like an total idiot but ends up simply being misunderstood. What crap. I suppose in this early use of the genre it simply has to be in your face type clumsily done. Wow, a light bulb in the milk, I for one was sure impressed. And Hitchcock wanted Grant to really be a murderer, no wonder why he turned out to be so unlikeable in what the producers allowed to remain. I don't know, maybe English times were different back in those days but I for one don't think a story that casts the greatest comedic/dramatic actor film has ever known as a secretive control freak/bully makes for a good movie going experience (this thing was made in America at that).Judging this as simply a point in the progression of Hitchcock's great career is this film's only saving grace. I rate it a four out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor Hitchcock film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to Hitchcock's other films from the 40s, "Suspicion" places somewhere in the middle. It's not as enjoyable as "Spellbound" or as elegant as "Notorious", but it's better than the rather mundane - if entertaining - "Saboteur" and the exceedingly dull "Rebecca".The film starts out as a somewhat dated Cinderella story and then gradually becomes rather a chilling, psychological thriller. On the whole it's not one of Hitchcock's best achievements, although there are the usual clever Hitchcock touches, like the game of scrabble and the infamous milk glass scene. The film also benefits from Grant's superb performance as the simply lovable scoundrel.When you see "Suspicion" for the first time, don't be discouraged by the first half an hour which often seems to drag; there are some delicious moments of suspense ahead. I personally thought the much-argued ending was fairly acceptable, though not entirely satisfactory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film, wasn't it Monkey Face??!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the funniest, but also one of the most gripping Hitchcock movies I have ever watched. Cary Grant is perfectly cast as the inimitable John Aysgarth, and Joan Fontaine thoroughly deserved her Oscar as the woman in an almost constant state of paranoia. The ending (although a little short and sweet!) leaves you wondering whether Aysgarth is still being the compulsive liar he's always been throughout the film, or whether he is a man who really has come to terms with his problems. Not to be missed. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ending spoils a great Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this years ago and always remembered it as not a very good Hitchcock film. Seeing it again, I see that it is actually a very good film that has the wrong ending. Anyone who thinks it is the correct ending must look at all of Hitch's other films to see that that is not the way he ends his films. What I would like for an ending would be either a Notorious type ending, maybe the mystery writer saving her or "Shadow of a Doubt" ending, fighting over the cliff. Actually, as I think of it, it could be a "Saboteur" or "Northwest", hanging over the white cliffs of Dover or something. In Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock he says that he wanted a scene of Cary Grant bringing a glass of poisoned milk to Joan as she is writing to her mother saying that she knows he is a killer. Apparently, that milk scene was intended to be the final scene. A lesser Hitchcock, but only because the ending is wrong. Otherwise, it could be up there with Notorious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspiciously disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock, Cary Grant, Joan Fontaine. Can't really go wrong with that combination of talents, can you? Apparently you can. The star director fails to make great use of his two star performers. Hitchcock is the master of suspense. But with Suspicion he produced a film in which suspense, and drama, is sorely lacking. The film really doesn't work on any level. It's disappointing throughout and the terrible ending is a final insult. Direct enough movies you're going to have a few duds. This is a Hitchcock dud.Grant plays playboy Johnny Aysgarth who arrives in town and sweeps dowdy Lina McLaidlaw, played by Fontaine, off her feet. Well, there's your first problem. The dowdy Joan Fontaine? I'm sorry but no matter how many times Johnny calls Lina by the nickname he gives her, and it seems he does so about a thousand times to greatly annoying effect, Joan Fontaine's no Monkeyface. We're meant to believe that Lina is an unattractive, undesirable woman, destined to be an old maid until Johnny rescues her. Even her own parents are convinced no man would ever want her. So when Johnny shows an interest Lina rushes headlong into marriage. And immediately finds that Johnny is not at all who she thought him to be. He gave off the impression he was quite wealthy but the guy's flat broke. And he has no interest in rectifying that situation by getting a job. Johnny's a lazy, irresponsible cad. It doesn't take long for Lina to start to believe Johnny is much more interested in her father's money than he is in her. But Lina will have bigger problems down the road. As Johnny's financial situation worsens Lina begins to suspect he is capable of quite monstrous things. Murderous things. And she's the obvious victim-to-be.Grant certainly has no problem playing the charming playboy. As a possible cold-blooded killer he is much less convincing. Is he really a murderer? The film keeps you guessing all the way through. Or tries to anyway. There's just not all that much dramatic tension, odd in a movie about a woman who thinks her husband is out to kill her. The story never really grabs hold of you. The best Hitchcock films put you on the edge of your seat. This film never has that effect. For this movie to work we have to be right in Lina's head, to see what she sees, feel what she feels. The movie is all about her suspicions. As good as Fontaine is in the role, and she probably is the best thing the film has to offer, the character of Lina never works completely. There's just something that's off about the character, about the whole film in truth. The pieces of this puzzle never all seem to fit together properly. Fontaine would win an Oscar for her portrayal of the "dowdy" woman whom a charming man wants to marry for her father's money. Eight years later Fontaine's sister, Olivia de Havilland, would win an Oscar for her portrayal of a "dowdy" woman whom a charming man wants to marry for her father's money in The Heiress. There the similarities end. The Heiress is a much better film than this one. Suspicion disappoints throughout and then comes the ending which is the worst thing of all. The movie fizzles out with a meek, lamentable whimper. For once Hitchcock really missed the mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two differing halves as Hitchcock blends a winner, of sorts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspicion, unfortunately these days, seems more famous for its debatable ending, well that and the accusation that Joan Fontaine got a pity Oscar after being ignored for the far superior Rebecca the previous year. What isn't in doubt, though, is that it finds Hitchcock on interesting form. Often talked about as being a grim story in essence, it's something of a comedy drama flecked in mysterious romantic dabblings.Cary Grant is cynical society playboy Johnnie Aysgarth, who romances and then weds Lina McLaidlaw (Fontaine), possibly only for his treasure seeking leanings? True to form, Aysgarth gets into a number of financial escapades that leaves Lina exasperated, more so when a shady partnership with his friend Beaky (a suitably doofus turn from Nigel Bruce) ends with Beaky meeting a mysterious death in Paris. As Lina thinks deeper about it, the more she is convinced that Johnnie is going to have her murdered in order to get his hands on her inheritance.And then there's that ending that has divided opinions across the cinema spectrum, a vastly different ending to the one in the source novel, Before The Fact (Frances Iles). Personally I think Hitchcock got it right, it feels like he has submarined the viewers with a cheeky glint in his eye. Once the comedy tone of the first half dissipates, Hitchcock builds the suspense greatly to reveal a picture about mistrust and paranoia, where we, along with Fontaine's fretful wife, are just not sure about Johnnie's intentions or state of mind. The director then takes his characters, and us the viewers, to the cliff's edge, and delivers an ending that most probably had him chuckling away with carefree abandon.Far from the top tier of Hitchcock movies, Suspicion is however, impeccably acted, well paced and devilishly cheeky. And of course there's "that" magnificent glowing drink scene to marvel at... 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't live up to potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspicion has many good things about it. First, Cary Grant plays Johnny Aylesgarth with an appropriate undercurrent of menace/hostility (think of how he talks to Katherine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story). Second, Joan Fontaine does an excellent job of playing the somewhat school-marmish girl who is swept away by Johnny, at least initially. Also, Nigel Bruce plays a great part as Johnny's school-buddy "Beaky".The problems I have with this movie are as follows:1. Johnny is supposed to be a "loveable rogue". He gets the rogue part right, but the "loveable" part is not believable. Even given the mores of an earlier era, it seems hard to believe that Lina would have kept taking more of Johnny's lies. 2. The ending is unbelievable. Even if Johnny turns out *not* to be a killer, (the "suspicion" is that he is), the idea of him turning his life around and them living happily ever after is stupid. Johnny has proved himself to be a liar and thief over and over again. I heard that Hitchcock wanted a different ending, but was overruled by the studio. Too bad, as I would have trusted Hitchcock's instincts here.Everone should watch this film for their "classic" collection, but overall, it is not as good as other Hitchcock offerings, such as Rebecca.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You gotta remember that Hitch was not only the master of suspense but a great innovator in surrealism as well. This film is great with sparkling performances by Fontaine, Grant and others. Yep. It's 40's fare but what the hey. I know the ending doesn't satisfy (my wife, a chic-flick fan liked it, though) but realize the studios had major $$ invested in Grant and having him a swine murderer didn't work back then. The remake with Anthony Andrews is ghastly, BTW. Stick with Hitch. Sit back, grip the arms of your overstuffed chair and let the surrealism rip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under Suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While traveling to the countryside of England by train, the repressed and shy Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) meets the reckless playboy Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) crashing her first class cabin with a third class ticket. When they meet each other again, Johnnie overhears a conversation of her father about her heritage and courts Lina that immediately falls in love for him. They get married and when they return from their fancy honeymoon, Lina discovers that Johnnie is a broken gambler that borrows money from his friends to live in a high-standard. Then she finds that he is also a liar and after receiving his old friend and partner in a real estate business Beaky (Nigel Bruce) in their home, Lina believes that Johnnie intends to kill Beaky. However, they decide to travel to Paris to dissolve their partnership. When two detectives come to their house to investigate the mysterious death of Beaky in Paris, Lina believes Johnny is the murderer and she will be his next victim."Suspicion" is another delightful movie from Alfred Hitchcock, supported by an intriguing and ambiguous plot and wonderful performances of Joan Fontaine, Cary Grant and Nigel Bruce. With a dark ending, this movie could be a masterpiece, but unfortunately the unexpected conclusion forced by the RKO Studio is totally disappointing. Based on the commercial and ridiculous ending, the lack of character of Johnnie Aysgarth is still impressive and for me it is never clear whether he really loves Lina or is interested in her allowance and future heritage. The ambiguity of this lead character makes the viewer to sympathize and share the fear of Lina, and I do not understand how Alfred Hitchcock accepted this interference in his work. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is at the village postbox, mailing a letter. I saw in the Extras of the DVD that the dog the Johnny brings to Lina belonged to Alfred Hitchcock. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil):"Suspeita" ("Suspicion")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would be truly suspicious is if it were to fall away as "early, minor" Hitchcock and not be embraced by those out to do as such.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love how the large window above the entrance to the exquisite house, within which most of Hitchcock's Suspicion is set, casts a bizarre and wholly distinctive series of shapes when the light shines through; bathing the entrance and general reception area in this odd series of patterns looking ever increasingly like some sort of spider's web. Such a 'look' is no doubt deliberate on account of the director, as the tricks and games certain people therein get caught up in often resembles a sort of inescapable trap with doom looming around the corner - people becoming flies in a trap already laid by that of a good looking man who's actually rather sour. People indeed speak often of how beautiful nature is, and then it goes and reveals its darker, uglier side.The film follows Joan Fontaine's Lina, a young Sussex based woman with a Christian upbringing and was born into a wealthy set of parents whom occupy affluent surroundings and enjoy the odd fox hunt. One day, on board a train, she encounters Cary Grant's Johnnie. Or rather, he goes out of his way to encounter her. Dwelling in a first class compartment, for which he does not possess a ticket, and eyeing Lina up in a literal manner in as much he begins at the feet and works his way up in a fashion which itself suggests a behavioural pattern, the two strike a brief conversation and successfully come across as two people of similar class backgrounds sharing a quaint train ride home. Johnnie cuts a suave figure, a well spoken and well dressed man of whom is brought to life by Grant in tone perfect fashion as introductions and pleasantries brood before appearing to give way to demeanours that appear wry or dangerous, and Grant takes the character from its foundations to a state of intent superbly; implementing facial expressions and subtle movements forcing both us and the lead into questioning things.In spite of the fact it is quite clearly verbally reiterated that Lina is just "too good" for a man like Johnnie, the two eventually come together and marry. This is born out of a fair degree of spite on Lina's behalf when she overhears her parents speak ill of her potential for marriage; something which, on top of the fact we are coerced into doubting whether Johnnie and Lina are a match anyway, plants enough doubt as to whether these people and their relationship will work. The bigger picture of things lies with the fact Johnnie reveals himself to have had many-a girlfriend in the past, so many in fact that he counts them instead of the more traditional noun of sheep if he should ever find himself awake at night still trying to get to sleep. A marriage to Lina on a wet and rainy day at a registry office gives way to the reveal he doesn't actually have any money at all and resulting in a tumultuous passage of play around these truths to occur.Cue a lot of aggravation; uncertainty as well as heaps of that titular suspicion, as Lina's world (or is it just her mental well-being?) rapidly comes apart at the seams as Johnnie moves mysteriously and odd things which weren't happening before begin to rear up. Is he after her money, which he will inherit should something 'happen' to her? Is his pet name for her, "Monkeyface", merely a misdemeanour? Or is it an ever increasingly awkward sounding insult which runs in perfect tandem to the ongoing troubles unfolding around their existing together. Perhaps there's nothing wrong at all with Johnnie's behaviour, and she is merely feeling the psychological fallout of rushing into a marriage she wasn't ready for with a man she's with to get back at her parents. The film has a lot of fun with the premise, and it is a good; well-built and often fun thriller chock full of the sorts of things which may/may not be there unfolding in a juxtaposed fashion to that of the Sussex coastline. The film is unfolded in that deft manner which would later become synonymous with Hitchcock's work; there is an awful lot of 1954's Rear Window in Suspicion's lead's psychological second-guessing of herself melded in with hard physical evidence which appears to be right in front of one's self, and yet remains prominently elusive.There is a scene much later on in the film, set in that same house as was mentioned in the opening, in which a police officer pauses to reflect on a series of expressionistic paintings of people or objects engaging or positioned in such a manner that requires a kind of foresight or ability to read into things so as to unearth what the genuine nature of what's being presented to you actually is. Such is what it is the lead faces throughout, a delicate and often poised piece that sees the director etch enough in the way of the terror born out the ambiguity surrounding the routine presence of one man, whilst consistently toying with us in regards to his actions and motivations. It is a sharp and often quite unnerving film which rarely features more than a mere handful of people on screen at one time and is all about the implied actions instigated by someone happening off screen acting as the fuel to the drama. In short, it is well worth the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joan Fontaine, Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock in Top Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, we all know the ending is not the one everyone wanted but it really doesn't matter. Hitchcock has said in print that this film is really about a woman's fantasy life and when looked at from that perspective it is brilliantly executed directorially and by all the actors, especially Joan Fontaine, and it doesn't really quite matter how it ends. Since he doesn't kill her, her fantasy is all paranoia and in the next reel she should probably go seek a good therapist. If he had killed her, the illusion would have been all about her immature and overwhelming love for her husband and the inability to leave him because of her all consuming, fantasy driven obsession with him. I have watched this film over and over and over and never tire of it and I have to say it is Joan Fontaine's performance that keeps the interest going. Grant is wonderful as always but she is the focal point and she never fails to deliver the goods. This is GREAT Hitchcock and I know people tend to overlook Fontaine and give great praise to Ingrid Bergman, especially in Notorious, which is a great film, yet I prefer Fontaine over Bergman and Suspicion over Notorious. The psychology of this film is sooooo compelling and the story and narrative so simple and tight that repeat viewings always reveal something new to discover as any great work of art should. There is not one wasted frame in this picture. Joan Fontaine is an actress who is so often dismissed by people and I don't understand why. She is delicate, fragile and vulnerable yet there is something steely and strong underneath all her performances. This is great acting and I don't care if Hitchcock manipulated her by telling her people didn't like her on set. I know many actors that if you make them uptight by trying to manipulate them into a fearful situation and try to get them to emote that fear and insecurity on stage or film just freeze up and are unable to communicate anything. That Fontaine is able to release her fear, pathos, terror, fright and vulnerability in front of the camera, no matter how it is achieved, is a testament to her talent and ability to transmit it. Give me Fontaine over Ingrid Bergman or Grace Kelly any day. Her two films with Hitchcock are perfection. I'm never quite satisfied with Bergman or Kelly in quite the same way though they have many virtues. And let's not forget Fontaine did win an Academy Award and New York Film Critics Award for this performance. Lest one think she is merely a puppet of Hitchcock watch her beguiling performances in The Constant Nymph and Letter From an Unknown Woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1941 romantic psychological thriller, "Suspicion" by Alfred Hitchcock, was yet another one great suspenseful film. I felt that the acting by Cary Grant was amazing, and along with Joan Fontaine, the story just got more and more suspenseful. There were so many twists and turns throughout the film, that i just gave up on trying to figure out the end. I also noticed the usage of lighting throughout the film, being that whenever the audience was starting to think Grant was up to something evil, the lights dimmed a little. I thought this was a classic Hitchcock masterpiece, and give "Suspicion" 5 out of 6 chicken nuggets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In any kind of relationship or partnership, it is very important to remain loyal and truthful to your partner. Partners need to respect each other for who they are and not use them for money, steal and sell important family heirlooms behind their back without permission, or take out their problems out on them. Looking for an easy way out of a problem is not a solution. If their partner is struggling through an issue, then both partners need to be there for each other to solve the problem before the problem takes a toll for the worst scenario.Hitchcock is able to work this theme out well in this suspenseful, mystery film. Hitchcock use of low contrast lighting and reflective shadows on the walls of the homes were used well. Hitchcock's use of the dolly shot in the dancing scene, long shots of the actors in the field, the close up flipping of the magazine, back lighting on Lina as she enters the room to see Johnny and his friend, were shot extremely well. All of the actors have performed their roles well.Hitchcock works in the foreshadowing and plot twists to the story extremely well with photos,merchandise,books,words, and the character's actions that keep the viewers glued to the film and make them guess what's going to happen to the characters at the end of the film.I would recommend this movie to anybody that's interested in watching suspenseful films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was the shadow of the window projected in the house intended by the director to imply a 'web of deceit'? It appears constantly in scenes filmed in the house. Also, what was the significance of the detective looking at the painting so intently? I know that these should go in the FAQ section but I can't seem to get to the page where I submit them. This is my first post here. Also I'd like to know if some of the backgrounds were painted (such as the church building at the beginning of the film) as it appeared to be a prop or painted. I will say that it seemed that during the filming Grant didn't know whether he was going to be a killer or not so he played it to the hilt. He has always played the affable gentleman but in this movie he could really be menacing and cruel to Miss Fontain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Cary Grant was capable of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant, perhaps the most famous and popular movie actor in the world at the time, gives his most complete performance in his first role for the great Alfred Hitchcock. He stars as smooth and charming playboy Johnnie Aysgarth who falls for the prim, proper and simple Lina McLaidlaw, an Oscar-winning performance by the beautiful and classy Joan Fontaine. They marry to everyone's surprise, and Lina becomes surprised herself when she discovers secrets from Johnnie's past that shine a light on his dark, edgier side. At seemingly every turn, she starts to worry and contemplates leaving but his charm and grace always pull through. But, when she suspects he wants her dead, what does she do? This is a somewhat formulaic pot-boiler thriller that Hitchcock keeps from being boring, if only because of the star power. As mentioned before, Grant was at the height of his fame and that alone could draw in an audience, and Fontaine was fresh off her role in Hitchcock's previous film, Rebecca. (On a side note, it was interesting to me that Fontaine looked so much like Ingrid Bergman in Rebecca, but looks like her sister, Olivia de Havilland, in this one, showing her true talent and ability to play any character.) Hitchcock, through his skilled editing and directing makes this better than in any other director's hands, although it might have been better had he received the ending he wanted. To not spoil it, I will only say that it is the type of ending that makes you like Cary Grant when it is quite possible that you shouldn't. This is not Grant or Hitchcock's fault, but the studio's who was merely protecting their prized investment. Still, there is plenty to like in this picture and if nothing else, shows that Cary Grant was capable of more than a pretty face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder in Mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant is here, as elsewhere, very likable. Impulsive, playful, flirtatious, devilishly handsome, and above all, charming. Too charming, in fact. There have always been signals behind that dazzling smile and that dashing dimple, that nobody could be so quick, so on top of things, could embody so much savoir-faire. NOBODY could be that good. And here Hitchcock puts the viewer's doubts to effective use.Grant, as Johnny Aysgarth, meets the supposedly homely and spinsterish Lina, Joan Fontaine, and becomes interested in her. He arranges to meet her outside the home of her well-off parents, Dame May Witty and Sir Cedric Hardwicke, both of whom distrust him. But Grant is grand. He steals her away to the top of a windy hill, undoes the top button of her blouse to show off her beautiful unicipal mapillary (sternoclavicular notch) and rearranges her hair. She's overcome and later, overhearing her father describe her as a spinster with brains and a nice personality, with no warning, she spins around and gives Grant a great big smooch. Grace Kelly would do the same in "To Catch a Thief," and it probably comes as a surprise to the audience, but I don't know why. It happens to me all the time. Beautiful women throw themselves at my feet so often that at times it's difficult to walk.Anyway, the two are married and after an expensive honeymoon Grant moves them into an extravagant house with a servant. It's only then that the penniless Grant discovers that her annual allowance will not pay for their expenses. Grant is faced with the prospect of finding a job. He makes rueful jokes about learning how to handle a shovel, then brightly announces that he has a decent offer from a cousin of his, Mr. Melbeck (Leo G. Carroll).But the financial problems persist. Grant involves a cheerful, generous, lovable old friend of his, Nigel Bruce, rather a dull bulb, in a scheme to buy some land and build a development. Not only does the deal fall through but, under mysterious circumstances in Paris, and in the presence of an unidentified English gentleman, Bruce drinks too much brandy and dies from it, an event the prescient Grant could foresee, and the joint corporation is never dissolved. On top of that, good old Johnny, it turns out, has embezzled money from his cousin's firm and charges against him for two thousand pounds are pending.Are we talking about Cary Grant as a MURDERER? It certainly begins to look that way. Joan Fontaine snoops around in Grant's personal correspondence, as some wives are want to do, and discovers that he's been making inquiries into the status of her life insurance. The purloined letter informs her that Grant has been denied a loan on her insurance, that the only way he can collect is if she dies.Gulp. She loves Grant deeply but he has been looking into poisons that leave no trace, and one night, after a row, he brings her a glass of minatory milk -- the famous glass of milk that Hitchcock planted a light bulb in to make it glow in the dark. Fontaine is convinced that the milk is poisoned. What to do! There are a couple of notable things about this film, the underlying sliminess of Cary Grant's ingratiating personality aside. First, there is a dinner at the house of a rough-talking woman author, Isobel Sedbusk. (What a name.) Her brother, a pathologist with glasses like coke-bottle bottoms, is discussing poisons during the meal and mentions "a corpse that dropped in recently" while deliberately carving a surgical slice of meat from the breast of a small roast fowl. Then there is Mrs. Sedbusk's, umm, companion, Jessie, who, if not a lesbian, certainly should be one, with her hair severely tied back, her mannish features, and her black suit and necktie. Then there is the later visit from two detectives who question Fontaine in her house. One of them, the goofy-looking one, is entranced by a loony looking modern painting in the vestibule. He gawks at it when they enter and again when they leave, and each time his baffled stare is accompanied by a chimerical arpeggio on the piano in Franz Waxman's score. (The music during the last high-speed sequence was lifted and re-used in Waxman's score for the skiing sequence in "Spellbound.")Well, boys and girls, not to worry! You and I both know that Cary Grant is no murderer (as he was in the original story). Not a bit of it. He was going to poison HIMSELF but then decided it was the coward's way out, so at the end he decides to go back and face the music, even though it means prison. "A man can't change," he firmly informs Fontaine. "Oh, Johnny, let's go back and face it together," she begs him -- and so they do. We can all be forgiven, though, for suspecting that Grant in this case may be right. A man can change alright, but given Grant's anti-social history he probably won't. And she'll spend the rest of her life trying to "bring you under control once I get the bit in your teeth," as she once put it.Joan, you're lovely, blond, English, naive, and vulnerable -- but your eyebrows are asymmetrical. Good luck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension-filled thriller from Hitchcock; early in the director's career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A subtle success from director Alfred Hitchcock, SUSPICION is short on the dynamic set-pieces and elaborate camera angles that enhance (or mar, depending upon your perspective) most of Hitchcock's later work. The simple storyline of a woman who fears she might have married a murderer is just that: simple. Hitchcock fortunately makes no attempts to jazz up the proceedings by jamming unnecessary characters or subplots into the straightforward premise. He simply sets up the characters and their motivations, and then he steps back and lets the ensuing tension take over.Joan Fontaine won a Best Actress Oscar for her performance here, even though she is essentially playing the exact same role she played the previous year in Hitchcock's REBECCA (not that she doesn't play it flawlessly again here). The picture is stolen somewhat by Cary Grant, who is marvelously sinister in what is arguably his first serious film role. The film garnered some controversy when RKO made Hitchcock alter the original bleak ending for a more conventional Hollywood finale. The film is remains an excellent thriller, however, and will most likely be enjoyed by all of those who enjoy Hitchcock's earlier, less glitzy films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Symphonic Web of Silver Shadows on Celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspicion--one of Hitchcock's finest--features an Oscar winning performance by Joan Fontaine, as Lina, animated to a brilliant score (that almost carries the movie) by the Franz Waxman. Hitchcock, Fontaine and Waxman transform the screen into a vehicle for Lina's innermost thoughts and fears: a symphonic web captured on celluloid. Lina suspects her husband--Cary Grant--is trying to kill her. Her emotional vulnerability, and our deepest fears, cast silver shadows--like dendrites--on to the screen.If you are a fan of great old movies, great film scores or Alfred Hitchcock--find Suspicion. A wonderful companion to Rebecca.</fullReview>

The problem is that the end (which is apparently changed from that of the book) doesn't really hold water, and once you start thinking about that it makes the rest of the movie shaky in retrospect.In a way this seems unfair. It's a movie I liked more the first time I saw it, and really I think the main criticism is that it doesn't hold up for reviewing as well as some of Hitchcock's other films. But then, even the first time, I never *loved* it, I just liked it. Not great Hitchcock, but overall, pretty good Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid delivery but a poor ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A chance meeting on a train is the start of a whirlwind romance between wealthy young Lina McLaidlaw and the dashing and debonair Johnnie Aysgarth. It is not long before Johnnie finds himself a part of the McLaidlaw family even though the wider family perhaps feel that he is not a good enough match for Lina. Lina's patience is initially tested with Johnnie as some of his quirks bother and worry him but the loving streak behind his actions win her over. However as some worrying "facts" come to light about Johnnie, Lina starts to doubt that her husband has aspirations to bigger things that maybe extend to deceit, treachery and yes maybe even murder.In my view any Hitchcock movie is at very least worth a look and it was thus that I decided to return and watch this film again after almost two decades since I last saw it. Initially a bit dull the narrative quickly gets down into the business of throwing the audience back and forward in what we believe and what we don't. This makes for an interesting film albeit not as tense or gripping as I would have liked. The delivery is touched with an element of dark humour and mystery but the pace is perhaps a bit too slow at times. Hitchcock directs with the usual interesting touches and awareness of tone and atmosphere that you would expect from him, while the cinematography compliments the narrative by mixing the bright and carefree with the shadowy and threatening ? often in the same locations.As everyone and his dog will tell you, the ending is not that great and it does feel like a copout after so much back and forward ? a "happy" ending that plays to a simple audience while also satisfying the censors of the time. This aside the cast all work with the majority of the material well. Grant is slick but dark enough to work within his character. Fontaine convincingly flip-flops in her belief and works very well in keeping the audience with her no matter what she believes. Support is strong from Bruce, Carroll, Hardwicke and others despite them mostly doing small turns.Overall then a solid Hitchcock film; not anything that special but enough about it to be of interest. The cast and director work well with the narrative but the ending is a disappointment as it does nothing of any interest of value and panders to the lowest denominator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the "master of suspense" director, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, this film I think is more admired for the performances by the two leads more than the story, I can agree. Basically shy Lina McLaidlaw (Oscar winning Joan Fontaine, possibly a win as compensation for losing Rebecca the previous year) meets playboy Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) who seems to live borrowing money from friends. They begin to court, and before long they are married, but after the honeymoon she seems to slowly become suspicious of all he does when it comes to what he does, and his interest in poisons. Johnnie's friendship with Beaky (Nigel Bruce) seems innocent enough, but he manages to get away with pretty much anything with his charm, but she trusts him less and less. It is after the mysterious death of Beaky that Lina's suspicion goes into overdrive as she is sure that Johnnie may have had something to do it, and it all comes to a head driving over some cliffs, and as they drive away, you wonder can their relationship continue, the last thing Johnnie does is put his arm over Lina's shoulder, so who knows? Also starring Sir Cedric Hardwicke as General McLaidlaw, Dame May Witty as Mrs. McLaidlaw, Isabel Jeans as Mrs. Newsham, Heather Angel as Ethel - Maid, Auriol Lee as Isobel Sedbusk, Reginald Sheffield as Reggie Wetherby and Leo G. Carroll as Captain Melbeck, and Hitchcock's cameo is a man mailing a letter at the village postbox. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Franz Waxman and Best Picture. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just viewed this for the first time I must admit that I rather enjoyed it: its principal character, Joan Fontaine's Lina, is both engaging and delightful, causing you to feel and care for her throughout the film. However, I found dashing debonair Grant and his friend' Beaky' rather annoying, making me want to shout 'get a grip' at Grant - surely no-one could be that unaware of Lina's beauty and desire for security?! That aside though, I found none of the irritating class divisions that annoyed the hell out of me in "In which we serve" - life is just portrayed in a form of romantic beauty and simplicity.In my mind therefore the film has two stars - Fontaine and the house (of fairy-tale-like dreams): Hitchcock lights both with depth and feeling, at no time does the house seem threatening, it just seems magical. After the police leave a shot reveals how she almost appears dwarfed by the house which seems to be pressing in on her in all its grandeur, enveloping not drowning. Does the house in darkness, lighting up the milk, protect her? As a story? Romantic? Cold? It would have been more exciting it he'd died, leaving her never knowing... Not an amazing ending, but still worth watching for it's two stars...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Suspicion" is a methodically slow, generally engrossing but somewhat overlong (even at 98 minutes) Hitchcock thriller. I don't think that it's one of his greatest films; he manages to get terrific performances from Fontaine and Grant (who, despite a little mugging at the beginning, is perfect in his ambiguous role), but he waits too long before he gets to the suspenseful parts. His directorial precision is evident throughout, but the abrupt ending (which, like the first reviewer, I think is weakly executed) doesn't really reward you for the attention that you've been paying until then. I definitely prefer this movie to "Notorious", however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nearly a great 'is-he-gonna-do-it'; the ending, with a hint of ambiguity, is the only thing that's fishy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion is a gripping enough yarn, a tale of a wife who just can't seem to get a hold on what her husband is really all about - meaning, of course, if he's a murderer or not, or will murder, possibly her. It's the kind of picture where the constant tug of is he or isn't he, and the emotional crisis at hand, are put upon the audience as well; we're with Joan Fontaine all the way, always doubting, yet always finding that charmer of Cary Grant. The first twenty minutes is simply the old story of two people unlikely falling in love, one from a well off family and the other not so much (although, for some reason, he's quite popular with some of the ladies). It's after they marry her doubts begin, first about his money, which he has none, then about job prospects, which are the same. Then other things pile up in her mind, like losing a job that he does get and not finding out till six weeks later, or with Johnnie's friend who succumbs to an untimely death by drink. She can prove nothing, but what about the recipe for poison from one of the detective books. Something doesn't add up for her.I was quite absorbed in the story, but also in the little twists and turns of the characters; the line "I think of my murderers as my heroes" by the novelist marks as a Hitchcockian comment if ever there was one. By having Grant in the lead we can only get so much of a grasp on what he's about, even if by the last third our suspicions are right in line with the protagonist Lina. It's a natural progression that one might see in other Hitchcock films (to a degree I'm reminded of Shadow of a Doubt, despite that being a far more sinister picture for its upfront attitude), and it works splendidly for the most part because Grant and especially Fontaine are so good in the parts. Lina isn't a dummy, but she also loves her husband, and this uncertainty- and the dread on her face when she's hearing details and things that make her faint on the spot- is spot-on. She's the 'identity' figure, meaning it's easy to go along for the ride as Hitchcock is bringing her along as well. It's one of the best leading lady performances in any of the Master's films, certainly of the 40s.But now to that ending, which is crawling still in my brain as to how it could possibly be considered a cop-out. Not to spoil a bit, but it is suffice to say things are not as one might expect from the premise, and it ironically didn't have to be that way had the studio- how prodded Hitchcock to not even have the ending originally written filmed- taken a chance with its big star. And yet there could arguably be a way that it wouldn't seem like the happy ending it was, while at the same time there is still a hint of it not being entirely a happy one. How will the marriage play out, one might ask, given the circumstances of Lina and Jonnies' fates? Yet there's something still 'off' about it, bringing and not bringing closure for a mainstream audience not possibly thought to not know how to take something darker or more straightforward from the trajectory of the plot. It's the only thing about Suspicion that taint it from being one of Hitchcock's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically speaking, this is a well-made film and almost deserves a score of 8. It's pretty to look at, the acting is just fine and there are no major complaints at all about the story. The problem for me is that there is also nothing particularly distinguished or noteworthy about the film. Because Hitchcock's original darker vision for the movie was nixed by RKO executives, what remains is surprisingly bland---albeit, well-done. To me, there just isn't any particular specialness about the film. What's the big deal if, in the end, you find out that there really ISN'T a murder being plotted and everyone is going to live happily ever after?! In addition, both Cary Grant's and Joan Fontaine's characters are really hard to believe. He's just too awful and worthless and she's got the charm and charisma of a piece of cheese. That's odd, by the way, as Fontaine received an Oscar for her performance in a relatively flat film. No bad, mind you--just very flat. Other actresses up for Best Actress that year were Bette Davis in LITTLE FOXES and Barbara Stanwyck in BALL OF FIRE--two ladies whose performances I clearly preferred to Fontaine's. But Davis had already won the award a couple times and Stanwyck was in a comedy--a genre seldom respected by the Academy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly insuting English comedy made by Americans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to see an American comedy made by Britons, but Hollywood going British was quite within the powers of the US dream machine in 1941. This was the second year of the USA standing aside while the Nazi scourge devoured Europe and smashed up Britain. American bankers and US industry including IBM had backed the Nazi war machine, and Hitler was seen as the man to smash Stalin and Communism. Nazi parties were on the rampage all over the USA, something that conveniently has vanished down the memory hole. So this fantasy English film is set in a stereotyped upper-class world that neither huge box-office star (Joan Fontaine &amp; Cary Grant) properly understood, Fontaine having gone to school in Japan, and Grant having been brought up in US variety music hall. Considering that Britain at the time this film was issued came under concentrated attack by the Nazi empire, it could be considered insulting to Britain, but that hardly mattered to the greed-crazed captains of the US film industry, whose only aims were 1.) to conform and 2.) to make money. They were such idiots that they actually wrecked Hitchcock's creation, obliging him to substitute infantile gratification for the original author's crime-novel ending. Britons were probably far too busy with other things to notice this piece of nonsense, although the industry did drive home the insult with a best-actress Oscar for Joan Fontaine, who for my taste over-emotes lamentably throughout. Forgettable nonsense that still retains a slightly offensive odour about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is by far my favorite director. It turns out that Cary Grant is my favorite old-time actor. "Suspicion" is one of the best films of all time, in my opinion. I know the ending was awful, but let us not take away the scenes prior. Hitchcock knew how to instill fear in the viewer. He did it in a way that no other director at his time (or any time) could. "Suspicion" followed the 'will he kill her' or 'will he not kill her' mystery. It did it very well. The production for this movie was great. The scenes where the viewer is unsure about Grant's intentions are surely the best. The score seemed to change when Joan Fontaine was happy or suspicious of Grant. A major keyed, melodic song would play when she was happy, but a version of the song in a minor key would play when she was suspicious. It's the brain of Hitchcock at work. I absolutely recommend this movie to everybody who has ever lived.</fullReview>

The acting was really good with an excellent performance from Cary Grant as usual. There were a few really interesting scenes in the movie; one which I thought was really interest although insignificant was in the beginning with all the animals it was crazy. Another somewhat eerie scene was when in the beginning as well, when Grant takes off her jacket and with the music and camera effects it was really strange. Speaking of camera-work, Hitchcock did a great job with his use of camera I liked all the different types of shots used (especially the nice pan shot when they kiss at her house) it was very "fluid-like". The music of the film was also really intense and really help give that extra effect for the scene. Really good film though and definitely worth a watch.

		<shortDescription>an overlooked masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until its understandably notorious and controversial ending, Alfred Hitchcock's unfortunately overlooked gem "Suspicion" is a classic example of the master filmmaker early in his career and weaving together his talents for generating a gripping story with the tactic that he would ultimately remain most famous for: suspense. The word that makes up the title, suspicion, is composed of those two elements and Hitchcock was a master at them. The movie stars Joan Fontaine (who became the only actor or actress to win an Oscar in an Alfred Hitchcock-directed movie) as a charming, but shy young woman who becomes increasingly aware that her husband (Cary Grant) has become entangled in a wide variety of legal tie-ups. Her questions turn to fear as she becomes convinced he's planning to kill her.That was just the sort of story that would attract Alfred Hitchcock. He is the leading force in the movie, but those also due enormous credit are the two leading performers, who provide the glue that keeps this movie together even when its shockingly disappointing resolution comes up. Hitchcock was famous for taking leading men such as James Stewart and having them play the exact opposite of their usual idealistic characters. Like Stewart, Cary Grant was and still is famous for playing endlessly polite, charming, and likable leading men. It took the nerve that only Hitchcock had to not only make Grant into a suspicious character, but to believe that he could kill. This sparred a lot of controversy in the studio system at that time, but frankly, there's nothing they should have worried about. Not only is Grant very good in the movie, but having him play the opposite of his usual character personality was hands-down brilliant. If you want to frighten an audience or make them suspect (and thus generate fear of anticipation), give them a leading man whom you don't suspect. It would have all been too easy to suspect the husband if say Lon Chaney Jr. had taken the role. Because Grant is so charming and handsome and charismatic, somehow that makes him seem more lethal.And of course, I can't leave out Joan Fontaine, who gets second-billing to Grant due to promotional reasons but is really the star of the show. Fontaine, among Grace Kelly and Kim Novak, is one of Hitchcock's most professional and well-cast leading ladies in his movies. Like with any movie of this sort, Hitchcock knew he had to get the audience to identify with Fontaine. This is unusual for Hitchcock, for he oftentimes like to have his leading ladies somewhat icy and cold, controlling and deceiving the leading man. So by taking these two elements and casting the actors and playing the roles the opposite of how they would usually be treated, Hitchcock created a web of suspense that even today many people try to imitate.As I've mentioned before, the resolution to the picture disappoints, and this blame is due one-hundred-percent to the studio and not to Hitchcock or his screenwriters. Hitchcock's intended ending would have been the quintessential way to conclude the story, but that's Hollywood for you. Although the ending is a crop-out and a head-shaker that does not ruin the suspense and anticipation and enjoyment levels that were built up in the previous ninety-five minutes. This is an overlooked and rarely mentioned masterpiece. One of the master-filmmaker, Alfred Hitchcock's very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's "Suspicion" (1941) is fundamentally flawed. The climax that Hitchcock wanted would have had Cary Grant throw Joan Fontaine from the car, but RKO (who released the film) felt that having Cary Grant as a bad guy would hurt his image, so they changed the ending to a happy one and in a effect made the film absolutely pointless. But, I when watch this film I ignore the tacked on ending, and what happens when you do that? It turns the movie into a riveting film, that has magnificent performances from Grant and Fontaine. There are some great set pieces such as the glass of milk and Grant and quizzing a detective author on how to do the perfect murder. Plus, you get a great performance from Nigel Bruce. To fully enjoy this movie, you must ignore the ending, and if you do that, it turns the film into one of Hitchcock's best.</fullReview>

The milk glass glistening in the stairwell was so strikingly a giveaway, why the other lame distractions?

Alfred Hitchcock is able to use the medium of black and white cinematography to obtain the artistry of mystery and tell a story. Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine starring in this film also entice the baby boomers to watch this film. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is another popular actors who the baby boomers enjoy watching. The film is just under 2 hours and provides an evening of Hitchcock entertainment. The plot holds your interest. However, it is the beautiful shades of gray and white which determine the film's artistry. Alfred Hitchcock's genius of directing makes every one of his films to be at the least entertaining. A good night of entertainment is provided by the movie with Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine as a bonus. Since I am a baby boomer, I give it 5 thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed this film years ago and had forgotten the entire story and this time I enjoyed a great deal than the first time. Maybe I was disappointed at the ending and fooled by the way Alfred Hitchcock twisted my thinking. Cary Grant, (Johnnie Aygarth) played the role of a complete playboy who falls in love with monkey face, a nickname he called Joan Fontaine, (Lina McLaidlaw Aygarth) his wife who he met on a train and borrowed money her for his fare on the train. Nigel Bruce, (Gordon Cockrane) gave an outstanding performance as a light headed good old chap as the British would have called him. There are times when you become quite alarmed by the behavior of Johnnie Aygarth as a wild gambling fool who never could hold a job. This is a great classic masterpiece from 1941.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseless Suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The weakest Hitch I've seen so far. Everything seems to be so shallow in this one, from the start till the end. The actions and behaviour of Lina and Beaky with Johnny are hardly believable to be human. It seemed that one minute more and Lina would write on her forehead "Hello, I Am A Complete Cuckoo Trying Hard To Believe In Every Word Of My Adorable Hubby, Though Constantly Being Doubtful".I guess it might be a typical average viewer-indulgent Hollywood flick from the 40s, even its "black" ending was rewritten because the viewers "would not believe that Cary Grant could be a murderer". What is left to say about traditionally weak and nauseating for Hitch's films romantic line, and the thrill which is almost absent here. A Hitch-and-miss affair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boggy Creek was better than this boring fluff...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my girlfriend watch at least 2 or 3 movies a day. Before i suggested we watch Suspicion we watched The Legend of Boggy Creek for few laughs. Well after wasting 100 minutes of my life on this Archie Leech snooze-fest i came to realise i'd rather watch a hillbilly on the toilet get attacked by a sasquatch all day then suffer through this shat again. This has to be Alfred Hitchcocks most boring film. I also found it amusing in the extras that Hitch thought the title suggestion suspicion was "trashy". That from the man that brought you the title "PSYCHO" lol. I bet audiences moaned and groaned at the lame ending as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concept spoiled by implausibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is unique in films of Hitchcock's that I've seen, in that I didn't really enjoy it.In fact, I actually found this quite predictable and annoying.Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newly married couple. He's the kind of "lovable rogue" character that you've seen in many films, without ever being lovable as far as I am concerned!In fact, it was a barely believable relationship at best, and at times seemed particularly false and implausible.Unable to hold down a job and trying to live an opulent lifestyle, Grant is led to borrow money that he cannot pay back.Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is insured for; and presumably what her late father was worth.Average and rather uninteresting all round actually, but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock mystery that lacks energy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Fontaine is swept off her feet by the suave Cary Grant. After their marriage, she realizes that her husband is very irresponsible and owes a major gambling debt. It appears that Grant tries to scheme his best friend, Nigel Bruce, out of part of his life savings. Bruce ends up murdered and Fontaine suspects that her husband will try to kill her for the insurance money. This drama drags on to an abrupt and flat finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>suitable for intellectual games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler warning!!!This is probably my least favourite Cary Grant film. I spent most of the time thinking: ignore him, leave him etc. Is he trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he persuades her to return home with him, that he will kill her after all? I see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers/critics have taken. Finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book, than to change the ending - and this is a more unreasonable change of ending than, for example, in Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's murderous habits are not mentioned) the book's ending is not definitely ruled out.In Robin Wood's Hitchcock's Films Revisited, he writes: "As one mentally 'swiches' from ending to ending , the significance of every scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion of the fiction's 'reality' disintegrates, the film becomes a 'modernist' text in which the process of narrative is foregrounded." I enjoy playing intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else, but unless the film stands on a straightforward reading, then it fails. This one fails. Even after considering the fatal glasses of milk that recur in a few Hitchcock films.An annoying quibble. The year is 1941. Nothing in the film says that it is set in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a Paris Bank, and goes there to do financial business? Does he not know that there is a war on? Indeed, were there still any flights from Croydon airport? Is he on good terms with the Nazis? How come it is never suggested that the Germans shot him as a spy or something.A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, the mystery writer, and her brother, the pathologist, there is a fifth person present, who is never explained nor introduced - a woman in a tuxedo. The credits say that she is Nondas Metcalf playing Phyllis Swinghurst. Is this not an example of how lesbians were coded in '40s films? Are we to take her as Isobel's lover? The books that discuss overt and hidden gays/lesbians in Hitchcock (e.g. Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar Meller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plots like this were a staple of English theatre between the wars. Act 1: Good-looking charmer meets na?ve spinster, sweeps her off her feet and marries her. Act 11: She realizes he hasn't got change of a match and negatives begin to pile up. Act 111: By now the mounting evidence against him can't be ignored and she realizes he has to kill her yo maintain his lifestyle. Ah, but not so fast, Inspector. This is 1941 and audiences won't sit still for a larcenous Cary Grant so let's bring in the switcheroo; it's all in the mind, Cary wasn't trying of off Joan, it was all a bad dream - to say nothing of a bad movie. At one point Grant even echoes a film he made with Katie Hepburn a few years earlier. In Holiday, his character feels that people should live life backwards, have lots of fun while they're young enough to enjoy it and then, in middle age, buckle down to serious work. Here, of course, Grant leaves out the part about work, let's just have a good time at someone else's expense till the jig is up. Don't bother with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently viewed "Suspicion" for the first time, and I must say I was disappointed. This is through no fault of Alfred Hitchcock or the film's cast, but instead to the studio for changing the ending due to production codes. The ending just doesn't fit the story. The plot keeps building itself up, but it fails to deliver in the end. I was really disappointed, and I hope that one day, a re-edited version will surface. Overall Grade: C Ms. Fontaine: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Period Piece Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh does this film seem dated! The two lead characters, Johnnie (Cary Grant) and Lina (Joan Fontaine), are old fashioned and somewhat locked into antiquated ways of thinking and behaving. Period piece costumes and sets convey a musty look. Music, especially in the first half, consists largely of traditional dance numbers and waltzes. And the B&amp;W cinematography, with its frequent use of rear screen projection, cements the oldness of the film's cinematic style. We can't really fault the film for any of this. But contemporary viewers may find that the look and feel detracts from the story. I certainly did.Johnnie and Lina meet on a train. Later they embark on a romance, and while the film is touted as a "mystery" or "thriller", it's more of a love story/melodrama combo, especially during the first hour. Johnnie is something of a rogue. His inner nature is ambiguous. At times he seems innocent and loving. At other times, he seems more like a scoundrel with a hidden agenda. Lina, who is set to inherit a lot of money, is fragile and vulnerable, provincial, and sometimes suspicious. Indeed, the story's theme can rightly be regarded as paranoia, from Lina's POV. Suspense or "mystery" doesn't really enter the film until well after the midpoint plot turn.I couldn't identify with, or get interested in, either of the two leads. Again, maybe that's because I'm not one for traditional melodramas set in the 1940s. I disliked the "Beaky" character (Nigel Bruce) intensely; he was a bumbling figure inserted apparently for comic relief, but I found him merely ridiculous and out of place. The mystery writer, Isobel, was rather more interesting.The film's controversial ending had no effect on me at all. Not having any interest in either Johnnie or Lina, I really could not have cared less how the story ended.I can see how this film might appeal to some viewers, if they are older, or if they like love stories, or are fans of Cary Grant or Joan Fontaine. Otherwise, for "mystery" lovers, other Hitchcock films are so much better than this one.</fullReview>
