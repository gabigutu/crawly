		<shortDescription>Iconoclastic sixties merriment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did have high expectations going into this film, being a fan of Cook and Moore through what is available of "Not Only But Also", and several other Cook projects like the superb collaboration with Chris Morris, "Why Bother?" The expectations were largely fulfilled when I got to see this film, via a rare showing on Channel 4 this last April, as a tribute to Dudley Moore. The remake with Liz Hurley in place of Cook (how crass and thoughtless a piece of casting? They should really have discarded the title "Bedazzled" and just made it a Faust update, and not made any association with the Pete n' Dud film) is of course an irrelevance, and it is truly emblematic of our culture that it has received so many more IMDb votes than this original.This film succeeds where "The Hound of the Baskervilles", a later Cook-Moore vehicle, abysmally fails. "Bedazzled" contains the essence of their comedic appeal, rooted as it is in errant taboo-breaking and gleeful absurdism. The strong guiding influence of Cook is in the script, which he had strong control over, by all accounts. The concept is a modern spin on the Faustian legend, based in 1960s London (amongst diversions!). "Bedazzled", with this scenario and its effective portrayal, is thus most winning when compared to both concept and execution in "The Hound of the Baskervilles"' lamentable case.We have Pete n' Dud centre stage, and both at their comedic peak. Moore as a hapless, beleaguered little chap, and Cook as a matter-of-fact, mischievous, cunning and charming devil. A devil called Mr George Spiggott, bizarrely! :-) The other turns are good, and merely complementary, with the various sins portrayed pretty well. Eleanor Bron is reasonable as the malleable (according to the wishes) but essentially quite undeveloped love interest of Moore's. Not that this particularly matters in a comedy such as this; and her hair is eye catching. :-)The brazenly literal cameo from Raquel Welch is something of a scream I must say; no pretence at her being anything else, which I presume there has been in other Welch movies of the period.The various segments in this episodic film, are perhaps variable in their quality, but none are poor. The episodic nature of the film really does work in its favour keeping it fresh, but having the wonderful London linking sequences the heart of the film. It gets most amusing as Cook's devil repeatedly outwits Moore and finds loopholes in his wishes to downright exploit. The "happy family and home life" wish is really quite bizarre and almost disturbing in its oddness, while maybe the "rich" one slightly overdoes Bron's bumptious ultra-sexuality, even if the whole segment works very well. The "leaping nuns" part is prime "Not Only But Also" in its hushed absurdity and is a joy. The art direction and music aspects are notably good, embellishing the film and drawing out its sixties context. This film has not and can not date, as it is all so tastefully achieved and its technical grasp never exceeds its reach.The whole film I feel, works excellently, with dashes of irony and an effective restating of the Faustian morals. There is an engaging melancholy to this film, below its comedic surface. The scene of the old woman being fobbed off by Cook is briefly poignant and suggestive of a whole society's delusion. The scenes as Cook effectively knocks on the door of Heaven feel slightly sombre to me, as well as oddly comic. There are some quite thoughtful scenes of dialogue as well, with the droll Cook in his element, perched atop a postbox. Of course, the depressing outcomes of each wish for Moore's character, only add to the slightly prickly, problematic mood that underlies the film. The whole thing ends on a very apposite note, I should add with a glint in my eye.I loved watching this film, and while I doubt it could quite be labelled a fully-formed "masterpiece", it is a startlingly good evocation of the 1960s in a way... and also very much an amusing, clever comedy, with the subversive spirit of Peter Cook stamped all over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clever and classy treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bedazzled", mainly because it's not available on DVD (and even VHS in the UK), has become something of a cult in recent years. This is also due to the simple fact that its a very good film, a very mannered and well-crafted high concept flick.Dudley Moore and Peter Cook were still friends in 1967. They were two of British TV's most feted stars, and had also enthusiastically appeared together in a few ensemble comedy films. They were no slouches when it came to their first feature either. Stanley Donen was brought in a director, Cook toiled over the witty script, Moore did the perky score."Bedazzled" is slightly dated and is quite an uncommercial product overall, but its still a clever and interesting film. It doesnt deliver bellylaughs, but it is pretty thought-provoking and intelligent. There's funny one-liners ("Yes, Irving Moses-the fruitier etc), totally original ideas (the animated fly sequence, Raquel Welsh as Lust), slapstick stuff and a top pop parody with Cook as the indifferent "Drimble Wedge".The pathos and sadness underpinning the movie is perhaps best summed up with the conned old lady's "Goodbye" as the Eyewash men leave. "Bedazzled" is very British and very 60s, but it still a well-made and well-acted fantasy, much better than the silly 2000 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cooke and Moore were possibly the finest comedians the UK has ever produced before Python and others followed Pete and Dud were the undisputed kings of the new cutting edge of comedy/satire in the UK.But always just under the surface (and later out in the open) there was a sadness and dis-satisfaction to both Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore and I think some of that shows up in this film. Think of the old lady taken for all her money by the Devil and the cheery goodbye she still manages. Also part of the film seems to be dealing with the moral flexibility of people given their circumstance.Stanley Moon (Moore) has limited opportunities as a short order cook all he desires is the love of Margaret one of the waitresses at the Wimpy he works in. But he is a good person, when after a botched suicide attempt he sells his soul to the devil (Cooke) he has all the opportunities in the world but it is easier for the devil to corrupt him.Throughout the seven wishes (in accordance with 7 the mystic number, 7 days of the week, 7 deadly sins, 7 brides for 7 brothers..)Stanley can only think of his own needs and perhaps this is why they fail to make him happy. On his one opportunity to give a wish away to stop one of the devils petty tricks (sending a swarm of bee's to harass some flower children) he refuses saying 'Their mine and iv'e only got four left!' The other main theme of this film is more to the forefront dealing with Cooke and Moores attitudes towards religion and it's place in what at the time was the modern world. People were beginning to come away from the church and for the first time non-believers were becoming the majority. Part of the film lampoons religion particularly the bouncing nuns, but at the end it's god who wins out over the devil all be it by a technicality. In a way they showed the obvious contradictions and flaws in the Christian faith - religion nice idea but surely it cant be that way? If all of the above makes this film sound heavy going be assured it's not, and where as in others hands it may have become a pretentious mess it becomes a light hearted very funny comedy romp. If you just want a laugh on a Saturday night this will provide it, if you want to look deeper in and start divining meaning from every little aspect you can it's that sort of film.Highly recommended 9/10 NOTE - AVOID THE REMAKE LIKE THE PLAGUE IT'S Awful</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really is that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched it again and this time I get it. Thirty-four years ago the script was over my head and I missed most of the double entendres. 1967 was a greatyear for them as censorship had just been slackened. The pop star sequence is in fuzzy black and white because it's supposed to be on TV - yes, that's what it used to look like. (Did people really dance like that?)The script is brilliant but sometimes the delivery is so throw-away the jokes are missed. Maybe as Peter Cook wrote them he didn't think they neededunderlining. For example, when Stanley borrows George's red nightshirt andsays something like "Does it really suit me? Red's not my colour, I'm usually more conservative." Red for socialism, blue for the conservative party. George's red socks were sported by Labour voters well into the conservative 70s and80s.Little things you may not know: Victorian nightshirts and long-legged bathing suits were a fad in 1967. George and Stanley when being themselves speak inworking class accents (unlike God). Dudley really was working class, unlikePeter Cook.RIP to both. Let's eat a bowl of raspberries and cream in their memories. xxxxxxxxxxx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does the devil bear the face of Peter Cook?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my personal favorites. Stanley Moon (Dudley Moore), a down-and-out Londoner who has a miserable job at the local Wimpy Burgers and has the hots for a beautiful waitress named Margaret Spencer, tries to hang himself, but then the Devil has to come in and save him. The Devil (played by Peter Cook) isn't all red and horned, but dressed in a nice tuxedo and wears Ray-Bans. He is interested in Stanley for the sole fact that George (the name he goes by) made a deal with God to get a hundred billion souls first before the other. In exchange for his soul, Stanley gets seven wishes, and of course George has to twist them all into nightmares, just for a cheap laugh. ("You just left me one little loophole. I had to take advantage of it, doctor's orders!") One of my favorite scenes is where Stanley and George are passing by as police officers, and with the snap of George's fingers parking meters expire, old ladies' grocery bags tear apart, and fires start in trash bins. Definitely a good movie if it's rainy outside, and you're all depressed -- it'll lift you up in no time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hip comedy that gets better every time you see it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the 2000 remake of Bedazzled for the same reason I never did see the Psycho remake - why mess with something so good?Dudley Moore as a short-order cook leading a life of quiet desperation and Peter Cooke as the Devil team-up to deliver an extremely funny movie with surprisingly deep theological commentary. The Theodicy, the nature of sin and repentance, and other interesting topics are discussed and explored.The first time I saw this movie I liked the offbeat humor (If you like Monty Python you will like this movie as well). However, I liked it better the second time I saw it and liked it even more the third time around, etc. So the first you see it you may give it a 7, the second time an 8 and by the third time it will rate a 9 or 10! I actually would give it a 9.5.Speaking of a 10, Raquel Welch is appropriately cast for this movie! Some other classic comedies I really like are the Pink Panther Movies, Arsenic and Old Lace (Cary Grant), A New Leaf (Walter Matthau) Dr. Strange Love, Pillow Talk (Doris Day/Rock Hudson),etc. IMHO, Bedazzled belongs in this company.Unfortunately, it is only out on VHS, but I like this movie enough that I will buy the DVD when it comes out. (Note: it is now available on DVD and I did buy it!)It would probably would rate a PG or PG-13 because of appropriately sexually explicit content - a funny seduction scene and some very brief nudity (movie would be fine without it, but it is extremely brief). The movie pokes fun at religiosity. Which might offend some religious people. But if you are a person of faith who doesn't take yourself too seriously, you will find this to be a good watch and you might get an interesting discussion or two out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching for Bedazzled (1967)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first bought this movie on VHS in 1983 as an ex rental from a garage, if it wasn't worn out then it certainly is now and I probably remember every line in the movie, but for some reason I have spent the whole evening searching for a copy I can buy to enjoy it again.The movie is a gem incomparable to the 2000 effort.Why is the movie so good? I believe the secret to the movie is that they played themselves, Cooke cruel, but humorous, arrogant, intelligent but tragic, Moore full of good intention, seemingly one step behind, but with the brighter future; the combination is gripping.At the end of it all, as in life Cooke is exposed as being slightly more fragile than he gives on and an unlikely bond appears to have developed between the two.I was reassured to hear the 60's critics found the movie bland and questioned Cooke's acting ability. Cooke's genius was non-conformity and the movie is full of it, trampolining Nuns, a hypnotically haunting Pop song, thought controlled pigeons, unforgivable abuse of kind old ladies and all captured in a cinematographic magic as were "the Prisoner" and "The Avengers" and which can never be recreated by a sequel.There are so many great asides, lines and scenes, that to mention one or the other does not do justice; it is the wealth of colourful detail in the scenes, the events, the characters and the script. This movie certainly isn't "bland", "bland" is Cooke's appearance in the "One foot in the Algarve" episode and if there is any movie to best remind us why the pairing had a hint of genius this is it.I hope I manage to find a copy to buy in the UK, but am also grateful that it is hard to get my hands on one. This movie like my "Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" or "Queen 1" LP is that much more enjoyable because it is mine and not the property of mainstream commercialisation ... However be sure you see it at least once when you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you see only one Dudley Moore film, make it this one!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen the Brendon Frazer / Liz Hurley version of "Bedazzled" I beg of you to check out the original version. Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, an already famous comedy team brought their expertise to this film, a reworking of the Faust legend.Moore plays Stanley Moon, a grill cook at the Whimpy Burger, who is in love with Margaret Spencer (Eleanor Bron), a waitress there. When his attempt to go and ask for a date is thrarted by his own hesitation, he decides to end it all.Enter George Spiggot a.k.a. The Devil (Peter Cook) who tells Stanley that he can be with Margaret, in exchange for his soul. Stanley agrees, and the rest of the film showcases Stanley's wishes and that there is no such thing as a sure thing.The chemistry between Cook and Moore shows through as their script demonstrates. Bron is wonderful as Margaret, and Stanley Donen's direction only accents the well written script.The only other big name in the supporting cast, Raquel Welch, projects sheer sexuality as Lilian Lust, the sexpot of the Seven Deadly Sins.Concerning the remake, I wish it were more like the plotline of the original, because I think that Liz Hurley would have made a terrific Lilian Lust. Watch the two versions and you'll see.All in all, you can't go wrong with the original. Check it out and enjoy.P.S. Julie Andrews!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit dated sometimes, but still very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the Hollywood remake of this movie a few years ago. I don't remember much about it, except for the fact that I wasn't really convinced by it. This evening however I saw the original version and I really liked it. Yes, it looks a little bit dated and the acting may not be the best you've ever seen, but the story is nice and timeless. It's about a man who is afraid to ask the girl of his dreams out for a date. In return for his soul the devil promises him to help him. He sells his soul and he gets 7 wishes. Of course the devil always knows how to fool the man by making his wishes not coming true the way he had imagined it.I had a good time watching it and I really had a few good laughs. The humor may look a little bit innocent by today's standards, but I still prefer this kind of humor over what is considered as humor today by some (a man running with a dead deer around his body, getting hit by a truck for instance - part in Tom Green's Freddy Got Fingered). You may call me old fashioned (even though I'm only 26 years old), but sometimes I prefer the old kind of humor over the new kind.Overall this movie looks a bit dated from time to time, but don't let that be a reason not to watch this movie. I'm quite sure you'll enjoy it. I did and I give it a 7.5/10 for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bedazzled just gets better as the years go by, and especially after the fiasco of the Liz Hurley remake. This version was written by and stars Pete 'n' Dud, with Eleanor Bron as the soppy Margaret Spencer, waitress at Wimpy's, Barry Humphries (otherwise known as Dame Edna) as Envy, Raquel Welch as Lilian Lust ... through its segments relating to Stanley's wishes (the 'sophistate', the millionaire, the pop star, the fly on the wall, the leaping nun ...) it scores points on every level, as well as reflecting the time - the pop star segment is very Ready, Steady, Go, George Spiggott's club (like Cook's in real life but hopefully the real one was less sleazy), and of course, the depressing town street burger bar. It is a very funny film and a good vehicle for the leads (their other teaming in Hound of the Baskervilles misfired badly). And it is directed by Stanley Donen, who was partly responsible for a string of MGM movie musicals with Gene Kelly in the 1950s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not even going to discuss the movie at length - it's brilliantly funny; see it. I'll admit I DID have an additional comment or two to make, but then I read these IMDb reviews and sank into depression.Do the people who "critique" 30, 40, 50-year-old movies by pointing out that "duhh, it's DATED!" imagine they're applying some kind of rigorous critical standard? Why not simply save valuable time, and pixels, by submitting a "review" stating, "This film cannot overcome the handicap of not taking place in 2003. Where are the SUVs? Where are the cell phones? And why wasn't it shot on the street where I live?"And I'm fairly sure the guy who complained of the "snotty English accents" that ruined his BEDAZZLED viewing experience is the same fellow who lives in the White House and coined "strategery".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great satirical comedy (even considering who made it)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Partial spoiler. One great thing about it, apart from the actors themselves, is the actual friendship that arises between the Devil and the "Faust" character (Cook and Moore). It seems that, in almost any other "Faust" story (obviously dramas, but comedies too), this would be just another trick used by the Devil to get the character's confidence. But in Bedazzled, it seems to be more or less completely real. And when George grants Stanley each of his seven wishes, but sabotages each one because of some loophole Stanley left in, he makes it clear that it's his job to do so. And in the next-to-last part, when all the wishes have gone badly, and George still has Stanley's soul, Stanley, instead of being bitter, thanks George for at least giving him a chance (which is a pretty original thing to include in a story like this- again, even a comedy).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rejoice! Rejoice! It's out on DVD as of this week!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely the finest fruit of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's comedy partnership, one of the funniest films ever made, and one of my all-time favourite films ever. It's been unavailable for years, with crappy old commercial VHS copies with the soundtrack hanging off changing hands for silly money (I taped mine off the TV like everyone else.) But now it's out on DVD! As of this week (end of July '05). I haven't bought one yet but I'm sure I will. I hope there are some nice extras. But the film itself is an absolute joy. So it was made on the cheap, so the production values are utterly 60s generic, so the sets were banged together with spit and sawdust - who cares when Peter Cook is just the best devil you could ever imagine, when the jokes are that thick and fast and that good, when Dudley Moore is the perfect hapless foil, when his music is so memorable, when Raquel Welch is such a good sport as Lillian Lust ("pick yer clothes up Lily, you're due down at the Foreign Office").Now to complete my joy, they have to withdraw and destroy all copies and prints of the hideous Liz Hurley re-make which must NEVER, EVER be confused with this timeless gem which has given me and so many friends and acquaintances so much pleasure for so many years.Watch it and when you've finished laughing (and thinking - after all, it is a perfectly plausible version of the Faust legend) raise a glass to the genius that was Peter Cook at his best (and this IS Peter Cook at his best) and to the beauty of his absurdly unlikely partnership with a sharp witted, sad-faced jazz piano player who was half his size and who went on to be perhaps the unlikeliest Hollywood movie star of them all. They're both gone, but in this perfect little film they will always be with us to mock us for our absurd vanities and follies, to make us laugh and think and feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never remake a perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full of social and commercial satire, as well as broad comedy, this movie not only combines a sharp wit with broad laughs, but it does so with, deep at heart, a sense of moral outrage. This is a movie made when it was still possible to look askance at the proliferation of junk culture. It contrasts with the 2000 remake (which is more concerned with product placements than with the cultural pollution of fast food and concrete)and proves again that Hollywood is insane for its new fascination with remaking perfect films.The 1967 "Bedazzled" retells Faust, but it does so with an abiding suspicion of wishes, romance, and the arbitrariness of power. When Peter Cook plays Mephistopholes, he does it with not only an urbanity that would make Goethe or Marlowe proud, but with an absurdity that contemporary viewers are likely to see as a precursor to Monty Python. They shouldn't. Cook's devil is playing a game. His devil is warm, caring, amused, and yet indifferent to the exercise of power and the tortures of the damned.All of this, and it's a wonderful comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faust-with a Swinging London 1967 twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it years ago when it first arrived on US drive-in screens. Didn't play well here at the time, this was pre-Monty Python days. The Britsh music invasion was on but the Brit comedy rage hadn't yet started. Think Monty Python meets Shakespeare with a touch of Noel Coward dryness and you have the texture and hilarity of this film. A good natured but on target jab at Christianity and religious politics in general and a good lesson in self appreciation. Cook's the smart assed devil who actually has some legitimate beefs towards the Allmighty. Dud's the poor schmuck who's getting devoured by his own timid nature and the world around him in general. They become good friends with only one problem. Ownership of Dud's soul. The one liner gags are terrific and more often than not they are dead on target. This isn't just a funny movie, it's a very smart film. Like the Python films that would come some time later it's a clever film with an edge that cuts into the nature and common fears found within the cultures that have sprung up within the boundaries of Western Christian Civilization. It will no doubt offend some, if not many, and will delight others. This has been one of my own all time favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite comedies. It never fails to amuse me, particularly the scene where Peter Cook/Satan is on his postbox explaining his fall from grace. Who else can explain so well why they would want to leave heaven? My other favorite scene is the very last one, where the Devil leaving Wimpy Burger and telling God that he is going to fill the world so full of strip malls, Wimpy Burgers, expressways, etc, that even God will be ashamed of it.That comment was made almost forty years ago and its almost scary how prophetic it was!And, of course, "You fill me with inertia" is a great comedic line delivered with style by Peter Cook.

		<shortDescription>Moore, Moore, Moore- How do you like it, How do you like it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bedazzled" is the rare comedy that's imperfections are due to it's creators cramming too many good, funny ideas into it. It's also exceptional for being an excellent, colorful, brilliantly written and directed comedy that stars the normally irritating Dudley Moore. Here he plays a depressed short order cook madly in love with the waitress at his work place.He can't find the courage to talk to her, so he tries hanging himself but screws it up. The dashing Prince of Darkness enters, played by Moore's better half, his comedy partner Peter Cook. The devilish Cook offers Moore seven wishes in exchange for his soul, and Moore cautiously accepts. This leads to a fun, funny, at times surreal farce packed with great dialog and a twist (and twisted) ending involving nuns on trampolines.The wish sequences, which place Moore in various situations and personas that eventually end up in Cook's favor, are little more than sketches that poke fun at intellectuals, the upper class, pop culture fads, and other social mores. They are funny, but many seem dated and overlong. They soon become tedious distractions from the best parts of the movie, the segments in between the wishes in which the extremely funny Cook steals the show as the unsympathetic, deadpan devil who calmly strolls about creating havoc and tempting people- and pigeons- to sin. His incompetent staff consists of the seven deadly sins, fleshed out by actors, including "Lillian Lust, the Babe with the Bust", played by a yummy Raquel Welch. These scenes are hilarious and at times even thought provoking, with various ideas and jokes about religion and the nature of good and evil. Like Monty Python's "Life of Brian" and Kevin Smith's "Dogma", this movie makes pokes fun at Christianity without being disrespectful or controversial, but unlike Dogma it is never overly preachy. The ideas don't get in the way of the jokes.Towards the end of the movie and attempt is made to give it a plot, with a bet between God and the devil to see who can collect more souls. This should've been the main story of the movie. Cook's devil should have been the main character, with Moore as the last soul he needs to corrupt to gain entry back into heaven. But as it stands this interesting tale becomes just another subplot that doesn't quite come off, just like the pointless scenes concerning a dotty police officer investigating Moore's attempted suicide.So while "Bedazzled" may not be a flawless piece of movie making, it is still a great, one-of-a-kind comedy that stands as one of the funniest movies ever made. It's certainly the best movie Dudley Moore has ever been involved with, not to put down "Santa Claus: The Movie" too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched Bedazzled again last week, for the umpteenth time. And no matter how many times I watch this film, I crack up. There are so many hysterical lines and humorous visual gags...I just can't praise it enough!IMHO, the best moments in the film occur not during the "7 wishes" sequences, but during the conversations between Stanley Moon and the Devil:Stanley: "You're a nut-case! You're a bleedin' nut-case!" Devil: "They said the same about Freud, Einstein and Gallileo." Stanley: "They said it about a lot of nut-cases, too!" Devil: "You're not as dumb as you look, are you Stanley?""So you really are the Devil." "Incarnate."Devil: "Well, for one thing, he's (God) omni-present. That only means he's everywhere, all the time. I'm just highly maneuverable." Stanley: "So he's here in the van right now?" Devil: "He's in the van, he's in the can, he's in the trees, he's in the breeze, he's in your hair, he's everywhere. There's no privacy for anybody. [glaring upwards, to God:] GET OUT! Get out of here while we're changing our clothes!" Stanley: "You won't get anywhere shouting at him, you know." Devil: "You're right; I should take the humble approach. [gazing upward, to God] "Excuse me your ineffable hugeness; would you mind stepping out of the van for a moment while we miserable worms get our drawers on?" Stanley: "I can't say you sounded too sincere, mate." [Devil kicks Stanley in the butt] Stanley: "Hey! What are you on about?" Devil: "I just wanted to give him a turn. I saw him nestling in your trousers."Dudley Moore is the perfect loser nebish, and Peter Cook perfectly devilish as the unholy one.Ok, I'll stop now. Maybe one can see a film too many times. However, in the future, I will continue to dig out my videotape of Bedazzled a couple times a year, and wish that someone today would make funny, intelligent movies like this (actually, "Dogma" is pretty good, too. Another take on the whole god-thing. A fun double feature!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Say the magic words - Julie Andrews!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 'Beyond The Fringe', Peter Cook and Dudley Moore - along with Alan Bennett and Jonathan Miller - helped define 1960's comedy. They were a classic comedy duo - Cook was tall, witty and handsome, Dudley short, musically gifted and lovable. They progressed to television - the wonderful B.B.C.-2 show 'Not Only But Also' - and finally into films. After appearing in Bryan Forbes' 'The Wrong Box' in which they played greedy, grasping brothers, they landed their own movie, directed by Stanley Donen, known mainly for musicals such as 'Singing In The Rain'.'Bedazzled' is a comic version of the Faust legend. Moore is 'Stanley Moon', short order cook in a London Wimpy bar, who is suicidally depressed because he feels his life is going nowhere. He even lacks the courage to ask the flighty waitress whom he is obsessed with - Margaret Spencer ( Eleanor Bron ) - out on a date. Salvation arrives in the cloaked shape of a mysterious stranger by the unlikely name of George Spiggot ( Peter Cook ). Spiggot is The Devil, and in return for Stanley's soul gives him seven wishes.In the first, Moon is a Welsh intellectual who tries to sweep Margaret off her feet ( and into his bed ) with clever talk. She cries 'Rape'! In the second, he is a millionaire who lavishes expensive presents on Margaret, to whom he is now married. But she is openly sleeping with everyone except him. The third wish sees him as a pop star whom the whole world adores. Alas newcomers 'Drimbl Wedge &amp; The Vegetation' are on the same programme, and Margaret transfers her hero worship to them. The fourth wish occurs when Stanley innocently wonders what Margaret is currently up to. He and Spiggot transform into flies who buzz around a morgue. The fifth has Stanley and Margaret passionately in love. But she is happily married to the too-good-to-be-true Peter. Stanley details his sixth wish carefully. There must be no men in Margaret's life. He forgets to specify the sex and is turned into a nun! Which means he has one wish left. Or does he?Though regarded now as a classic cult comedy, the film was a box office failure in its day. Pete and Dud had many fans, obviously not enough to make the film a hit. The late Harry Thompson - Cook's biographer - thinks British audiences were disappointed not to see the duo's cloth-capped characters in the film. While undeniably amusing, I do not think they would have worked on the big screen. In America, the advertising mistakenly overemphasised Raquel Welch's contribution - she is in it for all of three minutes. 'Bedazzled' opened when the popularity of British comedies was in decline, with only the 'Carry On' series and all-star romps such as 'Monte Carlo Or Bust' ( featuring Pete and Dud, incidentally ) keeping the genre afloat.Donen does not try to smother Cook's witty script with superfluous visual touches. Another director probably would have. The episodic plot is kept well under control. Sadly, he never worked with Pete and Dud again. The name 'Stanley Moon' came from Sir John Gielgud, incidentally, while 'George Spiggot' was the Moore character in the celebrated 'One Leg Too Few' sketch in 'Not Only But Also'. Another recycled idea was the leaping nuns. Dudley Moore wrote the wonderful soundtrack.Often overlooked when assessing this film is Eleanor Bron, playing multiple versions of her character. Not only is she beautiful but a marvellous comedy actress. Two years before she had appeared as a Kali Priestess in The Beatles movie 'Help!'. Funniest moment? Too many to name. Wish No.3 superbly sends up 'Ready, Steady Go' but it is Wish No.5 that never fails to make me cry with laughter. Stanley and Margaret desperately want to commit adultery, but cannot because their mutual admiration for her husband is too great! One of the funniest motion pictures of all time. Watch it and treat yourself to a Frobisher &amp; Gleason Raspberry Flavoured Ice Lolly at the same time, folks!In 2000, Liz Hurley and Brendan Fraser starred in a remake, which was okay but not a patch on the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious comedy that must annoy quite a few people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rather subversive little (slightly black) comedy, but not because of its support for hippies, but due to its demolishing of what constitutes the essence of Christian belief. The movie is at its best not during the materialization of Dudley's seven (well, six) wishes but during all the segments in-between. The dialogue between Dudley and Satan in these scenes is what won me over, and it's during these bits that Christianity, and religious belief in general perhaps, is taken apart with obvious joy by the writer. The mockery might be too subtle for the dimmer viewers, hence a believer of lower intelligence could enjoy "Bedazzled" without getting annoyed or upset. Although, a remark such as the one about a priest being "on our side" (Satan) might be a little too direct, and might reveal the film-makers' intentions even to the very unobservant viewer. Either way, I can imagine that the movie must have upset quite a few people back in the day.The great irony, of course, is that this movie's portrayal and description of God is very accurate, i.e. quite in accordance with how He comes off in the Great Book. A point, however, that will be totally lost on (the more fanatical) believers.Dudley refers to hippies as "those wonderful flower people" right after Satan targets them with a prank. What can one say to that? This was 1967, after all, an extremely naive and (comparatively) innocent period in the history of Western civilization. For all intents and purposes - at least to the lazier and more optimistic minds living at that time - hippies might have appeared to be that which they hypocritically tried to make everyone believe they were. If the movie had been intellectually fool-proof, which it isn't unfortunately but predictably (very few are), instead of glorifying hippies it would have placed them firmly on Satan's side, due to their abundantly obvious (perhaps with a little hindsight) penchant for indulging in at least half of the Seven Deadly Sins: lust, vanity, and sloth. (Hey, nothing wrong with lust; I am merely using the movie's religious-based logic.) Speaking of which, Raquel Welch has a bit part as Devil's servant Lust. She seemed to be rather confused about the accent she was supposed to use. I could have sworn she started off with an English accent but then somehow managed to slip into a light Southern twang. The director Donen probably didn't even try to correct her; he must have figured there was no use, not in a million takes. Or perhaps he'd given up AFTER the million takes. When Dudley's head is shoved onto her ample bossom, that might have been the first ever film sequence with a man resting his head on a pair of fake breasts. Just a thought.There are nice little touches of insanity, such as the notion that the Devil had lost his touch somewhat, being reduced to performing minor acts of "sabotage" such as corrupting pidgens into crapping onto people's heads or performing trivial acts of fraud against little old ladies. Although the in-between segments are the funniest, there is much hilarity in some of the wish-segments too, the funniest being when Satan cons Dudley into becoming a lesbian nun. That entire monastery bit is the film's absolute highlight.What really makes this comedy work most, apart from a meticulously prepared script, is without a doubt Dudley's excellent, totally spot-on nailing of the character. He plays him perfectly. The way he looks at people, the way he talks, plus his mannerisms and body language, all these are ideal for the portrayal of this fairly dimwitted Joe Shmoe loser. Occasionally Dudley says something a little too intelligent for his character, but that's forgivable in a comedy, i.e. plot-devices that advance a joke or gag are acceptable even if they stray from the established logic somewhat.I haven't seen a comedy this funny in years (apart from "Borat" and "Bruno"), but I am not too surprised given that Stanley Donen directed it. He had actually managed to turn a MUSICAL into a funny movie years earlier with "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers", so if he could do that he could do a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bedazzled: Unwavering Brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had my view of what comedy is revolutionised by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore via the immortal Derek and Clive, I could not wait to check them out together in a film. When I finally got the chance to see Bedazzled, I was incredibly excited to see what the most ingeniously funny duo ever could offer in a cinematic medium.Moore plays Stanley Moon, a depressively lonely cook with a secret attraction to the waitress who rarely notices him. Deciding to finish himself once and for all, his suicide attempt is suddenly interrupted by the appearance of the mysterious George Spiggot. Soon after revealing himself to be Satan, Spiggot offers Moon seven wishes for the simple price of his soul.Perhaps half an hour into Bedazzled, I started to feel somewhat disappointed. Though I was being made to chuckle, the opportunities for such weren't quite as frequent or hilarious as I had hoped. My expectations looking dashed, I decided to sit back and enjoy the substandard(by the high standards of Cook/Moore, that is) level of comedy I was getting. Of course, it was mere moments later that I was howling with laughter, a particular scene reducing me to fitful tears and gasps for air amidst the unwavering brilliance of gag after gag. The unending hilarity of that scene, and indeed all that followed, had me questioning whether I had just been in a mood not conducive to comedy. Cook's script is teeming with deliciously subtle jokes: whether cunning double-entendres or simple gestures. The dialogue is incomparable, benefiting from the clear chemistry of the two. Spiggot's twisted realisations of Moon's wishes are brilliant in themselves, particularly the now famous Order of St Beryl scene. My huge enjoyment of perhaps the latter two thirds of the film has me eagerly awaiting the chance to see it again.Tremendously funny, Bedazzled is entirely worthy of its cult status. Managing to convince me despite my initial cynicism, I have no doubt that further viewings will provide the chance to catch the likely dozens of laughs I missed first time around. Everybody must watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fencing For Your Soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bedazzled finds Dudley Moore as a short order cook at a Wimpy's in London trying his best to score with the lovely Eleanore Bron who comes in every day for an order. He'll do just about any old thing to make it with her and when you say that, you know that old Scratch will come up from the bowels of the earth to offer you a deal for your soul.But Moore doesn't give up that easy in fact he worms seven different chances with this girl and as the devil his partner Peter Cook comes up with a loophole every time. I have to give Moore credit, he negotiates like a Philadelphia lawyer, but Cook is up to each and every one. The way he gets out of the seventh and last is one for the books.Starring along with Moore and Cook is the city of London in the Sixties when because of the Beatles it was the pop capital of the world. For those who want a look at London back in the day, Bedazzled is definitely the film for you.The only other American on this film besides director Stanley Donen is Raquel Welch who plays the deadly sin of lust personified. And I can't think of anyone better for that time period.There is some physical comedy in Bedazzled, but the real treat is watching Moore and Cook fence for Moore's soul. It's the Faust theme with a real comic twist. Tab Hunter should have only been this cagey with Ray Walston in Damn Yankees.Moore and Cook did quite a few films together before splitting in the late Seventies. Dudley Moore of course had far greater success as a single than Peter Cook did. Then again this side of the pond did not see that much of Cook. The team did a lot of British television together that we in America never were privileged to see. I'm told some of those programs are classic. Bedazzled is yet another classic for them that is available and should be looked at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the Peter Cook and Dudley Moore comedy series on television in London as a teenager.I saw the film when it first came out.I saw it again recently at home on DVD.It is a time capsule. After all those years it is still entertaining. The music, dialog and camera capture the spirit of the swinging 60's.My teenage daughter saw it and said it was cool.Well worth watching. Worth every penny.It is also a kind of historical document. Made at the peak of the post war economic boom. The Devil's night club is set in a part of London under demolition and redevelopment.Peter Cook plays the part of Lucifer admirably. Scratching the record is symbolic. The shoddy quality control of British manufacturers and the subsequent demise of the motor cycle, automobile and other industry.A lot of extremely valuable stuff in there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Sixties Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Cook and Dudley Moore were already well established comedians in Britain and in the UK with the famous revue "Beyond the Fringe" and the television series "Not Only... But Also...", when they made this comic take on the Faust legend.Dudley Moore is Stanley Moon, a short order cook hopelessly in love with the oblivious Margaret Spencer (Eleanor Bron). After a suicide attempt, Moon encounters the Devil, in the form of George Spiggott (Peter Cook) who offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul.The film is, at times, very funny and Moore and Cook have genuine charisma in their parts, however the film is overlong and some episodes outstay their welcome. It is also very dated now. One curious thing is that, instead of portraying the Devil as the personification of evil, the film presents him as basically a likable trickster.Not perfect, but worth watching for the genuinely funny moments and the huge charm of this film.</fullReview>

Dudley Moore and Peter Cook filled the film with sly jokes, many at religions expense and some quick one liners which always please. The film is never dull due to the many 'wish' scenarios which are short and diverse. Dudley Moore composed all the music which provides a catchy continuity throughout.For some reason you can buy Cook/Moore films such as Hound of Baskervilles on DVD but not this one !!I have never watched the new version and will probably keep it that way from what I've heard :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, Pre-Python Take on `Faust'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Bedazzled' is one of my all-time favorite films, and one that well deserves its `cult' status. Penned by the late, great Peter Cook, and co-starring his long-time partner, Dudley Moore (they performed together in `Beyond the Fringe,' `Not Only ? But Also,' and later, `Derek and Clive'), this film was made two years before that wacky, irreverent Python gang made their first BBC TV appearance as `Monty Python's Flying Circus' in 1969. Except for the dated 1960's soundtrack, one might have thought the timeline was the other way around. Of course, Cook, Cleese, et al were all influenced by the late 1950's `The Goon Show,' with Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe, and Michael Bentine ? the grandfather of what we think of as `zany British humor' today.Python/Goon comparisons aside, in `Bedazzled' Peter Cook is absolutely impeccable as George Spiggott, the red sock wearin', album scratchin', china breakin', last-page-of-the-mystery-novel removin', raspberry and cream scammin', pigeon poop sortie launchin' Devil. George is assisted by the somewhat less than competent Seven Deadly Sins incarnate (with the possible exception of Raquel Welch, who plays a minor, but over-hyped, role as `Lust'). George persuades dim-witted Wimpy Burger fry cook Stanley Moon (Dudley Moore) to sell him his soul, for the price of seven granted wishes. All poor Stanley wishes for is the love and affection of fellow Wimpy Burger employee Margaret Spencer (Eleanor Bron). But every time Stanley makes a wish, George always finds a loophole to spoil it, with hilarious results. The interaction between Cook and Moore, the Margaret-obsessed wishes that Stanley makes and the ways that George always thwarts them, the trivial but `wicked' things the Devil has to do on a daily basis (`it's my job'), and the sheer irreverence of it all, will have you rolling on the floor with laughter!Just remember, when everything seems to be going wrong, just blow a `raspberry'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie's okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that if you compare it to the remake then it would seem like the remake tried something new with it - so I will spend some of my review comparing what I can of this to the remake.First off Peter Cook REALLY got into the role of The Devil - it seems that through the writing it would be like he was more portraying a mischievous guy that can do magic other than Satan. Dudley Moore wasn't as good as Brendan Fraiser was - every wish that Dudley's character did almost was the exact same person whereas with Fraiser you can tell a huge difference in his characters at every turn.I have heard of where the jokes are still funny after decades, this is an example although I don't think I would be as amused if I was even alive at that time let alone saw it when it came out.I did like how the wishes were unpredictable of what the lead character chose - regardless of the fact that I saw the remake FIRST. Unlike the remake the best wish was the last one, I thought the trampoline act was bizarre - what made it bizarre for those who don't know was the fact that it takes place in a nunnery (how the wish went wrong was also disturbing and sick).But the question on everybody's mind is my opinion on "Is this better than the remake" the answer is "No" this certainly is not better but how can anybody compare this to it's remake - the remake is one of the few that brings new cards to the original concept yet doesn't destroy the original (or in other words the remake respects this) there are a few things wrong with both movies but no movie's perfect. I might offend people who like this and hate the remake (and vise versa) but this is all my opinion.Decent entertainment, remake is just as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a longtime fan of Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore, and was overjoyed when I found this out-of-print video at the video rental store. Now that I have finally seen it, I just wanted to make some comments.In its plus column, Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore are a great comedy team, and while their acting is a little bit more stilted in a film than it was in their television or stage shows, their interplay is still excellent. Their characters are very well developed. Cooke is not a two-dimensional devil, he's not entirely evil, just flawed. Also, its obvious that Moore has a lot of fun going into the different roles throughout the film.Also in the plus column, the story is very thought-provoking and intelligent. Most people describe it as "an exceptional re-working of the Faust legend" or words to that effect. As I have not read the story of Faust (nor do I really believe that most people who say that have), I can't honestly say. What I can say is that Cooke and Moore go into some fairly deep theological issues in a way that is WAY less heavy-handed than other films, such as "Dogma". In the minus column: there is something decidedly irritating about this movie. Partly it might be the way its filmed, or possibly that its pretty dated, or possibly its that even though the characters are well-developed, they are still very wooden. Parts of the movie are tedious. Dudley Moore's first wish is that he's an intellectual, and what ensues is a fifteen minute pseudo-intellectual conversation with his would-be girlfriend, that is excrutiating. The most I can say for it is that the movie does get better later on. Also, there is a scene done when Moore has wished to become a rock star that is thoroughly unenjoyable. For one thing, its filmed all in black and white (I would assume, to simulate the Ed Sullivan show, rather than due to lack of funds, like the movie "If..."), and there is a jerky quality about it as the POV keeps switching between adoring fans, and the view of the rock stars on TV monitors. It was not fun to watch and it was a little bit creepy. At any rate, the only other thing I had a problem with is that Raquel Welch got very high billing in this movie, and she is only in two scenes, and in one of them all she does is dance. To make a long story short, "Bedazzled" is a fun, somewhat dated movie, which, while tedious in parts, is generally quite entertaining and thought provoking and funny. If you can find it, you definately should rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dry and thoughtful comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a unique movie this is. Its comedy ranges from sharp, dry wit to flinch-worthy puns and lewd double-entendres, yet it's as often wistful as funny and as often thoughtfully theological as either. The obvious direct ancestor to "Dogma", it's dated surprisingly little for a film from the '60s. Moore is perfect for the role of Stanley Moon (a/k/a "Sister Luna"), who matures from mousy whining to thoughtful self-acceptance, but the real gem performance is that of Peter Cook as the Devil. You'll never see another Satan like this one: bored, lonely, reduced to creating minor annoyances like scratched records and prank phone calls, almost as sympathetic as he is irritating. No infernal grandeur or cosmic evil here, his worst threat to God at the end is simply to make the world ever more ugly, noisy and exasperating - the true hell-on-earth of the modern age. The relationship between him and Stanley is drawn out with great sympathy and skill. The balance of power between them gradually shifts from classic devil-and-minion to tentative friendship (thinking he lost his touch after inventing the Seven Deadly Sins in a one-day burst of brilliance, this Devil feels a real kinship with the hapless Moon) to a parting of the ways, in which Stanley rejects and beats the Devil in the only way that really works: calm, genuine moral strength earned through adversity and experience. The Prince of Darkness is shown to be a mere beggar at the door after all.---But this makes it sound like a comedy version of the "Prophecy" films, with which it has only a little in common (notably the idea that the fallen angels' deepest longing is for reunion with God, also seen in "Dogma"), and ignores the many parts of the movie that are just plain funny. My favorites here are the convent of the sublimely loopy Leaping Beryllians, the "flies on the wall" scene in the morgue, and the hilarious "pop star" segment. Complete with "Hullabaloo"/"Shindig" style camera-work, lighting, and go-go dancers, this includes a priceless turn by Cook as an existential pop idol who delivers an icy, monotone performance ("you fill me with inertia") dripping with ennui, and could even be called a presage of Goth bands (--hey, he sounds like Peter Murphy to *me*!=)I've got nothing against Brendan Fraser, but this movie just doesn't need to be remade. The 2000 version will have to go quite some distance to match it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least that's the way that the Devil ("(Lucifer)...'Bringer of the Light' it used to be. Sounded a little poufy to me.")put it when Stanley Moon (Dudley Moore) complained about George Spiggot's ("...another one of my earthly pseudonyms") meddling with his wishes.One of my all-time favorite movies. Stanley is mooning over Margaret Spencer, but she won't notice him. Along comes the Devil and he's got seven chances to win her love.Of course, the Devil does everything that he can to screw up Stanley's plans. Fortunately, Stanley can cancel his wish by "blowing his raspberry" -- the famous bi-labial fricative made with mouth and lips. Okay, fart sound.When he does so, he returns to wherever the Devil is. And he's usually up to some sort of mischief, like cutting the buttons off shirts and scratching records.Though we're rooting for Stanley, it's the Devil who gets all the good lines. In between wishes, he tells Stanley a bit about his philosophy and his relationship with the one Envy calls "old creepy drawers"."I thought up the Seven Deadly Sins in one afternoon. All I've come up with since then is advertising." At his headquarters in London, all the sins are there: Envy, Avarice, Anger, Vanity, Gluttony, and Lust. The last is played by none other than Raquel Welch. Oh, baby!The script by Cooke and Moore is very funny, with various 60s references: the Devils "magic words include "LBJ" and "Jackie Kennedy". And there's a great discoteque scene with go-go dancers and that goofy Hullabaloo camera work. (Music and songs by Moore)Yeah, there's a remake coming out. But see the original.Ten stars.

		<fullReview>I first stumbled across this on late night television in the 70's - I have subsequently viewed it about every 5 years or so since and while yes, it's dated in many aspects, I don't necessarily believe that is a bad thing. Bedazzled was very much a movie of it's time, while also being ahead of it's time, as most brilliant things are. The theological satirizations still hold up today and I think it's an excellent riff on how many variables go into an experience, making wishes an exercise in futility. I have enjoyed owning the video so that I can fast forward through Ms. Welch's scene, which I have always found cringeworthy and the one sour note of the film. But the sight of the little old lady peddling off to the village for Fruney Green Eyewash is still one of my favorite things in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderfully funny take-off on "Faust", with Peter Cook as an affable, more than generous Devil, giving poor Dudley Moore every opportunity to find happiness, only to thwart him each time. This film is full of wickedly satirical episodes - Peter Cook even manages to get away with cheating and insulting a sweet little old lady, and his portrayal of a rock idol who can arouse hysteria among girl fans with his aloof demeanour and song lyrics ("You fill me with inertia!") is incredibly funny. This is a great British comedy from the 60s, before filmmakers became too timid to try real satire anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern British Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hapless loser (Dudley Moore) sells his soul to the Devil (Peter Cook) in exchange for seven wishes, but has trouble winning over the girl of his dreams (Eleanor Bron).An extremely influential figure in modern British comedy, Cook is regarded as the leading light of the British satire boom of the 1960s. He was closely associated with the anti-establishment comedy that emerged in Britain and the United States in the late 1950s.Others have said Cook (and this film) are sort of a precursor to Monty Python, and I can see that. The mocking of religion is there, especially with the nuns on trampolines. The film does seem to run a bit long and get stale in places, but as a whole it is a breath of fresh air, a piece of film history ushering in a new era of comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The devil's in the details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At no time did I laugh during "Bedazzled," other than a few abbreviated chuckles; but, regardless, I immensely enjoyed myself. My lack of laughter cannot be blamed on the film, as I rarely laugh during movies--I'm generally unemotive in all areas of life. But "Bedazzled" isn't the kind of comedy one laughs at; it's more the kind that one smiles at and thinks to himself "that's funny." In the beginning, there's Stanley Moon (Dudley Moore), a fry cook who can't quite get the nerve to ask out a waitress, Margaret, whom he's developed a rather large crush on. He's so skittish around her, one doesn't know if he's sweating from nerves or from the stove. After a botched suicide attempt, Moon is visited by the Devil (Peter Cook)--dressed like Dracula from the neck down, and Roger McGuinn from the neck up. Satan offers Moon seven wishes, which Moon burns through attempting to land a reality where he and the waitress are happily ever after.The film is split up into episodes, essentially, each being one of Moon's misguided wishes. Naturally, some are funnier than others. There are two that stand out as being above the rest: one in which Moon wishes to be a pop star--so Margaret will love him, flawless logic-- but is quickly brushed aside for the next big thing, which happens to be a psychedelic, pseudo-intellectual poetry reading. In the other, Moon is not specific enough in his request, yet again, and ends up a female nun who's attained the homosexual affection of Margaret, another nun. Moore and Cook--also the film's two writers--are great in their respective roles and have a innate chemistry. A lot of actors have played the Devil, and in many different ways, but I'm partial to Cook's approach: a calm, flighty sociopath. And a lesser film would have made Moore's apprehensive Moon the butt of joke after joke, but rather, he's played and written with care and consideration--which makes the conclusion to the film work.As funny as the film is, the concept runs out of steam after about an hour and begins repeating itself. Also, the philosophical babble about man, God and Satan wears thin, as the ideas don't go beyond anything you or I have though up in those twilight moments before falling asleep--assuming you're like me and ponder such things aimlessly. A high-concept comedy, "Bedazzled" is charming, sometimes interesting and home to a combination of denser-than-usual humor and nuns bouncing on trampolines. However, it runs its joke into the ground, just managing to resurface slightly before the finish line. God is good, and so is this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil is mean but nicer than God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the Fraser/Hurley version at the cinemas in 2000 I had no idea it was a remake. This, the original version from 1967 blends classic British comedy with pre-Pythonesque humour.Peer Cook tries to swindle Dudley Moore out of his soul by giving him seven wishes. The wishes all go wrong with varying degrees of amusement. I only burst out laughing once when Dudley is transformed into a nun. In between the wishes Rachael Welsh teases us as Lust while other familiar faces pass the camera before we've realised who they are. We sympathise with both the main characters. Will Dudley get his girl or will he live out his life in a habit? Will God take back Cook or will he just have a laugh?It's very entertaining and stands up well against the remake. Not unmissable but worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you had to choose one version of Bedazzled to watch, this would be it !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, my first encounter with the Bedazzled movies was watching the unfortunate Liz Hurley remake. I was a teen at the time and Liz Hurley was one of the 'It' girls of the day (the days of Austin Powers and Serving Sara). I loved the idea, and loved Hurley's devil, but that was pretty much it. I never could stand Brendan Frazer and it always pains me to watch him. A couple of years later, I accidentally watched the original Pete &amp; Dud film and I fell in love. The story is pretty much the same. It's 1967, Stanley Moon (Dudley Moore) has a dead end job as a Wimpy's cook and is hopelessly in love with waitress Margaret Spencer (Eleanor Bron). Unable to muster the courage to ask her out, he attempts suicide but is stopped by George Spiggot aka. the Devil (Peter Cook), who grants him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. Moon agrees and all his wishes are fixated on winning Margaret's heart, however each wish is altered (courtesy of Mr Spiggot).The movie's strongest point is its' screenplay, incredibly witty and brilliantly blasphemous at the same time. The screenplay is taken to another level with Cook and Moore's undeniable chemistry, and Cook's devil is cultured, smart, charming, very English and deliciously mean. Eleanor Bron is brilliant as the many incarnations of Margaret Spencer, playing each version with comedic brilliance. Raquel Welch, despite appearing for under 10 minutes throughout the film, gives an unforgettable performance as Lillian Lust, one of the personified seven sins. Equally unforgettable is Barry Humphries as the delightfully camp Envy who also makes an incredibly brief appearance.A more personal reason I love this film is because I love the Sixties. This movie is essentially a time capsule of 1967, set in Swinging London - technically the epicentre of the decade's cultural movement. Perhaps unknowingly, the movie's makers portrayed everything wonderful about 1967 in just over 90 minutes. The London scenery, the cars, the Pete &amp; Dud chemistry, the fashions, the sexuality, hippies, Julie Andrews... the movie has it all. But perhaps the ultimate 60's moment in this film is Stanley's pop star wish. He is transported to a TV studio in the style of 'Ready, Steady, Go' where his and Cook's performances are performed/filmed in the most 60's way possible: a crude elevated stage,a dancing teenage fan audience, leggy go-go girls, B&amp;W screens with 60's TV effects, unusual/long band names a-la-1967 (Drimble Wedge &amp; the Vegetation) and the very groovy titular song, composed by Moore and performed brilliantly by Cook.I absolutely loved this film. I'm not sure if this movie will cater for everyone's tastes, but if you're into Pete &amp; Dud, British wit, clever screenplays or the Sixties in general, then this movie is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wickedly Ingenious Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if The Devil were a smartass, lanky British dude instead of an unspeakably evil fire-monster? What if God wasn't a bearded Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model but an invisible, booming disembodied voice who likes to maniacally cackle in his spare time? What if Lust, one of the seven deadly sins, was embodied by the curvaceous Raquel Welch? What if ? okay, okay, I've given you plenty of what-ifs to let your imaginations run wild; now, wrap all those what-ifs into a profitable ball of madcap comedic energy and you'll get Bedazzled, one of the finest comedies of the last 50 years.It isn't funny haha like Airplane!, you might say, and it isn't trying to say something like the socially conscious Sullivan's Travels; Bedazzled is a collection of clever quips and dryly funny performances glued together with an insanely ingenious storyline that hits you with the force of a sexy wink from Linda Evangelista. It isn't anything other than consistently wicked and consistently engaging; yet comedy in the 1960s seems to be most attributed to Peter Sellers' greatest vehicles. But The Pink Panther series has its limits; Bedazzled, on the other hand, seems limitless. It may be tongue-in-cheek in its attitudes towards soul selling and heaven and hell's tricky relationship, but it is overtly serious when it comes to being unpredictable and quick. To call it underrated would be an understatement.Dudley Moore, always an under-appreciated comedic talent, portrays Stanley Moon, a hapless fry cook hopelessly in love with his coworker, the lovely Margaret (Eleanor Bron). He has kept his feelings secret for years, and, too nervous to do anything about them, finally decides that he's much too miserable in life to continue going on. So, he ties a noose to his apartment's pipe, jumps, and ? well, the pipe breaks. But fear not; just as Stanley is about to lose hope once again, The Devil himself (Peter Cook) appears at his door, offering a sinful deal: if he grants Stanley seven wishes, then he, in return, will collect the poor man's soul. Stanley doesn't even hesitate - what does he have to lose? - and indeed goes through with The Devil's plan. All his wishes revolve around capturing Margaret's attention, but as The Bible has told us several times, you can't just trust the most vile force in the universe.Like Sellers in Doctor Strangelove, Moore is given the chance to try on several personas and see where they go; when he wishes for eloquence in hopes to seduce Margaret with his mind, he adopts a smooth attitude and an intellectual Welsh accent to back himself up. When he asks The Devil to give him the swagger of a rock star, he really turns into a rock star, singing with the charisma of Roger Daltrey. Moore is so insanely versatile that awe is the only emotion that seems to come out of us; the fluctuations in his performances are so subtle that you have to remind yourself just how much talent it takes to switch characterizations back and forth so many times in a single movie.But if I've made the film sound like a fantasy romp with a stellar performance at its core, that only scratches the surface. Cook, as much as Moore, can spit out adept pieces of dialogue with the wit of the most seasoned of comedians (an increasingly impressive feat considering much of the film is improvised), and Stanley Donen, most known for his musical features (Singin' in the Rain, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers) keeps up with the forward thinking ideals of filmmaking in the 1960s, providing Bedazzled with a solid foundation while also giving it room to go off- the-rails when it needs to. Films like Bedazzled work so well not just because of the talent involved; they work so well because everything they do is funny, existing in a parallel universe comprised of remarkably backwards humor. Along with Raquel Welch's sex appeal, it hasn't aged a bit.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sell your soul to the dEVIL and get what you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this one on Netflix streaming movies. I've seen the 2000 re-make with Brendan Fraser, but was unaware of this, the original, until two days ago. Naturally a movie made in 1967, coincidentally the year I graduated from college, will have a totally different look and sensibility. Plus this one was set and made in England, using pretty typical British humor, while the re-make is set and made in the USA.Dudley Moore, who also did the music and co-wrote the script, is Stanley Moon, lowly short order cook in a London dive. He longs for the waitress, but as a small, shy person can only wish from afar.Fret not, along comes Peter Cook as George Spiggott, aka The Devil. He is a rather pleasant chap, but after all these thousands of years wants to get back into God's good graces, and to do so needs to recruit souls. He bargains for Stanley's. Eleanor Bron plays the waitress Margaret . Sex symbol Raquel Welch plays Lust (Lilian Lust). Other actors play characters such as Vanity, Anger, Envy, Gluttony, Avarice, and Sloth , the seven deadly sins.Both the original and the re-remake use the same general approach, the dEVIL will grant 7 wishes, so that he can get the girl, but each situation isn't exactly a good result. The two versions of the movie use totally different circumstances. An entertaining movie, and a nice blast from the past. It was good to see Moore in an early role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic worked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Cook and Dudley Moore worked together in a variety of media for a long time. Their double act was extremely successful on stage and TV (and also on long playing record) where the sketch format was used: this format suited them. Their movie work was far less successful, and I suspect that a large part of this was because what worked in sketches was much more difficult to sustain for a whole movie.The first joy of Bedazzled is that, like Monty Python's Holy Grail, it pulls off the trick of hanging a series of sketches in a linking narrative so that the fact that it is, essentially, a feature length sketch show is cleverly disguised.The second joy is that the linking narrative - an updating of Faust, whereby Dudley Moore's loser griddle cook is put through the mincer by Peter Cook's amiable but merciless devil - works perfectly, as do most of the episodes illustrating Moore's wishes.Although this is very much a product of the era in which it was made, it is still a very good film, and repays the time spent in watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1960's Personified.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever a movie depicted the golden decade, this one surely does. It embodies all of the anarchic playfulness, the growing contempt for - and willingness to question - any authority (in this case, even God), and the tremendous rush of optimism manifest by pop culture and bright, colourful fashion. As the saying goes - if you weren't there, you're square. Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore were at the height of their clownish powers, with Dudley playing the hapless nobody, Stanley Moon, and Peter a droll and world-weary devil. Stan unwittingly invokes his help in resolving a romantic dilemma. The devil responds with seven wishes in exchange for his soul; but being the devil, he inevitably reneges on each one. And so the fun begins. It would be asking much of a movie so steeped in the culture of the time - especially comic culture - not to have dated after 40 years, and there are odd times when its fraying hem becomes visible. However, the problems of desire, disappointment, temptation and corruption are themselves timeless (as indeed are burst shopping bags and pigeon crap) so we can still empathise with, and laugh out loud, at the plight of our would-be hero. Some of the scenarios into which Dudley finds himself plunged by his winsome tempter are at times hilarious and wretched. He can only escape each of them by blowing a raspberry, and moving on to the next. Sight gags abound and there are many memorable but throwaway one-liners. One suspects that the characters of Dud and Peter actually depict their true life relationship, with an overbearing Cooke constantly using Moore as the butt of his capricious humours. This is a slice of pure 1960's, as authentic as Ronnie Biggs, The Italian Job, miniskirts and picket-lines. It also contains two of Britain's best comedians of their time, with some quite amazing cameos, not least of which is Raquel Welsh as 'Lust', in the role one might say she was born to play. 'Bedazzled' is one of my favourite British comedies. It is wry, sly, witty and also unexpectedly poignant. Colours on the DVD remain as vibrant as Mary Quant stockings. If you're a baby-boomer, then the mere mention of 'Bedazzled' will bring a nostalgic grin to your face. But if you were born too late, then one or two scenes may seem a little passe. On both counts I'm sorry for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You realize that suicide's a criminal offense. In less enlightened times they'd have hung you for it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of either Dudley Moore or 60s British humor, so I'm surprised I found this movie to be as entertaining and hilarious as it is. It specializes in the droll kind of humor where it may take you a few seconds to get the joke. In recent years it has become a cult favorite due to the difficulties in finding a copy. The VHS is long out of print and it has yet to be released commercially to DVD, which is really a shame. This is one of the funniest films of the decade.I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Peter Cook was the best British comedian of his generation, and he's absolutely perfect in this film. As the devil, he gets so many great and quotable lines (my favorite being "You realize that suicide's a criminal offense. In less enlightened times they'd have hung you for it.") As fodder for such a brilliant comic performance, Dudley Moore equips himself very well and turns in a very likable performance of the ultimate nebbish loser. It's the human elements his character contributes that makes the film work so well. As Lilian Lust, Raquel Welch most certainly looks the part. Plus, the direction by Stanley Donen is incredibly stylish and much more interesting and innovative than you'd expect it to be. The surrealistic touches (particulary the nuns on the trampoline) work very nicely also.The film isn't flawless by any means. Its never outright boring, but a few segments seem to drag a bit (notably the intellectual sequence) and it could've been trimmed by ten or fifteen minutes. Also, due to being a product of the times it inevitably dated a bit. Luckily, these slight complaints certainly do not detract from the film being an overall very enjoyable and refreshing comedy.

		<fullReview>I love this film so much that it makes me want to weep just thinking about it. It is the most wonderful example of my favourite genre which I categorise as "Divine Comedy"; (think Life of Brian, the Toy Story's) comedies based on moral themes, religious preoccupations, consciousness etc. Emotional satire would be another way of putting it.It has a head start by being based on my favourite play which is Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, but it takes this to unprecedented heights of clever, thought-provoking and most of all hilarious genius. In my opinion, (and I write screenplays for a living), this is the funniest, cleverest screenplay ever written. It's a real "We-are-not-worthy" experience to watch it......which I do again and again, and can't help but suffocate with laughter and I recommend that you watch it several times too, because every line is a magic bullet and you just can't take them in in one go.It seems that it's not just the best tunes that the devil gets.</fullReview>

Granted, Moore's pretty much the deadpan comic relief (and his constant, "You just can't stop, can you?" gets pretty monotonous after a while), but the diatribes on God, religion, the Devil, sin, etc., are pretty funny.The movie itself is pretty basic, though, and the scenes with Dudley Moore getting his wishes seem to drag on a bit (someone else noted the first one with 15 minutes of psuedo-intellectual dialogue by the score). The only really good one is the Bouncing Nuns, and even that seems to go on a bit too long. The movie's best with just Cook and Moore strolling down a street having another exchange about God.</fullReview>

Trouble is, each wish is turned upside down to fit the devil's own sense of fun. Bedazzled benefits from the comic duo of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. The scenes between them have impeccable timing, witty dialouge and at times, very absurd bits. I like the fact that the devil is portrayed as a very nicely dressed fellow who is merely doing his job. Sure he's the prince of darkness, but you have to earn a living somehow. The wishes range from the sublime, to the absolute opposite end of the spectrum. My own personal favorite involves an order of trampolining nuns. Bedazzled is a nice, little film that will keep you smiling throughout it's entire running time.

		<fullReview>I loved this film cos i love Peter Cook and Dudley Moore,If they usually make you giggle then you should like this film.Dudley plays a lonely fella who works as a short order cook at Whimpeys.He sells his soul to the devil (Peter) in exchange for a number of wishes which he uses to try and get the girl he's in love with( the waitress at Wimpeys).He becomes a pop star, an intellectual, a nun and a fly amongst others and each time he fails to get her because the devil ruins it for him in one way or another.Dudley Moore and Peter Cook play there parts perfectly and the sound track acompanies it well too.I think dudley composed some of the music.All in all ,a charmingly funny film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a classic. It should NEVER be confused with the poor Hurley/Frazer effort - that left you wondering where an hour and a half of your life went.Cook and Moore are fantastic, their natural rapport makes the film near perfection. Gags are subtle but effective leaving you with one of those 'what a great movie' feelings. It was a film that I would recommend to any and all... its proof that money doesn't make the film (mentioning no names Mr Cameron, Mr Scott) its the script, the actors and the punch and this film has them all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspired Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having worked as a comedy team on television, Cook and Moore took their inspired brand of comedy to the big screen in the mid 1960s. This was arguably their greatest success. It's a clever takeoff on the Faust legend of a man who sells his soul to the devil in exchanges for knowledge and worldly pleasures. In this instance, Moore is a short order cook who is granted seven wishes by Cook, the devil. Of course, all the wishes go hilariously awry. Some of the episodes are funnier than others but it's all quite amusing. Bron is delightful as the woman of Moore's dreams. Welch is appropriately cast as Lillian Lust, one of Cook's assistants. This turned out to be the last good film of Donen's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated hilarious film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the film Bedazzled, a film with two great performances and great humor. Bedazzled is an incredibly original film. It's absolutely hilarious also. There is a cameo by Raquel Welch, who plays Lillian Lust, the babe with the bust. I'll quit talking about some of the great things about Bedazzled and move onto the better things. Well, it already is good enough there, but I left out the key in Bedazzled. Dudley Moore and Peter Cook are fantastic. They are so funny and the two of them together do such a great job. The film works alone with them. But the film is just fantastic that they need two great performances to support it. The film is great enough with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. The problem with the remake is that after seeing such great performances I couldn't stop thinking about the original performances. Bedazzled is a great comedy that is high on originality and humor. I am pretty sure that you will laugh at Bedazzled. Big thumbs up. See it if you haven't seen it already.The Plot: Stanley is a lonely guy who works at a Burger joint. Also working at the burger joint is Margeret Spencer, who Stanley has a secret crush on. One day he is so upset that he can't have her he decides to commit suicide. He is stopped by the Devil, who offers him 7 wishes. Bedazzled:****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil Made Us Do It Or Lusts To Make Us Do It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ultimate compliment that can be paid in life is your material being born again. Such homage has been paid to Peter Cook &amp; Dudley Moore as they collaborated on this script working for big name producer Donlan. The results are a 1960's feeling &amp; era set film.Many fans of Raquel Welsh feel she was wasted here, &amp; in a sense she very much was. Other than one good sequence with Moore in the bedroom, she only gets to be eye candy. Really, her role and Eleanor's role in this are not big on either count. Eleanor gets more camera time, but her role is not really much bigger.This film is very much into the sexist 1960's where women were looked upon as objects of men's desire. Even though in real life Raquel already had 2 kids, she became that desire for a long time before and after this film.The strength of the film is Peter Cook's way in his role as the devil. Instead of being just pure evil, he seems to bring a friendly smile &amp; wave to the role. The collaboration with Moore on the script show in their film long on screen partnership. This chemistry is the glue that holds the film together.The references to drugs and suicide are common themes for the era. Moore's score contains some hip jazz sax which was very much period like work. While Cook is a Devil might care type, Moore is pretty much the same awkward shy but forward type playboy he would later reprise in several other films including the drunk sot of Arthur. Moore is good natured here and keeps getting out witted by Cook's devil.Donlan produces some very 1960's looks down to the scene coloring of the film as there are times the color are psychedelic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pure genius of PC on full display</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been described as a time capsule by others, and in a way, regarding life in the 60s it is that. But the humour and devastating wit of this piece is as timeless as you can get. Cook was the Oscar Wilde of his day, incredibly witty, clever and arrogant, and his screenplay here is choc-full of devilishly clever and funny lines, together with some alarmingly good visual gags. Not one of them has a hint of overkill, every single one is underplayed and this should be a lesson to all comedy scriptwriters, directors and performers working today, as subtlety is certainly not the byword of 'noughties' comedy. His delivery is spot on, as always, his presence on screen always sparkling. For a laid back performer PC had enormous magnetism that just drew you in to his persona, with his fascinating face always hinting of mystery and naughtiness behind the boyish, arrogant, almost uninterested looking half smirk he seemed to wear, that some people including partner DM thought was a bit superior and demeaning of lesser souls. But lets face it, next to Cook almost everyone was of lesser talent, especially creative talent and wit.That Moore and Bron even managed not to fade into the background with Peter Cook on such scintillating form would be a tribute to their performances, but as the screenplay dictates, much of the narrative revolves around their scenes together (with Cook coming in as the killjoy raspberry just to prick poor old Stanley Moon's balloon). I've never seen Moore as good as this, and Bron shows what an underused talent she was. Yet at the end of this highly creative masterpiece of film satire it is one person's name that stands out way above the others. This is the very best of a brilliant comedian and still represents the benchmark of film satire and observational wit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEDAZZLED (Stanley Donen, 1967) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I consciously had never bothered with the recent remake, I did miss the original a couple of times in the past on Cable TV; now that I have finally caught up with it, I'd say it's a curious, with-it updating of the Faustian legend for the Swinging Sixties crowd which, in spite of frequently hitting its various targets, is rather patchy overall, thus rendering its cult status slightly overrated.The three leads ? Dudley Moore (as the timid cook hero), Peter Cook (as Mr. Spiggott alias The Horned One) and Eleanor Bron (Moore's co-worker and object of desire) ? are very appealing, although the film is perhaps best-remembered today for Raquel Welch's steamy, scene-stealing cameo as one of Spiggott's cohorts, Lilian Lust. Moore's various role-plays ? during the granting of his seven wishes ? are quite amusing, especially the accent he adopts during his intellectual mode and his befuddled countenance while impersonating a cuckolded aristocrat; at one point, he is even turned into a fly on the wall! The leaping nuns segment is perhaps the most outrageous one of all but it works surprisingly well, as does Peter Cook's deadpan song recital (during the black-and-white pop idol sequence) which is an unexpected highlight; Mr. Spiggott is also seen intermittently creating mischief towards the general public ? releasing a group of wasps onto some nearby peaceful hippies, removing the bottom from under a woman's shopping bag, ripping the last pages off Agatha Christie mysteries, etc. The witty screenplay, written by Peter Cook himself, features several in-jokes: "Julie Andrews" is the magic phrase which transports Moore from one misadventure to the next; Cook at one point makes a reference to director Stanley Donen's own earlier popular musical, SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS (1954); the name of the character played by Dudley Moore is Stanley Moon ? which is how Sir John Gielgud (who would later famously co-star with Moore in the ARTHUR movies) had erroneously referred to Moore in a letter praising a stage performance he had seen him in! Unfortunately, the subplot involving the ongoing investigation of Moore's supposed suicide/disappearance doesn't really work (despite the welcome presence of investigating officer Michael Bates) because there would have been no reason for the police to question Bron for so long since she was only a colleague of Moore's (and one with which he barely exchanged words to boot) and not his fiance! Dudley Moore also composed the music score which, during the opening credits, is great but the rest of the film merely features variations on the same theme.Although by far the most successful, BEDAZZLED was not the first screen teaming of comic duo Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (who originally hailed from TV): it was preceded by the all-star THE WRONG BOX (1966; with which I am familiar) and was followed by MONTE CARLO OR BUST (1969), THE BED-SITTING ROOM (1969; which I have on DivX but have yet to watch) and the reportedly disastrous THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (1978). Furthermore, Stanley Donen had previously tackled the Faust theme as a Hollywood musical, DAMN YANKEES (1958); having shot the Hitchcock pastiche ARABESQUE (1966) in England, Donen stayed on the Continent for three more films: the marital comedy-drama TWO FOR THE ROAD (1967; starring Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn), BEDAZZLED, and his misguided depiction of the gay lifestyle, STAIRCASE (1969; starring Richard Burton and Rex Harrison).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Peter and Dudley Don't Tickle You, Raquel Will</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wily devil named George Spiggot, who has seven wishes to grant, targets the soul of a short-order cook at Wimpy's in "Bedazzled," Stanley Donen's stylish take on Faust. Dudley Moore, who plays Lucifer's object of pursuit, Stanley Moon, is a failure at everything from his unrequited desire for a waitress at Wimpy's to his attempt to hang himself from the water pipes in his flat. The Haunted One, played by Peter Cook, is too smart and egotistical for his own good, although he manages to outwit Stanley in a series of twists that turn the seven wishes into seven disasters for the lovelorn cook. While a couple of the episodic wish segments linger too long, they are generally quite funny and even outright hilarious when the action moves to a convent of leaping nuns.The humor is quintessentially English. Those who do not relish Monty Python and "Fawlty Towers" beware. Others, however, will want repeat viewings to capture and savor lines that zip by too fast to catch at first. The delicious Eleanor Bron, who shone as the upper class snob in Donen's other 1967 film, "Two for the Road," has a showcase here. She portrays not only the vacuous waitress, Margaret Spencer, but also the various versions of the character that are depicted in Moon's wish skits. From a pseudo-intellectual to a devoted wife to a sex-crazed patrician to a repressed nun, Bron is wonderful throughout. Peter and Dudley are, well, Peter and Dudley, which is all that devotees of the team could want. Raquel Welch fans will also be delighted to see her expose her assets as Lillian Lust, one of the seven deadly sins. Her sly offer of "buttered buns" will likely have some viewers jumping through the screen."Bedazzled" is a film that may enchant some and bore others. However, even if English humor and Dudley and Peter leave some viewers cold, the sight of Raquel gyrating in a skimpy red bikini should warm them up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I must point out that I have read Dr. Faustus, and am well acquainted with the Faust legend. I saw this film in conjunction with a reading of Christopher Marlowe's play, back in late 1976/early 1977 (senior year of high school). I was already familiar with Cook and Moore, and thought this was one of the funniest movies I had ever seen.It's 24 years later, and I still think so.I rented this the other week because of the release of the remake. I had tried to get it for ages, but other people had the same idea, and beat me to the video store. Yes, it's a bit dated, but how can one expect it not to be? After all, 34 years is 34 years. How could something not be dated after all this time? But it's still hilarious, and the themes are timeless, so the story itself will never get old.The trampolining nuns are worth the price of the rental all by themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, far exceeds remake, and a great sign of its times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: there's a bit of a spoiler ahead. I recommend you see this movie, so I'll tell you why before I get to the spoiler bit, and it's not that much of a spoil.If you loved Austin Powers for its kitschy 60s go-go rock and vinyl boots, you'll love this one.This movie's fun to watch because it's such a sign of its times -- the clothes, the music, the slang -- not to mention that the stars are two top talents, among the funniest Brits you could find in their heyday. The music is especially fun. Even the incidental music is a golden gas from your momma's past, baby ... it's far out, man.Here's the bit that's a spoiler, so don't read on til you've seen it -- and you gotta see it!My favorite bit is when our hero gets his wish to be a beloved pop star, and Dudley Moore is there on Top of the Pops or some such show, singing "I'm on my knees / Won't you please / Come and love me", like a repressed Tom Jones, and the girls all scream like he's the heaviest cat ... and then Peter Cook follows as the next act, a weird, trancey and artsy not in the good sense) deadpan singer who sings "I don't love you .... I'm not interested ... you fill me with inertia", and all the girls leave Dudley to scream for Peter. The trippy light show and (now quite corny) psychedelic TV show scenes here are priceless.I wish so much for this to be out on DVD. I would definitely have it. This, and the movie The President's Analyst are fabulous examples of what was groovy, and funny, about the late 60s, visually, sonically and sartorially.</fullReview>

Enter the Devil (Peter Cook), going by the alias George Spiggott. Satan gives Stanley seven wishes, so as to help the poor bloke win Margaret's heart. Stanley makes his wishes, but there's always a loophole leading to a rather embarrassing situation.Maybe "Bedazzled" was sort of a period piece. A particularly dated scene is when a policeman is showing someone a rape victim and says "She brought it on herself."

		<fullReview>I remember seeing 'Bedazzled' in the late 60s when it first came out, and laughing and laughing. I thought it was so witty--my first taste of British humor. Last weekend, 30-odd years later, I rented it for my 16-year-old daughter, who was pining for something light. Sophisticated in Brit humor--she was weaned on Monty Python--I wanted her to see the original 'swinging London.' I thought she might be bored, but she (and I) thoroughly enjoyed it. Time has only added luster--the script is as witty and as theologically sound as ever and the cameos as delightful. Time has only enhanced the 60s London scene--the rock star bit, my daughter's favorite bit, appears to have been an influence for the Austin Powers set designer. George Spiggot's petty irritations--the double tempt!--made us giggle. The pacing is a still a little slow--it drags at the end. My daughter loved it, however, which was a pleasure. Lots of fun to see this classic again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Mephistophelean comedy is easily the best of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's big screen pairings, and far more successful than the Brendan Fraser remake (although the absence of Elizabeth Hurley guarantees that on its own), but it is somewhat inconsistent in tone. It's the set-up and linking scenes that are the funniest and cleverest by far, as Peter Cook's George Spiggott (aka the Devil) explains the various theological conundrums of the whole Good-and-Evil-and-Free-Choice thing to Dudley Moore's short-order hamburger chef Stanley Moon while going about his daily business of mundane petty sins and mischief - fixing parking meters, scratching records, cutting buttons off shirts, drilling holes in oil tankers, persuading pigeons to crap on passers by - with little help from his useless assistants ("What terrible sins I've got working for me. Must be the wages."). Most of the mysteries of the ages are explained: the Garden of Eden is revealed as a boggy swamp just south of Croydon, Heaven turns out to be the garden center at Syon Park in Brentford, God is naturally an Englishman. And the key to success with women turns out to be - "In the words of Marcel Proust - and this applies to any woman in the world - if you can stay up and listen with a fair degree of attention to whatever garbage, no matter how stupid it is that they're coming out with, til ten minutes past four in the morning... you're in." The wishes themselves are mostly slightly disappointing, like the duo's later TV work showing a tendency toward overlength, although they do offer Eleanor Bron a chance to really shine in several different incarnations of Moon's fantasy woman, and fly on the wall sketch and the wonderful leaping Nuns of the Berylian Order are strokes of insane genius (Cook's statically disinterested pop star - "You fill me with inertia" - is an inspired creation too). And don't forget the magic words - "Julie An-drews!" Second Sight's PAL DVD is a good one - a very good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, a 23-minute interview with Barry Humphries (who plays Envy in the film) and raw footage of a newsreel interview on set with Cook and Moore.</fullReview>

As Harry Moon, Moore signs a pact with the decidedly inept Cook and gets into one hair-brained situation after another. Director Stanley Donen keeps things moving at a brisk clip so the episodes are never tiresome. The nuns-on-trampolines segment is priceless --- Moore's nun name is very clever. Cook and Moore didn't get many chances to showcase their unusual chemistry on film so the film is a real treat.

		<fullReview>The humor is good and typical British. Most of the jokes work really well, it's just too bad that some of the sketches are dragging on for too long and the movie itself feels a bit long.Man oh man, let me start of by saying that Peter Cook and Dudley Moore are horrible actors. It was really painful to watch at times for me but since this is a comedy, the acting really is secondary. The real power of course lies in its jokes and one-liners. Who cares really that Dudley Moore and Peter Cook weren't the world finest actors?The quality of the most sketches is good even though some of course are better than others. But like I said it drags on for a bit too long at times, some more pace wouldn't had been such a bad idea at times. After 2 sins I already got a bit tired thinking about it that I had to watch 5 more sins but luckily the movie never really weakens and keeps you watching to the end.It is a very recommendable movie to kill some time with, also because of Raquel Welch small role!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bedazzled marked the first big-screen outing for Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, and when it was first released, a lot of cinemagoers were baffled by it. Probably because the dirty raincoats, cloth caps and surreal flights of fancy of their TV incarnations 'Pete and Dud' were missing, but mostly because Bedazzled really isn't that funny. The whole film has a stiff and stilted air, and none of the cast seem at ease in front of the cameras. A lot of the dialogue sounds as if it was post-dubbed from inside a cardboard box (there's an appalling dead echo on some of the outdoor scenes) and most of the 'wish fulfilment' sequences fall tiresomely flat, with the commendable exception of the pop parody in which Moore's gold-suited lovelorn ballad singer is updated by Cook's doomy psychedelic hipster 'Drimble Wedge'. Eleanor Bron is irritating beyond belief as Moore's love interest - are we really meant to believe that he was driven to the brink of suicide by such a flat, unloveable creature? Raquel Welch is typically dismal and inept in her three-minute cameo as 'Lust', and Michael Bates does his usual pompous routine as a stuffy, worryingly sexist policeman.Bedazzled does have some bright moments, however - the scenes where Cook and Moore's relationship is allowed to develop into something approaching mutual respect are funny, natural and often touching, and Cook plays his washed-up Satan (reduced to petty evils such as scratching record albums and cutting the buttons off shirts) with his customary dry wit. But on the whole, this film is embarrassingly dated - especially Stanley Donen's tricksy direction - and genuine Cook and Moore fans will get a better kick out of DEREK AND CLIVE GET THE HORN.</fullReview>

I eventually grew tired of the many tight close-ups of Dudley Moore's perspiring, beady little face, or listening to Peter Cook's repetitious lines and snotty delivery. The production has a nice feel in the early scenes at the diner, where Moore works as a short-order cook, but his seven wish-fulfillments after signing a pact with Beelzebub Cook are disappointing. Eleanor Bron, as the object of Dudley's affection--a cheerless, jaded waitress--takes some time getting used to; the actress uses her dry, apathetic voice in some amusing ways, and she's not afraid to be repulsive, but a little of her goes a long way. The Devil's faculty--especially Anger, Envy and Lust (the latter portrayed by Raquel Welch, in red bra and panties)--are wonderful, but this one-note twist on Faust is an overlong British farce with too-careful pacing and not enough big laughs. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

It's a funny, silly movie with funny, silly dialogues and a funny, silly plot, though it's pretty dated. There are some jokes that work and then the rest that kind of makes you go "heh". The story is interesting enough though, and I especially like how the wish sequences are kept short and to the point. Main guy asks for something, things go well for two seconds, then he finds out how the devil screwed it up again, lives with it for a while for the hell of it and then back to square one. Then yet another wish with a stupid obvious loophole. Meanwhile the devil causes all kinds of annoying stuff, being called while you're in the bath, working on parking meters, we've all seen mediocre stand-up comedy. It's all very kind comedy, except for some unexpected stabs to politics. They mock religion enough to make the fanatics angry (I mean they DO mention it), but it's all good and harmless. Oh and Raquel Welch is in this looking all good, but she gets so little screen time it should be a crime. I enjoyed the viewing, but it isn't sensationally good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen the Brendan Fraser/Elizabeth Hurley version long before this original from director Stanley Donen (Singin' in the Rain) and written by the two leading actors. It is exactly the same premise, a guy - Stanley Moon (Dudley Moore) - wants to be with a girl - Margaret Spencer (Eleanor Bron) - and along comes The Devil, aka George Spiggott (Peter Cook), and the guy signs a contract for seven wishes in exchange for his soul. Throughout the film Stanley becomes articulate intellectual, a wealthy industrialist, a brief rock star, has an affair, a fly on the wall and a nun, oh, and gets an ice lolly. In the end though, instead of the Devil demanding he makes a final wish and it isn't for himself, Stanley uses them all, and the Devil simply turns nice to get God to take him back into Heaven. Also starring a pretty brief Raquel Welch as Lilian Lust, Alba as Vanity, Robert Russell as Anger; Barry Humphries, aka Dame Edna Everage as Envy, Parnell McGarry as Gluttony, Dani?le Nol as Avarice, Howard Goorney as Sloth, Michael Bates as Insp. Reg Clarke, Bernard Spear as Irving Moses, Robin Hawdon as Randolph, Michael Trubshawe as Lord Dowdy, Evelyn Moore as Mrs. Wisby, Charles Lloyd Pack as Vicar and Lockwood West as St. Peter. In my opinion, this isn't as good as the much more lively and modern remake, this just feels too 60's, it seems much more chatty, and there was not much to laugh at. Cook is not as fun as the sexy interpretation by Hurley, Moore is not as concerned as Fraser, I think Welch would been a very seductive Devil, probably more so than Hurley, but if you like old fashioned comedy, this is worth seeing, at least once. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raquel Welch Was Wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BEDAZZLED was release in the United States on December 10, 1967. Bedazzled is a 1967 film written by and starring Peter Cook along with the gorgeous Raquel Welch and Dudley Moore, retelling the Faust legend in the Swinging London of the 1960s. It was remade in 2000 under the same name.Summary Stanley Moon (Moore) is a dissatisfied introverted young man who works in a Wimpy's restaurant and admires, from afar, the server Margaret (Bron). Despairing of his unrequited infatuation, he is in the process of an incompetent suicide attempt, when he is interrupted by the Devil himself, incarnated as George Spiggott (Cook). Spiggott is in a contest with God, trying to be the first to gather 100 billion souls. If he achieves this first, he will be readmitted to Heaven. In return for his soul, Spiggott offers Stanley seven wishes. Stanley consumes these opportunities in trying to satisfy his lust for Margaret (frequent Cook and Moore collaborator Eleanor Bron), but Spiggott twists his words to frustrate any consummation of desire. On the last occasion, he reincarnates Stanley as a nun in a convent: whilst being specific about nearly every other aspect of the wish, he has forgotten to specify his gender and vocation, and Spigott mischievously takes full advantage of that. Spiggott fills the time between these episodes with acts of minor vandalism and petty spite, incompetently assisted by the personification of the seven deadly sins, most memorably Lust (Raquel Welch).Questions: What did Margaret find that went with Stanley's note? Why could no one find Stanley's body? Why did the inspector become more interested in Margaret Instead of the disappearance of Stanley? Who was Lust? What did Lust have to do with this picture? My Thoughts: As far as the movie goes, don't waste your money! I thought I would ever say that about a Raquel Welch film. This was stupid and it took more than ** ******* before you even saw Raquel Welch. As far as Raquel, well she was as gorgeous as ever, however, how could you waste such talent and a gorgeous body in a piece of junk like this? Raquel was wasted in this movie and they should have showed this movie free. As far as the movie goes, I give this 1 weasel star and that's being nice and as for Raquel Welch, her and her body get 10 weasel stars even for a short performance like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being an Amerikanisch swine, more of an Anglophile than a xenophobe am I. Most of my favorite bands are English not to mention my favorite actors, directors, television shows, etc., etc., etc. How was it then that I went 48 years without seeing this "classic" British comedy? Twenty three years after the release of its predecessor, I watched the Brendan Frasier/Elizabeth Hurley remake and lust plain loved it. That made me all the more anxious to see the original, performed by the originators. My initial reaction was a huge *yawn*. The first scene between Stanley Moon and the Devil was soooooo drawn out and sooooo full of boring, long winded exposition that I literally found myself nodding off! To be fair, I soldiered on, hoping and expecting for the film to pick up its pace...I waited in vain. True, the look and feel of the whole movie was dated, but so then is Monty Python, and "A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum". That doesn't stop them from being hilarious. The one thing they have that transcends time is...well...timing! Fast paced, snappy dialogue brimming with that deliciously dry English wit. I found that to be sadly lacking here. So, sorry Queen Mum, this match goes to the Americans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strictly a product of British '60s humor...full of gags but still misses the mark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grant you that PETER COOK and DUDLEY MOORE are two very talented British performers but even their kind of talent needs a better than average script to overcome the tired gags conjured up to give a new spin to the Faust legend.Cook is a dim-witted short order cook who gets to realize some of his wishes (but always with a hex on all of them) from devil Cook, and the film is a series of jokes with Cook's best laid plans always going amok as he struggles to find and conquer his true love.DUDLEY MOORE completely nails his Stanley Moon characterization, as does PETER COOK with his sharp and snotty comments as the Devil, always up to no good. But the story concept wears thin by the time the first hour is over--and the last forty-four minutes are simply tiresome repeats of previous vignettes. RAQUEL WELCH is amusing as a seductress in one brief scene.The later remake with BRENDAN FRASER was a lot more enjoyable. This one depends entirely on your appreciation of British humor gone amok.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't believe how bad this lame attempt at religion bashing was.Typical left wing bashing of religion which passes for 'humor' in such sophomoric left wing circles.Spit and sneer at the Bible, nuns, etc etc etc. And that supposed to be hilarious.It wasn't.One of the dullest excuses for humor I had had the bad fortune to waste my time on.The love of Dudley Moore's life was a horsefaced excuse for an actress.The pacing of this lame British 'humor' was deadly and sleep inducing.</fullReview>
