		<shortDescription>A comedy with warmth, wit, and style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw this movie because it stars Brendan Fraser, an actor who can't seem to make a bad movie, and often makes great movies, such as "Blast From the Past".The big surprise was Elizabeth Hurley. As certain as Vivien Leigh was meant to play Scarlett O'Hara, no one could have done a better job playing The Devil...in this case a sly, brilliantly cunning, sexy devil who playfully torments Brendan by dooming each of his wishes with unintended, nasty surprises. She effortlessly leads him along like a puppy dog on a leash.Besides her comedic wit, (and some clever writing) I would be remiss not to mention that Elizabeth Hurley looks perfect, absolutely perfect, in every scene. Her clipped, refined British accent is the aural equivalent of a film shot on Kodachrome.Bedazzled exudes a positive, good-natured warmth, and is proof that comedy doesn't have to depend on silly sophomoric antics, pratfalls, or foul language.ADDENDUM January 10, 2008. After two years, I have no idea if anyone has ever read this review. Even if you don't like it, please give me a thumbs up or thumbs down, just to let me know someone read it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie, good comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, this isn't the best or funniest comedy in the world, but I certainly enjoyed it. There is a fair amount of really good comedy in the film to keep you entertained. ...And of course there's Elizabeth Hurley...need I say more?The story is a fun one and quite the fantasy, but nonetheless, it's entertaining. While not being anything terribly profound, this film definitely has a point to make, be happy with yourself and only you can make things happen, don't rely on others for your happiness.The acting in this film is very good. Brendan Fraser struts his acting talent in this film quite nicely, playing virtually 5 or 6 characters throughout the film. Brendan really is a talented actor and should get some notice for his role in this film. Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss also deserve a great deal of notice for their work in this film, all three of them play various types of characters in the film and do it quite nicely. Elizabeth Hurley and her ever-changing wardrobe should be reason enough for any guy to watch this film. She looks nothing short of fantastic in every scene. Frances O'Connor was a nice choice for the part of Alison / Nicole (also playing more than one role very nicely).All in all, this is a fun, cute movie with some really good comedy. I would recommend this film to anyone that likes those types of film, or is just a fan of one of the actors or director Harold Ramis. I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How unusual - a comedy that's funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wealth. Power. Admiration. They all sound pretty enticing. Indeed many people spend their life in pursuit of these or similar goals and are willing to sacrifice anything and everything in the process. But what if there was an easy way to do it, say, selling your soul? You're not really using it anyways .As the saying goes, the day I decided to do it there'd probably be a glut on the market.Elliot Richards is, for lack of a better word, a dork. Relegated to the most dreaded of worker hells - tech support - he is a social pariah. Mocked by his colleagues, he spends his time trying to be cool and is hopelessly in love with one of his co-workers who doesn't even know that he exists. While lamenting his lot in life he casually mentions that he would give anything to have his beloved Allison. Enter the Princess of Darkness, stage left.Although the basics between this movie and the 1967 classic of the same name are similar, there are so many differences (styles of humor, characters, plot, etc) that comparisons are pointless. So I won't even try. Bedazzled offers something so few comedies do these days - laughs, and lots or them, without relying on endless juvenile scatological gags. I thoroughly enjoyed the physical transformations that Elliot, Allison, and his cohorts undergo (several of which are amazing) each time he makes a wish. The spins on the wishes are especially amusing: for example, when Elliot wishes for power and wealth, he fails to take consider the how, and wakes up as a cuckolded Colombian drug lord whose kingdom is quickly collapsing around him. Elliot soon discovers that when dealing with the devil - surprise, surprise - nothing is, as it seems.I have liked Brendan Fraser since his role in "Encino Man". Since then, he has proven himself capable of doing both schtick ("The Mummy") and serious roles ("Gods and Monsters"). With this part he shows just how versatile he is: rather than one role, he takes on seven, and does so admirably (I particularly enjoyed sensitive guy - I was laughing so hard my side hurt). Elizabeth Hurley is deliciously wicked in a role that she was born to play (if reports about her are true.) and it appears that she enjoyed herself. Her spin on the ultimate temptress is hilarious and personally, I'll take leather-clad vixens over slimy snakes any day. Francis O'Connor, brings the same verve and versatility to Allison that she displayed in "Mansfield Park", although here she is less subdued. The supporting cast provides the finishing touch rounding out the film nicely.Although it didn't dazzle me, I was greatly amused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'George Of The Jungle' Meets Satan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a fun film with a number of good laughs. It is stupid? Yeah, in parts. Is the theology sound? Hardly, but there was more truth than fiction uttered in this film, believe it or not. Is the Devil made to look attractive? Well, yeah, I'd say Elizabeth Hurley is pretty attractive!The beginning is the best part of the film, and the end - with a dumb New Age message - is the worst. Along the way, the dumb Brendan Fraser's "Elliott Richards" learns some valuable lessons in his battle with the Devil. For selling his soul, so to speak, he gets seven wishes and we witness how he handles, or mishandles, these wishes. Much of it is pretty funny. Fraser is not a bad. He can play these goofy roles (i.e. "George Of The Jungle" and he can get serious and be effective, too, as in "The Quiet American.")Overall, it's good lightweight entertainment. Don't expect much, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. At least, that's the way I found it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Like The Original, But Pleasant Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1967 original, starring Dudley Moor and Peter Cook and directed by Stanley Donen was a droll dark comedy that bombed when it was first released to theatres but has developed a very strong cult following over the years. This 2000 version, directed by Harold Ramis is not so much a remake as a latter-day re-imagining of the story. Aside from the basic premise, the two films share little else in common. This new version is a wacky, fast-paced farce that makes up in some giddily amusing moments what it lacks in true wickedness.Brendan Fraser is perfectly cast as the hapless computer tech who makes a deal with Satan; granted seven wishes in exchange for eventual possession of his soul, we witness each wish he makes as his life becomes a series of colorful and very funny misadventures. Some first-rate make-up and special effects transform Fraser and his world every time he changes wishes. Elizabeth Hurley is extremely fetching and quite likable as the embodiment of Satan, although I wish she'd showed a bit more evilness than glee in her characterization.All in all, a very entertaining movie that, of course, leaves the door open for a sequel. Bring it on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bedazzled" tells of a tech support geek (need I say more?) who sells his soul to the devil (Hurley) for seven wishes which he attempts to use to get close to a girl at work (O'Connor). The flick is a situational comedy which takes the audience on a fun ride as Fraser's wishes turn him into one exaggerated comic-book-type caricature after another. A cute flick sans slapstick, pratfalls, and jokes, "Bedazzled" offers lots of outrageous situations, some sentimental moments, and a whiff of philosophy. A fun watch with a cute ending, lots of eye candy for the guys, and Fraser doing what he does best playing a big, naive, smiling guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The makers of Bedazzled were not out to make a classic comedy,they were simply trying to make us laugh.Their mission was a successful one.Bedazzled is full of laughs and great character acting by Brendan Fraser and Frances O'Connor.After many forgettable roles in several forgettable films,Brendan Fraser has really graduated into one of cinemas' big time players in just the last couple of years.As I said,Bedazzled will probably not go down as a comedy classic,it's just your basic comedy filled with laughs from start to finish,and that's good enough for me.It would be a worthy addition to the comedy section of anyone's home library.Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone in Movie Heaven dropped a feather down on Ramis, the director of such good time romps as Ghostbusters and Stripes. His remake of this 1967 classic rides on the slumped shoulders of Elliot (Brendan Fraser at his best), a pathetically geeky loner who is so socially unskilled that he makes our skin crawl a little. When we first meet him, Elliot is trying to glom onto his co-workers' after-hours social scene by using such tried-and-true means as showing photos of his speakers (from all sides), a truly awful blue-eyed soul brother act, and plain old stalking.Even though he is the guy you run from when he lurches towards you in the hall - probably knocking over the water cooler at the same time - Elliot really does want to be different. One reason for this is his fervent secret crush on Alison (Frances O'Connor), a beautiful systems analyst who doesn't see him at all. Elliot is so smitten by her that he doesn't even realize until too late that she has given him a polite brush off at the local pub, where he is busy trying to impress his buddies.Now comes a simple but nifty transitional shot: a cue ball skips off a pool table and bounces down a flight of stairs and the camera follows as it makes a steady, inevitable trip across the crowded floor, pairs of feet yielding right of way as it goes on to finally hit Elliot's feet where he sits on a stool in silent yearning. He picks up the ball and looks across the room, up the flight of stairs to where destiny, in the form of Elizabeth Hurley in a slinky red dress, is beckoning him.Ms. Hurley is actually the Devil, although Elliot doesn't know it yet, and she will shortly be putting him through a series of transformative experiences. In the meantime, though, he isn't buying her story, even though she presents him with a card that reads, "The Devil". Contrasted with the heavy-handedness of recent 'Sign O'the Beast R' Us' flicks such as Devil's Advocate, this sequence is done with sly understatement and depends simply on giving Hurley a chance to play the vamp she was born to be.We begin to like Elliot here because, even though he is presented with a slew of vanity-pleasing enticements, it isn't until she serves up a batch of his grandmother's cookies that he believes the Devil is really who she claims to be. And when he is presented with the standard seven-wishes-for-your-soul contract, it isn't until he sees a giant video screen of Alison calling to him that he makes the deal.Although the real treats - the deliriously goofy incarnations of teeth, hair and clothing that Elliot chooses for his ideal self in his endless quest for happiness, success, and Alison's hand - are yet to come, I am just pointing out how masterfully Ramis has set the table. By the time he is plunged into his voyage of self-improvement, we already know a great deal about Elliot and have begun to move into his corner.We've also begun to feel a certain sympathy for the Devil, thanks mainly to the fine work of Ms. Hurley, with her elegant voice and her clear zest for the role. Although she is certainly not the scariest Lucifer yet to appear on screen, she is one of the most persistently sales-oriented and could hang with the toughest of David Mamet's phone scammers. By turns sultry, pitiful, and practical ("Have you ever even seen your soul? Do you even know what it does? It's really just like your appendix - you'll never miss it."), she is always the ultimate Closer. Yet it's also never really in doubt that those with a glimmer of goodness can slip the bonds of her contract with no hard feelings on her part.Fraser's Elliot, who is almost always the dupe, is hilariously baffled by the persona the Devil has given him. Plagued in each adventure by the same guys who torment him at the office, he can never figure out what has gone wrong with his wish until it is too late. It's delightful to see this fine actor strutting the comic range he is capable of playing in all of his character's various selves, as well as the simplicity with which he returns to being the same old Elliot, wiser, at the end.Fine supporting work by Orlando Wilson, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss as Elliot's co-workers and karmic cast members. Great script by Ramis, Larry Gelbart of M.A.S.H. and Oh, God, and Peter Tolan (Analyze This, The Larry Sanders Show).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Episodic, semi-successful comedy with Fraser at comic best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE I've been convinced that BRENDAN FRASER is one of the brightest new talents to come along in ages. He gets a chance to show how clever he is at concealing his real self in BEDAZZLED, starting as a nerdy office worker and going through a series of changes in an effort to make a pact with The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley). None of his wishes are successful because each one has a hitch devised by the cunning Hurley to backfire. I never saw the original with Dudley Moore, but here I can see that the script stands in the way of delivering a solid comedy despite Brendan's flair for this sort of thing. He reaches the peak of his comic talent with his impersonation of a Latin millionaire, guaranteed to draw laughs.But much of the story is too episodic for the results to be anything more than reasonably satisfying. Hurley goes about her role with a sexy seductiveness that is almost as overwhelming for the viewer as it is for Fraser's character. Summing up: Fraser's fans will enjoy his multi-faceted romp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved the original so much over the years, I did not have much hope for this version. But I was pleasantly surprised. Harold Ramis wrote a new script based on the concept of the original movie, and he did a good job. Elizabeth Hurley plays a gleeful devil and amply fills out every outfit she wears; but Brendan Fraser steals the show. His acting and characterizations were outstanding. Lots of fun.Like the two versions of the Thomas Crown Affair, there are now two versions of Bedazzled that are both worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully funny movie for Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I saw this movie a couple days early as part of promo through a local TV and radio station. This is a VERY good movie. Brendon Frasier is a truly brilliant actor. His flexibility is truly showcased in this movie because of the variety of situations that come up. There were many times when I laughed out loud.And Elizabeth Hurley is a GREAT unconventional Devil. It is really refreshing to see something other than the mustached, horned, caped figure that seems to have permeated our cultural mythology. Ms. Hurley plays the Devil as seductive and inviting and yet devious and untrustworthy. Truly is a delight.I highly recommend this movie as a pleasant, light-hearted alternative to the typically very dark movies that seem to come in October but which still manages to maintain that Halloween spirit.</fullReview>

Stories about the devil and the wishes he or she grants is always an eye catcher, the struggle between Good &amp; Evil. Elizabeth Hurley (The Devil),"Bad Boy",'02 was very sexy as a devil and almost kept Brendon Fraser(Elliot Richards),"Monkey Bone",'01 from meeting his true love Francis O'Connor,(Alison Gardner),"Book of Love",'04. Elliot truly loved Alison and even told the devil,"I JUST WANT ALISON TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE", which made The Devil quite mad. If you just want to enjoy a film and be entertained, don't miss this crazy comedy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting too much when I rented this movie. In fact, I thought I'd probably end up turning it off after a half hour, as it looked in the trailer like it would be one of those silly, go for the gag-laughs Hollywood pieces of junk. What a surprise! This was an excellent, entertaining film that I thoroughly enjoyed. It's basically a love story, but far from a "chick flick"(yeah, I'm a guy), it's a clever one that is well written, has a number of different subplots that are interesting to see played out, and deftly mixes comic overtones with a touching character study. I wasn't a particular fan of Brendan Fraser till now, but I was blown away by the way he perfectly captured the number of different personalities portrayed in the movie. Even the technical aspects of the movie are impressive: in one scenario the special effects wizards make Fraser into a 7'6'' pro basketball player that is totally convincing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seductive Elizabeth Hurley as the devil and multi-talented Brendan Fraser as the hapless victim whose soul she demands, make an unbeatable combination. "Bedazzled" is not a remake of "Faust" but incorporates many elements of that tale. The movie points out the fallacies in our modern culture of material acquisition. Our hero has seven wishes--each one more hilarious and flawed as the last. He learns his lesson but in a very subtle and entertaining manner.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat disappointing yet slightly worth the money - Contains spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After highly anticipating the release of this movie, I still waited a week before I went to actually see it in the theater. The previews made this movie out to be a slapstick humor with the sex-appeal of Elizabeth Hurley in her fascinating wardrobe.Unlike what others have said, I was fairly disappointed with the performances of both Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley. Although, I would blame that mostly on the roles that were scripted. No matter how good the actor is, they cannot do a good job playing a poorly written role. The character development was not thought out very well, the choices that Fraser makes are illogical (anyone would figure out that extremes don't work after two or three tries, not five), and Hurley plays too sweet of a devil. That's not all together a bad thing, the sweetness of her character adds to the seductive nature of Satan, but I don't feel like it fit. It almost seemed as though the film portrayed God and Satan as old chums, not enemies.If you don't want to spoil the ending, don't read on.I feel that the ending in this movie does allow for the fairy tale "they all lived happily ever after" feeling, but I'm still not happy with it. Having a clause in the contract that says truly benevolent wishes void the contract is a cop out. Well, perhaps not entirely, but how Hurley reacted to his wish was very disappointing. I'm sure Satan would have been furious that someone had escaped being damned into Hell. The ending gave you a feel that Hurley and Fraser would now be friends.Maybe it's just my religious beliefs that kept me from truly enjoying this movie. Despite all the disappointments, I would still rate this with 8/10. The guy in me tells me it deserves 10/10 just for the outfits Hurley wears, but the critic knocks it down to 8/10, mainly due to my disappointment in the script. Overall, spend your money on this one, you'll probably enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pete and Dud meet the devil in California - and she's English</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Faust legend is a robust story. Although selling one's soul to the Devil is serious stuff, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore managed to make a light-hearted movie of it in 'Bedazzled' back in the swinging sixties. Here, a featherweight Hollywood director Harold Ramis ('Caddyshack,' 'Ghostbusters', Groundhog Day') has remade it, shifting the location from London to San Francisco. However an English actor, Elizabeth Hurley, still plays the Devil , this time tempting a nerdish Brendan Fraser.The story is a collection of linked episodes as Brendan tries out various fantasies, which all come with a catch eg 'rich and powerful?' Try Columbian drug lord. With each wish he pursues his fellow worker Alison, (Frances O'Connor) whom he has admired from afar for years, but always something goes wrong. Altruism saves the day, and the Devil is vanquished, but I think it would have been a lot more fun if Brendan had gone off with her (the Devil that is) instead. Elizabeth Hurley is not a great actor (Joanna Lumley would have been much better) but this part suits her fairly well. She plays it like a cruise director with a limited range of emotions, but up front enough to be engaging. The part is almost too big for her and she doesn't have the support of Pride, Lust, Avarice and the rest as Peter Cook did in the 1967 film. Brendan Fraser is a fine actor with a good range and does the cameos required here with considerable skill.This film is pretty light, frothy and forgettable, but once or twice the voice of Pete and Dud comes thought the script to reminds us that those consummate comics had a tip or two about life and living. Your soul may not be yours to sell, but Heaven and Hell are here on earth, and where you go is largely up to you. Alas, Pete and Dud are gone, but their work still has the power to amuse. This is a pretty flabby re-make, but Hurley and Fraser are effective and some of the comic spirit is still there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bedazzled stars one of my favourite actors Brendan Fraser who plays office geek Elliot Richards, who doesn't have any luck with women, including Alison, (Frances O'Connor.) a woman he really likes. One day, he meets 'The Devil', played by Elizabeth Hurley, who tells him that she can grant him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. He agrees, and some of the wishes granted end up with him being a cute Italian guy, a really tall basketball player, an ultra-sensitive guy and much more.Brendan Fraser is a great as usual and Frances O'Connor is good too. I don't really think Miss. Hurley is a good job but considering that, I thought she was okay here and her outfits in the movie were so cute.Bedazzled is a great movie, which will guarantee quite a few laughs a long the way. It's a lot of fun and I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold Ramis' Bedazzled wasn't as I expected, and I don;t mean that in a totally good way. The plot follows the 1967 version somewhat as a goofy yet charming computer geek (Brendan Fraser who makes this film almost watchable) who wants a girl more than anything. So, he meets the devil (played by a somewhat miscast Liz Hurley) who will give him 7 wishes, for one soul, but unfortunately, each one backfires (even if each one has a couple of laughs). Overdone too much and while there are some good parts, they are overshadowed by an overall bad quality. Which is unfair coming from the comic veteran Ramis (of National Lampoon, Animal House, Vacation, Stripes, SCTV, Ghostbusters, Groundhog's Day and Analyze This fame). C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people have criticized this film and not without reason, but I still find it pretty fun with some really very funny parts. It certainly is better than many of Fraser's other comedies, but can't hold a candle to Blast from the Past.It is not exactly original or brilliant, but it basically succeeds at being entertaining. Some of the scenarios in which Fraser's character found himself are really very funny and work quite well at achieving their comic effect, even though a number of parts aren't all that funny or intelligent.The film is not without its valuable message, either, even though it is an ancient and very well-worn one. The whole point about simply trying to be who you are, not wishing for the world, riches, etc., is still relevant and meaningful, giving the film at least some additional depth. Thus, it is a little bit (however little it is) more than purely mindless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil's Doo-doo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why remake this film? It would seem to me that the only reason would be if the first incarnation suffered in some way. Although seeing it today, the only flaw the original 'Bedazzled' has is that it is outdated by our modern lifestyles. Peter Cook and Dudley Moore made a very funny team back in the sixties and their version of 'Bedazzled' really out-performs the remake. Even the love interest (Eleanor Bron) had more personality in the original. I recommend seeing the 1967 'Bedazzled' if you are over the age of thirty and leaving this new one for kids who don't know any better.Both films are about a misfit (Moore in the original, Brendan Fraser here) who is unhappy and lonely in life. Along comes the Devil (Cook in the original, Elizabeth Hurley here) who grants him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. (The whole idea is itself based on a Faust legend from 400 years ago.) Sure, Hurley is gorgeous and more pleasing to the eye than Peter Cook, but she doesn't have the truly demonic disposition required to carry this role off. Cook had a mean streak throughout the first film that made you believe he was rotten. He also had the seven deadly sins around him as his helpers to punctuate what was happening to Moore's character. The Devil had his own agenda in the original. Even the ending of the 1967 film was far superior to this sappy denouement.The elements they should have worked on updating here are the wishes themselves. The efforts of Fraser's character should have focussed on refining what he wished for to adjust for judgment errors in his past wishes. Instead, he just makes knee-jerk wishes that turn out terrible and wasteful. In fact his very first wish had more stipulations than successive wishes. When the deal is first struck, he is skeptical yet thoughtful. He words his wishes carefully. By the second wish, he forgot what went wrong the first time and tries to correct it by overcompensating. A character like Fraser's Elliot would have truly put some thought into each wish. The fun would have been Hurley finding a hole that he didn't account for. Now THAT would have been a hell of a movie!I did not entirely hate this remake of 'Bedazzled.' There were quite a few laughs. And I might have even liked this and gone on to recommend it had I not seen the original. I am disappointed with director Harold Ramis. In his hands, I would have thought this would have outsparkled the original 'Bedazzled.' I guess the devil made him do it. (Sorry about that. I couldn't resist.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my guilty pleasures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of my guilty pleasures. You know, one of those films that you shouldn't really like but actually do. I guess it helps that I've always had a bit of a thing about Liz Hurley and her role here as the devil suits her perfectly, and her limitations as an actress don't really matter here.The other main character and another good looking woman is Frances O'Connor as Alison. She's lovely and a great actress here. In addition, Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss play a variety of characters very nicely.Brendan Fraser holds the whole thing together. He plays nerdy Elliot, who works with Alison though he is invisible to her. He says he would give anything to have her as a girlfriend. This is an invitation for the devil to offer him seven wishes in exchange for his soul... as long as he signs the contract.There follow five very funny cameos where Elliot takes different personas in order to win Alison. Each is doomed to end in failure. He asks to be (1) rich and powerful, (2) emotionally sensitive, (3) a famous athlete, (4) intelligent, witty and well-endowed, (5) President of the United States. Every scenario has a twist that he did not expect. The devil gives Elliot misleading advice in her own cameos between these scenes.Some reviewers have compared this version unfavourably to the Peter Cook &amp; Dudley Moore version. It's best not to compare them. The films are sufficiently different to enjoy each one in its own right.There are many scenes here that are laugh-out-loud, even on a repeat viewing. If there's a weak point it's the final half hour. Yes it does sort of tie the whole thing together but the pace slows and it tries too hard for a 'happy ever after' finish. Maybe a darker ending would have been better. But overall, great fun, great dialogue and great acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the 1960's film starring Dudley Moore and the late great Peter Cook, Bedazzled tells the story of a nerdy man who is, in his estimation, a failure in life and love. One day this man meets the devil, and a bargain is struck for seven wishes for a soul. Bedazzled is one of those films that is out-and-out sheer lunacy. It is one ridiculous premise after another, heightened by some superb comedy writing, directing, and performing. Elizabeth Hurley easily makes the most seductive, lust-inspiring demon to grace any film. She oozes sex in every word and body swish. Throughout the course of the film, she and the wardrobe department have obvious fun as she squeezes into some amazing outfits that leave little to the imagination. Aside from her apparent beauty and sex-appeal, she also can act! Brendan Fraser plays the nerdy and socially incompetent Elliot. Fraser is one of those actors that is very likable and has a natural sense of charm and humour. He changes looks during each wish, and just seeing how the make-up department changes him each time is amazing. Fraser is the comic soul of this film, and it is his ability to take the material at hand and transform it into laughs that really made the film an enjoyable experience. Some highlights include him playing an over-sensitive man who cries at the sunset. He turns into President Lincoln and flinches as a champagne cork pops at a play. He plays a basketball star that sweats gallons. And there are so many more. I can honestly say that this film made me laugh long and hard. Not an easy feat to do, especially in a world filled with adolescent tripe. Bedazzled is humourous on many levels. Is it better than its original? I don't think so, but that was a different kind of comedy. It was much more philosophical. This film is going for the jugular comedy vein, and it gets it early and holds on till the end. Director Harold Ramis does an incredible job pacing the laughs.</fullReview>

O'k, o'k, that's just my female blah-blah-blah. :) I only want to say that this movie shows 1) There are a lot of very unhappy people who are not like others because of their shyness etc. And to laugh at them instead of helping them is mean 2) If you want your dreams to come true - please do something for this because nobody will care about you better than you do 3) Women don't know what they really want 4) From me: I'd love to date someone of this type! :) (sometimes women make correct choices - you see!) I'd also like to add that really good comedies are rare and this is one of those rare cases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though admittedly many would call this movie stupid, I actually really liked it. I never like movies like this so it was a surprise. From the second it started with the whole people tag idea I started to enjoy it. Brendan Fraser is a great actor for character shifting comedies such as this.Elizabeth Hurley could have been better, but, it didn't really bother me. The one surprising/refreshing thing about this movie was that it was rather more unexpected then I thought it would be. In each situation I was always wandering, ok, in what amusing way did she mess it up for him this time. The screen play was also not bad at all. Lastly, I really enjoyed watching all the characters transform. Anyway, I rather fancy I'd want to watch it a third time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gently Amusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this review by saying Bedazzled is a Brendan Fraser vehicle. All of his films are enjoyable, but none of them have or never will be classics. This is another one of those one's, enjoyable at the time, but definitely no masterpiece.Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is a nice but lonely guy. He is madly in love with a co-worker, and one day plucks up the courage to speak to her, only to be embarrassed when she doesn't recognise him and walks off. Thinking that he will never be able to make it with a girl like that, along comes the Devil, in the shape of Liz Hurley, offering him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. He accepts, but discovers that his wishes backfire with unforeseen consequences.Mariah Carey lookalike Frances O'Connor makes for a nice supporting gal, and Brendan Fraser is watchable as always. But, here Liz Hurley really steals the show as the wish ruining devil. She is extremely watchable and steals most of the movie's highpoints. Another bonus is her in some mouth wateringly revealing clothes. Each time Elliot asks for a new wish, the Devil makes a creative and gently amusing way to ruin it, which gives the film an imaginative and hilarious side to boot. However, Bedazzled suffers from some flaws; the Devil's nightclub scenes are pointless, the sunset crying from Fraser becomes irritating and some of the scenes aren't half as funny or imaginative as they could've been. And the ending is a bit disappointing, although not as immediately predictable as you may think.Bedazzled is forgettable and quite silly, but it makes for some fun entertainment on a Friday. Better than you'd expect, but not MUCH better.I rate Bedazzled 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bedazzled sees director Harold Ramis return to the gentle comedy genre that he struck gold with in 'Groundhog Day'. There certainly are similarities with the main character repeatedly having chances to try and impress his love interest but that's about where it ends. Instead we have a loose remake of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's 1969 tale of temptation, the main difference being that in this age of female empowerment the devil is played by Liz Hurley. After a fantastic opening credit sequence of a global search for a suitable soul, we are introduced to the main character, Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser), who is like an American version of Colin from 'The Fast Show', a computer helpline operative seriously lacking in both social skills and sense of humour. His colleagues try their hardest to exclude him from their circle, while the apple of his eye has spoken to him once, to the extent of discussing the weather (it was wet). Without further ado, the devil visits him and offers him a faustian pact to the tune of seven wishes in exchange for his soul. The deal breaker is the prospect of impressing Alison, his sweetheart who doesn't even know he exists. Of course, this being a contract with Lucifer, the wishes manage to backfire and so we get to see how each of his utopias manage to go horribly wrong.The concept of different wishes providing Elliot with completely different lives makes the film seem like a series of themed sketches and plays like a medley of 'Quantum Leap' episodes. It also allows Fraser to showcase his comedy talents in portraying several subtly different roles, from sensitive new man to basketball star, which he does to great effect while still retaining enough of Elliot's core to make him recognisable. He is helped in this by some neat make-up work and in the case of the basketballer, nicely employed computer graphics to make him tower over everyone else. It's not just Elliot who is reinvented with each new wish but also the rest of the cast, who have great fun cropping up in very different roles for Alison and Elliot's workmates within each reality. Hurley does little more than turn up in various stripper outfits that will undoubtedly have those nice people in the advertising department of Estee Lauder in cardiac arrest. This is actually the best performance I have seen from her, and although anyone who has seen her in other films will know this is nothing to get excited about, she revels in her role as Beelzebub and though her acting is as wooden as ever, she manages to occasionally show the flair for light comedy that we first glimpsed in 'Austin Powers'. She also gets the lion's share of the lovely throwaway gags that litter the script, which also has some nice little knowing touches such as a filing cabinet made of mortician's slabs and hounds of hell named Peter and Dudley to name check the plot's original creators.Despite me thinking that I would inevitably be disappointed after seeing the visual A-Bomb that is the 'Charlie's Angels' trailer sear it's way across the scene moments before, I found this film pleasantly diverting. It's a gently humorous yarn, which while not containing the gross-out set pieces of more recent comedies (with one knob joke and no swear words, this is no 'American Pie') has a nice enough premise and sufficient opportunities for chuckling to keep you entertained. The only disappointment is an ending that feels a little rushed and predictable, but I'm hard-pushed to think of an alternative to this studio-pleasing wrap up considering the mood of the rest of the film. It won't challenge or shock, but it's well worth a couple of hours of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though Elizabeth Hurley plays The Devil she is a goddess.Brendan Fraser is certainly adequate to the job of playing Elliot Richards but Ms. Hurley steals the film.She is perfectly cast as the `Princess of Darkness' and seems to truly enjoy exposing her darker side.Brendan Fraser turns in a real acting tour d'force playing eight different characters. Possibly because of all the widely divergent characters he is playing he is not truly great in any of them ? though he is hysterically funny ? due primarily to the superb script by Larry Gelbart (of television's M*A*S*H fame), Harold Ramis (who also directed) and Peter Tolan from the original screen play by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.The Devil's demons (which appear in nearly every scene in one form or another) are great supporting roles played by Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein and Toby Huss. They provide just the right touch of devilish humour, charm and wit. Another bit of casting genius and writing is Gabriel Casseus as Elliot's cellmate who expounds on the soul and is later seen playing chess with The Devil (who cheats, of course).In fact all of the supporting characters were perfectly cast and brilliantly executed.The script was so tight and well written that it was almost actor-proof. It was even able to carry a moral message without slamming the audience in the head with it.To paraphrase an idea from the film ?you get out of life [and this film] what you put into it.This was an all-around good film with good direction, good jokes, good acting, excellent make-up (especially on Brendan Fraser by Ben Nye, Jr.) and a good yet unobtrusive score. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent... but could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bedazzled has a basic "Be careful what you wish for" premise. Brendan Fraser plays Elliot. He is a relatively annoying cubicle dweller who has few friends and no love life. One night at a bar he meets up with who else but Satan herself! Yadda Yadda, etc etc, and he signs away his soul for seven wishes. As you may expect, his wishes turn out to have some fatal flaw that is exploited by the devil and comic hi-jinks ensue.While this movie isn't going to blow anyone away, it was definately above average. Brendan Fraser did an admirable job playing multiple 'characters' during the wish sequences. Although his base character introduced at the beginning of the film may have been a bit over the top. I think it's his best performance since "School Ties". Elizabeth Hurley provides little more than eye candy as the devil. The supporting cast of Elliot's friends is also quite good as they too travel with him throughout the wish sequences.I only had two major complaints about the plot. First, Elliot never learns from his mistakes. He continues time and again to make very open-ended and generic wishes. By the third or fourth wish you can pretty much predict the outcome. Second, the love interest, played by Frances O'Conner isn't really defined enough early on. It seems the only reason she is the love interest is because she's a hot blond who happens to work at the same company as Elliot.If you take the movie for what it is, you'll enjoy yourself. However, I feel Bedazzled could have been so much better had Elliot not been so dumb. A battle of wits between Elliot (making wishes) and the devil (sabotaging the wishes) would have given the film a great added angle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was like making a good sandwich with Wonder Bread. The beginning is slow, and I didn't like the end, but the middle was funny as hell.It takes a long time for this movie to really get started. Elliot Richardson is such a loser at the beginning that it is painful to watch. He isn't even one of those lovable losers like Rob Schneider's copy man. He is a painfully annoying loser. His office mates are probably the biggest jerks that anyone has ever had the misfortune of working with.Just about the time I was getting really uncomfortable watching such annoying characters the movie finally starts. Once Elliot meets the devil the movie gets pretty good. Parts are a lot like `George of The Jungle.' There are a lot of really corny lines, and site gags. Brendan Fraser does those type of lines really well, and I really enjoyed them.Elizabeth Hurley has been panned for her performance, but I thought she did quite well. She seemed a perfect fit for the devil, and I could really picture her as a devilish vixen toying with Elliot's mind. A lot like Lucy holding the ball for Charlie Brown, the devil gets Elliot's trust only to pull everything out from under him. The idea of the devil being a vixen works better than an old man, but Peter Cook is a better actor than Elizabeth Hurley. Anyway, just being Elizabeth Hurley is worth a few bucks right there.The movie built well on itself. Each wish was a little faster paced and funnier than the last. Right as his wishes were coming to an end I was thinking he was close to a classic.Then the end came. The last half hour of this thing turns from a corny comedy (a very good one at that) to a sappy fable (and not the greatest either). It wasn't awful, it just was a bit cookie cutter and corporate. Everything was put into its nice little package, and everyone feels good at the end.All in all, not a bad way to spend two hours.</fullReview>

Brendan Fraser is funny as always, with so many transformations he does so well, but Elizabeth Hurley steals the show. She never looked better, and never put on such a convincing performance. Really hard to imagine a better devil in a comedy.I have seen unfavorable reviews of this movie, cannot really say why. It's no masterpiece, and I must admit not having seen the original, but this is still a very funny and intelligent movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Pretty much common in comedy films these days... He loves a certain girl and so is driven to some extent in selfish wish making by a certain biblical figure! How he overcomes his deviation forms the rest of the story.The movie does sag a drift after the interval. Also some coherence is missing in the narrative. But the movie is fun to watch onetime.

		<shortDescription>Making a pact with the devil can be fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Bedazzled", Brendan Fraser stars as Elliot, a likable loser who tries hard but just doesn't have many friends, and he hopelessly pines for Allison (Frances O'Connor). Then the devil shows up. The devil is Elizabeth Hurley in sexy outfits who, in exchange for his soul, will grant him wishes.This is a comedy, which is fairly funny with a number of witty lines and a few clever concepts. There are of course comedic mishaps each time the devil grants him a wish and it doesn't play out as he expected. The movie plays as a series of vignettes joined together and introduced with Elliot making another wish with the devil. It can seem disjointed if you don't like vignette-type films.Brendan Fraser is finally playing the type of role he is meant to play as a hopeless dweeb and morphs into his other characters with comedy. Elizabeth Hurley is, in one word, sexy. She is, in all senses, the devil."Bedazzled" is occasionally over the top, but then again, we are making a pact with the devil. The devil is certainly known to distort the truth, except this time it really is enjoyable fun.</fullReview>

Nothing oscar material. But he always does his best, despite that I think he'll never get out of these roles. "Bedazzled" has some funny moments. I would recommend this if it's a rainy day.

		<fullReview>Pointless and almost entirely laugh-free re-imagining of the old Pete &amp; Dud stalwart, with Hurley playing the devil and Fraser the witless goon who offers her his soul for seven wishes. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the funny bits.Fraser's usual amiable charm isn't quite up to the task of making this one work. He plays Elliot Richards, who at the beginning of the movie is a stepped-upon geek, annoying to his work colleagues and invisible to the love of his life, Alison (O'Connor). When he proclaims he'd do anything to be with Alison, the devil appears to offer him a deal.What follows is a string of scenes that mostly miss the mark, as the wily devil takes Elliot's wishes and twists them out of context. Naturally by the end of the movie Elliot has learned his lesson, and somewhere along the way he magically sheds his geeky persona and becomes a really cool guy. Oh dear lord.If there's a plus point to this movie, it's the array of fetish clothing that Hurley manages to appear in, running the gamut from schoolgirl uniform to red leather catsuit (the French Maid outfit is in the deleted scenes). If you think this is reason enough to watch the whole film, well who am I to argue? That's why I was watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The British style of the original Bedazzled is, quite frankly, wacky, and that's an understatement. This version is more streamlined and glitzy in Hollywood language and it still works -- quite well, in fact. I enjoyed Elizabeth Hurley's Devil and thought that she'd make a great counterpart to Peter Cook. Perhaps she's Mrs. Satan and wants to work outside the home while Peter is off damning others to Hell? (BTW, I thought the Peter/Dudley dobies were a nice touch.)Brendan Fraser does his usual dopey-guy routine and his alter ego stories have varying results from less funny (the athlete) to the screamingly hysterical (the overly sensitive dolphin and sunset obsessed guy). But overall, he's a really pleasing performer.This movie is a nice and inoffensive way to spend 90 minutes. But for the dry British wit that is missing, definitely make sure you see the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bedazzled is a maddeningly flat attempt to remake a classic. It isn't horrid, but I suppose people as talented as Harold Ramis and Brendon Fraser would really have to try to produce a really bad film. The problem seems to be pacing--this version seems content to hit a so-so joke every couple of minutes, while the original was much more consistently funny. This version is hardly trying--in the original, the magic words were "Julie Andrews!", here they're "I wish". Does "I wish" seem funny to you? The big difference is of course casting Elizabeth Hurley as the Devil. As an actress, Ms. Hurley has very nice breasts. That's probably unfair, she's not bad and does bring a sense of panache to the role, but she raises a problem--why would the main character still be interested in his co-worker after getting a gander at Ms. Hurley's cleavage? Fraser is sensational, and probably deserves an Oscar nod if people in comedies ever got Oscar nominations. Fraser is just about the only actor who can go from drama (With Honors) to action (The Mummy) to comedy (George of the Jungle) and be credible in each. He handles his various roles impeccably. But the screenplay is flat and listless, and seemingly goes from set-up to set-up with no motivation. The ending is straight out of the blue, although it does make a certain amount of sense. Still, Bedazzled is a far cry from the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEDAZZLED (2000) **1/2 Brendan Fraser, Elizabeth Hurley, Frances O' Connor, Miriam Shor, Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, Toby Huss. (Dir: Harold Ramis) The old adage: `Be careful what you wish for, For you might receive it' clearly applies to this remake of the 1967 cult Brit classic starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook in this updated farce of the old `Faust' legend, but this time with a formidable lead actor and a director of fine comedic pedigree. The former being Fraser cast as a hopeless schlub named Elliot who works as a computer techie in a San Francisco conglomerate where he is disdained by his fellow employees as his self-deluded friends and is equally hapless in love with another co-worker (well let's be frank, some babe who also works in the skyscraper that he spoke to once 4 years ago). Obviously inept at the social graces he makes a boob of himself one night at the local watering hole summoning up the gumption to speak to the fair Alison (O'Connor) with only a tight smile of constrained indifference and when he looks to his friends for a moment, she simply leaves him in his wake walking out of the bar. Speaking to himself and wishing to do anything to have the lady of his dreams fall madly for him sets up the chain of events involving the Devil in A Red Dress (the sultry Hurley having some fun here) to proposition the dorky Elliot into selling his soul to Her for 7 wishes/chances in gaining Alison to be his. The set ups are uneven at best but humorous thanks largely to the always game and amiable Fraser who has a finely tuned comedic grace and delves into his seven incarnations with gusto. Hurley, who is no doubt about it devilishly hot in her many form fitting costumes of debauchery, fumbles a bit here and there but she drips sexuality that sadly the pretty O' Connor fails to elicit for her character (it's vexing to have the fantasy girl of the protagonist's desires to be standard when you have the bodacious Hurley as Satan Herself, popping out of her barely-there outfits). The second part of what makes the re-shaping of the farce is Ramis (who co-wrote the screenplay with his longtime creative partner Peter Tolan and icon scribe Larry Gelbart, who's career encompasses everything from The Golden Age of Television Comedy with Sid Caesar to `Tootsie' and tv's `M*A*S*H' not to mention the 180 equivalent of this flick, `Oh, God!' with George Burns as The Almighty) whose sublime, low-key approach allows the one-liners and slapstick congeal into one substantial mold whereby the characters you care about and the humor rings a beat after it delivers. That is the signature of a true master of the genre but sad to say it isn't consistent throughout and equally troubling is that you can almost see where each variation of Elliot is heading (and largely you don't sense any true menace from the seemingly harmless Hurley - well at least until there is one knee-knocking moment where she's a giantess in a flame-red bikini top clearly getting to the point of not fooling with Ol' Scratch; oh baby!) The loophole laden premise is amusing to watch unspool on the two-steps behind Elliot but the journey itself becomes tiring and that is what makes this naughty comedy two steps behind being hellaciously hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The credits include the following line: `special thanks to Stanley Donen'. For what? Not complaining? If this film hadn't been released, Donen's original "Bedazzled" might have been re-released, and I might have got a chance to see it. I'm sure it's better.Peter Cook's devil in the original was (by all accounts) not just a plot device, but a character. Elizabeth Hurley's devil is no more than a granter of wishes and a changer of costumes. All the same I think I preferred her to Brendan Fraser, because I at least had SOME idea what kind of character she was meant to be playing. She was playing the Devil. She may not have had much personality, but at least she didn't CHANGE personalities whenever she changed costumes, as Fraser did.There's a scene at the end where Elliot (the Brendan Fraser character, the dupe) finally stands up to the office workers who had been making his life hell. You can only buy that scene by forgetting the start of the movie. They didn't make his life hell - HE made THEIR lives hell. He continually forced himself on all of them with his inane blather and his almost sickening craving to be accepted; and while they all loathed him, they were never openly rude or hurtful. (Until the end, when one of them made fun of him simply so that he could be punished for doing so.)We're never sure if Fraser is meant to be a geek, a doormat, or an everyman. If he's meant to be all three at once, the script fails to establish this, either. When he's thrust into strange situations it's never as funny as it might have been, since don't know where his reactions are coming from. Treat the disjointed story as sketch comedy, though, and it fares little better: the jokes aren't imaginative enough. Take that opening sequence, in which the devil "freeze-frames" randomly chosen individuals and we see tags like "good", "evil" and "drinks from the carton". Unfortunately, "drinks from the carton" is about as clever as it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where it's really hard to put your finger on where it exactly went wrong. It has a good director, a great cast and inventive scenarios, but the movie left me wondering why I wasn't laughing when I thought it was supposed to be a comedy. The only bright spot in this movie were the makeup-effects work (mainly on Branden Frasier), slick special effects and that piece of female perfection that is Elizabeth Hurley. If you find her as beautiful as I do, then you'll really want to check out this movie just for her "performance". She goes throughout the whole movie wearing very skimpy and revealing outfits that clearly was the reason for the PG-13 rating. The red bikini was my personal favorite......WOW!!But for everyone else there isn't much to recommend here. It's just not that funny or entertaining and just comes across as bland.rating:the movie:3 Elizabeth Hurley: 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main problem with this version of "Bedazzled" is that it wants to be loved. The Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original had a cynical bite that is completely missing here. It was also concerned not just with the schlemiel's wishes, but with what makes the Devil tick. Why does he do what he does? What's his relationship with God? Unfortunately, that movie's viewpoint that God is generally far more callous and satanic than Satan is not even hinted at here.That being said, this version does what it wants to do very well. Elizabeth Hurley is hot and Brendan Fraser again proves to be a likable and versatile actor. He also convinced me: you can believe Dudley Moore as an unnoticed little shnook. But Brendan Fraser??? Well, he does it.This is a good (safe) American version of an acerbic British classic. It is well worth seeing (at matine prices.) I just hope this means that the original will become available on DVD now. *That* one is a keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the 1967 original version of "Bedazzled", so I can't compare this 2000 version re-make to the original. With that in mind, I can say that this 2000 version is actually a fun and entertaining movie.The story is about Elliot (played by Brendan Fraser) whom is an overlooked guy desperate for attention and acceptance. When he runs into a very charming woman, who turns out to be the Devil (played by Elizabeth Hurley), he is given 7 wishes by trading his soul to the Devil. Can Elliot manage to find happiness, love and respect through his wishes? What works for "Bedazzled" is the hilarious situations that Elliot ends up in through means of his wishes, as the Devil tends to put a wicked twist on each wish, resulting in something other than what Elliot had hoped for.The cast were doing their part to make the movie work. And the two lead parts as played by Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley had great chemistry together and they both lifted up the movie quite well. Brendan Fraser was well-cast for the role of a dweeb character. While Elizabeth Hurley was no menacing Devil, she sure had the charm and sales pitch to pull off the role. And the supporting cast of Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein and Toby Huss were also hilarious in their various roles throughout the movie.Director Harold Ramis had a great sense of comedy touch and "Bedazzled" bears witness to that quite well."Bedazzled" is a fun movie and a movie that can be watched more than once. I am rating it a solid six out of ten stars. If you enjoy comedies, then "Bedazzled" is worth sitting down for 93 minutes to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elizabeth Hurley, still best known for her '90s relationship with Hugh Grant, and Brendan Fraser, star of Furry Vengeance, team up for this 2000 remake of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook's acerbic 1967 comedy Bedazzled: it sounds like a recipe for disaster, but even though the style of comedy is far removed from the original, Bedazzled 2000 succeeds in delivering its fair share of laughs, as well plenty of sexiness courtesy of Hurley.Fraser plays social pariah Elliot, who finds it hard to make friends and can only dream of a relationship with the apple of his eye, work colleague Alison (Frances O'Connor). When Elliot says that he would do anything to have Alison in his life, the Devil (Hurley) seizes the opportunity and offers the luckless loser seven wishes in exchange for his soul. What follows is a series of comedic episodes that see Fraser adopting numerous different guises, allowing the actor to surprise the audience with his versatility (Fraser is almost unrecognisable at times), while Hurley is predictably wooden, but distracts the viewer by slipping into several very sexy outfits for the connecting interludes.Of course, the devil being the devil, none of Elliot's wishes go according to plan, which leads to some very funny situations for the hapless dork, all of which are confidently handled by director Harold Ramis. This being a Hollywood film, it all works out well in the end for Elliot, who beats the princess of darkness at her own game thanks to his selfless heart, before finding love, not with Alison, but with her dorky doppelganger who just happens to have moved in next door.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for giving me the phrase 'small, wet, salty badges of emotional truth' and for Hurley's amazing array of hotter-than-hell get-ups, which include sexy nurse, sexy traffic warden, sexy cop, sexy teacher, sexy cheerleader, sexy bikini, sexy angel, sexy lawyer, and, in the deleted 'rock star' scene, sexy maid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bedazzled (2000): Dir: Harold Ramis / Cast: Brendan Fraser, Elizabeth Hurley, Orlando Jones, Frances O'Connor, Brian Doyle- Murray: Title represents disbelief when expectations are not met but it falls short on its knowledge of Satan. As played by Elizabeth Hurley he is likable particularly when Hurley expresses affection for Brendan Fraser in the conclusion. Satan loves nobody and delights in seeing humanity fall apart. When a female co-worker ignores him he says he would give anything to have her. Hurley appears and willing to grant three wishes in return for his soul. Deceit infects plans as when he asks to be rich and she turns him into a drug lord. Conclusion is no surprise with bogus setup and repetitious storytelling. Inventive directing by Harold Ramis but this is a set back in comparison to his Caddyshack, Groundhog Day or National Lampoon's Vacation. Fraser is funny and given challenging material as he struggles to find the catch to each wish. Hurley gives faults impression of Satan in the film's biggest flaw. Frances O'Connor as the fixation is seen in different setups for which wish Frasrer makes. Orlando Jones is also featured in this visual lunacy. This is not a pleasant comedy like some of the other ventures that Ramis has done. The Bible teaches that in God's presence Satan flees, which is what viewers should do at the screening.

		<fullReview>For most people, the conversation goes like this... 'Have you seen Bedazzled?' 'No, what's it about?' 'It's got Liz Hurley in it.' That would be where the conversation normally ends. It's fair to say that Ms Hurley is hardly known for her acting abilities. And good reason for it. Yes, she's a pretty face, but her looks don't always translate to talent on screen. However, in Bedazzled, she doesn't come off too bad. No, no one ever said that her failing to win an Oscar for her role as the devil was a travesty, but the whole package is watchable enough if you're in the mood for something lightweight and frothy.Brendan Fraser is the star ? playing a socially awkward geek who's desperately in love with a girl he works with. Naturally, he has no chance, until Ms Hurley (or the devil, but without the trident and horns) shows up and offers him seven wishes (for the minor price of his soul). He accepts and we're treated so a kind of extended clip show of what his wishes would be like. Of course, by dealing with the devil, nothing really goes how he would like.It's hardly deep and meaningful. Every time Fraser makes a wish, the devil makes it go wrong. Rinse and repeat. Yet it's still pretty good fun to watch. Fraser is as good as he ever is and naturally endearing for the role. Hurley still struggles to portray real emotion, even with the limited script she's given, but this is truly a case where her looks win us over. She really looks like the devil (might, if the devil was a hot woman) and so can be forgiven for her acting shortcomings.If you're in the mood for something daft and reasonably amusing to watch together on the sofa, this is definitely worth an hour and a half of your time. I wouldn't say buy it on Blu-ray and keep it forever, but if you're in the right frame of mind, it's not a bad way to waste time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant if unremarkable comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elliot (Brendan Fraser) is a nerdy office drone who his co-workers try to avoid as often as possible. He adores another of the employees, Alison (Frances O'Connor), and more than anything would really like to be with her. One night, a sinfully sexy Satan (Elizabeth Hurley) comes to him with a proposal. If he promises to sell his soul to her, she'll grant him seven wishes. He wishes for some of the obvious things - wealth, prosperity, knowledge, physical prowess - but she's sneaky enough to give all of the various scenarios an unfortunate catch.As co-written and directed by the late Harold Ramis, this 21st century update of the fondly remembered Dudley Moore / Peter Cook comedy never generates any great comedy fireworks. At its best, it's just sort of mildly amusing. It can't really sustain itself for a full hour and 33 minutes, with the more entertaining gags weighted near the beginning. At least it espouses some reasonable themes about selflessness and the idea that life is what we make it.What really drives the 2000 version of "Bedazzled" is an engaging star duo. Fraser, who'd proved his comedic chops in the past, does his able best to sell the material from sequence to sequence. You could say that he gives 110%. Hurley is extremely enticing, especially with the constant costume changes. She looks especially fetching in the cheerleader and cop outfits. O'Connor is perfect as the object of Frasers' desires, while the supporting cast - Miriam Shor, Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, Toby Huss - gets to strut their stuff in multiple roles. Ramis casts his repertory player Brian Doyle-Murray as a priest.Overall, this is likable but never really inspired.Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, but predictable gag film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the Devil granted you seven wishes for your soul, what would you wish for? Would you even consider it? Despite the obvious message and predictable end results, which any moron can figure out without watching this film, I come back to the "Bedazzled" every so often for Brendan Frasiers little parades and Elizabeth Hurleys sex kitten routine. This is a fun series of episodes that hit more often than they miss, which is something for remake comedies. The special effects seem to be tritely coordinated which was insulting, as was some of the over the top (and not funny) stereotyped humor involving the episode where our IT nerd is made into an intelligent homosexual. The basketball wish played out well, but our desired lady went completely juvenile in the penis references. For such a sexually driven movie, Harold Ramos certainly steered away from the vault of humor that could have made this a memorable comedy instead of a predictable gag film.</fullReview>

This film suffers from an awkward pace, very questionable and cheap effects, and a weak script. I can appreciate the protagonist's arch, but the other factors of the film don't bring anything redeemable or worthwhile enough to take time to invest into the character. They did, however, bring the movie down, like a ship sinking slowly beneath the surface.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Bedazzled (A remake of the 1967 Dudley Moore &amp; Peter Cook movie of the same name) Elliot (Brendan Fraser) is granted 7 wishes by The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) so he can win the woman of his dreams, in exchange for his soul. Brendan Fraser seemed to have been around forever without making an impact in anything till "The Mummy" but as shown there, he is a very capable leaving man. Despite the fact it had been 13 years since her acting debut I still think of Hurley as the girlfriend of Hugh Grant. Who stole all the media attention at the premier of his movie Four Weddings and a Funeral in "that" black Versace dress held together with gold safety pins. I'd only seen her in the first "Austin Powers" movie and as the media hungry man eater in EdTv. (Art imitating life, if I have ever seen it) but here her acting is OK, and she is very attractive (especially when she dons a school girls uniform) probably, the most attractive I have seen her. None of the rest of the cast were memorable or stand outs, including the woman of Eliot's dreams whose face and name I could by even remember an hour after the movie ended.It's a tad predictable, the devil doesn't play fair, the hero does some soul searching before his final wish, and it's all wrapped up nice and neatly at the end A pleasing way to spend 90 mins, but I doubt I'll have a real desire to revisit the movie ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big fan of original and thought I wouldn't like this because of that, but when I eventually saw it, I liked it. It restyles the wishes for a modern day audience and they were mostly very funny. My favourite was the sensitive boy, the funniest by a long way. The two dogs named Dudley &amp; Peter was a nice little nod to the innovative original too.Hurley was surprisingly good in her role and having a Brit starring in it was a the right thing to do. Frazer is a very good versatile actor, always good at comedy. It's more OTT than the original and it didn't last the distance quite as well, notably sagging in the last third, I thought. The script is funny but not subtle and witty like the 67 film. That script had a lot of Peter Cook gems in and is worth watching just to see a different type of humour.The remake didn't murder it at all, like some have wrongly said. It was a quite different version of it for more in your face modern tastes. Stands up on its own well if you didn't see or want to see the original, making it a worthy remake project. Thought it missed a trick by not including the seven deadly sins in person as the original did, one of my favourite scenes of the 67 film, however it helps make both films quite different watches. Just choose the version to suit your mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is a socially awkward, geeky, over-zealous man working a dead-end technical support job in a San Francisco computer company. He has no friends and his co-workers are always avoiding him because of his banal and embarrassing attitude. He has a crush for more than three years on his colleague, Alison Gardner (Frances O'Connor), but lacks the courage to ask her out. After Elliot is again ditched by his co-workers, at a bar while trying to talk to Alison, he says to himself that he would give anything for Alison to be with him. Satan (Elizabeth Hurley), in the form of a beautiful woman, overhears him and offers to grant Elliot seven wishes in return for his soul. If his wishes weren't going the way he wanted, then he could give her a call by dialling 666. Obviously, it doesn't go his way.Brendan Fraser plays a Mexican drug lord, an overly sensitive guy who cries watching sunsets, a dumb basketball pro, a suave and smart gay gentleman and Abraham Lincoln among others. He brings some charm to his multiple roles which in another actor's hands would have been completely insufferable. But, there wasn't enough consistency in the writing where the laughs were few and far in between. It was fun to watch Elizabeth Hurley's Satan who was smoking hot and helped the movie from getting too boring. Her assortment of jobs involved a teacher, nurse, night club owner and others. From a prurient perspective as well as from an entertainment point of view, she was great and looked more like an embodiment of Lust rather than Satan. Though I do empathize with Elliot wanting the love of his life, one can't help but imagine how much more awesome it would have been to have Satan, especially one as ravishing as Elizabeth, as a girlfriend. Frances O'Connor doesn't have much to chew scenery with other than being the standard pretty girl here, though she did make me laugh with her 'I just want a guy who pretends to be sensitive' scene. The special effects are surprisingly not that bad. Bedazzled runs on a one note joke and it gets lame very fast. It does tell a morality tale, but its not too overbearing and the ending is just as goofy and heart-warming as the rest of the movie.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bedazzled has a very simple premise and deliver a very simple comedy full of chuckles. Mix a sexy devil, a clueless anti-hero, some wishes gone terribly wrong, and voil?!It's funny, with each wish and consequences well devised. The dialogs are good and the script well thought out.Unfortunately, the movie over all feels a little cheap when you see it for the second time. It's not enough to stop me, but... What create that impression is that they reuse the same 5 actors to do different secondary characters. Also, some special effects are not as good as they could have been, and most scenes feel a bit empty. Lastly, Brendan Fraser's character is a bit too geeky at the beginning, but over doing it is a common flaw in Hollywood movies (as I've said many times).Still, it's worth seeing, especially if you like devil related comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't really live up to its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kind of like the premise here. Usually movies are bound by their basic settings. If the movie starts with certain characters and tones, chances are that those basic building blocks will not change all that much throughout the course of the movie. Which is why I love adventure films so much as they're usually full of exotic locations, ever-changing situations and there's always something new to marvel at.The same principle applies here. The seven wishes granted to Elliot (Brendan Fraser) allow him to go through many different scenarios and locations, from Columbia to the 19th century America. The problem is that some of these scenarios brought by the wishes are not that creative and usually depend on a singular joke to be made. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. The first few wishes and the various problems that occur are pretty funny to follow and I found myself chuckling from time to time, but the novelty wears off pretty quickly. The scenarios don't repeat themselves that much, but when you know that Elliot still has wishes left to be used, you can pretty much expect that something will go wrong with the first six, which kills the excitement. All that is left is the wonderment of how the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) will screw up this particular wish for Elliot. Though admittedly the last few wishes manage to dust off the formula to a certain degree, but I still feel that the writers could have been a bit more creative. Of course this is a remake, but they already changed some things, like the gender of the Devil, so why not go a bit further.On the technical side of things, the three main actors (Fraser, Hurley and O'Connor) play their roles pretty convincingly and I enjoyed their performances. They weren't anything spectacular, but the comedic timing was there and I especially enjoyed Hurley's portrayal of the Devil as a vindictive, petty and mean-spirited, yet surprisingly sympathetic character. She was evil, sure, but the malice just wasn't there. It's her job to be evil, so she is. Strange take on the classic character, but for the purposes of the film, it actually worked quite well.Final thoughts: I cannot really find it in me to call this movie bad, though the rating I'll give it is quite low, mainly because it's just so cheesy and doesn't really explore its possibilities. It's still enjoyable if all you're looking for are some cheap laughs and a way to spend an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a common theme that runs through Harold Ramis' films. That of people taking different directions in their lives, and seeing what possibilities are opened up as a result. Such as Groundhog Day. Bill Murray relived the same day endlessly and got to see how many variations he could get out of it. A superb comedy. Ramis' finest work. Then with Multiplicity, Michael Keaton was cloned several times, and a different person was created each time over.And now its Brendan Fraser's turn in Bedazzled, the remake of the 1967 black comedy. Fraser plays Elliot Richards, a socially inept tech support worker. This is a man who lives a horrible life. His co-workers head in the opposite direction the minute they see him on the horizon. Life seems determined to frustrate his every move. And worst of all, the love of his life doesn't even know he exists.Allison (Frances O'Connor) works with Elliot but he doesn't really register with her. And on the night she walks away from him, completely none the wiser to his feelings, he wishes to God Allison would love him as much as he loves her.And Elliot gets his wish. But not from God. From the other side of the cosmic tracks. The Devil himself. Or herself! The Devil (Liz Hurley) offers to give Elliot seven wishes. Wishes of his own choosing. He can be rich and powerful. Handsome. Intelligent. Anything he wants. The only thing she asks in return...is his soul.As soon as Elliot's used up his wishes, he's contractually obligated to sign over his soul to Satan. Since he's not really doing anything with it, he agrees. But every wish he makes backfires in some way, because he's a little careless with his phrasing. His life becomes more miserable now than it was before. And he's still no closer to wooing Allison.I've got to be honest with you. Bedazzled hasn't got much of a plot to it. Its gimmicky. Slight. And it's a one-joke film. Something that's becoming a worrying habit for Harold Ramis. I suppose Groundhog Day was a one-joke film, but the inspired casting of Bill Murray allowed it to transcend its origins and surpass all expectations. It instead became a comedy classic.But with Multiplicity, danger signs were beginning to show. The film's slight premise got out a reasonable amount of mileage for three quarters of the way through, and then stalled before the end. The downward spiral continues with Bedazzled.Elliot makes a wish. And then the Devil subverts it. There is always a catch. A sting in the tale. And gradually Elliot whittles his wishes away, bringing him one step closer to Satan's clutches forever.That's it. That's the film's structure. And each of Elliot's wishes follows the exact same pattern, unwaveringly. To the point that it becomes repetitive.The film is just about saved by Brendan Fraser, who brings his usual lunk-headed, good-natured affability to the character. Without him, Bedazzled wouldn't be worth bothering with.Fraser gets to show off a bit of range here. Because through every wish, he has to play a completely different version of himself. From a Columbian drug lord, to the world's most sensitive man, a lunk-headed basketball star, an articulate homosexual and even Abraham Lincoln.Fraser takes gags from the uneven screenplay and reworks them through his own charms. His use of the Spanish language sounds quite funny coming from him. Being a thickheaded NBA star comes naturally to him. Its a good thing Ramis had the sense to cast Fraser. This type of material is something he seems very in sync with.But I can't say the same of Liz Hurley. Nobody could ever accuse her of being a wonderful actress. She's downright terrible in just about everything she stars in, (although surprisingly she's never been nominated for a single Razzie award). She has zero charisma. No talent. Her delivery is stiff and wooden. And she's completely miscast in the role of The Devil.Granted she looks gorgeous. The film decks her out in a series of mini-skirts, catsuits and tanktops, but she never comes alive. The Devil should have been a comic whirlwind of mischief. And Hurley never gets off the ground. Roger Ebert put his finger right on it: "She lacks abandon, risk and maniacal self-amusement."He is so right. I know who I would have liked to see play The Devil. Claire Kramer. You may not know her, but she played the Hell God Glory in Season 5 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She played the part with all the reckless abandon she could muster. She's a wonderful actress. Hopping about with energy. A mischievous twinkle in her eye. And she looks great in a red dress. I can't imagine an actress more suited to the role of Satan.Hurley pales by comparison. Even when the screenplay provides her with witty puns, she has neither the delivery, nor the timing to make them fly. Like when Elliot asks her if there's a God: "Yes there is. Most men think they're God. This one just happens to be right." That line purred from the mouth of Claire Kramer would have been classic. From Liz Hurley's, its flat and unremarkable.And I hated the ending. The film arrives at a really contrived way to free Elliot from the contract. And he still gets the girl. Sort of. Its a weird ending, and left me feeling cheated for wasting my time on this film. A few chuckles here and there, but a big disappointment. Harold Ramis is really going to have to come up with something special soon. Otherwise his career will disappear faster than Liz Hurley's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's about writing, and lips</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while this happens. A movie produced under the most strict commercial constraints which actually has some cleverness behind its conception. It happened to me twice this week to watch to such an event (the other was with "the girl next door"). There is actually a story device here, a strategy. It is simple: our hero visits several worlds according to his "wishes" or at least he thinks. The comedy device comes when we understand each of those worlds will be a)totally different from the previous one and the reality of the hero b)never according to his true wish. This provides the film with a motive for reinvention through out the film which actually is effective. Fraser helps. I usually don't like his pseudo-clumsy acting style but here he shows really versatile.Now what i found really interesting: one wishes something, and other thing(s) come along which is to say, to define too many, is error, so the more general you get in what one defines, the more control one gets. This is interesting if seen from a screen-writing perspective; because it has to do with effective control over the medium (and the comedy of the unexpected stuff that happen in the parallel worlds has always to do with omissions or non-considerations or exaggerations in the "wish" itself). I liked it. Anyway, the credit should probably be given to Peter Cook, though i'll now try to get to the original version to check how it was treated thereOh, and by the way, Elizabeth Hurley is really a sexual being here. She has physical qualities obviously, but here i think it had to do with the way she uses her mouth. Usually that strikes me as something unnatural about her, but here it really works. Check it. Oh and her British accent also helps here.My evaluation: 3/5 Get to thishttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bedazzled" proves great comedy need not offend to entertain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bedazzled" proves great comedy need not offend to entertain.Writer &amp; director Harold Ramis, who co-starred with Bill Murray in the "Ghostbusters" movies and called the shots on last year's crime comedy "Analyze This," surpasses himself with this frothy, first-rate, Faustian fable about a love struck lad who sells his soul to the Devil to win the heart of his dream babe. Not only does "Mummy" hero Brendan Fraser deliver a hilarious, Oscar-caliber comic performance, but also he displays his incredible versatility as an actor, impersonating a wide variety of sympathetic nincompoops, including a goofy NBA superstar, a gay literary sensation, a mustached Colombian drug lord, and a hopelessly sensitive guy. Sexy Elizabeth Hurley relies on her devilish charms as "the Barbra Streisand of evil" to tempt Fraser and does her best to sabotage his plans. The chemistry sizzles between Fraser as the disaster-prone dweeb and Hurley as titillating temptress. "Bedazzled" benefits from intelligent, witty scripting, top-drawer thesping, and Ramis' inspired helming.As a cubicle-confined, computer-support technician at a huge, faceless corporation, Elliot Richards desperately struggles to fit in with his office cohorts who feel nothing but contempt for him. Worse, shy, lonely, immature Elliot has idolized from afar for four-and-a-half-years a gorgeous co-worker, Allison Gardner (Australian actress Francis O'Connor of "Mansfield Park"), who doesn't know he exists. When he catches his callous office mates at an after- hours bar, they get rid of him by goading him into striking up a conversation with Allison. Meantime, as the Devil searches for her next victim, she overhears Elliot say he "would give anything to have that woman in his life" as Allison dismisses him without a second thought. Presto, the Devil materializes in a red cocktail dress and offers Elliot "seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddly little soul," so Allison will find him alluring. Basically, "Bedazzled" unfolds as a series of funny episodes with Elliot changing from one character to another to woo Allison. No matter how many times Elliot reinvents himself, he always finds a loophole he overlooked and discovers that the Devil is out to sabotage his best laid plans. When he requests wealth and power, the Devil turns him into a cuckolded "Scarface" wannabe, and when he asks to be the emotionally sensitive guy Allison yearns for in her diary, the Devil makes him so sensitive he cannot control his tears and alienates Allison. Scenarists Larry ("Tootsie") Gelbart, Peter ("My Fellow Americans") Tolan, and Ramis have penned arguably the year's most sophisticated and insightful comedy with clever dialogue and wacky-things-can-only-get-worse complications. Moreover, this wish-fulfillment farce boasts a lesson that goes hand-in-hand with its laughter. Ostensibly, Elliot learns he should be satisfied with his own unique identity and refrain from trying to be somebody else. "Bedazzled" qualifies as another top-notch comedy Harold Ramis can add to his resume that includes "Stuart Saves His Family," "Multiplicity," and "Groundhog Day."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best, but definitely amusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bedazzled is the perfect comedy to watch while pulling an all-nighter. Keeps you awake and there are some genuinely funny bits. But the overall idea of it is rather idiotic and pointless. A dweeb wants to be popular and has a huge crush on a woman he'll never be with. He meets the Devil, or rather she introduces herself, and she gives him seven wishes, but he mucks them up. Seems a little like a rip-off of Gail Carson Levine's "The Wish" if you've ever read it.Brendan Fraser is all right, and the same goes for Frances O'Connor. Elizabeth Hurley as the Devil is hilarious at first but dulls after a bit. Overall, I'd give Bedazzled a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elliot Richardson, suicidal techno geek, is given seven wishes to turn his life around when he meets up with a very seductive Satan. The catch: he has to give her his soul.Although a remake (haven't seen it, though), this film is a really fun, witty, fresh, and original comedy! There are many clever jokes throughout the film, you'll have a grand time!Brendan Fraser plays Elliot Richards, who gets the seven wishes and Elizabeth Hurley plays the very sexy Devil, putting her twists into his wishes.As an above-average entertaining comedy that actually has less clichs (and I applaud for that), this film is great and funny with its great and clever jokes!

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable evil comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When looking at the poster and the title the connotations of the film are pretty simple, a film about a confused person who is under the control of an evil devil, but never did I ever expect it to be as good as it was. Brendan Fraser (George of the Jungle, Crash) stars as ugly geeky suck up Elliot and from the very start you can tell the whole film is centred around him and his personality. With many films this narrative device is often a bad way to go for example Shallow Hal was focused solely on Hal and his own issues but this 2000 film from Ramis differs because it is more funny and intelligent. Fraser does well as the poor character Elliot and his relationship with Elizabeth Hurley (Austin Powers, Edtv) is outstandingly funny. The two act very convincingly in-front of the camera the whole was through and enjoy many memorable scenes together. Perhaps many stubborn people will argue that the story is too basic with not much to it, and they are correct to an extent. I believe this film is very good for what it is. It's a comedy fantasy romance film, you know what I mean. I believe this film had to be basic because audiences are therefore appreciative of the genre and the many different types of jokes involving Satan, sex, relationships and character personalities. It's a very understanding plot moving at a quick pace with very light-hearted scenes. The whole idea of having the devil as a woman was also an interesting concept as Elizabeth Hurley dressed in very attractive clothes and presented a very sexual iconography. Having stereotypes in the form of Propp's hero: Brendan, the geeky guy and Frances O'Conner who plays Alison acceptably as the goal for the lead character. There are many predictable jokes but this is one of those films which is enjoyable for what it is, a perhaps corny romantic comedy with different types of jokes and expressing views about the after life. I recommend this film for anyone who likes a consistent plot with funny characters who jokes about relationships. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bedazzled" was so bad it hurt. I expected this film to put out stronger and funnier performances from Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley.Beneath the set changes, so many characters being introduced and cheesy jokes; "Bedazzled" has nothing to offer the audience, which is a real shame because this film had real potential. It had the cast and plot but were unable to capitalize on these aspects.Among the problems I had with "Bedazzled" were the number of unfunny and cheesy jokes. The only thing that was funny in "Bedazzled" were the situations Brendan Fraser's character was put in. Why classify a movie that is not funny in any way as comedy? Secondly, the main plot revolved around Brendan Fraser's character falling head over heals for a co-worker who was attractive but not stunning. Why would someone use seven wishes to try and win the heart of someone who does not have that much to offer. Having said this, I thought the ending of the movie was creative and I praise the writer for writing it that way.The other problem with "Bedazzled" was the unconvincing portrayal of the devil by Hurley. If a movie contains a devil, make sure it looks and acts evil. Hurley seemed to be dry as the devil with no semblance of being a devil. I believe the only reason Hurley was cast was for eye candy."Bedazzled" was disjointed and unorganized; it would have been better if there were fewer characters involved for Fraser to play. We should place "Bedazzled" in the 'Oops, I shouldn't have made this film' category.Please stay away from "Bedazzled" as you can get. Two thumbs way down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brendan Fraser is a god and a monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brendan Fraser never ceases to amaze me with the work he is capable of doing. How many languages does he speak? First he does the goofy stuff, straight out of Jerry Lewis, and then he plays the straight sideman like Dean Martin, and finally becomes the superhero in "The Mummy." No demands on his acting performance, whether as the confused but morally centered King George in "George of the Jungle" or the confused but morally centered Adam from "Blast from the Past" to his Oscar-worthy performance as the confused but morally centered Clayton in "Gods and Monsters," seem to out-demand his capabilities.Fraser is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood today.Confused but morally centered may have been his shtick in several of his most popular films, but he is not typecast. Witness "The Mummy" movies, or his amazing work in "The Quiet American" and "Crash." This is a studious actor, who engages deeply in his homework and strives never to leave a scene flat. I would guess he would be the kind of actor a director would love, for his knowledge, his dedication and his willingness to push boundaries.All that said, this particular movie is rather lame and it is really only Fraser's genius that saves it. Proving capable of playing a cavalcade of characters, from a rich Latino heartthrob to a convincing geek and everything in between, Fraser saves this movie from the trash heap. Sure, Elizabeth Hurley provides eye candy and she delivers her cleverly written lines with ease, and she's even a little bit funny from time to time. But it is Fraser who remains funny, or troubled, or terrified, or bold, or whatever the situation demands he be, with a surprising sense of alacrity.Sure, this review is mostly about Fraser, but that's just the point. As with most every other film starring this chameleonic actor, Fraser somehow manages to come to the fore. He even gave the amazing Michael Caine a run for his money in his understated role as "The Quiet American." If you're looking for a gag film, like "Blast from the Past," spend 90 minutes with "Bedazzled." But pay close attention and you'll see much more than well-delivered gags; you will see a true cinematic artist at work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEDAZZLED, in my opinion, is an excellent knock-out comedy. I thought that Alison (Frances O'Connor) was a beautiful lady... especially in the ball gown she was wearing during the wish where Elliot (Brendan Fraser) wanted to be an articulate writer. Also, I thought that Satan (Elizabeth Hurley) was a beautiful lady as well... especially in the sexy red dress she was wearing when she first appeared to Elliot. One of the quotes which amused me the most was, "Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk." That was really funny! In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent knock-out comedy to all you Brendan Fraser or Elizabeth Hurley fans who have not seen it. You're in for a good time and a lot of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a delightfully, simple, fun one. It's a good modern Hollywood update of the 1967 British movie with the same title starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook.The movie is perfectly written by Harold Ramis who puts some good and fun typical Ramis dialog in the movie. The movie consists out of several separate sequences that are all totally different. Every wish brings us to another world and another Elliot Richards, the main character played by Brendan Fraser. The first wish, where he becomes a Columbian drug lord is the best sequence. Unfortunately after that the movie never becomes as good as that but it's still fun enough all to regard this a good and successful comedy.Elizabeth Hurley is perfect as the devil, with the emphasis on perfect. She plays her role with lots of profession and class and looks better than ever. Brandon Fraser shows his comical skills and he plays a diversity of different character but he plays them all very well and is good and believable as every character.The movie most certainly isn't the best or most memorable comedy but it simply is great fun to watch. It doesn't make "Bedazzled" a must see but it certainly is a perfectly watchable movie for perhaps on a rainy afternoon.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The devil assumes the form of a woman (Elizabeth Hurley) and persuades a hapless dork (Brendan Fraser) to sell his soul in return for seven wishes which he uses to try to win the girl of his dreams but which tend to go comically wrong. This is a rather underrated comedy, great fun throughout and very often laugh-out-loud funny. Yes, the Peter Cook-Dudley Moore original is probably better, but this remake, by Harold Ramis, the genius behind 'Groundhog Day' and a string of other great comedies, has a lot going for it. I can't remember when I've laughed as much at a comparable mainstream Hollywood feelgood film. Fraser has a prodigious comic talent and basic likeableness and Frances O'Connor is good as the object of his unrequited love. Liz Hurley is gorgeous throughout, and contrary to received wisdom she can act and is perfect in the role. Bonus, there's a hilarious turn by the godlike Toby Huss (Jupiter from 'Nikki').</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Works Because Of Liz Hurley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original version of ' Bedazzled ' some years before this film hit theaters and didn't expect anything special,given the fact that British ace comedian Dudley Moore's act was a hard one to surpass.I was totally wrong,and having seen it again a few days ago on TV,I have to admit that remakes can really surpass the original -if there is a cast to do the trick.Brendan Fraser plays the 90's version of Moore- tech support executive Elliot whose nerdy ways make him the laughing stock of his colleagues.One evening,he goes to a club,sees the lady of his dreams and wishes he'd do anything to have that girl in his life.Enter(no,not the dragon,this one's worse than ten !)the very devil disguised as the ravishing,absolutely stunning Liz Hurley.She convinces him of her supernatural powers and grants him seven wishes,and every time Elliot becomes a character he dreams of becoming, until something goes wrong till Fraser realizes that to have wishes come true,one must work at them and not hope for a miracle.This effects a personality makeover and at the end of the film,he is a new man.The reason one should see this ? Liz Hurley,Liz Hurley and only Liz Hurley.She is the very personification of the devil-tempting,alluring,and devastating in her actions.Hurley gives her best ever performance in this film,and compared to her,Fraser looks indeed more an object of ridicule than an object of our sympathy,precisely because Hurley's act prevents anyone from bearing the slightest amount of resentment towards her character-in fact ,one kind of enjoys the way he gets betrayed again and again by the devil.Of course,Fraser's ability to play a wide range of characters,plus his experience in comedy make his performance quite interesting-but it is Hurley who prevents the script from degenerating into a sort of cheap,farcical series of comic skits.I have been completely bedazzled by her and I am sure I am not the only one.Liz Hurley proves that there is a lot more to her than just being the face of Estee Lauder.Very impressive !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie because Brendan Fraser's character was so hard to like. But when The Devil granted his wishes, he became so many different and distinct characters, and I liked these other characters. And Elizabeth Hurley did such a good job as The Devil. A lot of the humor in this movie came from the fact that Fraser's character was not very specific when he made his wishes (and who would be? There's so much to think about). The big lesson here was that people should not be selfish when they make wishes. Another lesson was that you should be very certain of what you want. It was a good movie overall, but not a great one.</fullReview>

Even playing the devil, or a demon pretending to be him, this movie is a lot of fun to watch as she fires funny line after line. Brenden Fraser is at his comedic best (Never cared for him in the Mummy) as one wish after another fails. I also like the fact that my buddy Orlando Jones (MAD TV) recurrs in each of the wish segments. The man needs his own TV series. A far better film than the one its based on, Bedazzled does have an interesting theological statement that would work even if Morgan Freeman appeared as "you know who." In fact, I'd like to see both films supporting each other. The special effects are great, especially when Liz goes all "Fifty Foot Woman" (she should have done the remake of the Allison Hayes classic instead of that horrible Darryl Hannah). All I can say, I've got the plot ready if anyone wants to see Bedazzled 2!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too bad it had to have an ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find myself often intrigued by some vague piece of information about a movie's plot or ten seconds of footage &amp; after the first viewing, my interest has been proven to be right once again : i thought i'd dig it, and i dug it. So was the case with Bedazzled, reading a rather spoiling review in a magazine when it was running its first week in theaters. (Allthough it wasn't until its DVD release that i sat down &amp; giggled )The 7-wishes-in-exchange-for-the-soul plot immediately offers more possibilities to build a comedy on than, for instance, the classic triple feature used in every Aladdin movie. First of all, the number is greater and second, its not as much about wishes than it is about interpreting them &amp; filling up the holes with satanic twists. The whole premise takes but a small quarter to develop, followed by the series of acts, strung together by the enthusiastic yet stylish performance of lovely Liz Hurley, in which we get some minor storyline development. That is where i locate my sole grief : i didn't really want to see Brendan Fraser get smart &amp; apply the contract rules towards a truly 'happy' ending. Hurley was likable enough to let her win. But what are you going to do about it ? America requires it.For those who demand a critical note of weak points, i took a step back and noted some. One, Brendan Fraser is by no means necessary to this movie, even if he does a decent job playing the nerd. It just requires someone capable of playing the nerd. For instance Tom Hanks could have done it back in his Dragnet days. Two, not all portrayals of Frasers wishes are that good, the 'emotional man' being the most tedious yet luckily also the shortest of them all, possibly cause that two-word formula wasn't much to work with in the first place. Then again, it is nicely fitted between the strong Columbia opening &amp; the basketball fantasy ( pay attention to that appealing instrumental piece we all know from the Full Monty's dress rehearsal, 'na-na-na-nah HEY na-na-na-nah' ). Three, that stupid hamburger-&amp;-a-large-coke joke was far too predictable not to look stupid in the whole of the comedy.All in all, what have we got ? good story, good interpretation, rocking female lead and all that put together cleverly enough to cover the major weaknesses. Highly enjoyable, though owning the DVD would not be among my wishes - i would require several hundreds like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begin with a clean slate and FORGET the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like film comedies, preferring action and thrillers.So I am completely surprised to find I loved this film and actually find it funnier the more times I see it.The trick is to stop comparing the original with this and treat this as completely new.Who would have thought pitting Liz Hurley against Brendan Fraser would work, but in a quirky way it does.Her British accent compared to Fraser's all American one accentuates the differences between 'good' and 'evil' in a very simplistic way and there lies the whole crux of enjoying the film-simplicity! If you want philosophical,theological arguments, what are you doing watching a comedy? I wholeheartedly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful lighthearted comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a delightful lighthearted comedy that improves with each viewing - - in that sight gags are abundant and are often overlooked in the initial preview. The story line is simple - a man (Brenden Frazer) sells his soul to the devil (Elizabeth Hurley) for seven wishes - which for the most part go terribly wrong. Brenden Frazer - as Elliot Richards - is masterful as he slips easily into one role after the other. Elizabeth Hurley - is the perfect antagonist - in that she plays and astounding `over-the-top' devil. But the real treat of the film is the supporting actors: Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein and Toby Huss - - all of whom playing multiple roles - - provide a short lesson to us on what acting is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining comedy (and a decent remake)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I am a great fan of the original British version . This Hollywood modern remake is an enjoyable comedy with quite a few laughs . Without any reasonable doubt `Bedazzled' (2000) is inferior than the Dudley Moore film but this doesn't mean it should be left unnoticed. I am sure that most of the fans of the original will hate it and here's the reasons why . A) The remake has an entirely straightforward plot which focuses exclusively on the wishes the leading character makes . The 60's version included some great philosophical and existential insights , like when Moore moodily wondered `Why can't we choose our parents?' . It also contained some great satirical touches concerning the perennial battle between God and the Devil (like when Peter Cook recited the reasons which made him turn against God and ending up a fallen angel) . All these elements are absent here and the film suffers , but fortunately not severely . B) An abrupt ending . As aforementioned the plot rotates only around the wishes and as soon as the wishes end , so does the story . The 60's film had more story going on for it . There were specific reasons concerning the importance of Moore's soul for the Devil and why he was so special . We even got to see Heaven and hear God's voice !! The film lacks these things and just stops . Well I guess for the uninitiated the film will be more fun . As for me , I enjoyed the 2000 version despite these flaws . It is a professionally made comedy by the talented Harold Ramis and I believe it is slightly better than `Groundhog Day' (1993) where the script ran out of steam after the second half and the film just dragged on . Bedazzled (2000) is not boring for a single second and can be enjoyed immensely.PLOT SYNOPSIS : The film opens with some scenes reminiscent of `The Mask' with Jim Carrey . Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is a lonely guy who works in a big company . His colleagues deliberately ignore him or even avoid him in their social gatherings . Elliot is cute with a robust body and quite educated , but he belongs in the sad category of social misfits . As much as he tries , he can't make new friends . Every night he ends up in his small apartment , microwaves a `fast' dinner and watches TV until he falls to sleep . He is secretly in love with Alison (Frances O' Connor) a beautiful girl who works in the same company with him , but hardly knows he exists . After subsequent rejections Elliot is disappointed very much . Shortly thereafter he meets an ultra-gorgeous fascinating woman with a mysterious British accent who claims to be the Devil HERSELF (played by none other by Elizabeth Hurley) . The Devil offers Elliot a pact to make his life happier . She offers him a huge pile of paperwork , calling it a `contract' (which of course no one is going to bother to read) . The Devil tempts and eventually convinces Elliot to sign and sell his soul . The grant is 7 wishes where Elliot can literally have anything he wants . Of course as it always happens in movies with genies , things don't go exactly as planned . It is universally known that a deal with the Devil never pays off . Elliot 's wishes always turn sour and he has no other option but to return to the mundane reality . The Devil only wants his soul and always finds tricks to make the wishes go awry .This is the story of the film and despite the weakness of the script , the movie has two things going on for it . Firstly the performance of Brendan Fraser shows his great acting skills and his enormous comical talents . Fraser pulls off one successful metamorphosis after another , to the point he is barely recognizable ! Aside that , Fraser succeeds in the dramatic aspects of the character . Despite his height and broad shoulders which make him appear like a goon , he achieves being a likeable `everyday' guy with nice behavior whom you root for (something he succeeded in `School Ties' as well) . Elizabeth Hurley is also great in her role . She is a drop-dead charming , irresistibly beautiful woman . She is HOT ! (he he he). Hurley is convincing as a modern siren , the incarnation of a dangerous temptation whom you should never trust . Simultaneously she is likeable enough herself : she really can't harm you if you have strong will . The second asset of the film are the wishes . Most of them are well executed and offer some great laughs . The make-up is PERFECT and Fraser changes persona with great agility . Not since the `Nutty Professor' with Eddie Murphy have I seen so exceptional work in the styling department . My favorite wish was the first one , where Elliot becomes a Latin millionaire . Of course the wishes wouldn't be complete without the great talent of Fraser who unambiguously is a gifted actor and changes voices and looks utterly convincingly , like when he speaks Spanish . Now there is the little worm of doubt which bugs me and tells me that the dialogue could have been voiced-over , but even in this case I will have to give my deepest congratulations to the director and the editors for some perfect work of dubbing .It is a great flaw that after the wishes the film ends up with a patchy cop-out and with a clichd way . I was expecting more plot or at least more characterization on Elliot . I also found pointless the cameo of God (or was it an angel?) in the middle of the film and it should be explored more . Well , I guess we shouldn't be expecting much . `Bedazzled' (2000) is not innovative and will not be a classic . It is however an entertaining film and I recommend it for a boring evening with the video . If you want a good comedy with a decent script , some great laughs , good performances , some remarkable SFX and a few satirical hints (the homework that the Devil gives to the students is the proof of `Fermat 's Last Theorem' , a very difficult mathematical problem which puzzled people for centuries and there are legends about mathematicians in the Middle Ages wanting to sell their souls to the Devil to solve it) then do not hesitate and see it . Although far from groundbreaking (this honor should go to the 60's film) `Bedazzled' (2000) is one of the best comedies from the 90 's.BEDAZZLED (2000) 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS) Both Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley give very good performances in this movie about a man who gets 7 wishes from the Devil, but Fraser truly steals the show about a guy who thinks he's finally gotten his lucky break. His character, Elliot, truly tugs at my heart strings in the first part of the film, before he meets the Devil. This movie delivers only a few laughs, however, (a big one is when Elliot wishes to be President of the United States), and I would recommend it only if you are a Brendan Fraser fan. I would give it about 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why the likes of Ivan Reitman would want to capitalize on the success of a brilliantly done comedy from the sixties, written by Dudley Moore and Peter Cook and directed by Stanley Donen, defies description. Needless to say, his relatively unrelated version, featuring Brendan Fraser (in Dudley Do-Right mode) and Liz Hurley (in British bimbette fashion), reeks of adolescent humor and corny predictability.

		<shortDescription>Uneven, falls short of potential but nonetheless a fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's premise, a modern day Faustian bargain (oh don't I sond like the pretentious young college student), could have provided not only for a much more madcap comedic experience but also a more dramatic and morally thoughtful story. The movie drags during the beginning introductions and the fantasy wish sequences are uneven, with some of them suffering from bad pacing and dialogue. Even so this movie is an enjoyable little tale, with a cute little moral lesson. There are moments of hilarity and Elizabeth Hurley flourishes in the role as the sexy unholy temptress who seems to just love her job (although she could have also done so much more with her role as well). Fraser is decent in his role but it certainly isn't one of his best non-dramatic performances (for a similar but much better example of Fraser's talent, look at the delightful "Blast From The Past"). So in summary, uneven yet charming although it certainly could've done so much more! 7 outta 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I haven't seen the original 1967 movie with Dudley Moore, but with nothing else to compare this movie too, it really wasn't too bad. I guess there's no use reitterating the plotline, so I'll get to the point.First and foremost, Brendan Fraser did an excellent job playing his multiple roles. In the first few scenes of the movie, he did a great job playing a complete dork, which must be really difficult for a 6'3, relatively bulky guy like Fraser. He also got into his multiple roles very well when he made those wishes. Obviously most of those wishes (like the most emotionally sensitive man in the world, or the dumb basketball phenomenon) were supposed to make him look foolish. But when he played that really intellectual guy, he really got into it, and played that role to a T. Fraser is a really underrated actor, and this movie, beyond a reasonable doubt, shows his acting range.Francis O'Connor, his love interest in the film, also does a really good job. Her role in the film is supposed to be minimal, but she plays her role really well, especially when she plays two different people (I hope that wasn't a spoiler). She's also one of the only British actresses that can hide her British accent really well, even better than Emma Thompson could in Primary Colors. That says something.Liz Hurley was there for laughs, and she pulled her part off really well also. There were times where she was a little annoying, but she had her moments.Overall, the movie kept you in your seat. I have seen worse movies, and this movie definitely has those moments where you can't help but laugh out loud. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bedazzled...enchanting title. Upside down story...one might sight something like "anti-stereotype" characters. It is so, I will not deny that. But these are not the "strong" points of this movie. You will have to look somewhere else to realize what this movie actually has to say.SPOILERSAs I said, the story is upside down: the devil, a very attractive lady interpreted by Elizabeth Hurley, meets a desperate guy, Elliot, who is deeply in love with a woman, called Alison. In his apparent desperate cause he accepts the devil's proposal to sell his soul for seven wishes. Despite what looks as an "ideal to become" life, the devil shows it's true face while fulfilling each of the wishes.Although the story might become boring for some, it really held me to my seat. I've actually seen it three times and I always had the chance to laugh, and most important of all to have the same feeling at the end of the movie. I was kept interested in what would happen next...what would happen wrong in a wish. The "mixing" was absolutely hilarious at times and this fact makes me affirm that this is a great comedy. The important thing is that laughing is not all there is to this movie.People might be a little outraged by how the devil was portrayed, but I say it was all done this way for "the show". An "anti-stereotype" would be the black savior( most certainly an angel in my opinion) who has an important, though short, part in the story. We can notice in each "wish" that Elliot's life is still influenced by the same people as in his real life. One might conclude after pondering on this fact that change doesn't come from the world around us, but change comes from within us. That is the message of this movie. It's not that important for the world to form itself regarding our wishes, but what is of any relevance is the fact that we understand that many things in life don't came that easy. As Elliot comes to the conclusion, one can not wave a magic wand so that all things become as desired by an individual.This film conquered me through its charm and the way it actually sends us an important message. It's not even that much that the viewer has to really sense the message because we get it told right into our ears.No movie is perfect though, but this one scores high where it has to. It's entertaining, the actors are, generally, funny and their actions and reactions believable and it has A MESSAGE. If anything in life doesn't have a real purpose, that is if a work of art doesn't have a real purpose and doesn't carry a message, then it can often be a waste. There is of course a difference between the delight of the human eye and the delight of the human intelligence. Anyone can see that. I would dare to say that this movie offers both delights. If there ever were a comedy I would recommend it would be this one. It makes you laugh, it makes you think and it makes you feel good. What else can you ask for from a good movie? Not much in my opinion. There are few movies which carry you into a state of exaltation at their ends, and, at least in my case, this was one of them. This film earns, in my opinion, a well deserved 8/10</fullReview>

How could Hugh Grant ever give up this woman? ;-)This is 90 minutes of fun watching, nothing deeper.

		<fullReview>This movie was...I cannot say "excellent", and the only reason I cannot is because I have seen it too many times. It was good, with Elliot Richards, a goofy geek, [Brendan Fraser], likes this girl Allison Gardner [Frances O'Conner (II)]. He meets the one and only female devil [Elizabeth Hurley], and agrees to sell his soul for seven wishes. All these wishes go wrong, and he never succeds in "getting the girl." The first wish he is married to Allison and is Columbian, and he sells DRUGS, to his surprise! To make things worse, Allison dumps him for Raoul. After, he finds out that Allison wants a sensitive man. So, he becomes the most [emotionally] sensitive man. Allison dumps him for being too sensitive. The third wish, he becomes a white Michael Jordan. He is very stupid. He doesn't even come close to getting Allison, because she sees his "thing," and it's so small, again, she dumps him. The fourth wish he is witty. He almost gets her...until he is a homosexual. The fifth wish he is president. He looks so ugly that he figures Allison will never love him. (He ends up looking like Lincoln.) The devil informs him that he forgot the Big Mac and Coke [that he had to pay for] that was his first "wish." Elliot naturally is infuriated and says he doesn't want anymore wishes. So...the devil surrounds him in fire, and he wishes Allison would have a happy life. He finds himself on the stairs, and he lived, because "any selfless acts voids the contract", according to the devil. Allison informs him that she's seeing someone, so he goes back home, but then he finds the "girl next door" unpacking. Her name is Nicole, but she looks exactly like Allison (with different hair color, of course). He fell in love quickly. All in all, this movie was pretty ok, and Liz Hurley and Brendan Fraser in particular were excellent, and I loved how everyone he worked with (except for Carol) was in almost every wish. I suggest you see this movie, but not too much, otherwise you'll think, "Why the hell did I watch this movie? It's boring." :) Cya around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone so far, as commented how lovely and hot Elizabeth Hurley is, in this movie. Although, she is a top babe, I personally prefer the British-born Australian Frances O'Connor who plays Brendan Fraser's love interest through-out the movie. ..... the movie??? ah, yeah... well, I wasn't overly impressed with it, even though it did have some laughable moments (Fraser shocked and embarrased by the size of his manhood in the Basketball wish was funny).Fraser plays the part of the nerdy loser well, but he is nowhere near as good as Dudley Moore in the 1967 original version.Hurley for me looked uncomfortable as the devil, and I really couldn't see any chemistry between the two actors on screen. Peter Cook, the original Devil from 1967, was much better and a lot more rotten.I would recommend this movie, if say, you was in on a rainy night, and there was nothing on TV, or you didn't have a decent video/DVD to watch. But would recommend the original Cook/Moore movie anytime !!!JRB. 02/09/2002</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Bedazzled directly after watching End of Days and the producers ideas of what the devil is like are quite different. Bedazzled is by the same director who directed Groundhog Day. Its one of those movies which only needs an idea to be a hit and succeeds in doing so. The film is narrowed down to an episodic series of sketches which are each as amusing as the next. Liz Hurley shines in her over-the-top performance as the devil. Brendan Frasier is much better in Bedazzled than he was in The Mummy Returns. The film takes a look at the lighter side of the devil and life. To sum it up, Bedazzled is a good idea which is smoothed out to make a great movie. 7.3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried sitting through five minutes of the original "Bedazzled" and that was pure hell. This one wasn't too bad, but it sure shouldn't qualify as a comedy. Brendan Frasier, the luckiest moron of Hollywood, plays Eliot. To win the girl of his dreams, he makes a deal with the the Devil (the *nuclear hot* Elizabeth Hurley). The real problem is that there aren't a lot of funny things happening. What was most interesting and compelling were the consequences of his wishes. The movie is actually several different "Twilight Zone" shorts, the best being was the first one. Unfortunately, it was Spanish with subtitles. The final fifteen or so minutes run out of creative steam so we wind up with an extremely weak ending.You be the judge, is Frasier playing himself? Liz is the best looking movie Devil of all time. It is Too bad she is not a strong enough actress to be very believable in such an esoteric role. Director Harold Ramis has done far better comedy, most notably with "Groundhog Day". All in all, this film's watchable, but don't expect to be bedazzled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the saying goes 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Many might argue the same could be said about Harold Ramis' modern remake of the 1967 classic starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Now with the multi-talented Brendan Fraser in the lead role as Elliot Richards, the socially inept nerd who doesn't fit in no matter how hard he tries and the one-dimensional Elizabeth Hurley as the sultry Prince of Darkness ("Well the Prin-cess of Darkness anyway"), Bedazzled is a good comedy despite its' flaws. In a nutshell, the premise is the same as that of the original but brought up to date with the modern movie-goer in mind. Elliot Richards is a computer technician who is secretly in love with beautiful co-worker Alison Gardener (Frances O'Connor). One night, he finally gets the chance to ask her out but blows it when she doesn't recognise him, much to the amusement of his fellow workers. Asking God for help, his prayers are inadvertently answered by The Devil who promises to help get the girl of his dreams in the form of seven wishes. Unfortunatley for Elliot, there's a catch. In return for aforementioned wishes, he has to give up his soul. It would ruin the film however to say what these wishes are as that would spoil the outcome of the movie. There are so many things that can be said about Bedazzled. With Ramis at the helm, it could be a far more superior film, but sadly, Groundhog Day it ain't. Like Brendan Fraser, Ramis is extremely talented but both are let down by a script that runs out of steam very quickly.The wishes that Elliot comes up with are met with humourous intervention by The Devil but aren't as jaw-achingly funny as they could be. Fraser's performances throughout the film are superb showing off his versatility as an actor alongside the ever beautiful and also extremely talented actress Frances O'Connor. Liz Hurley on the other hand is just there to look great giving only a tame version of Lucifer instead of being the ultimate incarnation of evil as he is so often portrayed. Overall, Bedazzled certainly has its' moments that will cheer you up and make you feel good. It may not be the greatest film ever made, but there are much bigger turkeys out there.</fullReview>

Elizabeth Hurley is also wonderful in her role as a seducing demon who wants to get a hold of Elliot's (Brendan Fraser) soul. Elliot bargains with the devil and he gets 7 wishes if he will give up his soul to the devil after he is through. The devil twists his wishes around and practically gives Elliot the opposite of what he desires. He is turned into everything from a Columbian drug lord to a idiotic basketball player.

		<shortDescription>Just another comedy masterpiece from Harold Ramis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis is the director mastermind behind "Groundhog day" - film that will be remembered as one of the wittiest, craziest and greatest comedies of the 90's. More recently he directed splendid mafia parody "Analyze this" which included perhaps Robert De Niro's funniest performance ever. I have to say "Bedazzled" is just another excellent comedy masterpiece from him. Charming Elizabeth Hurley might just be the sexiest devil in the history of cinema. Brendan Fraser's Elliot Richards sells his soul to her in exchange for seven wishes. The joke of the film is naturally that these wishes just don't seem to come true quite the way like he wants.Regrettable fact that one of the wildest and most daring scenes of "Bedazzled" is totally missing is maybe a little minus. When Elliot uses one wish to be a famous heavy metal singer he turns into a sick, gross and perverse drug addicted maniac and of course the comic point is that in the end it's not what he really was after either. His character is so overdone ode to sex, drugs and rock n' roll it's extremely hilarious but I guess the scene was way too outrageous, shameless and obscene and unfortunately was deleted from the movie's final version but luckily it's available in the "Bedazzled" DVD as extra so I recommend you to check it out if you get a chance.I loved Brendan Fraser especially in "Airheads" and I have to say he's outstanding and (considering how talented he actually is like this film so clearly proofs) maybe even slightly underrated comedian and just simply perfect choice for the amusing roles like in this flick. In "Bedazzled" he's even surprisingly good because he plays several totally different characters like a Columbian drug lord and a really dumb basketball player. (Damn that the most sensitive guy in the world is hilarious too...) Starting from the brilliant title sequence "Bedazzled" is an ultimate nonstop-comedy feast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit like Quantum Leap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Bedazzled" on Friday night. From the trailers and the reviews, I expected a dreary movie that would bore me two seconds in.But I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It is about a wannabe, a loser, who meets up with the devil (in the form of a beautiful woman) who will trade him seven wishes for his soul.He wishes to be rich and to be married to the girl of his dreams, and ends up a Colombian drug lord. That's just his first wish. He goes through five more of them, none of which turn out as planned. He ends up as a tall basketball player, an extremely sensitive guy, and some others, but the devil always manages to wreck his wish.I found this movie really interesting. It's a lot like "Quantum Leap", the TV show, but I love Quantum Leap anyways. In some parts it was cliched, and you could definitely predict the ending, but all in all, it's a good movie.The only problem was its lack of originality. Except for some hilarious parts, it's hard to remember much about the movie at all, but the actors do a great job playing their parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story wasn't too strong, but the dialogue was well written and very well carried through by Fraser and Hurley. This movie convinced me that he is one of THE most versatile actor among the Hollywood elite. He nailed every character he played from the sensitive poet on the beach to the hulking dumb jock. It's amazing how this guy can pull of speaking different languages too. He had spoken French so well in "Blast from the Past," and here he convincingly speaks Spanish and Russian. I laughed very often throughout the movie and felt that there was a little strength in the message it gave you toward the end. All-round very entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen Bedazzled like, 20 times, and I still never get tired of it. Brendan Frasier and his love interest's acting is impeccable. Brendan just plays every role so well. It's almost convincing. But, the downside is every one of his wishes goes by faster and faster and faster. I also thought Elizabeth Hurley could have looked a little bit better. I love her outfits, but her hair was just too nappy for me. Sorry, I notice these things. There were some lame jokes, and a few of them I was laughing inside, but not out. Overall, I think it was a good movie, although it could have had a better script. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit reluctant at first to actually sit down and watch this film, the major off point being it stars Liz Hurly. As I have said in other reviews I do NOT like this woman, however she is the perfect choice for this film (I somehow cannot see someone like Liv Tyler or Gwyneth Paltrow playing the role in the same manner).This movie is actually quite good, ok it's not great or is it an Oscar winner, but it is enjoyable.Brendon Fraser plays the lead role of Elliot, a sad pathetic individual who is besotted by a woman at work called Alison. While out one night Elliot states that he would give anything to get her; enter the Devil (Liz Hurly).In exchange for his soul Elliot is given 7 wishes, to use as he deems fit, of course everything doesn't go according to what he hopes.Written by Peter Cook, the man who wrote the original 1976 Bedazzled, it is everything you could want in a family film. It's directed by Harold Ramis (Egon from Ghostbusters), so what else would you expect except good old fashioned fun. Marks out of 10, it gets a 7.</fullReview>

To my surprise i enjoyed this film there are many funny moments the best when the workmates are involved. The basketball scenes were very funny, Fraser showed he is a capable actor and Hurley did not have to talk, just keep dressing up in the many 'turn on costumes' ( she still can't act). I reccomend buying this film just to cheer you up for a couple of hours and drool over Liz Hurley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a typical Brendan Fraser comedy in which he portrays a loser (in an acceptable way), that somehow tries to get a nicer life. Then in his life comes the Devil (Liz Hurley) who grants him 7 wishes in return for his soul. That is basically all you have to know. Then there are some jokes (funny ones and those that fall flat). Everything is average here, except Miss Hurley and not because she only wears short skirts, bikini's or other sorts of revealing clothes. She just has this charming devilish look in her eyes and that English accent. Oh man. Not only appealing as hell (get the wordplay?) but convincingly devilish.6.5 out of 10 (1.5 points for Miss Hurley)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEDAZZLED, in my opinion, is an excellent knock-out comedy starring Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley. I thought that Alison (Frances O'Connor) was a beautiful lady -- Especially in the ball-gown she was wearing during the wish where Elliot (Brendan Fraser) wanted to be an articulate writer. As a matter of fact, all the wishes he made were funny. Also, I thought that Satan (Elizabeth Hurley) was a beautiful lady as well -- Especially in the sexy red dress she was wearing when she first appeared to Elliot. One of the quotes which amused me the most was, "Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk." That was absolutely funny! In conclusion, I recommend this excellent knock-out comedy to all you Brendan Fraser or Elizabeth Hurley fans who have not seen it.

		<shortDescription>A modern-day version of a Medieval morality play?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: probably contains spoilers yahdy, yahdy, yahJudging from some of the comments I have heard made about Bedazzled (eg a glowing endorsement of it by, of all people, one of the high priests of the Church of Satan, and all the usual criticism from Christian types about how movies like it are leading young people down the left-hand path), I gather that most people regard it as some sort of wicked, decadent film (which can, of course, be a good or bad thing). I, however, regard it as essentially just a modern-day version of a Medieval morality play ie one of those "occult" movies which uses a fear of Hell and the Devil to terrify (or maybe, in this case, just coerce) its audience into being good.This intent of the movie is fairly evident, I believe, from the opening credits which make use of such favourite Christian themes as God's ability to know all our dark and dirty secrets, and the eternal war for human souls being waged by God and Satan. Further moralizing is laid on thick in the movie itself which seems to push all the usual Christian messages eg the Devil cannot be trusted; if you do bad things you'll end up getting into serious s**t (in this life and the next); only actions done for the good of others have any real merit in the grand scheme of things; and so on and so on ad nauseam. Like a lot of movies of its type these days (Dogma and Stigmata are other titles that spring to mind), it tries to combine squishy, feel-good New Age spiritualism with good ol' hellfire and brimstone Christianity, and the result is, I fear, an unholy mess (as it usually is).The movie wasn't all bad, though. Liz Hurley made a very sexy devil, of course (loved her outfits!), but this sometimes worked against her. Even when she was holding Brendan Fraser's luckless character over the raging inferno of Hell towards the end of the movie, for example, she still looked more sexy than scary which wasn't, I'm sure, what the director had intended at all.Another positive about the movie was the main character's wishes, or, more specifically, the way that the Devil screwed these up completely. Being a fairly sensitive guy myself, I wasn't all that rapt with the way that the "most sensitive guy in the world" scene turned out, but I suppose that someone so ridiculously emotional would turn anyone off. (I swear that it was the horrible dolphin song which finally turned his girlfriend off him.) Interestingly enough, Fraser's incarnation as a world-famous author seemed pretty similar to that of him as a SNAG (ie both characters talked a lot of s**t and were a lot more "feminine" than the average guy). It was interesting how, while he was a complete turn-off to the love of his life as a SNAG, as the author, he would have succeeded in bedding her had it not been for a rather amusing unforeseen problem. The stupid basketballer incarnation was probably the funniest of the lot.Oh well, if you don't take it too seriously, Bedazzled is a decent enough film, I suppose. Quite funny and worth watching for Liz Hurley if nothing else.</fullReview>

Beside the creative situations Brendan's character finds wishing himself into in exchange for his soul, the humorous script and good pace of the film, Brendan Fraser demonstrates again why for several years I've considered him one of the few truly talented actors today. From the meek and nerdy, to the suave intellectual, an overly sensitive dork to a happy go lucky drug lord, Brendan captures the true essence of every character he plays. Brendan has a true ability to facially express any emotion from pain to pleasure with convincing consistency. Slumped shoulders, ill confident bumbling steps or head high, shoulders wide with dauntless long strides, Brendan employs each detailed nuance needed to bring to life those he portrays. Be it The Godfather to Pet Detective...good acting is good acting. And the ability to convincingly portray characters as widely varied is truly a talent we don't see come around often. So at the very least, Bedazzled offers an example of those abilities as well as a good paced, well directed and written light hearted film ride you might consider enjoyingly worth your time. fc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>decent comedy but hardly a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis does a decent enough job traipsing into verboten territory in this relatively funny remake of a brilliant piece of cinematic comedy. Loser computer worker Brendan Fraser has a terrible crush on his coworker Frances O'Connor, with whom he's never even spoken. His unfriendly coworkers try to goad him into speaking with her but he instead winds up bumping into the devil, portrayed without much gusto by Elizabeth Hurley. The inevitable pact gets made, and Fraser continually finds himself about three giant steps away from achieving his wish. O'Conner as a sports journalist shows profound interest in towering basketball star Fraser until she gets a peek at his tiny penis. Fraser as a sensitive type proves too much for O'Conner who walks off with a guy that promises to drink beer and ignore her. After a few more tales of missed targets, Fraser learns a lesson and wanders off to find a relatively happy ending. Sadly, Fraser has little comic sensibility, far less than Dudley Moore, who played the character with pathos well beyond his imitator's capabilities. Hurley's role does not even allow for comparison to Peter Cook's devil; she would have been much better suited to portray Lillian Lust (done suitably by Raquel Welch in the original). Her presence makes itself known primarily through her skimpy outfits. Although most criticisms indicates she casts a more striking presence than Cook, I'd much rather see his slightest sarcastic facial expression than Hurley's gaudy sexuality. The original Bedazzled draped its comedy against a wildly anarchistic structure. Not so Harold Ramis's redo, which maintains a very traditional character progression and a horrifyingly facile moral conclusion that seems to indicate without irony that solace can be found in skin-deep beauty. Perhaps my greatest complaint, however, would be the almost nauseating amount of product placement, kicked off by Fraser getting a Burger King meal as his first wish, which gives the movie a distinctly corporate Hollywood flavor. Nevertheless, Ramis tends to craft comedies with decent, occasionally brilliant, success, and this film does indeed have its funny moments. Most of these come from the more outwardly (and pleasantly) offensive story twists, such as the aforementioned small penis episode and when Fraser leads O'Conner to his room, where he suddenly remember that he's gay. Versatile Orlando Jones and Ramis regular Brian Doyle-Murray show up for some pleasantly amusing roles and O'Conner is rapidly becoming the subject of a big crush on my part (I'm of the opinion she's far sexier than the overdone Ms. Hurley). Without a doubt, Ramis has created a perfectly acceptable film, but he would have done much better to come up with an original story to structure the jokes around; the film remakes Cook and Moore's original in name only, and Ramis achieves precious little by utilizing the name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film much more than the other comedy released around the same time, "Meet the Parents". This one featured stranger jokes which kind of makes it stand out more. Bedazzled, while I can't compare it to the original, is rather clever. The wishes while predictable mostly, still sometimes have a new aspect to them. The acting from the main actors was rather good, and Hurley seemed to be the more interesting of the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I loved the original. Yes, I was one of the crowd who gasped in pain when I heard about the remake. And then I saw it. And all I can say is..Harold Ramis, you magnificent son of a b@#%&amp;!, you've done it again! I really shouldn't have been surprised (He made even Stuart Saves His Family tolerable for pete's sake).The biggest surprise however was a terrific performance by Elizabeth Hurley. This is the role that makes or breaks this picture (especially with fans of the original) and she pulled it off.I certainly hope these two will team up again..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A passable film ruined by Liz Hurley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brendan Fraser is an above average actor who is made to look like a star by the wooden "acting" of Elizabeth Hurley. Whoever told her she could act wants locking in a padded cell. Each time Fraser moves into a different character you hope that the film will fulfill it's potential and then just as you are getting into it we go back to Hurley which not only brings the film back to Earth but on it's way to Hell. The original with Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore was a much better film. I realy think that films with Liz Hurley in should have a big warning on them so I don't watch them by accident. I would have given this film a 7 but Hurley has brought it down to a 4.</fullReview>

Unfortunately the wooden Liz Hurley spoiled the film for me entirely, with her lack of acting skills and terrible "I'm so posh" voice. Brendan played his characters well, with his usual comedic flair. I can't say I'll be watching Liz Hurley in anything again if I can help it.

He is confronted by the devil and asked if he would like to change the life he has. Only by making this mistake does he see that he is not so boring and that life does not revolve around pleasing others or being popular. His life was important, just as all of ours in the world. Sometimes people need a push in the wrong direction to see what a gift we all have, that gift is "life".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Would you give up your soul to the devil in exchange for seven wishes?' That is the question Brendan Fraser's character has to decide on at the beginning of `Bedazzled.' His answer is a quick `Yea! Baby!' When he sees that the devil is played by Elizabeth Hurley. Fraser is hilarious in his wish sequences that includes: a colombian drug lord, an extra sensitive romantic, a playboy writer, a way-too-big basketball player with all-too-small private parts, and the president of the united states (too bad for Fraser that he did not have sexual relations with that woman devil played by Hurley). This Queen Elizabeth reigns all over actresses in the looks department. She might not be the best actress around but who cares? Who sees films anyways for good acting? Sorry, I did not mean to say that- I guess the devil made me do it. So dazzle yourself with `Bedazzled.' **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains some spoilers.I really liked Bedazzled, i see that a lot of people think that the Original version was better. I havent seen the original though.What I like about this movie is that i recognize Elliot in myself. A few years ago I was also really someone that didn't have a lot of friends and had no luck with ladies. Like Elliot in the beginning of the movie. And also I found my true Identity, fell in love a few times, every time it just didnt work out like at the end of every scene were Elliot screwed up a wish from The Devil. But I know that i will find a perfect match someday, like Elliot meeting his new next-door neighbor in the end of the movie.I always like Brendan Fraser movies. Well Brendan Fraser COMEDYS, lets forget about the Awful "The Mummy". He just has a lot of talent, i mean he's actually speaking Spanish himself! And well he plays all the different characters in the wishes really well. I mean The Sensitive Elliot who would cry every time he looks at the Sunset. "When's that darn thing gonna set!". That really was the funniest part in the movie.The casting of Hurley raises questions. She looks really amazing, I would probably sell my soul to the devil if he looked like that, but she's not really funny. I think all the pranks she does everytime she meets elliot are not funny at all. Giving parking tickets, setting all the traffic lights on green, wiping out all the homework in the classroom. Annoying.Bedazzled also has great effects. Hurley changing clothes without the camera stopping at all, Fraser playing basketball were he's obviously stretched to look really tall, and the scene in hell all really look amazing.I recommend this movie to everyone who just wants to see some innocent fun, and especially when you think you will never find true love and you're desperately trying anything to achieve it, then this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ok For Fraser &amp; Hurley Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok where do I start? I was a bit skeptical about this movie to begin with. My friend however convinced me to watch it. Besides I like Brendan Fraser and enjoy (most) of his movies. Although I don't consider Elizabeth Hurley a wonderful actress, isn't she supposed to be a model? What is she doing acting? Anyways, the one thing that bothered me this entire movie was how many cliches there were. "Guy no one likes and gets picked on by co-workers, falls in love with someone who doesn't even notice him and gets offered a chance to change his life and get everything he's ever wanted"... like I haven't seen this a million times right? Not to mention I sat through the first half hour without laughing ::bad movie alarm goes off:: afterall this is supposed to be a comedy. However I did enjoy the "Sensitive Elliot" and "Gay Elliot" scenes, those, at least for me, gave a few laughs. I think this movie had an interesting plot, but somehow along the way the director just didn't make it turn interesting on screen where it counts. I don't hold it against the actors because I thought Fraser did an excellent job, Hurley did so-so she's not exactly convincing as "THE DEVIL". Regardless, this is likely to be one of those movies you watch once (if you made it through it the first time that is) and never touch again sadly. I hope in the future Fraser grabs some better scripts because I'd really like him to get out of this rut he's stuck in of bad movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happiness doesn't just happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Happiness isn't something random, bestowed or guaranteed from following a formula. And the people you may think you'd be happiest to have the life of, probably have things they're none too happy with anyway. It's a lighthearted message from a lighthearted film, which may be too saccharine sweet for movie fans looking for really serious fare. Though I doubt anyone's going to mistake this film for what it really is. Mind you, I'm not criticizing the film at all. It was well paced, fun to watch, had a good laugh here and there, and made me think (even if just a little). Elizabeth Hurley, who I barely noticed before, was delicious in her role as the Prince(ss) of Lies. The role didn't call for serious effort as an actor, pretty much being a caricature role, but she played the devil woman to the hilt and it was fun to watch (she had some of the best lines too). Brendan Fraser's role didn't call for particular depth either, it pretty much just needed someone to gesticulate through the number of different characters he played out in his wish fulfillments gone awry. His bouncy boyish charisma did help keep things light and comedic through all the farcical wishes in which the devil made it clear that you don't really know exactly what you want until you've found it. Some people will probably be offended at the lack of true maliciousness in Hurley's devil's character actually. By the end, however, Elliot gets a different perspective on his dilemma (you'll see what I mean if you watch) and we learn that the universe isn't so much out to get us as it just wants to teach us a few things. And I thought the ending was quite well done.So, unless you're in a particularly dour mood or some sort of perpetual sourpuss, and you're looking for something lighthearted and breezy, give it a rent.</fullReview>

It was entertaining; and a pretty good update of the original for modern times. These are really timeless themes anyway; but if this movie got people to check out the original or even other stuff by Cook &amp; Dudley then more power to Ramis, Hurley, and Fraser. I thought Fraser did a pretty good job and Hurley was excellent. I hope she continues to get other comedy roles that let her do more stuff than just look hot and be a sidekick for Austin Powers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>** 1/2 Offensive and boring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fairly diverting comedy remake of the 1960s Stanley Donen cult favourite with Brendan Fraser as a young man who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for seven wishes that give him the opportunity to win the girl of his dreams (Frances O'Connor). In this version, the horned one is played by a woman, and the revelation here that makes the film worth watching is that in her performance Elizabeth Hurley reveals herself to be a truly gifted comedienne, blessed with timing and charm in spades (in the Austin Powers movies we do get a glimpse of how good a sense of humour she has but in those films she was playing the straight man to Mike Myers' goofiness; here, however, she is the clip and pace of the whole mess of a film that director Harold Ramis has assembled). Other than her, the film is not much more than a collection of clichs that remind one of the idiotic comedies of the eighties, with stereotypes running from the `bad SEXUAL woman' (why does the devil take pleasure in the fact that she asserts God is a man and she is quite happily a woman, and why do only evil women wear slinky outfits?not that in Hurley's case we actually mind, but you know what I mean), vs. the good woman (O'Connor's many inexplicable characters that pop up in Fraser's dream worlds are never more than silly caricatures and her whole contribution to the film remains less than fluff), the gay neighbour (Fraser wishes to be the wittiest and smartest man in the world and comes home to find the worst horror of a homophobic clich in his bed who calls him `Mary' and tells him to prove his sexuality by naming off musical theatre trivia), and an entirely unfunny sequence that deals with penis-size obsession. You don't even get the impression that these missteps of taste were included out of some kind of preplanned offensive strategy; it's more like ignorance on the part of the writers to be sensitive to viewers' sensibilities and intelligence. I shouldn't be too critical, though, because I have to admit that thanks to Hurley's wit and Fraser's raucously funny characterizations I did laugh my head off; unfortunately, when the third act comes along, the whole film just ends without actually having an ending, making me wonder if the producers had run out of money and couldn't finish the film right. I'd love to say more but then I'd give it away, but suffice it to say that Ramis seems to have gotten so tired in making this furiously paced film that he got tired at the end and just gave up to give himself a break.</fullReview>

Rent this oneand your family will enjoy their Blockbuster evening. Compare this to that disjointed Family Man and you'll see the difference.Yes, Bedazzled was done before and arguably better. But this is a more modern film, where the English original will send much of your family flying to the refrigerator. It meets the big four criteria for a rental: 1. It's entertaining 2. It's modern enough to be called fresh, even if a remake. 3. It's well cast and this film certainly is. 4. It doesn't suck.Point four cannot be exaggerated or underestimated anymore. We've reached the American-Pie, Deuce Bigolo, Saving Silverman, generation where film after film sucks the big one, andsometimes finds an audience lame enough to praise it. Scary stuff. Treasure the light entertaining film like Bedazzled and keep your family happy when you have to stay home. You'll notice one zillion un-rented copies sitting on the Blockbuster shelves for the truly-sucky movies. Ever see the Blair Witch section? You'll never have trouble renting anything with the word Blair in it!!!!!!!!! The word gets out on the good and the Okay, and they can be hard to find. Find a copy of this one and enjoy.</fullReview>

There's heaps more that could have been done with it. Brendan Fraser never really got the chance to flex his comedic muscle as much as I would have liked, Frances O'Connor, in her first "Hollywood blockbuster" had little more than a passing role and was under-utilised. The big surprise, for me, came in the shape of vampy vixen and she-Devil, Elizabeth Hurley. Again she could have really camped it up (there was an element of restraint), but it appeared that she was really relishing her role as the Devil anyway. I guess that really letting loose on this film would have meant that the PG rating wouldn't have applied therefore it would be open to a wider audience. Be that as it may....The plot rolls along, with no real deviation (no pun intended), no real surprises but it's a nice popcorn, check your brain at the door kind of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being in my tender teenage years, I didn't get to see the 1967 original starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook (who spotted the in-joke with the two dogs?), however this was an adequate enough way to waste 102 minutes. Brendan Fraser stars as Eliot Richards, a man whom nobody seems to like or want to know about. One day, in a bar, he declares his love for Alison (Frances O'Connor). Along comes the Devil('Mrs. Wooden' Liz Hurley) who grants him 7 wishes, and maybe a crack at finding his true love. However, they don't go swimmingly. Fraser is alright, a step forward from Blast From The Past(1999), and this is watchable stuff, but it'll have to go a long way to equal Groundhog Day, directed by Harold Ramis, who helmed this one.</fullReview>

Sure, it is funny and all, but it gets stupid after a while. Brendan Fraser turns in a flawless performance as Elliot, a lonely man who sells his soul to the Devil to get seven wishes, with funny consquences. But, the whole Alison crush started to get old after awhile. Liz Hurley is okay as the Devil, but she is a little too soft. In conclusion, Brendan Fraser is one funny guy, but he can't save the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the better remakes of previous "classics". Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Frazer seem to have brought a different perspective to the story although Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore were superb in the original.It seems that much of humanity finds the faustian theme to be fascinating regardless as to whether it is depicted gothically or humorously. This film plays with that fascination and implies the clichd admonition to "be careful what you wish for because you might just get it".Hurley competently plays an alluring Devil and Brendan Frazer, at the outset, makes an excellent simple character - a type he played so well in Blast from the Past. His talents are however, given great scope with a string of characters that make up his various incarnations.The film ends in a fairly mushy way which may be a turn off for some people but overall I think that this is a mildly enjoyable way to spend some cinema time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to think of "Bedazzled" when i saw the previews, but i trusted Harold Ramis's directing, so i went to see it. It is a really great comedy. I know some people would look at it and think "oh great, another dumb Brendan Fraser movie", but Brendan Fraser was cast perfectly for the lead role. As we know Brendan likes to take many different kinds of roles from movie to movie (School Ties, Airheads, Gods and Monsters, George of the Jungle, etc....) Because his character in the film changes personalities every 15 minutes it is the perfect role for him. Elizabeth Hurley did get a little annoying after a while, but she didn't by any means ruin the movie. i saw this movie alone and laughed out-loud many times, if you're looking for a good laugh, then see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Brandon Fraser movie what do you expect? It's pure fluff. He's the Meg Ryan of men. The boy next door who's quirky cute then when he shaves and throws on an Armani, you'd sell your soul for a single serving portion of the man steak sub below the BVDs.Elizabeth Hurley is an ultra-cool chick babe. What doesn't this mega force get into? Her production company (a vehicle for winky Hugh Grant), her fashion side job, and of course her acting. I like her. She seems like she's stashing huge gobs of bubble gum in her cheeks when she speaks-sure- but her delivery is still fantastic and she's the sexiest devil since Al pacino in The Devil's Advocate.Bedazzled story goes...Elliot Richards (Brandon "King of Male Movie Fluff" Fraser) is a geek. He's unnoticed and perpetually awkward with the ladies (Yes, Brandon Fraser is a tall handsome chap, who'd be jumped where ever he strolled - it's a movie - go with it).He's got a great big loaf of French bread swelling in his khakis for Allison (Frances O'Conner) his aloof coworker. After being blown off, again, by the object of his Earthly desires, he mutters those oh so famous devil conjuring words " I'd give anything to have Allison." Poof. Satan, Lucifer, er, Lucille at your service. The Dev (Hurley Burley) is a knock out-he hasn't got a chance. She bedazzles poor Elliot into signing away his soul for a mere seven wishes. Why seven-she explains it just sounded good- and would bring the movie in under two hours for producers, I'm guessing.Anywho, Elliot wishes and the fun begins. She is the devil you know. If there's a loop hole she'll find it. Proving lawyers really are Mephistophelian , no?The lives Elliot wishes for make up the laughter in Bedazzled. I really bellowed a few times. Fraser's a great comedic actor- very facial.Ultimately a fun family night at the movie. If your date or you like the Meg Ryan-Tom Hanks-quazi reality- Capra(esque)- why even the devil couldn't get us down- happy dappy endings- you'll love Bedazzled.The history of the film is very cool. Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, once very popular "out there" British comedians responsible for the Beyond the Fringe troupe (like Monty Python that never got the same recognition here in the US) were the original proprietors of this story. Dudley Moore, then playing the poor soul enchanted with a woman's beauty so deeply he'd spend eternity in hell. Definition of hell? Think a thousand wide screen televisions turned up full volume, with Salyma Hayek reciting Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven over and over...I enjoyed this cute remake. You know, the audience of mostly pubescent males gawking at Elizabeth Hurley's Austin Powers' wardrobe rejects mainly comprised of bright red, skin tight cat suits, did too.Snack recommendation: Big Mac and a Coke .com-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the commercials, you might think that "Bedazzled" starring Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley would cause you to ask for your money back after seeing this flick. However, I assure you that this movie is funny. I'm not saying it's going to be a classic or even a blockbuster, but it's worth seeing. Fraser is funny, but what makes this movie for me is Orlando Jones (the "Make 7 Up Yours" guy). Jones has a supporting role (actually a couple of roles) that nearly made me soil my pants on two occasions. Check it out if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hurley And Fraser Dazzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crash course on how to beat the Devil, or Faust played for laughs; however you want to look at it, `Bedazzled,' directed by Harold Ramis, is a diverting comedy, easy on the eyes (courtesy of stars Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley), extremely palatable, and just funny enough to be satisfying. Ramis delivers it all with a steady hand and a straightforward approach that, while the story is not entirely imaginative (deals with the Devil aren't exactly anything new, cinematically speaking), finds a comfort zone that works and manages to garner some good laughs along the way. Fraser is Elliot Richards, a friendless, lonely young man whose life begins to heat up when the Devil (Hurley) seeks him out and offers him a deal he can't refuse; it's seven wishes, any one of which will land him the girl of his dreams, co-worker Alison (Frances O'Connor), who after four years of working in the same building doesn't know Elliot exists. For Elliot, who demurs initially, it's just too good to pass up, especially when the Devil convinces him that a soul is something that is entirely overrated. Fraser gets a chance to showcase his versatility as an actor here, as each wish lands him inside the skin of a different character. It's an engaging performance, with characters all over the map that take Elliot through a comedic journey of discovery that ends with an epiphany of sorts, about happiness and where you find it. But then there's this deal he made; is it too late? Hurley turns in a good performance as the ultimate seducer; it's not difficult to believe that a guy like Elliot could easily fall under her spell. But what makes it so easy to swallow is that there's no attempt to make this out to be anything but what it is, which is fantasy played for fun. It's obvious that Ramis knows his territory, and with the help of some clever, witty dialogue, he keeps a plot that is somewhat predictable fresh, and while it may not soar, he does keep the ship aloft and adds some nice touches, like the use of `dialogue bubbles' at the beginning of the movie to indicate some humorous traits of a number of randomly selected people from among the 6.2 billion that populate the earth. The supporting cast includes Miriam Shor (Carol), Orlando Jones (Dan), Paul Adelstein (Bob), Toby Huss (Lance), Gabriel Casseus (Elliot's cellmate) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Priest). Perhaps not one of the more memorable films of the year, `Bedazzled' nevertheless is pleasant entertainment that provides some chuckles and even a bit of a moral. All in all it's good comedy that stays above much of the base fare being offered today; it's a fun movie that works, and well deserving of a look. I think you'll be glad you stopped by. I rate this one 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I don't care for invidious comparisons, but...while I like Brendan Fraser and while this new version has some amusing moments...sorry, it isn't even knee-high to the Peter Cook-Dudley Moore original. If that's available, see it by all means. It's wittier and much more intelligently written. The ending of the new version is flat and truly bromidic. The '67 version has sequences that are far funnier than their equivalents here--the "Mr. Sensitive" routine in this new version is awful and the parallel one in the '67 film is a joy. The old one has Dudley Moore as a nun, which must be seen to be believed. Finally, the original one has the young Raquel Welch...playing Lust. Need I say more? If the '67 version isn't on hand as a rental, it's a crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is brainless fun, but, as is typical, most of the plot and best gags were "given away" by the previews.The biggest problem is the way in which Fraser's character is released from his Satanic contract. The actual method of voiding the agreement (which I won't spoil) is suitable (and probably has literary precedent); unfortunately, the way in which this is demonstrated in the film is just boring ? both visually and dramatically.Fraser is almost unrecognizable in many of his guises. Hurley is surprisingly good in her role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Bedazzled' is one of those little movies that starts off very well and ends pretty admirably too. Unfortunately it is the middle of the picture that ultimately makes the film fail. Not too badly, however. Still a 6 out of 10. Brendan Fraser sells his soul for what he thinks is happiness in the form of 7 wishes to the devil (Elizabeth Hurley). The film has some very juvenile humour in Brendan Fraser's portrayal of a star basketball player and sensitive sunset watching flake. The stereotypes of pro athletes and gays are pretty lame and the one wish he has where he is the president of the United States had the potential of being the best skit in the whole film but fell apart because it lasted about 1 minute. Too many uneven moments but a good turn overall by Fraser as the main character while Hurley, being one of the best looking women in the world, is pretty one dimensional as Satan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bedazzled" stars Brendon Frasier and Elizabeth Hurley and is a remake of a late 60s Peter Cook and Dudley Moore comedy. Frasier is a nerd who agrees to sign away his soul to the devil (played with vampish glee by Hurley) so that he can attain the woman of his dreams. Of course, as many of our politicians have learned, making pacts with the devil are rarely successful, and the film depicts Frasier's attempts to get his wish right. I wish Frasier had kept his comic mugging meter turned down to 8 instead of 11 here- he has demonstrated previously in "The Mummy" that he can be funny without overdoing it (and he also demonstrated in "Gods and Monsters" that he has strong dramatic chops, as well). Unfortunately, for much of this outing, Frasier lays it on thick. All the same, "Bedazzled" is a fun romp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a remake that delivers. It's as good as the 1967 original.The plot revolves around a grown man named Elliot Richardson (Brendan Fraser). He's a total LOSER. He never gets girls, his officemates including Orlando Jones (from MadTV and The Replacements) avoid him as well.Then one night, he goes to a bar, and a ball hits his shoe. Enter Liz Hurley as the devil. After being skeptical, Elliot tries his hand at getting seven wishes for a soul. Each wish he gets, such as being a Colombian drug-lord--goes HORRIBLY wrong. After a few more wishes, Elliot realizes that the devil is turning his wishes sour to get his soul.Stop there. No more spoilers.First off, Liz Hurley is fantastic. Funny and attractive as well, but Fraser steals the show, giving great performances. I've never laughed out loud in a movie this year since Meet The Parents! I recommend it as a family movie. It has many jokes to keep everyone laughing. Sure, Hurley is noting compared to Peter Cook, but it's a cute movie.Rating: 8.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two things save this movie. One is Brendan Fraser. After catching him in Gods and Monsters I'm starting to think that Brendan is a highly underrated actor. His portrayal of the different "characters" in his wishes are dead on perfect. He makes himself likable and annoying at the same time. Fraser is now becoming one of the actors that may make you want to see a movie instead of keeping you away.The second thing that saves it is the direction. Ramis never keeps us in a wish to long and brings them each to an end and drops in a joke just when we need it. He also does a great job of getting Elizabeth Hurley "bits" of evil to do while she is rattling off her exposition. Her part is a tough one because she just sort of pops in and sets us up for the next wish. She does a good job with her role, but to be honest I was a bit distracted when she was onscreen by the fact I couldn't stop drooling. Ohh Hugh you are such a silly man.It's not a great comedy but it is appealing. Great 3rd date movie.</fullReview>

One could even argue that this film fits into the continuity of the first movie (assuming the aforementioned "One" is extremely sad and has a lot of time on his hands).

But it does not matter.The movie, overall, is very disappointing. The ending is dreadful. There are a few humorous and entertaining moments. I found virtually all of the "drug lord" sequence, which appears early in the film, quite amusing. (This must be common feedback, since the reworked final trailer uses large portions of this sequence.) But it all goes down-hill from there. It just doesn't work. Hollywood garbage. I'm a fan of the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original film and I expected more. Hopefully this remake will spawn a DVD release of the original film.

		<shortDescription>A hugely watchable and funny comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is actually a remake of a 1967 movie by the same name starring Dudley Moore but I have never seen that one so will just discuss this version on its own.What other reviewers seldom mention is that the movie is an ensemble comedy, with a core group of five actors playing roles in all of the different segments that reflect Elliot's wishes. By now everyone knows the basic premise: a devil appears to a dweeby young man in the form of a beautiful woman and grants him seven wishes.This is Elizabeth Hurley's best performance ever, with her delightfully clipped British accent and stunning physical beauty coaxed along to perfection by director Harold Ramis. As another reviewer has stated, she deftly leads Elliot along like a puppy on a leash.The writing is also great in that it builds on the viewer's expectations. For a guy struggling along in a service sector job and pining after a cute girl who works for the same company, well duh...of course he's going to wish that he's rich and powerful and married to her. And the devil gives him exactly what he wished for, with hilarious results! When that wish blows up in his face (quite literally), of course he's going to re-work the wish so that Allison loves him and that he is a soulful, sensitive type. The devil grants his wish, with even more hilarious results.And so it goes for the rest of acts one and two.Congratulations to the makeup and special effects team because they transform Elliot into a Columbian drug lord, a freckle faced flower child and a seven and a half foot tall basketball star, among other things. The lead actress playing Allison also shows a variety of different looks and personalities in her embodiment in the wishes.While much of the action and situations is over-the-top, the movie cannot be considered a farce because it is all deftly resolved in act 3. The ending is plausible and satisfying. Farces also don't usually succeed in making fun of the NBA, private school education, and famous American presidents in the same movie.In all, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A devilishly funny film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley have incredible chemistry in an adaptation written by genius comedic writer Harold Ramis in this hilarious comedy about a lonely, desperate man (Fraser) who is enticed by the Devil (Hurley) to give up his soul for seven wishes.Frances O Connor co-stars as Alison Gardner. As Elliot struggles to win her affections with each following wish, the Devil finds clever ways to make us laugh and ruin Elliot's wishes.It's not necessarily the special effects, costumes or make-up that win you over. However, they are all top-notch and saves a ton of money re-casting new actors for each individual wish. The plot alone is just something so interesting in its own right. Plus, you add in the comedy and the chemistry, you've got a great film.There are a small amount of laugh out loud moments, but the movie is over run with small chuckles most of all. Elizabeth Hurley has never looked hotter and as a viewer, you're rewarded with a huge number of skanky outfits. She delivers each line with a sexy vibe that sends a tingle through your body.Brendan Fraser plays Elliot as desperate and pathetic perfectly. Other than Jay Burschel, I've never seen an actor pull of the role of awkward. Brendan can play it well and he's very versatile and shows it off.It's not exactly a movie for kids, but it's not entirely for adults. There is a scene of profanity and mostly mild profanes. There's not blood nor violence that is disturbing so it's mostly a family movie. I would recommend it to anyone to watch it, at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but not as good as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the original Bedazzled film with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. It was hilarious and creative. Then they decided to remake it, which wasn't a wise decision. Not that Bedazzled is a bad film it's just that it's not as much fun as the original. Why would Elliot(Brendan Fraser) be in love with Allison(Frances O'Conner) when he could be with the smokin hot Devil(Elizabeth Hurly). alright i'll admit it Elizabeth Hurley is hot and is great as the devil. No Peter Cook but still great. I had fun with the Bedazzled remake though I couldn't quite stop thinking about the original and how much fun it was. The new Bedazzled is fun and funny, but not quite as funny as the original. I give it a thumbs up, but I prefer the original. It's a lot better and funnier. Not that this film isn't fun or funny, it's just not as good as the original and I didn't really like Brendan Fraser's character. Elizabeth Hurley looks good, is good, and the film is funny.Bedazzled:***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I'll be blunt: this is a bad movie. However, there is a "But" here. This is a bad movie BUT Fraser saves it. Whilst not the best script, Brendan makes it watchable and even enjoyable. He plays about a dozen different characters, and each one different. I swear I cannot hear sports players or commentators now without hearing Brendan's voice over the picture saying... "we wanna play good, and we gotta play good... and i think we played pretty good. But you know, there's no I in team and we had to go out there and play good, and I think we played real good tonight." While he is sweating so much they must have had a hosepipe on his head and back. But, I really actually enjoyed Brendan, I think he saved what would have been an utterly dreadful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fraser Fine; Hurley Horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the good news about the new version of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's cult 60's comedy-fantasy: Brendan Fraser is excellent. Now the bad: Liz Hurley is an embarrassment. Funnily enough, the imbalance between *performance* and mere 'presence' is what gives the movie some of its guilty pleasure, although it was hardly intended. Arguably, the sheer awfulness of Hurley's one-expression acting is part of the joke itself, a constant reminder of the pitfalls of fame, where a member of the cast is recruited simply on the basis of being famous rather than any innate ability. Certainly, in interviews accompanying this film's `special edition', veteran comedy director Harold Raimi gives nothing away, remaining the genial craftsman whose protective smile perhaps hides more than it ought. The film itself is uneven, reflecting the unequal nature of the co-stars it showcases. When Hurley is on screen it falls flat, but moves along quickly enough as Fraser bounces lines off her with all the panache of tennis pro practising against a wall. But for those who are most familiar with Fraser's work from ?The Mummy' or ?Gods and Monsters', his multi-roled performance will come as a revelation, and is much the best reason to see this film. Whether as the moustached and cuckolded drugs baron (during which segment he speaks fluent Spanish and Russian), the annoying nerd (a performance which reminds one of early Jerry Lewis) or the monolithic blonde basket ball player, he is consistently entertaining, and works harder than the rest of the film in making us laugh. His most astonishing incarnation of all is in the `deleted scenes' found on DVD and special edition videos: here he is a debauched and drugged rock star, and Raimi's high-octane and surprisingly adult parody of ?Sid and Nancy' is absolutely superb. One can see why this wasn't included in the final cut, but it is still a shame that it wasn't, as it would have been much the best thing in the film, and Fraser's performance is jaw dropping.Ultimately this is a film which lacks the original wit of the 1967 original. The first two British stars offered a parody of 'Faustus' set in the tempting grounds of Swinging London, and made of Eleanor Bron a continuously unachievable, endless sought, sex object. Frances O'Connor, as first Alison then Nicole, tries her best but can't erase fond memories of the original (although the idea of other members of the cast also acquiring new identities in each of Eliott's incarnations, as well as she, is an effective one). Raimi's updating replaces the balance and badinage of Cooke and Moore, and the subtle elusiveness of Bron, with something far less satisfying. And, along the way, 'Bedazzled' loses its comedic soul as quickly, and as surely, as does the unfortunate Eliott.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good fun...Fraser is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected to. From the previews, it looked to be another inane attempt at comedy but had I realized before that Harold Ramis directed it, I probably would have been much more eager to see it. I caught it on Cinemax and really enjoyed it. Liz Hurley -- what can you say? She absolutely drips with sexiness and I can think of no other female in Hollywood who would have been better for this role. Brilliant casting.Brendan Fraser -- you can tell that he is having a blast with each of these characters. As Ramis said during the mini-interview in the closing credits on Max, Fraser added his own style to every character and in each one, you can see his inherent goodness come through. I very much enjoyed watching him play each character and looked forward to seeing what he was going to do with the next.In addition to being very funny, this movie contains a moral -- be careful what you wish for because you just might get it. Or is the moral to be happy with what you have and make the most of your life? Or that life is what you make it? Hmm...I guess the real moral is whatever you get out of it. Finish it off with a great feel-good ending, and this movie is a winner.7/10Todd</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most heart-warming comedies in years...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bedazzled is a lovely remake of the 1967 film (unseen by me), and it shows the true emotion of love in an offbeat sort of way. The movie stars one of my favorite actors, Brendan Fraser, as a complete loser and social outcast, who desperately yearns for the love of someone else. Brendan Fraser's nerd impression is actually quite amusing, albeit sad. We watch the people at his workplace constantly avoid him, when he thinks that they regard him as a friend. We also see his love for a woman (Frances O'Connor), and how he makes funny but pathetic attempts to introduce himself to her. Elliot (Fraser's character in the movie) later meets another woman (Elizabeth Hurley), who has an incredible offer for him to agree to: She will put seven wishes in his possession if he sells her his soul. His soul, you say. Why would he give his only soul to this person? Because she's the Devil.Now Elliot has some trouble with the mere fact that he must sell his soul to this person, just for seven measly wishes. Seven wishes, and no more. Just seven wishes that could alter his life forever, making him wiser, and probably a better person. So the Devil hands him the contract and he signs away, giving the only thing that makes us significant to the, as Hurley says, "Princess of Darkness". Throughout the remainder of the movie he will learn a lot. I'm not going to spoil any of his wishes, but he will find out more than he needs to know about people and life, which makes this a great movie.There was only one problem I had with this film, that is if Harold Ramis could have picked anyone for the Devil, why Elizabeth Hurley? He could of picked someone like Sandra Bernhard or Courtney Love, a real (something or other) in laments terms, and instead they get a sex symbol? But Ms. Hurley's performance, however, is a lot more keen than I expected, and she adds an entirely new edge to The Devil, making it a great film.Now I'm not going to give away the ending, either, but I must say it's one of the better endings that I've seen in recent years. It's good, it makes sense, and it is very sweet and cheery. With all the depressing and vulgar crap in our film industry today, this ending is quite sure to please just about anyone (unless you enjoy morbid and depressing resolutions) , making Bedazzled a really great film.My score(0-10): 9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crash course in wish making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, we all know that this re-make was made for no other reason than as an excuse to get Elizabeth Hurley into some ridiculous number of skimpy outfits, so there's no need to discuss that here. It's just a given. Brendan Fraser plays the part of a painfully geeky guy that gets no respect at the office and has a lonely life because he is so hopelessly nerdy, until one day when he shows up uninvited to the brewery to hang out with his work buddies and runs into the tremendously sexy Devil. She offers to grant him seven wishes (it just seems like a good number) in exchange for his useless little soul. And of course, there is a substantial romantic element to the story, which is universal for movies like this. Anytime you have a total dork like Elliott Richards (Fraser) in a movie, there is ALWAYS a girl that doesn't give him the time of day but with whom he works magic during the film.And now the nonsense begins.Elliott obviously starts off with all of the clichs ? I want to be rich, powerful, married to Allison (the girl that doesn't ever notice him), yada yada yada. Being granted by the devious Fallen Angel, of course, all of Elliott's wishes seem great at first but then soon go horribly wrong, which leads to the dumbest thing about the whole film. After returning from each wish (by dialing `666' into a pager that the devil gave him and that has 9 other useless numbers on it), he regroups, comes up with a tremendously over-compensated wish, and then tries again, only to have everything go wrong again. The obvious question is this, why didn't Elliott use any of his wishes to modify his previous wishes, rather than just starting all over and hoping all goes well? He seems like a smart enough guy, however unpopular he is. You would think it would be easier to just say I wish that Allison was married to me AND loved me, and that I was not a Colombian drug lord (and by the way, Elliot, specify your desired profession, you ARE dealing with Satan here). Can I say something here? My father is an immigrant from Colombia, and the portrayal of the super powerful Colombian drug lord in this film is completely untrue and very disturbing. Clearly, the production team for Bedazzled was too dim to realize this, but Colombia is a third world country, and what you have there is a lot of poor farmers who are harvesting some crop to feed their families. It's AMERICANS who are spending billions of dollars a year to shoot this crap into our veins or snort it up our noses or whatnot. The drug lords aren't filthy rich Hispanics living in the jungle in Colombia, people, they're Americans living here.Despite the fact that the actual wish-making procedure in the film was just poorly presented, it made for some funny situations. The badly mangled Spanish-speaking portion of the film went on for WAY too long, but some of the later mishaps were pretty funny. I don't know why, but I just about fell off the couch laughing when those smart-ass guys came up and kicked sand at Elliott on the beach when he was the most emotionally sensitive man in the world (what kind of an idiot would wish for something like that, by the way?). Actually, that's the only funny thing that I can think of right now, but trust me, the move is not a total waste of time (it's still pretty dumb, though). Don't rush out to the video store for this one, but it's worth sitting through once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, undemanding, devilish entertainment that provides a fine comedic showcase for Brendan Fraser.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it. That's the rib-tickling theme of "Bedazzled," a remake of sorts of the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore 1967 cult laughfest in which malcontent misfit Brendan Fraser is granted seven wishes by the Devil (or should I say She-Devil) in return for his soul. The trouble is each wish fulfilled somehow backfires so that the poor schmuck has to keep paging the Devil's "666" hot line to redo his wish. On his wish fulfillment list (which is carefully worked around "getting the girl"): Richest, Sexiest, Most Famous, Most Intelligent, Most Sensitive, and Most Charismatic. The fun of it all is seeing HOW Fraser's wishes are going to get screwed up.The charming Fraser gets great mileage out of his meek geek, getting a great chance to show off his comedic versatility with a variety of attitudes and accents as he morphs into each of his supposedly ideal characters . Gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley, who reminds me so much of a young Jacqueline Bisset in this movie, has a great time playing the sly, playful Deviless in disguise, whipping into smashing new outfits at the drop of a camera angle.Hand it to the producers and writers of this Faustian fluff in keeping the pace quick, the situations inventive, and not resorting to crass, predictable toilet humor to tarnish the comic luster. It's effortless, nothing great by any means, but enjoyable nevertheless. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bedazzled" is so bad it hurts. I expected this film to put out stronger and funnier performances from Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley.Beneath the set changes, so many characters being introduced and cheesy jokes; "Bedazzled" has nothing to offer the audience, which is a real shame because this film had real potential. It had the cast and plot but were unable to capitalize on these aspects.Among the problems I had with "Bedazzled" were the number of unfunny and cheesy jokes. The only thing that was funny in "Bedazzled" were the situations Brendan Fraser's character was put in. Why classify a movie that is not funny in any way as comedy?Secondly, the main plot revolved around Brendan Fraser's character falling head over heals for a co-worker who was attractive but not stunning. Why would someone use seven wishes to try and win the heart of someone who does not have that much to offer. Having said this, I thought the ending of the movie was creative and I praise the writer for writing it that way.The other problem that "Bedazzled" faced was the fact that Hurley wasn't covincing enough for me as the devil. If a movie contains a devil, make sure it looks and acts evil. Hurley seemed to be dry as the devil with no semblance of being a devil. I believe the only reason Hurley was cast was for eye candy."Bedazzled" was disjointed and unorganized; it would have been better if there were fewer characters involved for Fraser to play. We should place "Bedazzled" in the 'Oops, I shouldn't have made this film' category.Please stay away from "Bedazzled" as you can get. Two thumbs way down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply OK; Hurley is wrong Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elliott Richards is a pathetic, groveling employee of a computer company who lusts after Allison (Frances O'Connor), and who would do anything to win her. Anything ? Here comes the devil (Elizabeth Hurley) to offer him the oldest bargain ever written: the Faustian sale of his soul to the devil for his wish. Only she gives him seven wishes (and her pager), and each of his wishes lends to some mildly funny results. Such is the premise of Bedazzled, a remake to the 1967 comedy starring Dudley Moore, Peter Cook as the Devil, and Raquel Welch as Lust (who else ?) As a whole, Bedazzled is a disappointing movie. To his credit, Brendan Fraser is an excellent comic actor, and he works hard throughout the film with his different looks and accents, and successfully embodies the physical comedy required. Likewise, O'Connor is terrific and beautiful, and stands out in several scenes. One of the problems, however, is the casting of Elizabeth Hurley as Satan. While certainly beautiful, playful, and fun, this film needs a devil who is actually evil, and who could scare both Fraser and the audience. In addition, while Bedazzled boasts Larry Gelbart and Harold Ramis as co-writers, it simply doesn't achieve its comic goals. Slightly better the average.Vote: 6</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and witty movie turns to mush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elliot has no life. His co-workers despise him and his weird attitude gets him nowhere with ladies. Particularly one woman who he has known at work for four years but has never said anything more than a peep. One prayer to God that he would do anything to have this woman sparks a grand entrance from The Devil herself. Laying out the contract, Elliot gets seven wishes, in return the devil gets his soul for life. Elliot makes the deal hoping to get the woman. Unfortunately, hell is more on earth than he thought.Elizabeth is incredibly hot, and every scene she is in tickles every male 's fetishes (School girl, nurse, bikini babe, etc.). But what is a pleasant surprise is the movie is actually pretty funny in points instead of plain stupid. From the over sensitive Elliot to his Columbian crime trade, we see the poor loser go through his wildest fantasies played out till they crash terribly in the end.Thank goodness BEDAZZLED did not become stupid. However, it reached another low in becoming mushy especially toward the end. The devil starts to fancy Elliot and likewise. Then we unfortunately get to see the relationship start to interfere with business and what Elliot "really wants." Aside from the mush, the cameras seemed to do a shoddy job at the beginning especially around the devil and Elliot 's first business talk and their little car ride.BEDAZZLED has some light hearted fun and an unbelievably sexy devil. A lot would be missed if you rented it, but it seems to be the wiser choice.</fullReview>

Liz Hurley then arrives (as the devil), she really is the sexiest woman on the planet and is a sight for sore eyes in this film. She grants him 7 wishes in exchange for his soul after he confesses he would sell it to be with the woman of his dreams. I wont spoil it for you if you haven't already watched this film but it really is a fun film and one which I would recommend you go and see. After seeing this movie I didn't feel like I had wasted an hour and a half of my life but instead felt enriched and it genuinely made me happy for the rest of the day.

If you just focus on that, considering this a collection of comic skits, its partially tolerable. The odd thing is how tepid the humor gets when it veers toward matters sexual. Its all about sex, that sort of perfect movie love that's centered in sex. There's a small penis joke, but otherwise, the studio rating engineers oddly steer clear of all the stuff that could have been really funny with this body and identity shifting.Their substitute?

		<fullReview>This is quite an amusing comedy about the life of an ordinary guy who has his life changed. Ordinary and unpopular Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) does not have any real friends, and now he is in love with a work mate Alison Gardener (Frances O'Connor). He tells God "I would do anything to have that girl", and instead, he gets his wish from The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley). She says he has seven wishes (like seven deadly sins) if he sells his soul. He also has a dialler to phone 666 (the Devil's sign) if his wish isn't going the way he wants. Throughout, he wishes to be many different personalities, including (unintentionally) a powerful Spanish drug dealer, an overly-sensitive nature lover, a professional basketball player with a "little" problem, a great book writer who turns out to be gay and President Abrham Lincoln, all wishes certain to have something go wrong, it's the Devil, what do you expect? When he gets to his final wish he does not want it and he eventually gets let off after a non-personal wish. In the end, it turns out it is not Alison that he was to be with, but a lookalike with dark hair named Nicole (yes, it's still O'Connor). Also starring Orlando Jones as Daniel, Paul Adelstein as Bob, Toby Huss as Jerry and Gabriel Casseus as Elliot's Cellmate. It may be cheesy at times, and not have the biggest laughs, but it's still fun to watch. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall an enjoyable movie with laughs and smiles but nothing extra-ordinary to keep myself coming back to it.I like Brendan Fraser and the looks of Elizabeth Hurley sure stole quite a bit my attention (this fact alone might make me watch it again to catch anything I missed).The movie is all about Brendan playing a miserable guy named Elliot, hopelessly trying to get together with people but don't make it. The character is quite sad since I see too many real life people in him. Fast forward and Elliot gets a chance to fulfill his every dream trough seven wishes offered by the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) in exchange for his soul.The movies is all about the wishes, the make up the comedy and laughs. It all ends happily of course (I don't regard this as a spoiler since it is a comedy without any claims for irony or dark twists) which is appropriate for the movie but not very unique. I must recommend the DVD version that contains deleted scenes since they cut out a whole wish episode that probably didn't fit in but it was quite fun and actually added to the movie even if it is watched after the main movie is finished.I would like to see the original movie that this one was based on, starring Dudley Moore whom I'm not very fond of but still this idea is a good one and it just might have something extra.Rated 5/10 for being fun and enjoyable to watch but nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS - I just finished watching "Bedazzled" at home on DVD, and my face and eyes still hurt, I laughed so much. I suppose this kind of movie strikes a particular type of person, like me, and I can't ever recall having so much sheer fun watching a film. There are better films, to be sure, but not many funnier ones. What else should I have expected from Harold Ramis, whose contributions go all the way back to "Caddyshack" and "Ghostbusters", and who is responsible for one of my all-time favorites, "Groundhog Day." And, of course, "Analyze This", another fine comedy. Great script, great direction, and that Brendan Fraser is one of the most versatile actors around. He was absolutely believable in each of his "wish" personas. My two favorites were the Colombian drug lord, and the dumb basketball star. Elizabeth Hurley, as the devil, is also perfect casting.I probably would not have watched "Bedazzled" if it hadn't been for the recommendation of a dear friend in London. Thanks, Rebecca. Your recommendation got me to buy my own copy of the DVD, and it is one I'll enjoy watching repeatedly for a long time. I respect and like very good, serious films, like "Schindler's List", "Saving Private Ryan", "Das Boot", "The Shawshank Redemption", and more recently "Finding Forrester", "Cast Away", "Traffic", just to name a few. But I also think we should feel comfortable putting on our "silly hats" now and again for films like "Bedazzled", in the same genre as "Dumb and Dumber", "The Waterboy", and "Dirty, Rotten Scoundrels." A good comedy is one of the spices of life.The DVD is really great, both the picture and the sound, in Dolby 5.1. The colors are muted where they should be, and sizzling when sizzle is called for. The 5 surround channels are used well, and there is the occasional deep rumble from the subwoofer to add appropriate mood. The "making of" feature, narrated by Elizabeth Hurley, is one of the more enjoyable.Elliot's line, stated in my "summary", really gets the movie going. In the end, as the closing song of the film reminds us, "If you want to be someone else, then change your mind." That's what the story is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an innocuous and mildly amusing remake of a 1967 comedy formerly starring Dudley Moore. Since I haven't seen the original, I will comment on this film on its own merits. The story is a lighthearted Faustian parody where a geek named Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) sells his soul to the devil (Elizabeth Hurley) in exchange for seven wishes. Consistent with the maxim, `Be careful what you wish for', Elliot's wishes bring him numerous unintended and droll consequences.Harold Ramis has written and directed some classic comedies (`Animal House', `Caddyshack', `Ghostbusters', `Groundhog Day'), but this material comes nowhere near the standard set by his earlier films. The film is a showcase for Brendan Fraser, who is funny, but not hilarious.Fraser's performance is hit or miss. Some of his portrayals are very humorous and some fall flat. He is better when he is playing the sincere buffoon than when he is trying to render some bizarre caricature. Not much is asked of Elizabeth Hurley by this screenplay. She needed to be beautiful, sexy and naughty, which isn't much of a stretch for her. Frances O'Connor has an equally undemanding role as Elliot's love interest, being more of an object than an integral part of the film. Some of the funniest performances are given by the supporting actors especially Orlando Jones and Paul Adelstein.This film is good for some light entertainment. I rated it a 6/10. There are worse ways to spend an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broad sketches, sexy outfits but no real laughs and very episodic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elliot is lonely and finds it very hard to make friends in his workplace - displaying an acute lack of social skills anytime he tries. When he is approached by the Devil in a bar he ends up signing away his soul in exchange for seven wishes. Everything appears to be great - he can have the woman of his dreams and anything else he wants, but his wishes don't quite go the way he expected them to.Never having seen the original, I cannot fairly compare this with that, although I would hope that the duo of Cook and Moore could have made a more satisfying film than this one. The plot is just an excuse to create several sketch type sequences that replace the usual idea of a narrative flow! The sketches are amusing but never laugh out loud funny; rather they are broad jokes and clichs that are really only ever one-joke scenes. The overall message is OK but delivered in quite a pat ending that, because the film hasn't bothered to develop characters that I care about, doesn't really work (or matter).The one thing that the film does very well is make me attracted to Liz Hurley! I had never really found her that desirable before, but you would be forgiven for thinking that this film was made just to allow us to see her look sexy! Her actual performance is playful, if a little fake or maybe forced, but her legs are great and she look fantastic! Whatever she's in she looks hot and it made me feel used but good! Fraser does the best he can - he comes off with some credit as he shows a reasonable comic touch and, God bless him, he hams it up as much as he can in his `wishes'. Jones is an OK support, O'Connor is pretty and Casseus has a brief cameo - however it is Hurley's movie all the way; well, the movie belongs to her legs, breasts and stomach - and they're worth watching even if she's not!Overall this is a poor comedy. It has a sort of amusing `sketch-like' feel to it that makes it episodic in a good way, but that takes away from the development of the film and doesn't give many laughs in return. The main reason for watching this film? Hurley in an ever-changing line of sexy clothes that make her look GREAT! Although I wouldn't bother on that reason alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a nice find</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I start this reviewing saying how much I enjoyed this movie. "Bedazzled" has a very original story, in which a loser signs a contract with the devil in order to gain 7 wishes-- that are actually a curse in disguise. One thing to congratulate is the extremely professional way that Brandan Fraser portrays some characters; an actor needs to be very careful to perform such imitation. At some points I thought the story would go into a creepy stuff, and happily it didn't-- that wasn't the point of the movie afterall. It's also great that writers didn't appeal to any religion or lack of religion, allowing every kind of spectator enjoy this without feeling insulted. Moreover, it doesn't have any moral lesson to leave the spectator feeling cheesy. Great movie, indeed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I can't give you some insights about the movie that would mean a lot. Anyway, I think it made the best out of the story about the devil and even though it can't compare to Ma vie es un enfer, it was a nice comedy to watch. Elizabeth Hurley is a great comedian, really. I didn't expect something that good from a model. Along with Brandon, it was a nice dialogue to watch. I would also say each story had its unique insights that I found not too pretentious and just the kind that would make you think about some things in life, but not too seriously. I don't understand why that comedy wasn't unappreciated in its time. It served everything that a good funny movie ought to - nice laughs, fresh jokes, good acting and an interesting story. I enjoyed watching it and I recommend it to everyone, as long as they feel like watching a fine comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good update</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the original Dudley Moore/Peter Cooke film so I was surprised to find I really liked this version.Many times when a classic is "updated" all they do is change the setting and pretexts, but the update here is far deeper. Though amusing and rather irreverent for its time. the Moore/Cooke movie in the end sticks pretty close to the classic theology. God is distant, unknowable and terrible to anger. Satan is prideful and uncaring about anyone but himself.This film however updates the theology and with it makes it more applicable to the modern day. God is not distant, just hands off because we have to make our own decisions... but he does give us a whisper when we're ready to hear it. The devil is not really his adversary, but a sly sort of partner in the whole matter of educating humanity. And both are reflections of what is already inside of us, good and bad, and vice versa. In the "man makes his heaven or hell" moral it falls right in line with modern theology. In fact, an interesting seminary paper could be written contrasting these two movies and how the differences speak to the ongoing revelation of god in our lives.In short, whoever posted that the theology in this movie was not defensible is way out of touch with modern theology.</fullReview>

He was the perfect dupe for the slick Hurley, who always looked absolutely fantastic in every appearance.The make-up and costuming were marvelous, and the movie was truly funny throughout. Wow!

		<fullReview>Bedazzled is a strange film. It's based on an office nerd who suddenly has a couple of wishes to play with after being granted that power by the devil. The nerd is played by Brendan Fraser who delivers quite a good performance early on but as the wishes progress, the performances decline. Hurley plays the devil and is now where near as good as she wants can be. We see her in a string of tight outfits which seems to be the main attraction of this film for some people and as the film progresses, her voice and acting just becomes unbelievably annoying and poor. The film reaches its climax and the content just couldn't get any more cheesy. The script is predictable and all though the wish element is fun at first, you can see its just one long, pointless joke nearer the end as he becomes president of America and just the speed at which the later wishes are dealt with adds to the utter farce and stupidity of it all.I suggest you avoid this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> One thing this movie has going for it is the fact that Brendan Fraser is actually quite funny. He really pulls off doing all those characters, which gives the movie a more fresh feel. Each time he is a different person, whereas in the original he was the same guy and only thought himself as somehow different. But other than that, this is just a poor remake of a great classic marketed for more laughs to make more money. Not really worth seeing except for Brendan Fraser.

		<fullReview>This movie made me cringe. Brendan Fraser makes an ass of himself left and right. Let's go through the wishes:The first one is probably the most entertaining, simply because guns go off. As usual, Fraser's character is looked down on and makes a fool of himself.Actually, you know what? That basically sums up the entire movie. No need to go through the rest of the wishes. I have to say though that the worst scene is the one where Fraser becomes a "sensitive guy" and turns into a wimpy fruitcake. Actually, almost every character he plays is painfully pathetic. You find yourself wondering how the next wish will screw him up, and hope you won't hate the character he becomes. But you will. Elizabeth Hurley cannot act. Not that she needs to in this movie, all she really needs to do is put on tight clothes and talk in her annoying accent. As hard as she tries, she is NOT sexy.There are hardly any good points I can make about this movie. I gave it a 2/10 for some reason, perhaps because it ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fraser stars as a socially inept loser who's had a crush on one of his colleagues for several years. He'd give his soul to be with her, and is given the opportunity to do just that when he makes a deal with The Devil in the form of sexy Hurley who agrees to grant him seven wishes in exchange. As one would expect, the wishes backfire in comic fashion and he's faced with the choice of giving up his soul or trying on his own to pursue the girl of his dreams. Despite the fact that Fraser and Hurley make a likable team, the film unfolds in all-too-familiar fashion and the comedy never quite peaks the way you'd hope for. Film's ending is pretty cheap, and should have been thought out better. **</fullReview>

Too bad that the scenes in between weren't as fun to watch.Elizabeth Hurley has about as much acting talent as she has fat on her body, and it *so* boring to watch her trying to act. Brendan Fraser though, is great playing goofy characters like this one (look at e.g. the delightful romcom Blast from the Past).In short, Bedazzled is a good film. Nothing more, nothing less.

		<fullReview>This film was pretty bad. By comparison, Scary Movie was better. I have no idea how they classify this film as a comedy. It was NOT FUNNY AT ALL! It is literally the first "comedy" where I actually never laughed once. I seriously considered turning it off halfway through (just as an aside, the only film I've ever actually stopped watching is Tank Girl). What seriously bothered me about this movie was that the devil was a nice, likeable person. Elizabeth Hurley, admittedly gorgeous, simply is too nice and playful. I liked her a great deal more than the guy I was supposed to like and feel sorry for, Elliot, and I doubt that's what was intended. The wishes were very predictable and some of them (Sensitive Elliot) were so annoying that I had to fast forward a bit to get through them. Avoid this one at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, there are people who actually find this funny? To be fair, I didn't make it too far through this one, so maybe something funny happens eventually. First you see Fraser playing an unlikeable loser, which is more sad than funny. The devil turns up, acts outrageous but not funny, so I figure, maybe it gets better when we get into the wishes. So I fast forward to the first wish, and there's a long thing about Fraser discovering he can speak Spanish which isn't remotely funny. So I fast forward through that to an inept version of a gag from the first movie. Then there's Fraser as another annoying unfunny character. Then I gave up.So maybe the rest of it is brilliantly funny. But I doubt it.First off, while Fraser is a very charming light comedic actor, I don't think he's any good at this Saturday Night Live-style character sketch comedy. He's not funny, he's just annoying.Even if I hadn't seen the original film I would consider this abhorrent, but it's also striking how this film changes things in ways that are inevitably worse. In the original, the Fraser character, played by Dudley Moore, was shy and awkward and miserable, but he wasn't someone you felt you wouldn't want to be trapped in a room with. Fraser plays the role as an insufferable bore with no redeeming qualities.As for Hurley's version of the Devil, well, it's the sexy bad girl thing, a concept of Satan a guy would get after striking out with a hot girl in a bar. The original movie's devil, Peter Cook, was a very distinct and well thought-out character, a friendly bloke fond of cruel practical jokes who acted like the best friend Moore so needed. And Cook's performance was sharp and brilliant. Hurley doesn't seem to have thought anything about what the Devil would be like, she's just concerned with seeming sexy and a little bad. It is weak on its own; compared to Cook's performance, it is pathetic beyond description.But I want to emphasize again that I am not saying this is a terrible movie compared to the original. This is a terrible movie compared to other comedies of this and every other era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Original, Poor Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are risky, especially cult favorites like "Bedazzled". The first "Bedazzled", when released in 1967, was hardly an original story. It's an offbeat take on the old concept of selling of one's soul to the devil in return for fame and fortune in the temporal world. But Peter Scott and Dudley Moore turned this idea on its head and into an irreverent laugh-fest. It still routinely appears in repertoire theaters for midnight showings a la "Rocky Horror Picture Show". So how to set your new version apart from the original? Answer: cast the voluptuous Elizabeth Hurley in the role of the devil, and make her hot, hot, hot. That's good; now just remember to pack in tons of wicked, witty, irreverent humor. Ooops, the production team completely forgot the humor part (or decided to go the potty humor route). Too bad, hot Elizabeth or not, now their movie's a loser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bedazzled" is so bad it hurts. I expected this film to put out stronger and funnier performances from Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley.Beneath the set changes, so many characters being introduced and cheesy jokes; "Bedazzled" has nothing to offer the audience, which is a real shame because this film had real potential. It had the cast and plot but were unable to capitalize on these aspects.Among the problems I had with "Bedazzled" were the number of unfunny and cheesy jokes. The only thing that was funny in "Bedazzled" were the situations Brendan Fraser's character was put in. Why classify a movie that is not funny in any way as comedy?Secondly, the main plot revolved around Brendan Fraser's character falling head over heals for a co-worker who was attractive but not stunning. Why would someone use seven wishes to try and win the heart of someone who does not have that much to offer. Having said this, I thought the ending of the movie was creative and I praise the writer for writing it that way.The other problem that "Bedazzled" faced was the fact that Hurley wasn't convincing enough for me as the devil. If a movie contains a devil, make sure it looks and acts evil. Hurley seemed to be dry as the devil with no semblance of being a devil. I believe the only reason Hurley was cast was for eye candy."Bedazzled" was disjointed and unorganized; it would have been better if there were fewer characters involved for Fraser to play. We should place "Bedazzled" in the 'Oops, I shouldn't have made this film' category.Please stay away from "Bedazzled" as you can get. Two thumbs way down.</fullReview>

The only thing that Ramis &amp; Co. seem to have accomplished in this exercise is completely subverting everything that makes the original such a pleasure to watch.Dudley Moore's bumbling yet endearing short-order cook is replaced by Brendan Fraser as a genuinely annoying computer geek--honestly, I don't know why we're supposed to like Fraser's character; I couldn't stand to be around him for a minute. Where the original "Bedazzled" ended on a beautifully dismal note, this edition opted to go with wishy-washy optimism. And perhaps worst of all, every bit of the biting British wit of the 1967 film has been replaced by a deep and abiding Californian sappiness.Go see the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original--don't waste your time with this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bedazzled Dazzling or yawn?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bedazzled Dazzling? or Yawn?"Bedazzled" is a great comedy for the whole family. An amusing hilarious, motion picture starring Eliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) a sad pathetic bubbly, loser who works at Synednyne technical Support . Who has associates who he thinks are his friends, (Paul Adelstein) as Bob, ( Miriam Shor) as Carol, (Orlando Jones)as Daniel and (Toaby Huss) as Jerry. Eliot thinks that some day there will be a magic wand that will wave around and make everything better ? it has come, as a Devil (Elizabeth Hurley). Who gave him only seven wishes for his soul? He is a desperate man, who wants to be with a girl named Alison Gardner (Frances O'Conner). Well he is so desperate for her he actually makes a deal! In his wishes, he wishes to be stronger, more attractive, and wealthy to attract Alison; he realizes it just doesn't work that way because every wish he has had, as became a total nightmare.The acting in this film is admirable. Especially the fact that Brendan Fraser and Frances O'Conner had to change there character about 5 or 6 times and pulled it off pretty well, is amazing I'd say they're talented actors. And since Elizabeth Hurley is in this film, looking her best ever there is no way for a guy to not want to see this film especially with her sassy ever-changing wardrobe. Which makes her look like nothing but, fantastic in every scene. I have watched this film more than a hundred times (no joke) and I still enjoy it!So witch is it, a movie that makes you yawn and want to go to bed? Or is it a Dazzling movie that you enjoyed? I'd say DAZZLING!!!Alys L. ,13 years old</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nonsense or overlooked?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you know what is a slob? For real? This movie is way overlooked. Harold Ramis did a genius work in it and I can't even put it in words. That's why he made the movie, he was probably tired of trying to write books.I just must say, I've seem all kinds of movies, my favourite movie use to be Forrest Gump and I didn't even know why. I still have just one thing I haven't figured out about Forrest Gump, a movie made for people who lived everything in their lives already. I still wonder how the soundtrack composer could do that music be so perfect. It tells all the movie story in just one song with no words at all. That's just another genius work.But, Bedazzled have that, and even more. I don't even know how many movies I've ever watched. I did missed some big names such as Schindler's List or half of Hanibal trilogy or even Dogville. But I've watched most of the big ones and a lot of small ones as well.I do watch animes, Full Metal is a work greater than Matrix. Azumanga Daioh reminds me of Seinfeld a damn lot. Ranma is the best anime comedy I've seem and Akira is almost childish, like Forrest Gump, but it's so nice.12 Monkeys, Brazil, Monty Python and all Terry Gilliam work is way too pessimist. I love all of them, but being pessimist make them incomplete to me, as I'm an optimist.I also have watched some European movies and most Brazilian movies. Those I won't even try to cite names, since they're not international, and some don't even have a name in English.No story that I've ever seem, not even Peter Pan, Neverland, Hook, Spiderman, Batman, Hulk, Superman or X-Men have ever beaten Bedazzled. Ever.Not even old movies I don't even know names, such as Ben Hur, and some that keep telling Jesus stories, Maome cartoons, or Greek novels.This is by far, today, my favourite movie as "best movie I've ever watched". I just need to watch Chaplin again to be able to better compare, and more Steve Martin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah well, it had to happen sometime. Brendan Fraser makes one bad film in an otherwise decent career.The trouble is, its not his fault. Whoever cast Liz Hurley should be strung up. She is certainly not convincing enough. Pretty, granted, but not enough. A better choice might have been Christina Ricci. At least she would have had a fun time trying to doodle Elliott out of his wishes. This is a mess of a movie. To have even considered remaking a film which was not known as a huge box office hit around the first time was bad enough but this is taking the mickey. Is there no originality left in Hollywood anymore? I'm amazed that Harold Ramis even put his name to this.Still, if you are not expecting anything serious then try it but don't expect too much. And someone give Brendan Fraser better material to work with in future even if its a bad film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so patheticly stupid. It's plot was pathetic and not worth the effort. I am disappointed that Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley would pick such a stupid movie. They are usually in good ones. Don't go see this movie. It's not worth the money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can only remember walking out of two movies in my life.This was the third.It's the only Harold Ramis movie I have not liked, ever, acting or directing. Episode 1 (wish 1) turned out to be trite and boring once it developed. Oh-oh. Then episode 2 was exactly the same. I stayed through episode 3 to see if there would be any hint of change, and when there wasn't I left.Hurley is still nothing and I guess she always will be. But I was warming to Brendan Fraser, and now this is a big setback.On the IMDb scale of 1 to 10 I had to vote 1 because there is no 0.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sympathy for the devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know exactly where the expression "you poor devil" came from, but I suspect it started with A similar idea to the one that drives the 2000 remake of `Bedazzled.' This idea is that the devil, lucifer, beelzebub, whomever, is a sort of salesman (or woman) walking the Earth trying to close as many deals as possible. Everyone hates salespeople except salespeople. People like Elliott (played by the versatile Brendan Frasier) are the reason telemarketers exist: for every 10 wise people, there's always one sucker. Still, for the seller, the low percentage of success must be disheartening. I chuckled upon hearing the devil, played by Elizabeth Hurley, say "this job sucks!"Unfortunately, so does the movie.This is the weakest work I've ever seen from Harold Ramis (at least as a director). Both uninteresting and unoriginal, `Bedazzled' fails at nearly everything it sets out to do: It should make you think about what you would do with seven wishes. It doesn't. It should make you laugh. It doesn't, at least not often enough.Another waste of money by a movie studio.Grade: D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, I was like most of you. I saw this as simply yet one more outrage perpetrated by the venal Hollywood jerks. Then it finally soaked in on me. I had been so blinded by my contempt for the despoilers, that I had missed the horned one's evil hand.If Satan really existed, what WOULD he do? After all, the flick is blaring forth with the concept right and left. Take one of the top 100 movies, remake it for no reason other than money, corrupt a greatly underrated comic talent into directing it, start the flick out with jarringly unfunny "gags" but, rather than delivering a film famously awful, settle into a simply mediocre flow of dross, get movie-buffs so worked up that we lose faith in the wonder and majesty that is comedy.In other words, el diablo has won. Do not accept that! Rise up and revolt against those trying to get us to believe that comedy is dead. Don't let Hollywood beat us down into submission!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another example of a poor script, bad acting, and shallow characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This age old story line has nothing new offered in this movie, except that Elliot Richards gets 7 wishes rather than 3. The entire movie follows his wishing for what he wants, and always having his wishes turn out badly. While the little wish sketches could have been funny if perhaps Brendan Fraser were say, Jim Carrey, Fraser certainly is not. In fact, his mellowdrama, doofy guy smile only gets more annoying. All his wishes are strung together with poor dialogue that first time director Pete Jones, the director of Project Greenlight's Stolen Summer, could improve. Elizabeth Hurly at least is pretty to look at.Overall, all I got from this was the feeling that I could have spent the last 90 minutes on the toilet and be more productive. If you are looking for a movie to remind you that You can't get what you want just through wishes, go rent Disney's Aladin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They oughta be ashamed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've sat through a lot of remakes, but I can't recall one as insulting as this. Ramis and Gelbart, who you'd think would know better, have gutted this classic and left only a trivial shell. Gone are the intelligence, wit, pathos, questioning of religion and disrespect for the divine ego that made the 1967 original so special, and all we have left is a set of thin gags stretched to the point of pain. Hurley and Fraser try gamely, but they don't have much to work with except a lot of costume changes. To top it off, the satisfying resolution of the original - Stanley Moon's maturing past the need for *any* sort of supernatural help-- is replaced here by a jaw-droppingly cheesy bit of divine intervention, a flurry of special effects, and a cute ending. Did they really think this denouement was covered by having Mme. Satan tell Elliott that heaven and hell are right here on earth after all, and gee whiz, life is what you make it? Gad.If they'd just called this movie something else it would just be another cute romantic comedy with a fantasy subplot and I'd have no problem with it. But as a remake of "Bedazzled" it is, IMHO, an offense, and further proof that too many modern filmmakers think the moviegoing audience is a flock of dumb sheep.(Good moment: the chess game in the final minutes. Nice touch. Sorry there aren't more like it.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bedazzled Isn't Exactly A Movie That Was Supposed To Be Along Flying High And The Monty Python Movies As The Best Comedy Film Of All Time However It Is Still A Funny Movie. My Favourite Part Is When Elliott Asks For The Sports Wish And The Devil Gives Him Dennis Rodman And He Squeals And She Just Says "Just Kidding", I Find That Personally One Of The Best Parts, Another Great Part Is When He's Wishing To Be A Sensitive Man He Says "I Wish I Was The Most Sensitive Man Alive...No Wait, I Wish I Was The Most EMOTIONALLY Sensitive Man Alive" And The Devil Replies "Damn I Was Hoping You Wouldn't Catch That, I Could've Had A Lot Of Fun With That" I Just Had To Laugh At That. The Only Downside Is That I Think Orlando Jones Was Underused In This Film, He Could've Done So Much More. Overall I Recommend At Least One Viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misbegotten complete failure. See the original instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original is a dangerous proposal at best and this one fails in so many ways. First, all the philosophical and wickedly delicious satire that grounds the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original are ruthlessly thrown out like yesterday's bathwater. There are no conversations, much less witty or intelligent conversations, about the nature of God, the Devil, and man. Either the writers were too dim to *get it*, didn't think the audience would put up with an intellectual dimension or most likely just couldn't top the original script.Second, I can't believe anyone would be stupid enough to cast a woman as the Devil, much less a beautiful one. The whole point of Fraser's character's bargain with the Devil was to win a girl he was too shy to approach. If you don't see the incongruity of conspiring with a woman who looks like Elizabeth Hurley to win some other woman, I can't explain it to you. Sure enough, even the writers of this dreck woke up one morning and realized, "Hey, Elliot's quite likely to notice that the Devil is more attractive than any other option on his plate!", necessitating a scene where Hurley changes into a HUGE DEVIL, complete with warts, yellow eyes, and the full range of big-budget Special Effects, to squelch THAT idea.Finally, as another reviewer has noted, Elliot's wishes are just scattershot semi-random stabs at getting himself into a situation he can live with. There's no successive refinement of the wishes to take into account what happened earlier, thus no true matching of wits (the traditional essence of Faust tales) between the Devil and Elliot.The sets are opulent and the costumes exquisite. Big production values all around. Unfortunately for this empty shell of an imitation, Cook and Moore's original proves yet again that money isn't necessary to make a good movie, but brains are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that the director who made the terrific "Groundhog Day" and the clever, and sometimes very funny "Analyze This" , along with the wonderful actor from "The Scout" and "Gods and Monsters" could have made this mess. Not one joke (there really is only one joke here, misstated wishes) works, and nothing plays out. To make matters worse, there is the jaw-dropping performance by Ms. Hurley. Does she really think that bouncing up and down when she walks ( and even sometimes when she's supposed to be standing still) is funny or sexy?It's really not Brendan Fraser's fault, and it's not the first time that he's been seen over-playing in a desperate attempt to make unfunny material work (see "dudley do-right" for a textbook example of desperation), but what was going on with Mr. Ramis? Did he just give up on the project at some point?They should have burned this</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the inaptly named `Bedazzled' - a virtually laughless remake of a 1967 Peter Cook/Dudley Moore comedy - the old Faust legend takes one of its severest beatings ever. I've seen the original film only once before ? at a revival theatre in the mid ?70's ? and remember finding it to be a fresh, original and occasionally laugh-out-loud hilarious British comedy. Unfortunately, none of those adjectives can be applied to this newest version, which strands Brandan Fraser and the stunning Elizabeth Hurley in 90-minutes worth of repetitious humorless nonsense.Strike one against this film is that it is basically a one-joke concept stretched out to be a full length feature film ? sort of like a 90-minute version of a mediocre `Bewitched' episode. Hopelessly nerdy Elliot (Fraser) - who is such an overbearing geek that his coworkers are forced to run and hide when he comes in their vicinity - makes an idle wish one day to be with the beautiful young woman he loves and yearns for from afar. Enter Hurley as the devil who takes Elliot in hand, promising him that he will be granted seven wishes on the understanding that his soul will be required as final payment. What Elliot doesn't understand is that making a bargain with the `Father of Lies' ? even if in the guise of a beautiful woman - virtually guarantees that each wish will, in some way, fall far short of securing him total happiness.Since the 1967 original managed to make a genuinely funny comedy out of the very same material, we must assume that the failure of this version lies not in the premise but in the execution. So where did this particular group of filmmakers go wrong? Part of the problem may lie in the fact that Brandan Fraser, though a likable enough actor on the surface, is hardly a gifted subtle comedian on the level of Dudley Moore. Elizabeth Hurley, easily one of the most stunningly gorgeous actresses working in films today, looks sensational in the part of the temptress and she does convey a certain sly sexiness that might have worked if the jokes had simply been funnier. Here too is part of the problem ? the weakness of the script. The scrapes Elliot inadvertently wishes himself into are simply not very imaginative or humorous. One of the funniest sequences I have ever seen in a film actually occurs in the original `Bedazzled,' when Moore finds himself stranded in a convent filled with nuns bouncing on trampolines. This film could have used a few bouncing nuns I think. Instead, Elliot's adventures come across as hopelessly mundane in their nature and, even worse, the caricatures he is called upon to act out in many of the scenes border nearly on the grotesque. Perhaps, Jim Carey might have been able to pull this part off.You know you're in trouble when, as a viewer, you begin to count off how many wishes the main character has already used up. If it weren't for the eye-candy provided by Ms. Hurley, `Bedazzled' would truly be hell on Earth. As it is, it seems more like purgatory. Now if only we could figure out which sins we are being forced to atone for. If I knew, I promise I would stop committing them immediately.</fullReview>
