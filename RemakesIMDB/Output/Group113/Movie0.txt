		<shortDescription>Swift, scary update on the "Had I But Known..." theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A toothsome little potboiler whose 65-minute length doesn't seem a second too short, My Name is Julia Ross harks back to an English tradition of things not being what they seem -- Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes is one example. Out-of-work Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job at a new employment agency in London, whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend. After reporting to duty, she wakes up (Having Been Drugged) in a vast Manderley-like pile on the Cornish coast, supposedly as the barmy-in-the-crumpet wife of George Macready, who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks. His doting, enabling mum is the irresistible Dame May Whitty (this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of good-vs-evil than she occupied in The Lady Vanishes). The nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically; we know what's going on but are powerless to tell poor Julia. This movie, curiously, is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest (and very few British) films noirs. I think it's closer to the Gothic old-dark-house tradition than the American one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption; it does, however, evince a more modern, psychoanalytic cast of mind. Whatever you call it, it remains a sharply satisfying thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can second the emotions of other comments about this taut thriller. It's extremely well-acted, especially by Nina Foch, a fine actress whose close resemblance to Ann Baxter may have limited her opportunities.George Macready, man of the golden voice, is good as poor Marian/Julia's "husband". His mother's reactions to his violent psychopathic tendencies are among the film's best moments. Dame May Whitty is at her best as the scheming, protective mother. The film does NOT seem too short. Its only fault is an over-reliance on convenient plot devices like a sleeping draught, a nightdress tossed out the window, a mysterious cat, an intercepted letter etc. Yet Lewis's direction is noteworthy for its economy and for the way he generates Hitchcockian suspense without overdoing anything. Three years later, Dame May Whitty would also appear in Columbia's THE SIGN OF THE RAM, in which she embodies a meddlesome busybody. That film and MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS would make a fine double-bill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched this film strictly on the strength of reviewers' ratings I was most pleasantly surprised. Although clearly low-budget, it bears the signs of clever ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes in the strange house and looks out the window I found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be enhanced with an exterior shot focused on her face and then moving backwards to include the house and its isolated location. And lo and behold! the next scene was exactly that last shot of the house standing lonely on the cliff at the water's edge. There are other examples of how a clever director can elevate his film to the level of a very enjoyable thriller. Savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed.As to the performances, George Macready is his usual creepy self, barely maintaining his composure while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as the no-nonsense working girl who's not about to submit without a fight. But Dame May Witty, oh boy, she even had me doubting my own eyes and believing she could get away with her evil schemes.This a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quickie feature from Columbia is taut but very brief...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Second-feature concerns a young woman in London desperate for a job, happy to accept live-in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy--I end up feeling like a prisoner too--but this rather classy B-film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic. It's far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is quick on her feet. Rehashing this in 1986 (as "Dead Of Winter") proved not to be wise, as the plot-elements are not of the modern-day. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!) but it stays the course nicely until a too-rushed climax, which feels a little sloppy. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-notch nuttiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A demented little thriller from low-budget genius Joseph H Lewis. It's the film that finally got him noticed in Hollywood. The cinematography is by the great Burnett Guffey and he starts us off with a stunning shot of a rain-soaked street reflecting brilliant sunlight in our eyes. We're in a Hollywood version of England throughout, the whole film is virtually studio-bound. The paranoid plot has Julia kidnapped by a family desperate to cover up a murder by son George MacReady (who calmly slashes up cushions to show us how crazy he is). They pretend to everyone that Julia is the dead wife and that she's lost her mind - that way it'll be no surprise when she turns up dead, the victim of "suicide". The plot is imaginative, silly and strange, and Lewis compliments it perfectly with driving camera moves and striking compositions. Check out how Lewis covers three pages of dialogue with half an hour's shooting - a closeup of Julia's eyes, her face masked by MacReady's threatening shoulder...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hide the Furniture Cushions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who think of Dame May Witty as the kindly, slightly batty, old lady from Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, this movie requires an adjustment. Here, she's anything but kindly or batty. Instead, her son, George Macready is the loony one. Just don't give him a knife, otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe. Now we know what he has in mind for the trapped Nina Foch if he can just get out from under Mother's domineering hand.Really tight little woman-in-danger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout. The script never strays from Foch's dilemma. She's held prisoner in a big old Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea. They're going to kill her, but why. Her predicament makes no sense. The tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another, but even strangers seem against her. We begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her.Director Joseph H. Lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so. Then too, watch Foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top. Witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line. My one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events. Nonetheless, it's a good, nerve-wracking way to spend a little over an hour, courtesy Columbia studios.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charming and Truly Suspenseful Little Gothic Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail-biter. She accepts a position as secretary to a London society dowager (played imperiously by Dame May Witty) and her creepy son (the effete and bothersome George Macready). Before she knows it, she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor she's never seen before, where Witty and Macready are calling her Marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that she's Macready's mad wife. Of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds, and even though we know Julia has to eventually escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how she'll manage it."My Name Is Julia Ross" has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period, but I was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe-string budget and B-movie pedigree. There are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat, and I found myself really rooting for Julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine would have swooned, screamed and dithered, waiting for her hero to come and save her. So I can't tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herself.Well done.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MY NAMES IS JULIA ROSS is a neat little thriller from Columbia later remade in '87 as DEAD OF WINTER with Mary Steenburgen as the unfortunate girl who finds herself prisoner in a strange household.Here it's NINA FOCH who answers an employment agency ad and ends up in a household ruled by DAME MAY Witty and GEORGE MACREADY--and a plan that must have seemed daring and original when the story first appeared in '45.Seems that she wakes up after a drugged night of sleep and finds out she has a new identity--no longer Julia Ross. Macready declares that he's her husband and Dame May Witty calls her by a different name. The two of them are conspiring to keep her there until their ultimate plan is carried out. Foch, of course, intends to get to the bottom of the thing and free herself from their hold on her.What really hurts the story is the manufactured ending which is much too abrupt and too full of coincidence and loopholes to be believable. But still, while you're watching the story unfold, it does have its share of tension and suspense.Personally, I prefer the more elaborately plotted remake with Mary Steenburgen and Roddy McDowall which came along in the '80s, called DEAD OF WINTER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional "B" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is fun.Along with "The Narrow Margin" and "Face Behind the Mask" this is one of the best B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), is well-directed, fast paced and exciting. It only stumbles at the end which I found a bit too implausible to buy.Foch (a good actress) is just OK in the lead but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and frightening) as the villains. Well worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a typical grade B movie in 1940s Hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations. Why? It has a wonderful plot and backed up by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Dame May Witty, as a female villain, of all people.When a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary, she certainly gets more than she bargained for. The only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise. Seems that Witty and MacReady want to pass her off as their daughter-in-law and wife, respectively. MacReady killed his real wife and wants to do Foch in as well so that a body can be claimed.The film deals with how Foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does. Why don't people believe her?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...I've fallen and I can't get up....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture starts off pretty well but quickly tails off into the Predictable Potboiler category. Answering an add from a phony employment agency, Nina Foch (Julia Ross) is kidnapped by a family anxious to find an alibi for unstable George Macready, who has evidently killed his wife. So, she becomes the unwilling stand-in.A pretty good start, but things go quickly downhill along with viewer interest. The main complaint is that Julia Ross is an extremely passive and helpless kidnap victim, thereby setting the Women's Lib movement back more than half a century. Showing very little gumption or pugnacity, she is easily held back, caught, restrained and forbidden throughout the film and each morning she is shown awaking in her bed, presumably after a good nights sleep. She does a great deal of grousing and complaining but does not show much forethought to or urgency towards escaping - wouldn't that be your main thought in a similar circumstance? Well, as I say the whole movie was a turn off, especially the hilariously contrived ending. Miss Foch did her best with out much to work with, and the support cast, Dame May Witty in particular, was very competent. It is mercifully short at 65", but it's not time well spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In London, Julia Ross (Nina Foch) is totally broken and unsuccessfully seeking a job. Her previous love affair with the lawyer Dennis Bruce (Roland Varno) has ended and he has just married with another woman on the previous night. When she sees an advertisement in a newspaper in the boarding house where she lives, she goes to the employment agency and she is interviewed by Ms. Sparkes (Anita Sharp-Bolster). When she learns that Julia is alone in London with neither relatives nor boyfriend, she offers a job position of private secretary with the wealthy Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty) and her son Ralph Hughes (George Macready). Julia is immediately hired and Mrs. Hughes tells that she must move to her house that night. Julia goes to the boarding house of Mrs. Mackie (Doris Lloyd) to pack her things and she meets Dennis that called off his wedding. They schedule a date for the next Friday and she goes to the house. Julia wakes up two days later at a seaside manor in Cornwall. Further, the employees believe that she is Marion Hughes, the wife of Ralph, who is unstable due to a nervous breakdown and delusional. Soon she learns that Ralph has killed Marion and now she is his alibi. Further he is plotting a scheme to kill her as if she had committed suicide. What can Julia do to save her life?"My Name is Julia Ross" is an entertaining film with an original story unlikely to happen. Julia Ross trapped in the mansion usually does not take the correct attitudes. Arthur Penn's "Dead Winter" uses a different storyline that slightly recalls the general idea of "My Name is Julia Ross". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Trágico Álibi" ("Tragic Alibi")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one can't be beat for chills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph H. Lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir. This is surely his best.It doesn't have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir. Though American-made, it is set entirely in England. It lacks gangsters. It lacks a femme fatale. It does not lack crime.The title character answers an ad. She is overjoyed that she'll be making some money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot. Only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal. And Nina Foch gives the sense of a strong woman as Julia.Part of the excitement comes from casting against type: Ms. Foch has an elegant manner. She is no screaming, cowering victim. She is actually a bit icy and patrician, albeit impecunious. This makes her character's plight all the more believable.Surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of Dame May Witty. She was (and is) probably most famous for the charming title character in "The Lady Vanishes." She has a sweet manner and a harmless, slightly dithering manner. But here she is far from a heroine.George Macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son. The whole cast, in fact, is superb.It seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident. Undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it on a low budget. That is the thrill and charm of film noir, the real film noir: It is small, convincingly lowlife, and, in this case, unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a "Hitch"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that it seems Alfred Hitchcock should have directed; The Gazebo is another that comes to mind. Similar to "The Wrong Man" (which was a true story), the odds seem so heavily stacked against our heroine that it seems she will never be able to save herself. Another comparison that comes to mind is "Gaslight".Dame May Witty never gave a bad performance in her life, but here, she seems to sleepwalk through a role that doesn't give her much to work with. Her motivations are never fully revealed beyond the convenient fact that she loves her son.George McCready just has to walk in front of the camera to give me a chill. This "over the top" role may have looked silly had any other actor tried to tackle it.And finally, there's Nina Foch. I have always enjoyed watching her, but never thought she was a terrific actress. I WANTED her to be terrific, because she has a naturally exotic and sensual face and overall appearance, but she never seemed to submerge herself in a role - she always seemed a bit distant and aloof. It's interesting to me that she spent decades as an acting teacher/coach. As the saying goes, "Those who can, do; those who can't, teach".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Name Is Julia Ross is directed by Joseph H. Lewis and adapted to screenplay by Muriel Roy Bolton from The Woman in Red written by Anthony Gilbert. It stars Nina Foch, Dame Mary Witty, George Macready, Roland Varno, Anita Sharp-Bolster and Doris Lloyd. Music is by Mischa Bakaleinikoff and cinematography by Burnett Guffey. Julia Ross (Foch) out of work and in debt arrears to her landlady, hastily accepts a in-house secretarial position to Mrs. Hughes (Whitty). Starting work in the Hughes house in London the first night, she wakes up two days later in a cliff-top mansion in Cornwall. She is told she has been away with mental health problems, her name is Marion Hughes and she is married to Ralph Hughes (Macready)...A very important film in the career of the great Joseph H. Lewis, My Name is Julia Ross would effectively put the director on the map, with noir fans subsequently rewarded with the likes of Gun Crazy and The Big Combo. Compact in running time (65 minutes) and budget, it's a film that showcases just what real good work could be achieved by a director and photographer noir team working under tight restrictions; classical noir production if you like.Story as it is is pretty straightforward and familiar, but atmosphere and visual smartness ensure this is no walk down retread lane. It falls into the Gothic noir spectrum of films, following in the traditions of Rebecca, Gaslight and Suspicion. In fact, it's also very much "old dark house" on staple terms, with eerie staircase, wood panelled rooms, secret passageways and even a black cat. While the setting, house on a seaside cliff where the mist rolls in at night, is splendidly moody.The characterisations (very well performed by the cast) are vivid and odd, with us clearly meant to note that Julia Ross is clearly the only normal being in the Hughes household! Best of the bunch is Macready's Ralph Hughes, the catalyst for all the things that are happening, he fondles his knives like a fetishist, a truly memorable noir antagonist.Ultimately it's what Lewis and Guffey bring to the fore that makes the film better than it is on the page. Expressionistic touches are here of course, but it's the skew-whiff camera placements and up close POV shots that bring the viewer into Julia's confused new world. Memorable scenes are frequent, be it a rain sodden street or Julia peering through the bars of her bedroom, there's visual treats aplenty here.The ending is all to quick and as is often the case in this type of narrative, implausibilities need to be ignored. But that is easy to do, because with atmosphere unbound and not a shot wasted, this is a safe recommendation to the Gothic noir faithful. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Gothic B noir from the director of GUN CRAZY and THE BIG COMBO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is a mesmerizing 1945 B thriller from Joseph H. Lewis, arguably one of the very finest directors of Hollywood noir films. This 65 minute Gothic oddity from Columbia Pictures came after Lewis' lengthy apprenticeship as the helmer of a string of poverty row westerns, East Side Kids comedies, horror melodramas (including the incredibly bizarre Bela Lugosi shocker THE INVISIBLE GHOST) and standard studio B product (SECRETS OF A CO-ED, BOMBS OVER BURMA, THE FALCON IN SAN FRANCISCO, etc)---all of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive Mr. Lewis. MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS (as well as SO DARK THE NIGHT from the following year) introduced a director who had mastered the rare and delicate art telling a dark and probing tale swiftly and efficiently on the most modest of budgets. Later Lewis productions like GUN CRAZY (1949) and THE BIG COMBO (1955), despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure, continued to rely upon deft, lucid camera work and effective low-key lighting. And very modest resources.MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS probably owes more to the tradition of British mysteries (it's set in a studio-bound England) than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and trappings. A young woman (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman (Dame Mae Witty). Two days after her arrival she awakens from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and, mysteriously enough, with a brand new identity---that of the old woman's daughter-in-law. Told that she's been the victim of a nervous breakdown, she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament. But before long she begins to piece together the strange and troubling truth behind this dark mystery, that her "husband" (the always menacing George Macready) most probably murdered his real wife and that she's been duped into participating in a harrowing and sinister scheme. Much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest tale are the indelible touches that Lewis brings to the production, marking it as the first of his truly serious endeavors as a film director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a good B-movie that it actually became an A picture!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Name is Julia Ross" is a very, very rare sort of picture. It was created with a very modest budget and cast in order to be the second, or 'B' picture at a double-feature. However, when the film was screened, people liked the film so much that at many showings, it was the premier picture! This is rather unheard of and says a lot about the story from Muriel Bolton and Anthony Gilbert--as well as the direction by Joseph H. Lewis.The film begins with Julia (Nina Foch) looking for work. She's frustrated in her search and is excited when she sees that a new employment agency has opened. They interview her for a job and during the course of the interview, they have some strange questions--does she have any family, does she have a boyfriend and the like. Well, she can answer no to most of the questions but lies about the boyfriend part--telling them she has no one in her life. They are thrilled and offer her a job. Here's the bizarre twist. She suddenly finds herself drugged! And, she wakes up two days later in a prison-like mansion!! And, these strangers begin referring to her by another woman's name! She insists that she IS Julia Ross and demands to be set free but they treat her like she is insane. Her 'mother-in-law' (Dame May Witty) and 'husband' (George Macready) obviously have something awful in mind--but what? And, with all the neighbors having been told that she is a schizophrenic, she cannot convince any of them that she is telling the truth! What's next? See the film for yourself.Th bottom line is that everything works well in this film--the acting, writing, direction, sets. The only negative, and it's a minor one, but back in the 1940s, Hollywood had the Production Code and according to this code, evil had to be punished so viewers know that somehow things WILL work out for good. A similar film that works even better is the 1960s French film "Diaboliquement Vôtre". Likewise a man has been kidnapped and folks work very hard to convince him he's someone else. But because there is no code to restrict the film, the ending is VERY dark and more satisfying. Still, both are exceptional films and I recommend both very highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nina Foch insists that "My Name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the film suffers. It could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer.When I was growing up, Foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.It's a live-in situation; once Julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.The acting is very good. Low budget but still entertaining - some things, particularly at the end, happen way too quickly, which is why I said the movie is too short. Nevertheless, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let Dame May Witty's cute grandmotherly face fool you. She's out for no good in this delicious film noir sleeper where a fake employment agency is created for the most nefarious of schemes. George MacReady, the most sinister actor under contract to Columbia, is cast as her son whose mysterious past leads way to the necessity to hire Foch on as Witty's new secretary, in fact, a position in which they do not really need to fill. MacReady's the ultimate mama's boy, and Witty must take on certain characteristics she deplores in order to get him out of his latest mess. Where does Foch fit into all these plans? Well, unless you read the plot synopsis, you're better off not knowing, because that's half the fun here in watching everything unfold and all the cards fall into place.The sweet faced Nina Foch essays total confusion as she is thrown into a new life which she does not understand anything about. But all isn't letter perfect for MacReady, Witty and Anita Bolster as the severe looking housekeeper who posed as the employment agency. Witty, so lovable as the title character in "The Lady Vanishes" and so pompous (with a hidden side of compassion) as the town matron complaining about middle class people wearing "mink coats and no manners" in "Mrs. Miniver", gives one of her most stunning performances, and the lack of an Oscar nomination for her role is certainly a crime in itself. As for MacReady, this is definitely his most challenging performance, and those who only know him as the husband in "Gilda" will find him quite remarkable.When he declares about the rocky waters below the huge frightening mansion he's holding Foch prisoner in, "Beautiful isn't? Would you like to listen to the sea and hear what it says? It doesn't say anything, does it. That's what I like about the sea. It never tells its secrets, and it has many secrets", the film takes on an almost film noir variation of "Rebecca", "Wuthering Heights" and "Jane Eyre". Film Noir doesn't get any more Gothic than this, and even in smaller roles, the tiny cast is excellent. Roland Varno as Foch's possible rescuer, Doris Lloyd as the cockney landlady and especially Joy Harington as the thieving maid in Lloyd's boarding house give more to the haunting atmosphere. An above average remake, "Dead of Night" (with Mary Steenburgen), is equally as almost forgotten as this, genuinely one of those small little sleepers that has attracted a cult following and is starting to get the acclaim which it has long deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Evil Conspiracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Gothic noir, with its story of a woman-in-danger who's trapped in a creepy mansion, seems to inhabit the same territory as Alfred Hitchcock's "Rebecca" (1940) and George Cukor's "Gaslight" (1944). Unlike its predecessors however, it's a low-budget offering with a relatively short running time. It's fast-moving, suspenseful and full of snappy dialogue and features a cast of colourful characters who are involved in a particularly evil conspiracy. Director Joseph H Lewis' reputation as a talented filmmaker was cemented by the great commercial success that this movie achieved and his skills in creating a brooding atmosphere and making effective use of close-ups is especially apparent in this tense melodrama.Julia Ross (Nina Foch) is a young lady in London who, after a short period of ill-health, finds herself three weeks behind on her rent and out of work. When she sees a newspaper advertisement for a new employment agency, she immediately goes to visit the agency's office and is interviewed by the rather severe-looking Mrs Sparkes (Anita Sharp-Bolster). After establishing that Julia doesn't have any family ties or a boyfriend, Mrs Sparkes decides that she would be suitable for work as a live-in private secretary to her client, Mrs Hughes (Dame May Witty). Mrs Hughes subsequently approves the appointment and at her insistence, Julia moves into her new employer's house that evening.Next morning, Julia wakes up in a strange bedroom in a mansion overlooking the sea in Cornwall and is told by Mrs Hughes and her son Ralph (George Macready) that she's Ralph's wife Marion and when Mrs Sparkes appears to be working at the house as Mrs Hughes' housekeeper, Julia becomes extremely alarmed and recognises that she's being held prisoner. When Julia protests about her situation, no-one takes any notice because the staff have all been told that she's recovering from a mental breakdown and her numerous attempts to escape all end in failure.Despite the treatment that she's subjected to, Julia never doubts her own sanity or her identity and is reassured in these matters when she discovers a secret passage and overhears Mrs Hughes and Ralph discussing their plans to murder her as part of a scheme to cover up a previous murder. Julia's only chance of escape then seems to rest in her own ability to outwit her captors.As the psychotic villain of the piece, George Macready conveys all the madness and menace that Ralph Hughes embodies as he indulges in his unhealthy obsession with knives and consistently fails to control his violent temper. Dame May Witty is very credible as her character who externally seems to be a typically posh elderly lady but is in fact, cruel, amoral and the mastermind of an extremely wicked conspiracy. Nina Foch, on the other hand, does a great job by showing her fear at times but also by being convincingly natural on other occasions.The disorientation and fear that Julia experiences in this movie are well reinforced visually by the use of tilted camera angles and close-ups and her state of being imprisoned is also emphasised by symbols such as the bars on her bedroom window and a shadow-grid on the staircase wall. Similarly, the shadowy compositions within the mansion contribute to the uncomfortable claustrophobic atmosphere that compliments Julia's predicament perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs to be Rediscovered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Name is Julia Ross (1945) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Intense thriller has a broke woman (Nina Foch) accepting a live-in job where she is to work as a secretary for a kind woman (Dame May Witty) and her son (George Macready). The woman shows up at the house but wakes up the next morning with the mom and son trying to tell her that she's his long lost wife. What's really going on is that they're going to hold this woman captive in hopes of driving her crazy. This here is a film I had never heard about until it came up on Turner Classic Movies and host Robert Osbourne wasn't lying when he said it needed a new crowd to discover it. This "B" movie from Columbia runs a very fast paced 66-minutes and for the most part it's one of the best of its type. The film has an ultra low-budget but that just adds tot he entertainment because it has to rely on its story, which is a pretty strong one and we also get some very strong performances. What works best is without question the story because driving someone crazy has always been a part of movies but the way it plays out here is pretty tense and makes for some very thrilling moments. The attempts at escape, the trying to convince people she's sane and so on just makes for some great entertainment. Foch clearly steals the film as the woman facing death and who must out smart her kidnappers. Foch has a certain quality that makes us care for her but at the same time she comes off very strong and this benefits her character a lot. Both Witty and Macready are perfect as well and they make for some very memorable villains. The evilness and coldness that both display while also appearing so calm and sweet was great fun to watch. Some people have called this a noir and perhaps there are elements of it but it would also serve well in the horror genre as there's an underlying creepiness built by the atmosphere. The Gothic settings are certainly a decade or so before they'd become popular and the mother/son relationship is being done long before PSYCHO. It's certainly a shame this movie isn't better known but perhaps that'll change in the next few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ross By Any Other Name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At sixty-five minutes this may well have provided a satisfactory 'B' picture element to a typical double bill risible though it seems today.There's a stunning opening shot of (what will turn out to be the heroine) walking away from camera in the pouring rain and had they been able to sustain that feel this may well have been one to reckon with. Alas, it loses credibility almost at once - certainly when viewed in 2010 - as Lewis crams in exposition and progression in double time so we learn that Julia Ross (Nine Foch) is broke, owes three weeks rent, has just lost a boyfriend to marriage (then, within thirty seconds learns that he couldn't go through with the wedding), sees an ad from a new employment agency in the newspapers, applies, is interviewed and hired for a live-in secretary post on the strength of the fact that she is single, no boyfriend, no parents, no friends or, to put it another way, no one is going to miss her when the new employers turn her lights out. It moves so quickly that at the time the audience wouldn't have had time to reflect on how ludicrous it was but the three leads, Foch, Dame May Witty and George MacReady are all up to snuff and seen today it makes a nice curio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Low Budget Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improbable, but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a nifty little suspense film...never mind that it is somewhat improbably (all the more so since there are holes in the plot)...it's still entertaining.It was a rather cheap B-picture, but that didn't keep one actress from shining through -- Dame May Witty as the mother who is protecting her adult son from being discovered as the murderer of his wife. To do so, they kidnap a young lady looking for a job (Nina Foch), and publicly treat her as having had a nervous breakdown, with the intent of murdering her and making it look like suicide so they can identify her body as the long-dead wife. Witty was always pretty interesting in films, and no less so here. Foch is a little less interesting, but does okay...sometimes it seems as if she is sleepwalking...but I don't mean that in terms of the plot. The son is played nastily by George Macready.It's a rather short film, just over and hour, so it moves along at a good pace, and it makes you want to forgive the the unevenness of the script. At least until the ending, which is about as bad as any I've ever seen in a film. Still, it's an interesting suspense film which could have done extremely well with a better director. I'll give it a "7" barely, although the ending made we want to drop it to a "6".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woman In Jep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Julia Ross, a young Nina Foch is the mostly rootless American in London who is hired by a nefarious mother and son, Dame May Witty and George Macready, as a secretary. On her first visit, she's drugged and awakens two days later in a stone mansion in Cornwall. Her clothes and ID have been destroyed and she's been given a new identity. She finds she is now Mrs. Marian Hughes, Macready's wife.She's kept from leaving, held prisoner, in fact, and soon learns that the Hughes plan to kill her and make it look like suicide because, in fact, Macready, a madman, has already stabbed his real wife to death and disposed of her body in the sea. This leaves something of a hole in the social fabric and they're going to plug it with Foch's fake suicide.It's a short movie. It really resembles one of the mystery radio dramas that were popular at the time of its release, with names like "The Whistler" and "Inner Sanctum." Nina Foch is a decent actress with pleasant, even features, but not a stunning beauty in the usual Hollywood tradition. She doesn't have the kind of face you want to fall into, but rather paint, or at least run your fingers over and tweak. George Macready, whatever his role, always comes across as more or less the same character -- a Prussian officer with a smooth voice and a face with a Schmiss from sabre fights in a Heidelberg gym. Dame May Witty is much better at likable roles instead of villainy. She was most enjoyable as the lady who vanished on Hitchcock's train. Oddly, I recall the day she died, 29 May, 1948, because I have a flashbulb memory of myself in childhood reading her obit on a sunny afternoon in the New York Daily News, and wondering who she was. Now that my brain is turning into tofu, I intend leaving it for analysis to the American Culinary Institute.The plot is pretty much by the numbers. It was remade, I think, in 1976 with Mary Steenburgen. The first time I was aware of a similar tale -- a young woman hired at an isolated estate and being passed off as someone else -- was in Conan-Doyle's "The Copper Beeches." A seasoned mystery writer could have knocked out this plot as fast as he could type. It was merely a matter of setting up the situation and then figuring out the many ways she could try convincing others that she was sane, not nuts, and how many ways she could try but fail at communicating clues to possibly helpful figures from outside her prison. I counted three important notes from her or from a friend -- notes that would have ended the mystery pronto -- that were intercepted and ripped up.Yet, withal, it's tautly written and enjoyable if you are looking for a diversion. Happily, it's only a bit more than one hour long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie a few years ago, and totally fell under its spell. The cast from the leads Nina Foch, Dame May Witty, George Macready down to such unforgettable character players as Anita Bolster, Queenie Leonard and Doris Lloyd are perfect. I think it is important to see a movie in the context of when it was filmed, rather than from a standpoint of the current day. Regarding the supposed "passivity" of the Foch character, even in today's world of "women's liberation," if one is constantly drugged, it would be difficult for anyone to be other than passive. As to the movie itself, I found it to be a very good "woman in distress" type of thriller and, on its own terms, succeeded immensely. FYI, this movie opened by itself at the Ambassador Theatre in NYC and although not considered a major movie, was on the Top Ten Movies List of 1945.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches.... people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear. Also, alas, an ending that comes out of nowhere, because, apparently, the auteur has lost interest in the movie, or perhaps because as a B picture it has to fit into a slot.</fullReview>
