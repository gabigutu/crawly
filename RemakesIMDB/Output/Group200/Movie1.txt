		<shortDescription>I never knew light could be so disturbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, when a director wants to set a dark mood, he or she relies on shadows and gloom in the camera frame. Here the exact opposite has been achieved through the perpetual midnight sun which throws the descent of Jonas Engstrom into madness all too clearly. At first the effect is subtle, but as the picture continues and there is never any nightfall one begins to feel the same bone-deep weariness and lethargy experienced by the protagonist. I watched it for the first time late at night and it completely threw me off my sleep cycle for the night. Most powerful.I speak neither Swedish nor Norwegian, but I didn't find the subtitles a hindrance at all--indeed, I much prefer subtitles to dubbing every time. I found that I had to work harder to notice everything that was happening on screen, which was a welcome change from the constant "eye candy" that seems to be the norm coming out of the movie business these days. All of the performances were understated yet brilliant, especially, of course, that of Stellan Skarsgard. I was particularly intrigued by the opening title sequence, showing the murder through the eyes of the murderer in a disjointed and confused sped-up manner, and this point of view is a foreshadowing of how both Engstrom and the viewer will feel by the end of the picture.I have not seen the remake yet, and I'm not sure that I want to do so. The Hollywood movie business never seems to know when to leave well enough alone. I'll be able to make a better recommendation when or if I get around to the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remake a good thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent psychological drama about a cooly repressed detective unable to own up to causing the accidental death of his partner, at the same time he is persuing an author suspected of killing his young girlfriend. The detective story isn't important here - the detective has no trouble locating the killer, understanding his motives, or "solving" the crime. What is interesting is the detective's inablility to deal with his problems and face life truthfully, metaphorically illustrated by his inability to block out the sunlight and sleep. Stellan Skarsgard gives a very good performance as the detective struggling to keep control of himself and the situation. As he becomes more and more tired, his life and his desires race out of control, and his need to maintain his facade causes him to make decisions that take him to the edge of catastropy.This film is understated in a way that the 2002 Al Pacino remake missed the boat on. It takes place in Norway, and the director resisted the temptation to show us a travelog of cute Norwegian villages. Most of the action takes place in non-descript rooms, suffused with the cold grey light of the arctic sun. The acting is understated and viewers are left to understand motivations without explicit explanation. The film is engrossing from beginning to end, and I'll never understand why Hollywood feels it needs to try to do better - it rarely can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating thriller with a brilliant performance from the woefully underrated Stellan Skarsgard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was REALLY impressed by 'Insomnia', the directorial debut from Norwegian Erik Skjoldbjaerg. If this movie is any indication of his talents he is one writer/director to watch! I have yet to see Christopher Nolan's Hollywood remake of this movie but I would be extremely surprised if it manages to equal it, let alone top it. (And I absolutely loved 'Memento') At first you think you're going to see something you've seen a hundred times, a mismatched "buddy" cop movie or your standard serial killer mystery, but the movie quickly enters unfamiliar territory and manages to subvert expectations. Apart from Stellan Skarsgard ('Breaking The Waves', 'Ronin') the cast was unknown to me, but they are all first rate, and I couldn't say there was a bad piece of acting throughout. But Skarsgard, a woefully underrated actor, steals the whole show with an utterly brilliant and compelling performance that shows a depth rarely seen by Hollywood actors, especially in thrillers. 'Insomnia' is a fantastic movie that I cannot fault. The less you know about it the better. Whatever you do, SEE this movie! Highly recommended, especially for those sick and tired at how most thrillers made these days are so predictable and formulaic. It doesn't have to be so, and 'Insomnia' proves it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller with a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 1997 film 'Insomnia' starring Stellan Skarsgard is a fine example of the rich films being offered by the foreign film market. Skarsgard plays Jonas Engstrom, a disgraced detective who, with his partner, travels to Norway to help a small town solve the murder of a 17-year-old girl. Due to the atmospheric conditions (there is 24 hour sunshine) and recent events, Engstrom is suffering from a severe bout of insomnia, which is causing problems with his work and psyche. Not having seen Christopher Nolan's remake, I didn't know what to expect from the story, so I was pleasantly surprised by the unconventional progression of the storyline and the various twists within the script. I have only seen Skarsgard in a couple of films, but he is always fantastic, as he is in this film as well. There are few actors who can keep a straight face, yet still manage to convey complex emotion, and Skarsgard is one of them. He walked through his scenes with a somberness that is reminiscent of most M. Knight Shymalan heroes; powerful, yet weary. Skjoldbjaergs's direction is absolutely beautiful. The colors are quite sharp, and most scenes are expertly framed ? most would make gorgeous still frames.I plan to see the remake of 'Insomnia' eventually, but whether you have seen it or not, I would recommend catching the film that inspired it. 7/10.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>moody phycological thriller with atmosphere to spare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to love going to the video store because there were always so many films I wanted to see, but as my tastes became more refined, my trips to the video store have become more difficult. It's not easy to find movies who's foundation are based on cinematography and atmosphere, but this movie is just that. This movie is slow and drawn out, and if you need lots of dialogue to keep you interested in a film, this one won't work for you. But if you like eerie scenes with quiet reserved characters and a sound track that is as slow and quiet as the pacing is, then this movie is will be perfect for you. The acting leaves nothing to be desired, the story is well written, the sound track is perfectly mood enhancing, the sets are breath taking, and the cinematography is immaculate. Slow, moody, harsh, and absolutely beautiful. One of the best films I've seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight as hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to believe that this is Erik Skjoldbjaerg's first film. It seems like a pro job to me. Very rarely do you get thrillers crafted this well. Almost everything is perfect. The script is as taut as possible. I saw no holes, anyhow. The plot is believable and you will never see the best twists coming. Even if you are the type who sits there and constantly guesses what's coming next during thrillers, I doubt you could. The film does a lot to avoid plot cliches. And if I'm wrong about that, if I was just blinded by other aspects of the film, it won't really matter. The characters are very well written. Especially the main character, played by Stellan Skarsgard. He is certainly one of the best actors working today and this may just be his greatest performance yet. He owns the film. The cinematography is effective. It's bleak and cold. The camera moves assuredly, and it's always where it should be. The music is perfectly subdued. The direction in general is simply amazing. The mise-en-scene is marvelous. I love the settings of the film, the threatening, rocky terrain, the broken and rusty buildings, everything. This is a must-see film. One of the best films of the 1990s. 10/10.P.S.: Christopher Nolan, the man who created the equally impressive thriller Memento, is set to direct the American remake of this film. I personally loved Memento (though I think I'd choose Insomnia over it if I had to), and I wish Mr. Nolan all the luck. I'm sure he knows what a challenge it's going to be. And I certainly pray that he isn't satisfied with simply copying the original. He could do so and mostly get away with it - Insomnia is quite underseen. I sincerely hope that he will make it his own. I already recognize one piece of the film that has to change if the setting is moved to the U.S.: Skjoldbjaerg brilliantly uses the midnight sun in this film. I doubt it would be successful if the setting were, say, Alaska. I don't think Americans would buy it. Nolan is going to have to compensate for the loss of the midnight sun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant, moody, a bit creepy. A noirish thriller. Stellan Skarsgard gives a wonderfully subtle performance in the lead role of a Swedish police detective suffering from sleep deprivation while on assignment in Norway. Stylistically the director and cinematographer effectively recreate the alienated and somewhat hallucinatory feeling of being sleep deprived and in a foreign country. There's more to the story of course, but to reveal those details would spoil the surprises. Be warned, if you like your movie heroes uncomplicated then stay away from "Insomnia".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This One Is Obsessively Awake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Sometimes you stumble upon a mini-film school by accident. The differences among the `Alien' films for instance is so profound one wonders if it is possible for the same person to actually watch them all. Same here with this and the Nolan/Pacino/Williams restructuring. This film is about externalities, about fate, about the oppressive capriciousness of nature. About how we are all alone and always try to outrun that fact. It has a coherent tone. Encounter, even murder, is a mere tick in the cog of the relentless timepiece.The American remake is about the power of an individual to write reality. This is all about internalities. Encounters are the prime movers in this world. All relationships matter. The Williams character writes himself, about himself, about Pacino's character, about the whole thing we see as incoherence, all of us under his spell. Here, there are decisions and consequences.It is a difference of day and well, night. Same script more or less, but two films that couldn't be more different. All of us make some sort of important decision along the lines of which of these worlds we inhabit.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller in the classic Scandinavian style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Insomnia is a criminal thriller shot in the classic Scandinavian style, a combination we're only seeing rather recently. When a teenaged girl turns up dead in a landfill, a homicide team is sent up from Oslo to back up the local police, who are ill-equipped to handle such a murder owing to its infrequency. Above the Arctic Circle, the lead detective is like a fish out of water - the 24-hour daylight drives him crazy and he is desperate to get out.The scenes have a cold, bare feel to them, like the shooting locations (Troms? and environs) and the protagonist/antagonist, Jonas Engstr?m (Stellan Skarsg?rd). Stark is a good word - but it is effective, and also beautiful. Bj?rn Floberg also turns in a solid performance as the prime suspect. I found Skarsg?rd's female foil (Gisken Armand) a bit cloying but that's not enough to bring the whole film down.Skarsg?rd's intensity is impressive and captivating, and the dynamic between his character and the others (he is Swedish, they are Norwegian) helps keep you interested. It's interesting to see how being a murder cop hardens a person - whether that person is Norwegian, Swedish, or American doesn't matter.I would definitely recommend this film. It's a powerful and beautiful work that deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original vs. Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the 2002 remake of "Insomnia" with Al Pacino when it came out. I found it to be an excellent thriller, not least because of the powerful performances from the actors (especially Robin Williams). But also because of the very unreal mood throughout the movie. Something correlating nicely with the story of Pacinos sleep-depraved cop on mission in Alaska, not coping with the around-the-clock sunlight very well.It was a lot more difficult getting to see the Norwegian original movie. But finally they showed it on TV so that i could record it. Comparing the two versions is unavoidable, deciding which one i prefer is a lot more difficult though. I can say however that watching the original has made my appreciation of the remake even higher. Christopher Nolan is an intelligent director and his remake is great proof of that. He has successfully captured the mood and essence of the story, keeping the most effective scenes from the original and adding other scenes that fit well into the story and help adapt it to the US instead of Norway.The acting in the original is generally good. I find Robin Williams performance as the killer hard to beat though. When it comes to the lead, Skarsg?rd is even more fit for the role of the haggard and worn-down policeman riddled with insomnia than Pacino. Skarsg?rd sometimes feels like the actor who gave the expression "haggard" a face.In the end i guess most people in the American audience, and also perhaps most other parts of the world, would prefer the remake of this movie. The pace is slightly higher in the remake, the style more modern and the actors of course more recognizable. This movie also feels a little less polished, but in my opinion it has just as much to offer. And if for no other reason, the original is worth watching because it highlights why the remake is such a feat. Recommended.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers within! Insomnia is a film that holds your attention, and part of the reason is the fine performance by Stellan Skarsgard. He has a 'below the surface' type of intensity that makes him fascinating to watch. The film does not make compromises to draw more viewers, like the hollywood remake with Al Pacino and Robin Williams. One example is the scene with the dog. The hollywood version, although basically the same film about murder and other intense human emotions, wimps out by not making the Pacino character kill the dog as the original does. Why? Also, Skarsgard's character is an unromantic womanizer which has lead to his current situation, but the hollywood version has the character embroiled in an internal affairs investigation. Why?It seems that hollywood versions of movies have to dumb down subject matter from the more challenging foreign films on which they're based, but is that what North American viewers really want? Maybe,...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does Hollywood re-make European films? Because they are so great. And this is no exception. I saw the Pacino version first then searched out this European original. Despite the bad press of the Pacino version, I did enjoy it very much.However, this version is darker, raw and allows the view to see and feel more. A must see for those who have seen the American take of this film. A must see for those who love well acted European cinema.I don't wish to recommend which version you should watch first, yes the story is known the second time around, but it is the character differences, how the films were made, and the use of dialogue (or not) that are important... surely.

		<fullReview>This isn't an easy movie to comprehend, it isn't something you sit down and watch like a regular saturday movie, it settles in, deep inside you, it doesn't have happy, perfectly moralistic characters which have per&lt;sonalities cleaner than a baby's bottom.A swedish police-inspector accidentally shoots a colleauge when chasing a criminal in the tundra of northern-Norway, and he blames the crime on the criminal he was chasing. The ongoing investigation and the terrible secret he has to keep, the mindjob this mess he has gotten himself into creates leaves him lying in bed unable to sleep. Another colleague finds out, and blackmails him.As the movie progresses, the situation builds and becomes more intense, and more surreal, the definitions of right and wrong slowly diminish as the noose tightens around the main characters neck.It's a tough nut to swallow, because it displays the weaknesses in morality of the human nature and how obscure this definition really is. Would you have done the same? If noone saw it? Could you live with that feeling of guilt for the rest of your life?This movie, which originally is Norwegian is being refilmed, in an american version which comes 2002, with Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank in the leading roles. I don't think this movie would be filmed with these fabolous actors, if it was crap. For those of you who thinks it sucks, watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the film recently on a letterboxed videotape and would highly recommend it. Watching it late at night, especially if you feel a bit tired yourself, is the perfect way to get into the spirit of things--it helps to identify with the main character, a Swedish police detective played by Stellan Skarsgard.Skarsgard's character is called in to consult on the investigation into the death of a murdered teenager in a small town in the far north of Norway, in the area above the Arctic Circle. It is constantly daylight during the summer, and the detective cannot get to sleep, no matter what he tries. This causes him to slowly burn out as he continues the investigation and contributes to the accidental shooting of a colleague, which he then attempts to cover up.This isn't a film for those accustomed to slam-bang action or a fast pace, but it was an excellent travelogue and very interesting slice of life in an area many Americans will not be familiar with.

		<fullReview>Swedish homicide investigator Jonas Engstrom (Stellan Skarsgard, star of laugh-a-minute Breaking The Waves) and his chirpy, flirtatious side-kick Erik Val (Sverre Anker Ousdal) trudge over to Northern Norway (the Land of the Midnight Sun) to help in the investigation of a murdered teenage girl. The supposed "perfectionist" killer has scrubbed clean the victim for evidence, including all her hair. However, laughing boy Jonas is on the case.Kicking-off with a jarred opening sequence that resembles the nightmarish start to David Fincher's Seven, Erik Skjoldbjaeg's feature debut makes a predictable whodunnit, but an all-together more unpredictable investigating cop. Certainly more Bad Lieutenant than Colombo.Suffering from serious sleep deprivation due to the endlessly light Norwegian days, Jonas vitally loses concentration whilst chasing the killer. In the fog he accidentally shoots and kills his mate Erik. Then, and this is what makes Skjoldbjaeg's Insomnia quite interesting, instead of owning up and doing the decent thing, Jonas conceals evidence pointing to him and even lands on the side of the murderer. From there on in the hunter and hunted become embroiled in a sort of dastardly pact.Suffering from acute guilt, Jonas becomes increasingly involved in a web of paranoia, deceit and cover-ups, and to top it all he still can't get a decent nap with all these shenanigans going on. You want to sleep for this man. Eventually, of course, he becomes truly psychotic and you sense he would most likely laugh in the face of Mel Gibson's 'twisted cop' in Lethal Weapon. Going steadily more bonkers, Jonas calls a pretty receptionist's kittens disgusting (very bad sign) before trying to rape her against a row of toilet rolls.Including a grotesque scene with a stray dog, Insomnia is not for squeamish and although it succeeds in keeping the viewer awake throughout there's something very rotten in the state of Norway. Ultimately a measured, compelling and really rather nasty film. Hitchcock might well have approved.Ben Walsh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insomnia: A Dazzling Spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently become fascinated by Hollywood's proclivity toward remaking any foreign language film which sees success, I've been comparing and contrasting original and remake of late. The Norwegian Insomnia was the latest film to get this treatment.Assigned to the investigation of a 17 year old girl's murder, Jonas Engström finds difficulty adjusting to the midnight sun of Troms?. When an unfortunate accident forces him to lie about his actions, he becomes haunted by both his guilt and the threatening musings of the girl's murderer, who knows the truth.Hand-held camcorder footage makes us accessories after the fact as the opening credits roll, thrusting us instantly into the middle of the apparent "whodunnit?". The opening exposition is minimal, giving us little more than a disgraced policeman and his next case. Things seem set for an interesting mystery thriller until the aforementioned early accident occurs, knocking our expectations aside and nosediving into entirely different territory altogether. This turn shows us instantly the facets of Skjoldbj?rg's film: its evident intention to ignore convention; its attitude of moral ambiguity; its layered and fascinating main character. Stellan Skarsg?rd plays his part supremely, lending a deeply convincing air of melancholy to a character that might in other hands have invited more animosity than sympathy. Engström's inherent guilt is manifested almost as well by the performance as the wonderful extended metaphor of the invasive light. He is a paragon of stoicism, his real emotions left to be conveyed by his desperate attempts to keep the sun from his room. The plot refrains from giving us one case breaking twist after another, preferring rather to focus on the eponymous insomnia, the emotions it represents, and their effect upon the mind of their victim. The suggestions of a sexual sadism and perverse character intentions fuel the film's approach to the much discussed good guy/bad guy synonymity issue, an interesting side-dish well supported by the interactions of Skarsg?rd and Bj?rn Floberg. By the conclusion, Insomnia has given much more than promised, leaving us with an impeccable ending to a complex character study.Surprising in its direction, Insomnia delves into the psyche of an emotionally battered man, inviting us to sympathise with or scorn him as we see fit. The contrasting darkness of its themes meshes with the brightness of its imagery to give us a dazzling spectacle, and a memorable one too.</fullReview>

The film is very good. None of the characters in the film are flat, all are well acted and the story is believable. The setting is in the north of Norway and the dynamic - and partial language barrier - between Jonas and the locals is an interesting detail in the story. Also, the setting echos the loneliness we understand to be felt by Jonas. And the metaphor of the unforgiving, all-seeing, never-resting midnight sun...I am now curious to see the American remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this original version better than the US remake with Al Pacino. The Al Pacino version had more "stuff" in it (the investigations in LA, the infatuation between Pacino and Hillary Swank, Robin William's kidnap of Hillary Swank, etc. etc. etc. It deterred from the main message. Here there was a clear parallel between Jonas and Jon Holt. They both had committed an "accidental" murder. The "good guy" and "bad guy" were one and the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INSOMNIA (1997, Norway) is a really good murder mystery. The fact that it's set in Norway only adds to the movie, for most Americans watching this, Norway is far away, exotic, and mysterious.

		<fullReview>Insomnia is quite an achievement for a first time feature director. The photography is very good and the FEEL of the picture is top notch. Not a mystery with a gimmick ending, Insomnia instead is a moody, almost creepy portrait of a detective who's meager morality nearly rivals his prey. Skarsgard is brilliant, he is quite a presence on screen in contrast the small roles he has been limited to in Hollywood. While the Pacino remake is a good movie, the original is a darker, braver film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This particular film isn't the kind of thing you can sell to an American audience (typically), and that's assuming it were to be in English, which it isn't (dialogue is Norwegian and Swedish).The film really relies on the protagonist, Stellan Skarsg?rd, to work. He's such a boyish, innocent looking individual, it adds to the shock of what we really learn about the character as the film moves on. This guy doesn't get equal Norway/US work for nothing.Great dark, moody little film, with the antagonist Jim Holt really being the least effectual character in the story. It's really a character study of Skarsg?rd's Jonas Engström, a character we watch learn about the darkest parts of the soul -- parts the rest of us won't even acknowledge.I'll admit there's something missing here, and though I can't put my finger on it, the mood achieved here overcomes any technical flaws I might feel the need to nitpick. 9/10, well worth a look if you're into darker, psychological tales.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of a few good Norwegian movies ever made. And it's a non-typical one as well, there's no cheesy dialog, no theater-acting and no-overly beautiful scenery.The director, Erik Skjoldb?rg, has managed to make an interesting movie, he have gotten the actors to play real, and not as if they were in a theater play, which often happens in Norway, and ruins almost all movies. It all feels real, and that makes the hole movie more suspenseful and frighening. The cinematography is one of the best I've seen from Norway, and it doesn't use the nature as most movies does, it uses the actors.Stellan Skarsg?rd makes a masterful preformance, and keeps suprising throughout, as the midnight sun tears on his character you can truly see it in his eyes. And the rest of the cast is superb.This is one of the absolute best live action feature movies from Norway, together with "Orions Belt" (1985) and "Nine Lives" (1959, Oscar Nominated). The best film from Norway is "Fl?tklypa Grand Prix" (1975) and it's a puppet movie, that says the most of the Norwegian movie industry.10 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from perfect, but worth your time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I'm probably slightly biased. This film was shot in my hometown, by a director from said town. Obviously it added to my enjoyment that I was able to recognize several locations and so on.However, I think this is a fairly objective review. To give a quick summary of the plot; a Swedish detective, Jonas Engström (Skarsg?rd), is sent to Northern Norway to investigate a murder. While chasing a suspect he accidentally kills a fellow officer. Instead of admitting his guilt, he blames the suspect they were chasing. However, the suspect knows what really happened...The story is far from perfect, and some dialogue seems odd (although English speakers probably won't notice a lot of it, since it often has to do with the characters' dialect). Engström behaves strangely at times, but that's meant to be a result of a combination of insomnia (because of the midnight sun up north during summer) and guilt, and if you don't realize that while watching, you should probably be watching Teletubbies instead...There's some bad acting, especially from some of the minor characters, but Skarsg?rd does an excellent job. The colors in the film are very "colorless", an effect I think is somewhat exaggerated, unfortunately. What can be a bit strange if you live in Troms?, is that the Troms? of the film never really feels like the Troms? you know, but that is perhaps unavoidable... All in all, however, "Insomnia" is a good film and will probably seem a bit exotic to many non-Norwegian viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Insomnia" is a must see film!! This film was excellent in story and script. It would have been a Hitchcock if made in America during his time. I read some comments about it looking cheap but i don't think they exactly have a "Titanic" budget to work with in this film. The idea of the lead detective having to lower himself to the murderer's level because of an accident that would ruin his "outstanding" career is great filmmaking. If I were to make a guess about the scriptwriter of this film, I would say he or she is probably a detective novelist or that this was based on some true story because its just so "real." Don't read the following line if you haven't seen the film!!The only reason it gets any criticism at all is that he gets away with it in the end(crime shouldn't pay) but i believe he will be worse off this way, as he is haunted by it every night, ie., the reason he is sleepless and of course the reason the movie is named "Insomnia". Plus He knows that the fellow detective on the case knows the truth at the end!!So in my mind I see him dying by his own hand and by that gun in the near future after the end of the film.(what we don't see)This is a must see movie!! Especially if you are a reader of detective novels.</fullReview>

But the dialogue is not the core of this story - it is the unspoken that weighs heavy on the viewer. I liked the "visions" and thought that many of the scenes where blocked quite well. I had few expectations about the quality of this film and was therefor not disappointed by much. (I think if one goes into every film expecting to be blown away you will always be disappointed.)

His decision to cover up his own involvement will lead him to a personal implosion of sorts.Stark, raw, Insomnia is challenging as a visceral experience.I enjoyed it and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not to be confused with the America version with Al Pacino and Robin Williams. An atmospheric and intelligent thriller set in the Norsk "midnight sun" area. Basiclly its the story of a police detective sent there to investigate a murder, and the way he fouls up and tries to cover up his mistake. A local writer has the goods on him, but will he turn him over to the authorities? Film will leave you guessing until the end. This is an interesting concept of having a Film Noir taking place in a land where the sun never sets. The sun permiates everything and we can feel the effects of the insomnia on the characters involved. The ending is somewhat pat, but in the light {if the pun can be used} of the events leading up to it, it can be overlooked. The American version is similar to an extent, but changes the end somewhat. See this one. It is the better of the two. If you are a fan of detective stories and Noir, you just cant lose. Great serious and intelligent fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think it's completely fair to evaluate a film by comparing two takes on the same material, but it was inevitable with this foreign original, directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. I had already seen Christopher Nolan's Americanized version of INSOMNIA and so I wanted to check out the differences. I may be in the minority here, but all this version did was make me appreciate the Al Pacino film more than I used to. I don't think Stellan Skarsgard was as effective in the part of a haggard detective undergoing a chronic lack of sleep and being forced into cooperating with a known killer. The setting here (Norway) was not nearly as picturesque as the Alaskan surroundings of the 2002 film. Truth be told, had I not already been familiar with everything going on in the story from the Nolan film, I think I would have missed a lot of details in this one. It would be interesting to know what I might have thought of this if I had caught it cold, without a comparison to the remake, but that's not a reality for me. But here's another example for me where a remake can sometimes deflate an original's power. Whether I'd even go so far to call a recent American rendition of a recent foreign movie a bona fide "remake" is debatable, though. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A web of his own making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has to be appreciated that Detective Jonas Engstrom is from Sweden and not accustomed to the land of the midnight sun of northern Norway, and that the sunlight streaming through his hotel room giving him insomnia is relentlessly there twenty-four hours a day. Thus his judgment is flawed, and when in a fog (literally) he accidentally shots his partner and close friend, his decision to cover it up rather than face the difficulties of owning up is understandable. What follows is a demonstration of the truth of the adage 'Oh, what a tangle web we weave when first we practice to deceive' (from Sir Walter Scott).What is superior about this somewhat familiar plot is both the resolution and the atmosphere. Although this is a realistic cop drama several light years beyond standard US TV faire, and comparable to the best Hollywood efforts, and features a gifted and accomplished actor in the lead role (Stellan Skargard, whom I last saw in the very disturbing Breaking the Waves (1996)), it is not completely realized. We are troubled by the decisions that Engstrom makes, particularly in framing an innocent young man, to say nothing of his shooting the dog; and while we understand how he became caught in this trap of his own making, we feel there must be something more than the midnight sun to account for his disintegration. His aborted affair with the hotel clerk Ane (Maria Bonnevie) contributed to the general sense that he was falling apart cognitively and emotionally. But why?Nonetheless this is a smooth, compelling drama, well crafted by director Erik Skjoldbjaerg, whose talent is obvious. I am looking forward to his next film, the intriguingly titled, Prozac Nation (2000). Gisken Armand as the overseeing detective (and Engstrom's conscience) attracted my eyes as I watched her watching Engstrom. She does a good job in a subtle role. Bjorn Floberg as the writer who occasions the story is sufficiently slimy to arouse our profound distaste and to make us wish that Engstrom would add murder to his other crimes... But does he?(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has Oslo detectives Jonas Engström and Erik Vik dispatched to a Norwegian city (above the arctic circle) to help solve the brutal murder of a young woman. Engström and Vik are tasked to work with Ane, a local detective.Engström's character is fleshed out more thoroughly than in a typical police procedural. The story is presented in a manner to keep your attention--in fact it requires close attention. However, it is the study of Engström's personality that I found most interesting. Significant insights are given into the qualities that drive him: guilt, sexual repression, ego, and anxiety. In pursuit of the murderer in a heavy fog, Engström shoots and kills Vik. Was this an accidental shooting? It is hinted that Engström might have known who he was shooting (a flashback shows that he had enough time to recognize Vik). In any case, for reasons of guilt or ego Engström tries to cover up his action by claiming it was the murderer who killed Vik. Complications ensue when Ane starts to smell a fish when investigating Engström's story of the shooting. I liked the concept of the investigator being investigated. In several revealing scenes we get clues to Engström's repressed sexuality. There is a scene in a car where he makes an advance on a suspect's girlfriend and a scene where he makes a move on the hotel clerk and is rebuffed. More telling is a scene where he is hidden behind a door while a suspect and a woman go at it close by. In this scene we see that Engström is turned on while trying not to be. The music in that scene makes for an intense experience.I thought all of the actors were well cast and the restrained performances added to a sense of reality. I had seen the 2002 remake of this before having seen this version. In reading through several of the reviews of the 2002 version I saw that many people commented that this original version was better. Having liked the 2002 version made me want to see this. I agree that this version is better, but not dramatically so. The 2002 version is not a direct remake, but is different enough to be a separate movie. It is interesting to see how the same material can be tweaked to create a different experience. For example, in the 2002 version the relationship between the local detective and the main character is given more emphasis. This version is more subdued and hangs together better--there are no superfluous action scenes. One great advantage this version has is that it does not have the ridiculous shoot-'em-up ending. One of the final scenes that has Ane placing a bullet casing on a table is a testament to the tight presentation. That single act says as much as what it might have taken several scenes to accomplish.</fullReview>

Besides that, this is a very strange and enjoyable experience. The plot is oddly confusing and predictable at the same time. I have never seen anything quite like it. A lot of lines are strangely repeated by different characters; "What are you going to do, arrest me for smoking?" "Ketchup maybe. Was he eating a hot dog?" "She dressed like me, tried to look like me, it scared me." "You have no evidence I killed Kay. You only know because I told you what I saw." "Wild Card!" Just when the police think they have found a clue that breaks the case, the suspect easily explains it away. Odd. Different. Very entertaining. One disappointment; did they "doctor" the most famous scene in the movie? I'll never forget the leg crossing when I saw it in the theater, but it just doesn't look the same on DVD; I don't really see anything. Or is my mind remembering more than I really saw?

		<shortDescription>Best Norwegian film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the breakthrough movie of Erik Skjoldbj?rg, now a Hollywood director, and it's well deserved. Now it's also the subject of the Christopher Nolan remake starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams. But the original is as suspensful and intelligent as anything coming out of Hollywood these days. It creates the unique feel of the midnight sun in Skjoldbj?rgs native Troms?, and you can almost feel the insomnia yourself by a brilliant performance by Swedish international star Stellan Skarsg?rd ("The Hunt For Red October", "Good Will Hunting", "Ronin").9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this last night in cable, I will see the Al Pacino remake early in the next week, If it is half as good as this it will be great, This is a tight 98 minute supsence drama that relies on characters relating to the situation on hand &amp; not on special effects &amp; other gimmickry.This film takes place in upper Norway in summer time, the Day is 23hrs long, &amp; we see the weary toll it takes of our hero, superbly acted by Stellen Skasgard. In fact the entire small cast is superb, the settings are barren &amp; a few spots very exciting. A must see for those who will see the Pacino, Williams film rating ***1/2 91 points/100 IMBD rating 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Insomnia is a great film. So great in fact, that the thought of Christopher Nolan making his own version of it kind of frightens me. Nolan has the potential to be one of the most innovative directors of our time, so why does he want to touch such a beautiful film. Insomnia is brilliantly photographed film. One shot in particular of Stellan Skarsg?rd might has well have been an oil painting. The entire film is shot with a never ending color scheme that sets a mood without any words having to be spoken (or subtitles written for that matter). Skaesg?rd (who will be known his whole life as "that guy from Good Will Hunting") shows his superb acting skills in the role of a sexually confused insomniac detective who accidentally kills his partner while chasing after a rapist/murderer. Insomnia is a great "suspense" film that makes such forgetable films as "Se7en" or "Ransom" question their own, not-so humble existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and brilliant psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Insomnia is a terrific thriller. Like all the great thrillers, it isn't just about suspense and surprise, it's also about the personalities and motivations of the characters. Stellan Skarsgard gives an amazing performance as Engstrom, the cold, egotistical Swedish big-city cop sent to a small town in Norway to investigate a young girl's murder. Already an outsider, he does nothing to endear himself to the local police who hope he will live up to his brilliant reputation and crack the case. Plagued by insomnia which he blames on the constant daylight of the far north in summer, he begins the investigation and gets an early break which suddenly turns very bad and forces him to confront some uncomfortable personal choices.As the film progresses, we realize that his insomnia has little to with arctic twilight and everything to do with his own internal demons. As a man who prides himself on controlling his emotions, he is paralyzed by impulses that burst forth and point to something dark and hidden in his character. As the investigation progresses he slides deeper into a situation that spins out of his control, until he can only react to events in a desperate attempt to regain control of the investigation and of himself. Sleeping would help but as the title suggests, it continues to elude him. Considering this was the first major film by the director, Erik Skjoldbj?rg, makes it only more impressive. Not only did he co-write the complex script but he also directed it with the sure hand of a pro. He quickly establishes the perfect surreal mood and never rushes the rhythms of the story. Everything in Insomnia plays out at a nearly perfect pace. The camerawork is superior, and the acting is uniformly good. The only part of this film I can't address is the dialogue, since it was subtitled from Swedish and Norwegian. I read reviews from citizens of those countries who found fault with it, so who's to say? But as far as I'm concerned every other aspect of this film is tremendous. Soon to be remade by the talented Christopher Nolan, one hopes he will break with tradition and do some Hollywood justice to the European original. If he does he's got a surefire winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One question...why a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly remarkable and enjoyable film in my opinion. Well directed, written, and acted. When I first heard that it was going to be remade I could not understand why. This was also my first reaction when hearing that 'Abre Los Ojos' was being remade (i.e., 'Vanilla Sky'). The irony turned out to be that while viewing 'Insomnia' for the first time, I commented that it reminded me of a Chris Nolan film. Being a huge fan of Nolan's other work ('Following'; 'Memento'), I am now actually looking forward to his artistic take on what is already a fantastic film...Hope it is better than Crowe's remake of 'Abre Los Ojos'....10/10.</fullReview>

"Insomnia" is a film noir, and hence, Americans won't exactly love it...in addition, it monopolizes on discrete subtleties that add to its richness... in its European way, it is a well made film, and essentially the best foreign psycho thriller I've ever seen, surpassing even Polanski's drama/psycho thriller "White," the 2nd of the Tricolor Trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This excellent film isn't the typical who-dunnit that you can watch while catching up on work for the office. It isn't going to appeal to anyone not willing to work at following the narrator through some rather difficult personal troubles. The detective is closer to a Film Noir detective than a typical policeman. He is not what he seems. But he lacks the pithy sense of humour and reveals depth and evil that most Noir protagonists can't touch. This is a very well written, well directed, and, at times, deeply disturbing narrative. The mise en scene is carefully matched but may seem off to those raised on Hollywood simplicity. The portrait of the protagonist adds to other excellent studies of the effects of prolonged pursuit of serial killers/murders. Also, the transfer and music rank among the best efforts on DVD. Though you don't get much in the way of extras the Criterion version is worth every extra penny. (The film also portrays the collateral effects of stress and sleep deprivation as the protagonist falls deeper and deeper into his personal abyss.) Not a fun Saturday night but a brilliant film. The more you bring to it the better.</fullReview>

From an American perspective the film's perspective was something unusual and extremely refreshing from the typical foreign films and the Norwegian language is certainly one of the most intriguing languages to listen to being spoken.

		<shortDescription>Oh, he did a bad, bad thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Insomnia reminded me of the Keitel-cult classic - of the same insightful creation - continued to impress upon my mind. I speak of the lewd film, Bad Lieutenant (of which I was not overly fond of) where a corrupt cop solves the mystery of an unspeakable crime. Insomnia oddly follows the same vein, but in more of an inconspicuous nature. Instead of pushing the despicable nature of the main character ? in this case it is Engström ? our fearless and simple director gives it to us very under the radar. Pealing back each layer with delicacy, Skjoldbj?rg gives us a crime, followed by a random act of innocence, followed by a small cover-up, followed up with a never-ending stream of light, which is all surrounded by the fear of the unknown and the endless possibilities that the world that has been created around us can instantly be crumbling down upon everyone involved. I enjoyed this film so much because of this small, insatiable sensation that Skjoldbj?rg instantly created with his slow moving camera, his deadpan scenes filled with Norwegian chills, and that light ? the unending light that haunts Skarsg?rd's flawless portrayal of Engström. Also, the technique of light was used under the guise of night impressed me. In most Hollywood chillers of this nature, you see night being the time when our heroes confront their fears or moral dilemmas ? not here, the light brings out the inner-soul of our character and gives us a choice whether to like him or not. Notice the character that Engström most connects with in this film ? Vik's killer. Both claim to be innocent victims of accidents, but while they search each other out, they have trouble leaving each other's side. You didn't see this connection as much in the remake, mainly because mainstream Hollywood always has to have a defined "bad guy". Skjoldbj?rg gave us a soul to the unknown.Norway is filled with simple people constantly dealing with deadly issues that we take as normal day-to-day living. I loved that big city police officers were brought in to handle a murder case that obviously could not be handled by the simpleton local officers ? yet, in the end; Skjoldbj?rg poses yet another question to us about who really was more knowledgeable. There is a constant struggle going on during this film that makes us, the viewer, question the entire motive at hand. We want Engström to find the girl's killer, but also we want him to come clean about himself ? a question we ask every heroine in a film struggling to come clean and overcome obstacles. Yet, with Insomnia, we know nothing about Engström to even ask this question. It comes as a half-hearted request because he was not innocent to begin with. Skarsg?rd plays this man with suspicion and question because we are given no diagram of how this man arrived to this one location. We hear whispers in the non-existent shadows, but nothing that fully develops his past. He plays with our perception of "good cop/bad cop" like in no other movie. There are scenes that make us cheer for him, while others (like the stint with the hotel receptionist) that make us cover our eyes and quiver our lips. Like no other, Skarsg?rd develops, matriculates, and dedicates his time to this character, ensuring that every bold step that he makes is done for a reason. A complete reversal from what we saw him doing in Breaking the Waves or Good Will Hunting, here we see him complex and dedicated to the character at hand, continually proving that Skarsg?rd is a force in the Hollywood community (i.e. see the final scene and those non-replaceable eyes).Insomnia is a film that stands directly on its own two feet without instability. While it is not quite at the level of utmost perfection (even though there are quite a bit of perfect elements) due to some slower key elements, the awkward pacing of the grand finale, and the jumbled themes of lies and deceit (especially between Engström and the actual killer) ? it is still a very grandiose film. It keeps your attention, it brings about the ideas that demons do not just reside in the dark corners of your mind, but in fact in your everyday lives. I think the best moments of this film occur when Engström fights with his partner after the accident in the lighted bedroom of the hotel. I enjoyed this the most because it gave us a rare opportunity to see a different character than what was originally presented to us. It violently gave us a slice of the good during times when we didn't think it was humanly possible. This may sound strange, but I also enjoyed the Norwegian accents (albeit a Norwegian film) because they added this sense of absurdity to it all. It took us to another place; where the oddity of forever sunlight was drown out by the sounds coming out of our characters mouths. I am not complaining or thinking this to be strange, I just thought that it added to the overall tone of the film, giving us a chance to step away from mainstream Hollywood.Overall, I would highly suggest this film. I am a believer that if you see the Nolan remake first, you will not like this film at all. The two are not the same, and to compare the two (in the big picture) would be heresy. I loved the acting, I loved the location, and I thought the plot was detailed, yet simple, symbolic yet original all at the same time. This wasn't a story convoluted by deep sub-plots and overblown romances, this was a stiff drink on a cold day. It was the perfect balance between good and evil caught in a place where you cannot hide in the shadows. I thought it was another great addition to the Criterion library.Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As is always the case when American producers decide to remake a relatively unknown foreign film, there are a lot of people that say this Norwegian film is better than the American one. In actual fact, there's not a lot in it; but this film deserves more credit for having the original idea, and it has to be said that the idea is a good one as this film carries off it's central theme and plot in style, and the two blend excellently to create a compelling and intriguing psychological portrait of both a criminal and the effects of not getting enough sleep. The film carries off an excellent reversal in the common psychological theme, in that this time; it's the daylight that causes all the horrors. Insomnia takes place in Norway where, for one half of the year it's light and the other half it's dark. It's currently light, and detective Jonas Engström has been assigned to a case involving a murdered girl. The plot thickens when the detective accidentally shoots his partner whilst chasing the killer, and then proceeds to cover up the murder he has committed while the search for the girl's murderer continues.The American remake adheres to the plot of the original rather closely, and that's a shame for someone like me who has seen the remake as I always knew what was going to happen next. But even so, while the plot didn't contain any surprises for me; watching the detective's descent into insanity owing to his insomnia makes for a great watch, and the as the plotting is expertly handled by director Erik Skjoldbj?rg, watching it play out is always a pleasure. Stellan Skarsg?rd takes the lead role, and while he may not have the star power of Al Pacino, he manages to deliver a darker and all the more believable performance as the put-upon policeman at the centre of the tale. In fact, all the ensemble cast comes together well and the film feels very much like an A-class production at all times. Insomnia features a number of memorable scenes that help to ensure that the audience will remember it beyond just its central ideas; and overall, it's clear that the writing team have succeeded in making a film that transcends its cat and mouse formula.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I disagree with the above comments-it's a psychological/crime drama that kept me riveted. This is the "Insomnia" screenplay that was adapted for the new Al Pacino "Insomnia". This film is especially intriguing and disorienting for non-Scandinavian viewers because it takes place in rural Norway (subtitled)and is set in a cultural and physical landscape that is very foreign to everyone else and adds to the strangeness of the story. It's a good, psychologically creepy story and builds up the tension and I would recommend anyone who goes to see the Pacino one (and likes it at all) to try to see this one. Basically, it's about two Swedish (I think) detectives who come to Norway to assist in a murder investigation, things go very wrong right away, and one of the detectives starts to go a little nuts and can't sleep (hence the title), and the plot then begins to twist in on itself. Lots of paranoia in the film and they way it's shot makes the viewer sense the paranoia as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another terse Scandinavian thriller, coldly lit and artlessly directed. It's the sort of thing we British do rather well on television - it plays like a Nordic Inspector Morse (Inspector Norse perhaps?), as Skansgard plays the role of the strong silent cop from Stockholm, out of his depth in a smaller community. The glaring absence of any sort of plot makes this a real chore to sit through though. Really, I'd be fascinated to see more films of Scandinavia, but most of the ones that have been released over here recently come across as amateurish and rather pointless (Love Lessons and Nightwatch spring to mind). Obviously lack of funds is a problem, but how about some inventiveness rather than these half-hearted strivings at cinema. The whole exercise just seems redundant. Credit where it's due though - the opening murder scene was pretty well handled, though I'm not sure about its relevance to the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great genre movie, even when you have already seen the even more superior remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Christopher Nolan remake of "Insomnia" surprisingly enough isn't well liked by everybody but generally speaking it is being regarded as one of the best crime-thrillers of recent years. I wonder how many people actually know it's a remake of this Norwegian movie, that was released 5 years earlier. Just like most people, I saw the remake before the original.And the the invertible question which on is the better movie; the original or its remake. In this case I really have to say Christopher Nolan's. It does a better job at capturing the atmosphere and the sense of insomnia, that the main character is suffering from. And no matter how great Stellan Skarsg?rd is, he of course ain't no Al Pacino! Biggest or most significant difference between the two movie is, is that the remake is a longer movie and for some good reasons. It takes its time with its buildup, which enhances the movie its tension and mystery.But it's of course not fair and perhaps even a bit silly to compare this movie to the remake because it of course got released first and is the original movie, which the superior 2002 got based on. And you could say it's pretty much a scene by scene remake, with only a few additions put into it. But I'll just judge this movie for what it is and pretend like I have never seen the remake.When doing so, you'll have to say that "Insomnia" is one original movie within its genre. It starts off like any other typical genre movie, in which a policeman is flown in to solve a murder case. The story however soon starts to take some twists and it starts to become apparent that this is not going to be an ordinary case, in which the main character is the perfect, righteous hero, who'll solve the case cleanly.The story is definitely the movie its biggest strength. It lets the movie distinct itself from anything else and its were all of the movie its surprises are coming from.But what also helps are its cold, depressing, looking settings, in rural Norway, that set the entire mood and atmosphere for the movie. It adds to the whole mystery of the movie as well, though it isn't really the mystery or the murder that plays the most significant part in the movie. It more relies on its other dramatic developments and its characters, which all makes the movie a surprising and tense one at times.In the end it doesn't really matter whether you have already seen the original or not and it also doesn't really matter that I consider the remake superior to this original. The movie simply remains a more than great and original watch within its genre.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonas Engstrom is not enjoying his business trip to northern Norway. Several problems plague him, he can't sleep because of the 24 hour daylight, the murderer he was brought into apprehend is steeped in police procedure (damn you CSI!) and he accidentally shot his partner and good friend and left him to die on a foggy, barren ice field. That last thing really put a damper on the trip. To really enjoy the film, you have to keep in mind Engstrom is a remarkably smart detective and ignore the fact that had he just requested to move to a hotel room without a window and been upfront about the accidental shooting (which even the murderer points out to him) everything would have worked out fine. The film feels like it gives you a lot longer than its 96 minute run time to practice your suspension of disbelief skills yet somehow after the last cheesy special effect that ends the movie you feel like you watched an episode of a British detective procedural rather than a theatrical release.</fullReview>

During a chase of the suspect, Skarsgard accidently kills his partner. Rather than do the logical thing and admit it, he covers up the crime and blames the suspect. Now, he has to solve a murder, and keep his secret, all the while not being able to get a wink of sleep during the sunny nights.Skarsgard is very greasy, yet subtle (no one is more laid back).

		<fullReview>While the concept had potential - brought out in the superior Hollywood remake - the unfocused storyline and stoic acting made me doze off briefly while watching this film. This does not happen to me often, and when it does it's a sure sign that my mind has wandered.Nolan's remake is more suspenseful, features more effective performances (especially by Robin Williams), and a better sense of the relentlessness of the midnight sun. The original's jump-cut-as-lacuna editing may have been fresh for 1997, but movies like Fight Club and Memento have since greatly refined the screen representation of lapses of consciousness, and this review is being written in 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Great But Better than the Cheap American Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a straight film that seems to be hidden in dilluted colors and although it is much improved over the American version, there is still something lacking which makes it a great film. It deals with a detective who is possessed not so much as by guilt, but an inability to come to grips with his existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comment that comes up first in the user comments section by "Methi" should be ignored as it completely baseless. Others have here at some length extolled the virtues of the original. I will simply add my opinion that it is far superior to the 2002 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absorbing film that never lets the viewer down, INSOMNIA remains faithful to its premise from frame first to last. There's not a single aspect of this film to be found lacking. I'd seen it a couple of years ago, but it wasn't until I just recently revisited it that I felt compelled to comment on it- to put in my two cent's worth, as it may be. In its uncompromising scrutiny, it's as fascinating a "search for truth" as THE INTERVIEW (another compelling film I highly recommend). I never saw- nor intend to see- the "American version." I've seen far too many unnecessary American remakes of good foreign films to care about seeing one more. (THE VANISHING was an excellent, suspenseful foreign film; the American "re-imagining" was laugh-out-loud ridiculous. Jeff Bridges happens to be one of my all-time favorite actors, but the otherworldly "accent" he so badly mangles in the remake makes him look like a fool.) (And, speaking of fools doing remakes, give Knob Zombie's un-imagining of John Carpenter's classic HALLOWEEN a pass: Let's just call it SHALLOWEEN and put the legend to rest once and for all.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story but boring film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story itself is interesting. A police has to make a deal with a murderer because they both have some secrets inside of them. However, the film itself is quite boring. The pace is a bit too slow. The silences are too long. Overall, The film is watchable but don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hazardous to call a work of fiction "contrived." (Of course it's contrived! It's a movie!) Yet this celebrated film is hollow at its core: Stellan Skarsgard is a flabby, soulless actor. If only the lead had been played by the splendid Sverre Anker Ousdal (stupidly killed off early in the film), it would have been worth the trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two Swedish policemen, one of them Stellan Skarsgard, arrive in northern Norway to help solve the murder of a high-school girl. The killer is almost trapped but escapes into the fog along the shore. By mistake, Skarsgard shoots and kills his partner. He invents a story in which the girl's murderer shot his partner. Later he's invited by the girl's killer to meet at an isolated place. The two agree to pin the murder on the dead girl's boyfriend, an obnoxious kid anyway. But Skarsgard, plagued by his conscience and the midnight sun, has been unable to sleep and makes an attempt to capture the killer. The killer clobbers Skarsgard and then accidentally falls to his death. A Norwegian policewoman has figured out roughly what went on but contemptuously allows Skarsgard to go back home where, it is fondly hoped, he'll be able to sleep again, although we are left with grave doubts about that. The final freeze frame is of Skarsgard's face and everything fades to black except for his eyes, which are wide open and glow in the dark like an uneasy animal's.Stellan Skarsgard is just about perfect for the role of the insomniac cop. He always looks half asleep anyway. He slouches around, placid, bookish, as if his mind were elsewhere, maybe in wonderland. You can't ruffle him. When the murderer shoots off his shotgun into the plaster ceiling over his shoulder, Skarsgard simply moves his head to the side with an expression of mild distaste. I show more animation when the dentist says, "Turn this way a little." It's a slow film though, a story of intrigue and character, rather than a who-dunnit with a lot of ancillary action. What I mean is that it's quite different from the American remake that starred Al Pacino. Pacino is equally good at projecting exhaustion but in a very different way.The logic in this film isn't as clear as that in the remake. Here, Skarsgard can have absolutely no motive for shooting his partner of more than a year. In the remake, Pacino's partner was about to squeal on him for some irregularities to Internal Affairs. And here, all it takes is a single phone call for Skarsgard to agree to meet the killer. Pacino had to listen to Robin Williams sympathize with him about his insomnia. And Pacino's hallucinations were far more vivid -- a massive truck bearing down on him in his lane -- while Skarsgard's are more subtle -- a glimpse of his dead partner's face staring through a window. The remake is palpably "American". It ends with a shoot out that Williams' heavy has never shown himself capable of. Shotguns and pistols bark. Seaside fishing shacks are blown to smithereens. So is Williams, while Pacino dies after a few parting words. The European original ends with a dying fall and an ambiguous hint of things to come. (Those glowing eyes.) Neither film is a masterpiece. They both fit nicely into the generic frame of the guilty cop movie. And in some ways I prefer the remake. It's pace is faster and the characters' motivations are explored in greater depth, and finally it makes more sense. But that stupid final shoot out works against it and it is, after all, not the original, so it gets no bonus points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incriminating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so eager to see this film, I remember I was actually desperate to see this. All I could do was read comments on this film. I remember one of those comments was that "Insomnia" was as good as "Silence of the Lambs" and "Seven". Well....When I finally saw "Insomnia", I was so disappointed. The acting was lame, dialogue was cheap, and the qualities that create suspense just weren't there. I tried to like this film, unfortunately it failed. On the bright side, if you suffer from insomnia, see this film by all means. Its the perfect cure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You lose something in the subtitles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the new version with Al Pacino and it was great. This one was good but I do not understand the language and lost the feel of the movie because of having to constantly read the subtitles. You miss little things like mannerisms and voice tones because of the language barrier. This film is a bit darker than the remake. It seems European films are always a little bit darker than the American counterpart. I hate the word insomnia because I suffer from this sometimes. I like the trailer part "No rest for the wicked." I can relate with making a mistake due to lack of sleep which gets one in a pickle. I would of rated it higher but like I said you miss something with the subtitles. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to be controversial, because I think the U.S remake is better. Pacino and Swank are better, it's a more claustrophobic tale and the original murder is more convincing and relevant to the tale.Still this is a decent European effort, a top thriller; and worthy of a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, But Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Norwegian film was re-made for English-speaking audiences in 2002 and starred Al Pacino. This original one starred Stellan Skarsgard, an equally well- known actor of Europe.Critics usually favor the first version of any movie than is re-made, and they are more likely to favor a European version. Sometimes they are correct, but not here. The re-make, although nothing super, is still better than this version, although isn't bad.Europeans would like this version more because of its ambiguity and moodiness, which they (and elitist U.S. critics) think makes it more attractive to the "cerebral." Entertainment-wise, this version simply isn't as interesting....and it IS the "entertainment business," after all.The ending of this Norwegian film also leaves one unsatisfied, but the filmmakers did a nice job of portraying paranoia and the good-vs-evil nature of us human beings. Skarsgard does a wonderful job in that respect. He exhibits such a look of a haunted, depressed man!</fullReview>
