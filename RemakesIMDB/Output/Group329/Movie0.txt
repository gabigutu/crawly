		<shortDescription>A great Tour de Force by a fine cast, interpreting a great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie in a USAF chow hall on the island of Makung in the China Strait with about 20 other airman. The year was 1960. We were stationed there on a missile site. Our targets were 7 Chinese missile sites. Their target was us. I was 22 years old and immortal. Until I watched this movie.When the movie ended, I will never forget the fact that no one moved for perhaps 10 minutes. There was just the bright, blank screen and the sound of the end of the film going around and around. Thiketa-thicketa-thicketa................... No one ever said a word about what we had just seen. We, or at least I, never forgot this movie. As said earlier, it was more than scary. It was sad.It seems strange now, 40 some years later, to be telling people that you really should watch this film and watch the masters at work, with a script that is chilling. And you know what? We still haven't outlived the possibility...........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Without Being Pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"On The Beach", despite it's heavy subject of a nuclear holocaust wiping out all human life, succeeds because Stanley Kramer is mercifully more restrained and less pretentious than he would later be in "Inherit The Wind" and "Judgment At Nuremberg", which are memorable more for their polemics than their characters, in my opinion. Except for one minor speech by Fred Astaire at one point (which as the previous reviewer noted is somewhat ironic in light of the fact that the very thing Astaire rails against, the idea that large nuclear stockpiles could keep the peace, turned out to be absolutely true) the film is for the most part about people and how they react to the knowledge that their world and their lives will soon come to an end. This is what makes the film so compelling as far as I'm concerned. The cast is excellent, with fine performances by Astaire (his first non-musical part), Anthony Perkins and Gregory Peck. But the real strength of the movie is Ava Gardner's touching performance as the lonely, alcoholic Moira Davidson who manages for one brief moment before the end to find true love with Peck. Having read much about her life, there is something almost hauntingly autobiographic in Gardner's portrayal, and that only adds to the movie's overall poignance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cold War aspects of this movie may be a bit dated, but for those of us of a certain age it is a reminder of the fears we lived under at that time. In retrospect, it may be that Julian was wrong: it may have indeed been the very presence of these terrible weapons that prevented a third world war.In any case, that aspect of the story never overshadows the movie's underlying theme, which is, rather, how each of us views the sum of our lives as our mortal end approaches. Are we alone? Have we connected with anyone? Have we failed? Have we loved? Have we been loved?Color would have been all wrong for this essentially b&amp;w story. Superb performances from Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire and the pre-Norman Bates Anthony Perkins. A fine bit as well by John Tate as the old admiral("to a blind, blind world").A mere cold-war nuclear destruction movie would leave one merely frightened at the end. The fact that this movie leaves you with an almost unbearable feeling of terrible sadness is a testament to the human power of Nevil Shute's book, as well as to the fine script and Kramer's superb direction.One of the most depressing movies ever made, but a truly great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectly paced and well acted, it keeps melodrama minimised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era (1959) and on a topic (nuclear war) that usually demands melodrama, "On the Beach" resists. In fact, the all-star principal cast and director Stanley Kramer seem to treat the topic as a stage play, focussing on the individual. And that is how such a story should be treated. Life on the northern hemisphere has been destroyed a defence mistake by one of the (then) two superpowers. Gregory Peck's nuclear-powered submarine was submerged at the time (they stayed under water for a hell of a long time in those days). The sub heads for Melbourne, Australia, which is one of the only places in the world not yet affected by radiation. But the radiation will come, and this is where the truth of the piece comes out.The inhabitants of 'the end of the world' go through what you would expect: denial, anger, clinging to the thinnest hope, and finally, resignation. As I said at the start, this is clearly a story about the individual. Kramer knows this, and the cast of Ava Gardner, Tony Perkins, John Meillon and Fred Astaire play it with a reality that is all too rare. Even recent films like Final Impact fail to deliver on this count. The real joy of the film is the pacing, which gives the cast the chance to play it like it should be played. Astaire proves he is an actor, and only once slips into his raised eyebrow 'top hat and tails' mode. It is a well thought out movie without the Hollywood ending, but such is the art of Kramer that the ending is a good resolution, not just a funeral. The camera work is exceptional throughout, starting with the continuous shots in Peck's submarine. I don't know about the Waltzing Matilda music at the start, however. But it does work later in the piece, and makes it worthy of the Academy Award nomination it received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are all on that beach, on the thin line between life and death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And the essence of our lives is expressed in the way we treat each other under the implacable threat of imminent mortality. As Ava Gardner's character says, at the penultimate moment of love's farewell, "It's been nice, Dwight Lionel. It's been everything." And what she says on her beach is true for every last one of us, on ours.The primary power of this great movie to me is how well it conveys the idea that for us, on this beach, love and tender kindness are all that matter in the end, and the end is always near. The sheer kindness that Ava and Gregory's characters express for each other is surely the key element of their triumphant relationship.The moment in which their relationship most completely triumphs, of course, occurs at the Narbethong Hotel. "On The Beach" achieves a cinematic moment of genius when the chorus singing "Waltzing Matilda" changes from a rowdy crowd of drunks to a magnificently harmonious group of fine male voices. As the sheer beauty of the music overwhelms us, it also overwhelms our characters, and we all unite together in a sublime moment of awareness that true love and kindness give us our only victory over imminent death. "You'll never take me alive," says the ghost.The way Gregory Peck's character shifts from fumbling with the fire to turning toward Ava as the music inspires transcendence, and the way Ava smiles at him, make this scene unforgettably great.Nearly as wonderful is the scene in which Ava's character learns that the Sawfish will be leaving, with her captain at the helm. She will have to face her death alone. She doesn't waste a moment in argument or recrimination, but expresses the fullness of her love for him and her great courage when she accepts his decision and thanks him: "..it's been everything." And then: "oh, I'm so frightened." This moment is one that I take to heart. It shows the love and courage I wish to have "when the time comes."There is still time, brothers and sisters. But we are all on the beach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On The Beach was made in 1959 and it's still a fantastic movie some 46 years later. As great as all the performances are, the photography and the script are as out-standing.The only drawback to this black &amp; white classic is the hauntingly depressing nature of the film. Death is never easy to explore and it's done here tastefully, gritty, and realistically. Gregory Peck shines in this controversial role. Ava Gardner gives her finest performance. Fred Astaire is incredible in this serious role. However, the film was stolen by the pre-Psycho Anthoney Perkins and newcomer Donna Anderson as a doomed young couple with a new baby. The ending of On The Beach is one of the most depressing in screen history, still this is a must see for any fan of any of the actors or the legendary Stanly Kramer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most potent movies I've ever seen. Chilling! Although appearance of movie is dated...it should be...filmed in 1956. The characters, situation, emotion are timeless. The date of the movie in no way weakens the strength of the story. Only slight weakness is the relationship between Peck and Gardner. Too much time spend on these two at times distracts from story. Still it does set up a moving ending in which devotion to duty, comrades, (in a situation where such devotion is meaningless) deepens our awareness of humanity. Not for the weak of heart. No happy endings here!! All the more powerful for its non hollywood approach, we need more of these movies. Instead of finishing the moving feeling good, we finish THINKING GOOD. Much more important goal of a movie if you ask me.</fullReview>

I have seldom wanted to be in a group as much as I did that night. I almost got up and went to sit in a row with one of the 4. Directing? Brilliant. Cinematography? Brilliant. The cast? Exceptional. Ava Gardner (still beautiful), Gregory Peck, Fred Astair and Anthony Perkins are inspired. I have always wanted to go to Australia. Many years later I got the chance. As the coast of Sydney came into view I started to cry...and didn't know why? Then I realized, I was 'hearing' Waltzing Matilda and remembering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May I enter a minority report? I hate this film as much as Nevil Shute (author of the novel On the Beach) did.Shute's biggest complaint was the film's distortion of the character of Commander Dwight Towers. In the novel, Towers' "coping mechanism" is an alternative reality: the conviction that "when all this blows over" he was going to return to his wife and family in Connecticut; he even buys them presents to take home. "You may think I'm nuts," he tells Moira, "but that's how I see it." Moira's greatest achievement is to enter into his alternative reality and to promise to visit him in Connecticut. Indeed, to Moira's sorrow, the two do not consummate their relationship; Towers will not, cannot, cheat on his wife. The mercenary Stanley Kramer would have none of this: the film, he decided, needed sex. Gregory Peck, to his credit, tried to argue Kramer out of this distortion, but Kramer wouldn't budge.Like all Shute's novels, On the Beach is about ordinary people triumphing over an impossible situation. The characters in Shute's story talk of simple pleasures and go on with their lives, planting flowers and beautifying their homes, talking of "the situation" and "when it comes" in careful euphemisms, not in denial but quietly aware that soon and very soon they must make their plans about how they are going to spend the end. My favorite scene is in the furniture store, when Peter Holmes says "Can I pay with a checque?" The clerk answers in the affirmative, and they exchange their documents with dignity, like gentlemen, without bitter recriminations or snide end-of-the-world jokes and with no pathetic attempts to utter profundities. The movie, I fear, betrays the mood of the novel: in the movie, the characters do nothing from start to finish other than moping, moping and moping. This makes the film sentimental, corny and downright mushy. The novel has none of those qualities.Kramer made the mistake of imagining this story to be about nuclear war, or the aftermath thereof. He's utterly wrong. The story is about the triumph of the human spirit over impossible odds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Emotionally packed drama about a futuristic, for the time the movie was released in 1959, nuclear war that took place in the late fall and early winter of 1963/64. With the only survivors of the conflict being in Australia waiting for the Gime Reper to come and take them away in the form of deadly radioactive clouds.The USS Sawfish the only surviving vessel in the US Navy makes it's way down from the North Pacific to Melbourne Harbor with it's skipper Capt. Dwight Towers, Gregory Peck, on his first day on shore leave getting involved romantically with a local Australian woman Moira Davison,Ava Gardner. Towers a native of New London CT. where the Sawfish was based knows that his wife and two children had perished in the war and is in need to find himself someone who he can spend the last few months of his life with Moira filling that need. Moira herself had been involved for some time with nuclear scientist Julian Osborne, Fred Astaire, but he's become impossible to Iive with since the war started. Julian had developed a deep guilt feelings about his involvement with and testing the hydrogen bomb that he's become a suicidal mental case in both his, like Moria, drinking and driving.There's also in the film the story about a young Australian couple Navy Lt. Peter Holmes and his wife Mary, Anthony Perkins &amp; Donna Anderson, who had everything to live for.Now with the end coming they have to choose in not only taking their lives, with cyanide pills, but their infant daughter Jenny's as well. That's in order to avoid suffering the inevitable and horrific death resulting from deadly radiation poisoning.For the most part "On the Beach" plays like an afternoon soap opera but the fact that you, and those in the movie, know that no one in it will survive the final credits makes it a lot more personal as well as heart wrenching and involving. Getting a radio signal originating from the US Pacific Coast the Sawfish heads out to sea to find out if there's any one still left alive in the United States by sailing thousands of miles and finally surfacing in San Francisco Bay. The eerie sights, through the Sawfish's periscope, of an empty and dead city was just too much for San Francisco native seaman Ralph Swein, John Meillon, who jumped ship and swam to shore. Later telling Capt. Towers, who was shielded from the radiation inside the Sawfish, that he'd rather "get it" here, in SF, then in Australia with the rest of the sub's crew.The last hope of human survival on the North American Continent is dashed to pieces when Lt. Sunderstrom,Harp McGuire, goes ashore with a protective, from radiation, suit in San Diago where the mysterious SOS-like signal that's being picked up by he Sawfish is coming from. Lt. Sunderstrom is shocked to find out that its, the SOS signal, only coming from an empty coke bottle that's attached, by a window shade, to the Morse Code clicker. The radioactive clouds from the nuclear devastated Northern Hemisphere starts sweeping into Melbourne and the rest of Australia a lot earlier then most of the scientific experts expected them to. It's then that everybody frantically start to plan for their own deaths before the deadly radiation starts to take effect. This leads Mary Holmes to have a nervous breakdown not being able to bear to put her young daughter Jenny , more then herself and her husband Peter,to sleep forever. Julian not having any problems with the thought of his own demise, and alienating himself from all his friends and his former lover Moira, locks himself up in his garage and starts the engine of his beloved champion race car asphyxiating himself.Both Mary and Peter come to terms with the end by having little Jenny drink her formula, spiked with an lethal dose of sleeping pills. Then in a last and emotional embrace have a drink of hot tea with the deadly cyanide pills mixed and dissolved in it. Capt. Towers after saying a tearful good-by to Moira goes together with his men on the USS Sawfish out to sea and back home to the USA to die together with their already deceased families and loved ones as the movie sadly come to an end to the music of "Waltzing Matilda".Powerful and thought-provoking movie about a nuclear holocaust without a single person being killed, as a result of it, in the film. "On the Beach" may have been dated a bit after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 but has come back to haunt us with the events, and wars, that followed the attacks of September 11, 2001. With many people, on both sides of the battle-line, who never had to live through in the 1950's and 1960's the fears and nightmares of a nuclear Armageddon are now sadly reminded that it's a war that, like in the movie, nobody will win much less survive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is emotionally devastating, even after you've seen it a number of times. Others on this site have reviewed the plot, so I'll say that the thing which most affected me about the film is, ultimately, its nihilistic viewpoint- that Death is indeed no respecter of persons, age, ability, or good intentions. The completely innocent die along with the guilty, there is no salvation for humanity, and in the end everything mankind has done, good and bad alike, is rendered irrelevant, completely meaningless.The only thing I disliked were the dramatic chords and the scenes at the end- "THERE IS STILL TIME BROTHER!" Duh! We KNOW what the message was and didn't need it beaten into our heads, thank you very much!Personally, I'd have ended it as the submarine is sailing off into the sunset to the slow, sad strains of "Waltzing Matilda."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simply, one of the finest examples of the genre ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age where sci-fi films seem to rely more on big budget special effects,and spectacular explosions,to hold an audience(usually at the expense of a decent script and plot line),On the beach is here to remind us of how it should be done.Although the plot is simple and uncomplicated, it works well on different levels,almost feeding of the paranoia that abounded at the time, concerning atomic weapons.It tells the story of a group of individuals,and their last few months of life.An atomic war has wiped out most of the earth,only Australia and parts of the southern hemisphere are left,but it is only a temporary reprieve,the cloud of dust which has destroyed mankind is heading their way.It is against this backdrop that the film opens,and we get to meet the main characters.Dwight Towers,the american submarine captain,played superbly by Gregory Peck,good time girl Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner),desperately looking for one last chance of love,young naval officer and new dad Peter Holmes played by a young Anthony Perkins,and Fred Astaire as the towns drunken scientist,proving he could act as well as dance.As these characters develop,and we start to care about them,(they are all believable and for the most part,likeable),the film starts to ask questions of the viewer.what would i do? what about my family?how would i cope?.Director Stanley Kramer plays on the very real fears of the viewer,much the same way as Byron Haskin did in War of the worlds and Robert Wise in The day the earth stood still,albeit in a more subtle fashion.It is in the second half of the film,when the grim reality sets in,that Kramer cranks up the tension,almost scene by scene,we witness the growing despair and anguish of these poor souls,and there are some pretty unsettling scenes,non more so than when we watch people queueing up for "suicide"pills and then again when Anthony Perkins tries to explain to his young wife how to administer them to their young daughter in his absence"when the time comes". But of course,even amidst the doom and gloom,love blossoms,and the most poignant scene in the film for me,is when Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner kiss for the first time.A first rate cast and script,together with a haunting soundtrack,(you'll be whistling waltzing matilda for days after watching this)makes this one of my favourite films.Don't just rent this classic,buy it and give it pride of place in your collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was/am not an actor, but I was a Fulbright at the University of Melbourne 1958-1960. When the U.S. Navy and Stanley Kramer fell out, he needed bit players with an American accent. As a result, I was recruited to play the (nameless) part of the planesman ("Depth 45 feet, Sir" and other immortal lines).It was great fun. I worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week (really -- though most of the time was spent playing poker -- made more money playing poker than I did for acting) for two weeks at the Melbourne Fair Grounds. Met and chatted with all the participants other than Ava Gardner, who had no truck with anyone other than her Spanish cameraman.I was very impressed by Kramer and his writer. As to the others, it was clear that good brains do not make good actors (though all were nice people, particularly Fred Astaire who could have made millions as a salesman if he had not made them as a dancer/actor).I have seen lots of times and think the best movie ever made (even better than "No Time for Sergeants", which I have seen even more times).Would like to hear from Jack Boyer (the submarine medical corpsman) if he happens to read this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most visually stunning and endearing story ever made concerning the scariest scenario facing humanity. Peck, Gardner, Perkins, and Astaire are outstanding. But it's Astaire's role that exemplifies brilliant casting. His frail, yet, intelligent demeanor, makes him effective. His success as a dancer in musicals is strangely eclipsed by his performance as a sensitive and troubled scientist. We soon forget that he ever danced a step. Kramer understood how to portray ideas clearly. As backdrop to a trout fishing scene, young scouts are seen hiking through a stream. In view of their impending doom, this portrays a stark, heart-wrenching absurdity. Indeed, this and the subsequent scene, with Peck and Gardner, are used to contrast classic opposites, specifically life and love with death and hopelessness.Hollywood will probably consider a remake, considering its propensity to propagandize. However, On the Beach is more of a message film than propaganda. In the final scenes, as the backwash of a submerging sub transforms into trash blowing down a desolate street where a Salvation Army banner reads: "There is Still Time Brother," the message is there for all to perceive, unbiasedly.Oy! And just recently (Nov 2007) I found out that there is a remake. Not too good according to the critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Anti-War Film in the Cold War Period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1964, the nuclear submarine USS Sawfish arrives in Australia after the worldwide nuclear holocaust. Commander Dwight Lionel Towers (Gregory Peck) confirms that the world has been destroyed and the nuclear dust is coming to Australia. The widower Cmdr. Towers, who grieves the death of his wife and children, is befriended by Royal Australian Navy Lieutenant Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins), who is a family man with wife and the newborn baby Jennifer. He has a lover affair with the local Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner), a still beautiful alcoholic woman with a past, and she falls in love with him.Cmdr. Towers and his crew invite the drunkard scientist Julian Osborne (Fred Astaire) to join them in their reconnaissance voyage to the further North and to the United States, and they return hopeless and aware that Australia and the rest of the mankind has very few days until the doomsday."On the Beach" is a powerful anti-war film released in the Cold War period. It is dated in the present days but I believe how scary this realistic film might have been in the climax of the Cold War in the 60's. The idea of people taking "sleeping pills" supplied by the government is one of the scariest things I have ever seen in a movie. When Lt. Peter Holmes explains to his housewife and mother, a typical woman of the 50's and 60's, what she should do with the baby and herself, her reaction probably reflects a great part of the female universe in this period. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Hora Final" ("The Final Hour")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last survivors of a nuclear holocaust huddle together in Australia. As the the Fall - out inexorably approaches they prepare for their inevitable death in different ways..................... Mr Stanley Kramer gives us this scenario - a popular one in the 1950s - as a starting point to his Doomsday epic "On the beach" adapted from Neville Shute's novel of despair. And they went,not with a bang,but with a whimper. Mr Gregory Peck,captain of a US nuclear submarine,bows to the wishes of his men to return to their already wasted home country and die miserably rather than than spend their last few weeks lazing around around on some beach in Oz full to the gills with tinnies and sheilas - doesn't sound like any sailors I've ever met. Come on Greg,be a man and throw another shrimp on the barbie - no worries. Mr Fred Astaire sucks the exhaust fumes of his expensive foreign sports car instead of driving it,engine screaming,over the edge of a cliff like any real petrol head would. Everybody else either drinks themselves to death or takes the suicide pills so thoughtfully provided by the government. Is this really the way it would happen? Would nobody even try to think of a way to survive?I'm pretty sure there were bolt - holes for the politicians in Oz just as there were here -Regional Seats of Government they called them - where all the fat cats would be safely locked in until they could creep,blinking,into the sunlight and start a Brave New World. Of course the rest of us drones would all be dead,but hey,you can't make an omlette without breaking an egg.....right? Somehow I find this portrait of humanity waiting docilely to become extinct rather unconvincing. Realistically Mr Peck would have given the keys to his submarine to his E.O.,said"Once you get out of Sydney Harbour turn right",and walked off with Miss Ava Gardner into the nuclear sunset. Still,"H.- Bomb Fever" was at its hight in 1959 and the received wisdom had it that mankind was doomed.Who was going to argue with that?Not Mr Kramer - obviously.His "There is still time brother" last shot is pure irony,not a plea for the banning of nuclear weapons. N.B. "Waltzing Matilda" actually means walking into the bush with only a rucksack for company.Stick a few tinnies in it and you have a valid alternative to sailing halfway round the world in a sweaty,smelly submarine to a long- dead naval yard in San Francisco where the fall out would kill you in 72 hours.No worries,mate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is still time brothers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it fascinating that the films that stressed the end of the world scenario did not start popping up until 1959, the year of ON THE BEACH. Within a few years (as pointed out elsewhere on this thread), FAILSAFE and DR. STRANGELOVE came out as did the Ray Milland film, PANIC IN THE YEAR ZERO. Why it took so long to discuss nuclear disaster is probably a bi-product of the McCarthy Period. To question nuclear deterrent was to be a pawn or supporter of the Communists in Russia and elsewhere. Interestingly the sole movie I can think of prior to 1959 about nuclear war was the comedy THE ATOMIC KID with Micky Rooney and Robert Strauss, and the plot there was that Rooney survived an atomic blast at ground zero after eating peanut butter sandwiches. That's hardly a serious film discussion on the dangers of fallout.It also helped that the Stanley Kramer film ON THE BEACH was based on a very popular best seller. I have mentioned elsewhere that Nevil Shute was a popular novelist of the late 1940s and 1950s, but best recalled (at least up to 1954) as one of the best writers on airplane-based stories like NO HIGHWAY. He began to surprise critics with two novels that remain popular to this day, but have nothing to do with aircraft: ON THE BEACH (about nuclear holocaust) and A TOWN NAMED ALICE (about life in the back-lands of Shute's native Australia). ON THE BEACH is a dramatic story that eschews over-dramatizing. The characters are facing the final crisis of Earth, and there is no quick fix or solution. Everyone is going to die. There is no massive outbreak of lawlessness - everyone seems resigned to the inevitable. And I think that is why the story works...when you see people running amok and in panic you are inclined to be amused at how people can't control their fears (despite the fact that we would all be in a state of near panic at such a time). By seeing the resignation of the characters, and how it releases them to make admissions to each other before it is too late, drives this ultimate tragedy home.Everyone becomes honest. Nuclear physicist Fred Astaire (in a stunningly good dramatic performance) is asked who he thought was the most dangerous man in the 20th Century. He looks blasé while answering (without naming someone like Hitler or Stalin) "Albert Einstein" - the ultimate atomic theorist and scientist of the century. A sailor who comes from San Francisco sees the town is totally dead when Gregory Peck takes the submarine he commands into the harbor. Shortly afterward the sailor jumps off the submarine, and swims back to the shore. Peck does not stop him - subsequently he speaks to the sailor who is sitting on the shore "fishing". The sailor knows he'll be dead soon but he's comfortable because he's at home. Peck leaves him there, knowing that the sailor will be happier to die in his home town than thousands of miles away in Australia.The confrontation of truth in the dying days of earth becomes painful, as colleagues reveal their affection and love for each other. We also see how several (including Astaire) decide to speed their ends to avoid the pain of nuclear contamination and slow death. It is one of the grimmest, and most effective film endings of modern movies - and the last image of the banner stating there is still time (meant to be for religious reflection actually) haunts the audiences that watch this film to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Destiny Is In Our Own Hands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1959, the apocalypse of On the Beach allegedly took place in 1964. We missed it, but it sure doesn't mean it still can't happen. Maybe now more than ever. But probably not in the way it happens here.That's one of the awful things about On the Beach, they don't know what happened. Scientists among the survivors in Australia speculate, but they don't really know. Interesting however that their speculations led to the future film scenarios in Failsafe and Doctor Strangelove. But as Ava Gardner said, she didn't do anything so why is she and all the rest still left south of the equator doomed.Nuclear war has occurred and the result was total annihilation of life in the Northern Hemisphere. The nuclear powered submarine U.S.S. Sawfish was submerged and sailed south until land with people was found in Australia. Still people like Gregory Peck can't get it into their heads that everything they knew and loved is gone.Still though he finds time for a romantic interlude with Ava Gardner as the Australians and those who made it to their shore size up the situation and it ain't good and no options for hope.Nevil Shute's apocalyptic novel was filmed in Australia and it leaves a good ring of authenticity. Anthony Perkins gives an earnest portrayal of the young officer in the Royal Australian Navy though he does slip in and out of the Aussie accent.Besides the message of On the Beach the main publicity about the film concerned Fred Astaire in his first straight dramatic part. He got rave reviews from astonished critics and deservedly so, playing a nuclear scientist who know amuses himself by indulging in a secret fantasy to become an auto racer.This film was hated, still hated by right wing critics everywhere because of its total pessimism. The religious right particularly doesn't like this film because the apocalypse arrives and there's no divine intervention, even just to save God's Elect whomever they might be. It's just the end of life and the promise that future visitors to the planet might piece together the story of what happened as does the crew of the Starship Enterprise finding a devastated world or two on their mission to seek out life. Yes, it could happen to us.I think that what Stanley Kramer was trying to tell us is that whatever created this universe left it in the hands of those who inhabit it to do what they could with it or any corner thereof. It's our responsibility to find a way to live together and respect each other and our differences or annihilate ourselves. It's not easy, but it's that simple.Maybe we'll learn that lesson and On the Beach is a good teacher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting movie. Strong in places. Mostly falls short of the books plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie because I had just recently read the Nevil Shute book and wanted to see how much I liked it. I loved the book and expected the movie to be good too. How could you go wrong with all the good actors and a BW Sci-Fi/Drama theme to boot? I saw this movie when I was in grade school or something and also wanted to know my reaction to it now. In short, I was disappointed. It was overly melodramatic, the characters had been all changed and the plot mixed up. Nevil Shute had written a wonderful, subtle story about the end of human life on this earth and how people might cope. This movie was harsh and jangling to watch, punctuated with loud blasts of music at dramatic points when it was obvious what we were seeing. Standing alone, with no comparison to the novel, its not a bad movie. It is 2hrs 15min in length and I was not bored durring any of it. I love Gregory Peck. He did a great job of portraying an American family man trying to cope with what happened. Its almost worth it just to see what an interesting actor Tony Perkins could have been. Fred Astaire may have been the most believable. He also is worth seeing. I love his dancing, but he can be a great dramatic actor as well. To sum up: If you like this theme and these actors, then definatly watch this movie. Its not a waste of time. I just felt there was a lot of depth that could have been there and wasn't.

		<shortDescription>Evocatively Haunting and Indelible of All Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly. I remembered "On the Beach" to this very day when I saw it as young teenager back in 1959. I grew up during the Cold War era at a time when we had school drills hiding under our desks or rushing to a makeshift bomb shelter when the sirens sounded their alerts throughout the community. This movie I believe is more meaningful to those of us who lived through that period than to those who did not because the emotions of that time are hard to capture or imagine otherwise. The center piece to this movie that still indelibly sticks with me is when Ava Gardner and Gregory Peck meet for their last and final farewell at the dock before the SawFish crew departs back for the U.S. where they decided to spend the remaining days of their lives . In retrospect,this scene still haunts me because I remember it evoked so many mixed and simultaneous emotions of loneliness, immense sadness, honor, duty, love and finally their endearing humanity to each other that tragically and inevitably must end by forces and circumstances beyond their control. There is a sense of despair and helplessness that I remembered having as I exited the theater, even at that young age, which says a lot about the movie. I believe now that Stanley Kramer metaphorically summed up the entire theme in the movie from this scene : there is that indefinable humanity in all of us, arising out of tragic consequences from events that we did not intend or want. I never watched (or wanted to) this movie again until last night on TMC ... almost 50 years later. It was powerful. Ava, Greg, Fred, Tony et. al. deserve more than accolades for their impeccable performances. For those expecting a high-tech disaster movie from "On the Beach", they will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hyper Reality, pathos-driven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a classic, agreed. But the only worth of praise for this one is the relative early (1959) treatment of the apocalypse-by-atomic war. Other than, "Beach" offers little more than a soap opera. It lacks tension, it's terribly conventional, and it's portrayal of the consequences of a nuclear catastrophe are incredibly naive ? playing down reality. Gregory Peck has the charisma of a bag of potatoes here. Neither his, nor Gardners, Perkins' or Astaires characters are believable; they're merely clichés, sticking figures. In the face of only a few weeks left to live, why would Australian society go on to remain order and calmly await the end? Who, for instance, would care to go on a fishing trip if the final days have come? Moreover, why would any Navy member keep his position? To proudly die "in duty"? ? For an entirely different approach that treats the same serious subject much stronger and more uncompromising, see Peter Watkins' semi-documentary "The War Game", made a few years later in 1965. It has all the tension, all the hopelessness, and all the political explosive yield. Or care for a more "melodramatic" variant? Then try the Canadian production of "Last Night" (1998), a still much better. ? Seen from today, "Beach" offers something of a better reality. It's comforting because it lies about wished and choices. It's, in the word of french philosopher Jean Baudrillard, hyper reality: It depicts a world without the unpleasant elements, a straightforward illusion of the last days on earth, as if the nuclear war is an almost "natural" thing.</fullReview>

I think this film may well have saved the world.. they had to have seen it in the Kremlin..just how does one face the reality of giving poison to your spouse , your child, yourself...Peck ,Gardner, Perkins, Astair.. the beautiful Donna Andersen , they show you in heart tearing performances. How could that message not have an effect on our enemy, they had families too,they faced the same fate if they ever pushed that button. This film's time may have come again. If nothing else i would encourage everyone under 40 to see it just to understand what a profound effect the cold war had on my and my parents generations.SEE IT AND IF YOU HAVE SEEN IT SEE IT AGAIN AND SHOW IT TO YOUR KIDS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cold War masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderful movie, though dated by the use of archaic terminology like "atomic war", succeeds because it captures the atmosphere of the atom bomb-fearing fifties.Filmed in black and white instead of color (a wise choice, since B/W allows for a more expressive, timeless look), this movie follows the crew of the USS Sawfish, a United States Navy submarine who managed to avoid being destroyed in the Big War. The crew, led by Gregory Peck, land at Melbourne, Australia, where they mingle with the local population, most notably Ava Gardner. Together, the men and women of Melbourne and the the crew of the Sawfish wait for the end as a cloud of fallout drifts toward Australia.Anthony Perkins gives a fantastic performer as a young Aussie naval office who fears for the future of his family. Fred Astaire nearly steals the show as a guilt-ridden scientist (and stock car tyro).This movie has a nearly oppressive feel at times, due to the fact that you know what will happen -- the timeline is inviolable. We know that no one will save the day, we know that there is no escape. Watching the good folks of Melbourne who cling fast to their traditions and the regular tick-tock of their daily routines change slowly into a panicked populace with a desire to seek thrills and new experiences is at once inspiring and frightening. It seems as if a sort of genteel nihilism takes over.I recommend this movie highly to anyone who enjoys the science fiction of the fifties and sixties, anyone who enjoys the Cold War flicks of the age, and to anyone who likes a remarkable movie.Oh, I've noticed a trend here in which our Aussie members seem to enjoy bashing the (lack of) accents the American actors use. They speak the truth. Of course, after putting up with decades of Aussie actors attempting to speak with any of the various American accents, it seems to me to be a bit of fair play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another one of Stanley Kramer's Important Pictures--which ultimately means prestige in place of heart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bustling residents of Australia are both on-edge and in denial following a nuclear bomb explosion which has decimated the rest of the world; they have approximately five months left before the radiation fallout hits their country. In denial, too, is Gregory Peck as an American captain about to command an atomic submarine north in search of life--he flirts with blowzy, tippling Ava Gardner but can't stop talking about his wife and kids back home (just like all married men, we're to assume). Fred Astaire gives an over-emphatic performance as a scientist and race-car enthusiast, while Anthony Perkins fidgets nervously as a young lieutenant who is contemplating the mercy killing of his wife and baby. Based upon the book by Nevil Shute (who was reportedly unhappy with this adaptation), the picture is full of prestige and dignified hysteria, both in search of awards and acclaim. There was a time in 1950s cinema when producer-director Stanley Kramer's name in the credits meant you were about to see something Big! and Important!...however, the relationships depicted here are merely thumbnail sketches, and the Naval jargon and detail are a wet blanket on the narrative (there is no suspense). The film is a product of its time: Peck stands tall and mighty even in a natty bow tie, while Gardner keeps her navel hidden wearing a two-piece bathing suit. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most excruciatingly BORING and slow-paced movie I have ever seen. As a fan of the cold-war era type movies, I expected much more out of this movie than it delivered. There was way too much focus on the individual character's day-to-day lives than the main plot, which was actually very interesting and had a great deal of potential. Also, I realize this is an overall bleak situation, but Ava Gardner's almost continual drunkenness (typical) did not help make the movie more tolerable.In my opinion this move would have been much better suited to a 30-minute Twilight Zone episode, than the lengthy movie that it is.Sorry, but as much as I admire the actors a lot, but really hated this move.</fullReview>

Its talky but if you pay attention, you figure out what is going on even though it is slow at times. A very touching scene of people all enjoying themselves each their own, knowing they are going to die, in a public setting while a bunch of folks sing Waltzing Matilda a cherished Australian folk song. At one poignant scene, it becomes a focal point and if you can hold back your tears from being moved, you are a better man than I but at a loss for it. The stars do their duty, our imaginations are activated, and we realize in the end that if what the movie is saying is true, you are now seeing the last of mankind. Thus, the sadness and loneliness that will now inhabit this part of the Solar System from now on. Snack for sure, always a tasty drink and reflect on the message of the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kramer vs. Kramer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting comparing Kramer the producer to Kramer the director.After producing some wonderful quality films between 1949-55, like "Champion," "Home of the Brave" and "High Noon," Kramer suddenly jumped into directing in 1955.From then on he both produced and directed, starting with "Not as a Stranger." It's remarkable to me how accomplished "Stranger" looks directorially. Not only does Kramer handle a cast of top actors with skill, but excels in the distinctive blocking, photography, and production design of the film. Right from the start Kramer didn't look like a novice, but a greatly experienced director--like he'd directed a dozen films before. In film after film, including "On the Beach," "Inherit the Wind" and "Judgement at Nuremberg" Kramer achieves a remarkably consistent and distinctive style. Sharp and crisp black and while images impress with their clean lines and striking compositions. Kramer's skill at creating highly communicative works is also to his credit. His themes and messages are etched with clarity and conviction. While other mainstream directors were settling for cozy confections, Kramer was out there on the front lines, blazing unchartered trails with grity and gusty courage. Here's a film maker who had something to say, and said it, with style and confidence. We are most appreciative of the rich film legacy left by both Kramer the producer and director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's important to remember that when "On the Beach" was released, Stalin had only been dead 6 years, and the threat of global thermonuclear war was both real and immediate (never more so than during the Cuban Missile Crisis, just 3 years later). You can only view the film in this context.Admittedly, at times the pace drags and some elements are overwrought, even maudlin: the Salvation Army band, over-reliance on "Waltzing Matilda" (to remind us that we're in Australia?)--but if you can overlook these excesses, other facets are dead-on.To see San Francisco utterly deserted (along with the startling music which accompanies this sequence); the search for the source of the phantom radio transmission, and the puzzle of "waters" and "connect"; the magnificent Ava Gardner in her last luscious full bloom; subtle touches including the exploring crewman's shutdown of the generators in the power station which no longer serves any customers; the lone sailor's decision to jump ship in San Francisco; Gregory Peck's final skyward glance as his submarine leaves Australia--this film is at its very best when not telegraphing its message, but simply allowing us to see the last flickers of hope as the characters face their demise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers) A nuclear war has wiped out the northern hemisphere and the Australians are waiting for the radioactive fallout to make it to the southern hemisphere, bringing certain death. They have five months.I have seen several movies where I have developed a bond with the main character only to have him die in the last reel. But I have never seen a movie like this where I know from the beginning that everyone will die. This setup establishes empathy for most all of the characters. In life it is hard to be too harsh in your feelings for someone you know will soon die.Not sure that things would transpire quite like what is shown (the Aussies are presented as more well behaved than might be expected), but there is a lot of truth to be had. Gregory Peck plays Dwight Towers, an American submarine commander who was at sea for the nuclear conflagration and whose sub has made it to Australia as one of the remaining safe places. For a long time Towers speaks of his wife and children as if they were still alive. This struck me as a quite believable reaction. Even when you are at the side of a loved one in death it takes a goodly amount of time to believe it.How the Australian people react to their plight is interesting. Anthony Perkins plays Peter Holmes, a Lieutenant in the Australian Navy, and, while his wife is in total denial, Holmes' approach is rational. His reaction seems to be, "OK, we know what is coming, how best to deal with it." Holmes' situation makes you ask just how you would deal with it. When the fatal sickness comes, could you euthanize your child?Fred Astair plays Julian Osborne, a scientist who participated in the development of the atom bomb. When asked who was responsible for the war, his first response is "Einstein." Then he analyzes how it probably did start, with an overly anxious response to a blip on a radar screen. Though the threat of nuclear annihilation is not now what it was in the 1950s, the chance of an accidental exchange, or a terrorist attack triggering such an event, has a non-zero probability. This movie will have more of an impact on those who lived through the height of the cold war when there were bomb shelter lots selling a variety of bomb shelters in the style of used car lots, and the Cuban missile standoff was played on TV like a sporting event, "Here come the Soviet ships, will they turn back, or will we have nuclear war?"Cultural inertia is a strong force and early on much of Australian society continues to function as if nothing was going to happen--a kind of global denial reflective of the personal reactions. The conscious mind rejects contemplation of its non-existence, and even more so the non-existence of all conscious minds. As time wears on some people engage in risky behavior, others seek love before the end, while others take solace in drink and revelry. A moving scene has Tower's crew voting to sail back to the United States to die in their home country, a touching and understandable desire. I found the saddest scenes to be the ones that had an evangelist speaking to a public gathering invoking God to help in understanding and guidance. In but a short time the whole concept of God would cease to have any meaning.There are many fine qualities here in addition to a compelling and troubling story. The black and white photography is well done. The interior and exterior shots of the submarine seemed realistic--there must have been a knowledgeable consultant on board for the filming of those scenes.The casting is close to perfect. This is one of Gregory Pack's best performances and the chemistry between him and Ava Gardner seemed real. Seeing Fred Astair in a dramatic role was a surprise, but his performance is most impressive. I saw this movie in its original release and it is Astair's performance that I remember the best. If Fred had not been the supreme dancer, he could have had a career as an actor. Anthony Perkins plays Holmes with straightforward efficiency that he is perfectly suited for.And the music? You will never listen to "Waltzing Matilda" in quite the same way ever again.</fullReview>

By the last rendition of Waltzing Matilda, the overall sadness of the movie got to me. Great performances by Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. According to TCM, Ava wore no makeup in the film,since director Stanley Kramer thought no one in this situation would. While viewing the early rushes of the film. Kramer thought Ava was cheating, since she still looked so beautiful. He confronted her at a dinner. She asked Kramer what he thought of her makeup that evening and he replied that it was very becoming. She then took his hand and rubbed it along the contours of her face to show him that even off camera, she was not wearing any makeup. Humanity was portrayed with a lot of dignity. That's the one thing I probably think would not be true if the events of the movie occurred in the present. Let's hope we never get to find out if I'm right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nuclear war has devastated the planet. All life in the Northern hemisphere has been extinguished and the last remaining pockets of humanity gather in an idyllic community on the Australian coast to await the radioactive wind sweeping down to wring the last fragile gasps of breath from the world. Humanity is doomed. Finished. The nuclear arms race has reached a final, terrifying climax and do you know what the most startling thing about it is? Just how good an actor Fred Astaire really was...In this adaptation of Nevil Shute's novel, Astaire throws off the dancing shoes, says "so long" to Ginger Rogers and plays a bewildered, aging scientist using the last days of mankind to live out his boyhood fantasies of life as a race car driver, while ruminating on the self-destructive tendency of our species that has finally driven us to extinction. Disillusioned, sad and yet maybe even revelling in the carefree abandon that imminent death offers, Astaire is undoubtedly the best thing about this movie, which is high praise considering some of the competition. Gregory Peck especially shines as Captain Dwight Towers, leader of an American submarine crew who find their way down under. Towers, forced to leave his wife and child behind in the USA has to face the growing realisation that they are dead and there is nothing he can do to save them. He is ably supported by Ava Gardner as a lonely alcoholic desperate to find love in what time she has left and Anthony Perkins as a committed family man, who must face up to the possibility that he will have to poison his own wife and baby in order to be a 'good father.'As you can probably guess then, On the Beach is not a cheerful film. In fact, it's harder to imagine a grimmer opus of despair and you definitely have to be in a certain frame of mind in order to watch it. Bar one barnstorming stock car race which sees automobiles careening off the track recklessly, spinning around and exploding, it's a very slow paced movie, so it's a tremendous credit to the writers involved that two hours of people pondering the fragility of life and everything they did not accomplish doesn't get boring. It is still very much a product of the time though and more cynical audiences might find it difficult to believe that society will keep performing everyday functions right up until the end and not degenerate into a chaotic, panicking mess.That said, On The Beach is still an immensely powerful film. The message resonates even today and in terms of capturing the paranoia and pessimism of the 1950s, it does so with far greater effect than any of the so-called metaphorical science fiction films filled with giant, radioactive ants and rampaging aliens that appeared in cinemas at the same time. The script is terrific and while the pacing may be a bit slow, the cast are all running on full steam throughout. The scene where Perkins explains the effects of radiation poisoning in particular is arguably the most harrowing anti-nuclear message that film has ever provided. And if it makes you shudder watching it in this day and age, imagine what it must have felt like back in 1959, when the shadow of the bomb loomed large overheard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of my favourite movies. I've read recently that the author Neville Shutte was very unhappy with the fact that in the movie the two lead characters Dwight and Moira consummated their relationship. In the novel they did not. To me Both Kramer and Shutte are both correct. The movie would not have been nearly so powerful without that wonderful scene in the cabin with the tenor singing in the background. Dwight surrendering to Moira is sad. By giving in he is admitting that his wife is gone. His children are gone. In the novel a consummation of their relationship can not possibly have had the same emotional effect. Therefore it is totally correct to have Dwight remain 'faithful' to his deceased wife.An important movie for it's time. Wonderful novel, wonderful movie. Wonderful memories.</fullReview>

The film does very well at sustaining an enjoyable framework for just about the whole 'first act', but the problem isn't nearly the take-off but rather the landing. It seems the film will end about 3, possibly 4 times, and all the tension it builds resolves, and yet it keeps going on, before deciding to end with an abrupt conclusion. It's too long for what it is, and the extra footage isn't necessary at all. It seems the whole tension/structural aspect has been over-managed, over-done. The apparent inherent logic seems to be one way, and then we're given an encore, and then another...and it only works against it. There's a lot of good in this film - good acting, entertaining content, somewhat interesting intrigues with their philosophical implications and romances...but it's just about half an hour too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy Moral Quandaries from the Heart of the Nuclear Standoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A coastal Australian population (and the US submarine coincidentally docked nearby) awaits the inevitable, weeks after the rest of the world was wiped out by a wave of nuclear-powered, mutually-assured destruction. There's an eerie sense of normalcy to the landscape, by far the film's greatest, most thought-provoking strength. The worker bees all go through their usual motions, as if a great big wall of radioactivity weren't looming off the coast, slowly creeping in to poison them all. It's enough to pull us out of the moment and consider how we might react in such a situation ourselves: when there's nothing to be done, isn't it better to ignore the inevitable, living out the rest of our days in a willfully-ignorant sense of unsteady bliss? Of course, there eventually comes a moment when such questions can't be dodged any longer, and the cast makes some bold, powerful decisions in the face of a long, grueling death by airborne toxin. Those uncomfortable choices, and the ethical quandaries that precede them, form a stiff backbone for the film. The slow, dry pacing of its superficial plot can be difficult to work through, though, and ultimately that's what keeps it from reaching its loftiest ambitions. As with many sci-fi commentaries of the era, you'll have to do a lot of reading between the lines to make the most of this one. It's smarter, but also far less accessible, than most of its modern counterparts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Struggling to come to terms with the end of the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On The Beach is directed by Stanley Kramer, has a screenplay by John Paxton, is based on the novel by Nevil Shute and stars Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire, Anthony Perkins and Donna Anderson.On The Beach is set in 1964 where following a Nuclear war the majority of the worlds population has been killed, apart from some people who were at sea at the time and the population of Australia. The deadly radiation is making it's way towards Australia and the citizens and any survivors from other countries who've made their way there must come to terms with their impending doom.The US submarine USS Sawfish commanded by Captain Dwight Towers(Gregory Peck)arrives in Australia where Towers and his crew await the end of the world. Towers befriends Australian Navy Lieutenant Peter Holmes(Anthony Perkins)who's young wife Mary(Donna Anderson)is struggling to accept that they and their new born daughter will soon lose their lives.Towers also meets Moira Davidson(Ava Gardner) a weary woman who uses alcohol as a way to cope with what humanity is facing. Towers and Moira fall in love and for a while bring some comfort to each other. Towers is a widower who's family were killed in the Nuclear war although he still holds onto a small hope that somehow they may have survived. Towers also meets Julian Osborne(Fred Astaire)a scientist who helped create the atom bomb and bitterly regrets that invention and the military who used these weapons.As they seek to come to terms with their situation a radio transmission is received from America which could indicate survivors there. Towers, Osborne and the Sawfish crew go to investigate.Bleak and chilling On The Beach makes us question the sense of having so many Nuclear and biological weapons when just having one is one too many. Both the film and the novel make you think how you would react to the world ending, would you pretend it wasn't going to happen? would you get sick or would you commit suicide to prevent a horrible death? The films characters all have to face these questions and Mary and Peter Holmes in particular struggle to decide when faced with suicide or agonising radiation sickness. It's an horrific choice none of us should ever have to face. Being released so close to the Cold War this film no doubt struck a powerful chord with audiences who thought they might well be facing the worlds end soon themselves.Chilling,thought provoking and deeply moving with brilliant performances On The Beach is an unforgettable experience. The films use of the tune Waltzing Matilda is haunting and it works really well with the film especially during the final few minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this, my 65th year of life today, I have have enjoyed so many great and memorable films. But in all that time, this wonderful B&amp;W classic remains my single favorite. It's one of those gems that once you see it you can never forget it, and how many movies can you say that about today? This truly inspired piece of filmmaking was remarkable from the start. The amazing ensemble cast, starring the wonderful Gregory Peck in one the best roles of his life, to a memorable and stunning Ava Gardner in the sunset of her career in a role she was born to play, and the dark horse in this remarkable drama, Fred Astaire, in a nuanced performance that should have won him the Oscar. While never really known as a dramatic actor, more as a song and dance man, this was the shining, glorious moment of his entire serious movie career. Add to this splendid line-up the always underrated Tony Perkins as the young Lieutenant, and you have pure screen magic. Under the subtle guiding hand of Stanley Kramer and based upon the riveting novel by Neville Shute, this masterpiece of a post-Apocalyptic future remains a film for the ages. WATCH IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has that subdued fifties quality to it. There was a lot of cold war fear and worry about bombs, as well there should be. There still is when we consider the screwballs who seem to have their hands on these weapons. I would hope that this fairly dated film would give us another reminder as to how fragile we really are. Obviously, at some point our species will die out, be it from lack of food, disease, pollutants, or war, but we certainly don't have to accept it and we need to be aware of the most immediate dangers. I had trouble with the characters in the film. I know that some have said, "What are they supposed to do?" I guess, knowing the nature of the beast, there would be a little more panic and a little more looting. We don't need to portray it like "Children of Men" but there would certainly be an element. Just look at natural disasters where a considerably smaller number of people are affected. The acting is good; the plot is interesting. I just had trouble with the stiff upper lip stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bleak, black and thoroughly depressing this film has to go on the list of all time downers. This is the story of the end of the world via radiation as survivors try to find a safe place and other people still alive, but instead find only the abyss.Stanley Kramer's powerful look at what nuclear war may bring is a masterpiece of film-making. It moves you to ponder not only your own mortality but also that of the world. Made at the height of the nuclear arms race this story was once a day or two off from actually happening, today its still possible, but I think we'd have a little better chance of averting it (or at least I hope). Its a wonderful heart felt movie on all levels both in front of the camera and behind it.The problem with a film like this is, why would anyone want to watch it. Yes, its a well made and well told drama, but its so depressing and the ending is such a foregone conclusion that watching it becomes an exercise in self abuse. What can we get out of story that is now so clichéd that as we watch it we fill in the blanks of whats going to happen next. I'm guessing even when it was made everyone pretty much knew what the outcome was to be. To be honest other than a chance to see great film-making I don't know why anyone would want to make oneself feel so depressed on purpose.This film is a vital warning about "tomorrow". It just may leave you feeling too hopeless to do anything to stop it.</fullReview>

This is also a movie about people coming to the horrified realization that all the rituals and customs of daily life that they thought were so important are actually basically pointless. Many of the barriers that seem to be in one's way only exist in the mind. For example, some of the characters in the movie take up dangerous sports. What's the worse that can happen, being killed? So what's the big deal? You're going to die in a couple of months anyway! This is a classic movie that will repay careful re-watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just too unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this movie comes highly recommended, but I just found it too unbelievable to fully enjoy it.Nuclear fallout doesn't act at all as depicted in this film. There'd be no cloud of 'radiation' (as if it's a physical thing) slowly creeping over the globe and 'eating up' everything that lives. And even if there were, underground shelters should be able to keep at least some people alive, even if this 'cloud' sticks around for centuries (not likely).However, much greater transgression than goofy science is characterization and behavior of everyone involved. Even if we imagine no one ever thought to stack up supplies or set up some hydroponics in the basement, the fact is that normal people wouldn't be as rational and accepting of their imminent death as characters in this film. Survival instinct is one of the strongest forces in any living thing, and yet it's the one thing everyone here appears to be devoid of. Maybe I'm just more cynical than the authors or a product of a different time, but it seems to me the last few months of human civilization would be a chaos of skyrocketing crime, drug-filled parties, crazy religious cults and death-seeking thrills, most likely resulting in a complete breakdown of society.I see the author was aiming for a sentimental and yet uplifting message, but that's just not the way human mind works.But hey, if you have abnormal faith in humanity or equally abnormal capacity to suspend belief, you'll probably like this more than I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just loved this movie. Quite faithful to the book and captures Shute's sense of stoic resignation (oh well, chin up old chap)and of course the almost manic obsession for one last hurrah....cue port drinking, fishing, Australian Grand Prix.... Would have liked to have seen more of the dissolving of order that Shute depicted towards the end and of course Kramer copped out a bit with the last scene of Moira on the headland as the sub sailed off (perhaps Ava taking suicide pills would not have been a good look in those days).My only real disappointment was the score. How many variations on waltzing matilda can you fit into two hours...the ghostly rendition of the final verse as Dwight and Moira kissed in the fishing lodge was bold and the beautiful type stuff. As an Aussie I found it cringe-worthy (even allowing for the era) and Kramer I think showed a bit of naivety in his understanding of the country by pushing the tune ad-infinitum.Also thought him heavy handed with the music in his treatment of the San Francisco, San Diego scenes and the final banner scene. Silence would have been far more effective.Still, a tremendously powerful, though-provoking and non-sensational treatment of a topic which occupied the minds of many at the time. Really did illustrate the world ending with a whimper and not a bang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 15 Year Old's Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I probably have a unique perspective towards this movie, based on how I came to see it for the first time. I was 15 years old and was lazily channel surfing (all 12 channels!) on Saturday morning television. I had missed the first part of the movie, tuning in at the San Francisco scene. At that time, I had not heard of either the book or the movie, and was thus unaware of the full story. I wondered how Australia had been spared, and admired the Aussies ability to enjoy the good life at the fishing resort. When it started raining, I thought at the back of my head "What if the rain is bringing down fallout?", but just as quickly thought I was taking the story too seriously (turns out I was right on). When obviously healthy people started lining up for suicide pills (just because 1 or 2 people had gotten sick) I wondered what was their problem (obviously I understood later). When the movie ended with everyone dead, I was completely disturbed. Going outside for a breath of fresh air brought no relief, as the beautiful winter mid-day sky looked just like that at San Diego in the movie, and I saw no one else outside. I think I grew up just a little that day, as I have ever since viewed the world and nuclear war differently. My father was a career military man who had always said "The true warrior knows the virtue of peace, because he knows what war brings." - that day, I knew what he meant.</fullReview>

Sometimes, I have been annoyed by the stoicism of the characters in the face of the ultimate disaster. But more often, I just admired their ability to enjoy each day remaining to them, and to consider the good things they have experienced in their lives already, without being in denial of what is coming. I feel certain that, in the face of such a tragedy, we humans would, for the most part, react quite differently, and for the worse, with riots, increasing violence, and every kind of extreme behavior.

"It's not too late...brother"... on the steps of the public meeting hall. The song "Waltzing Mathilde"; as Peck and Gardner enjoy the last week of their life. Fred Astaire improbably portrays the jilted husband addicted to race cars; Gardner and Peck as new lovers, embracing what may remain of their life.Tony Perkins is quite good. As a newlywed, he is concerned with providing the right antidote for his wife, so she may end her life with the baby, without suffering.Yes, this is a very strange and unorthodox film.

Astaire is really amazing when he discusses his regrets about helping with the weapons of mass destruction. Somewhere between a painful reminder of a possibly horrible outcome and an expression of the resilience of human spirit. Some over the top Hollywood moments in love scenes with Gardner, Peck and Perkins, but mostly fine telling of a very difficult story. If you've ever thought about what you do as the end of the world approaches, it provides many alternatives...drinking heavily and singing, drinking champagne, kissing your sweetheart (and their makeup remains perfect!). A race car driver throws caution to the wind, knowing he doesn't have long anyway. Just as things start to settle in to a normal- seeming situation, events begin cropping up that remind us that this is not life as usual. Reality continues to set in, and they cannot deny any longer what will happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A LITTLE TOO HOPELESS?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Always one of my favorite films, this had a tremendous impact on me when I was 12 years old, so much that I immediately went and sought out the book in the public library.Thought provoking and memorable. However, one thing has bothered me for years. While it is sad and stunning to see mankind reduced to such a state, I don't know how realistic it is to see so many people willingly commit suicide. Of course, we did see that many years later in the real life incident at Jonestown, but that was more murder at the hands of a religous fanatic than suicide.Humankind has always had a built-in survival instinct. If not, then we might not be here now talking about this film. We live in a hostile environment, whether through nature or at our own hands, but we have managed to last through all of it. AIDS is as hopeless and devastating a disease as radiation poisoining and yet there are some patients who have denied the inevitable and are still alive. There is something in mankind that simply refuses to give up.A previous poster mentioned the lack of anyone in this film even considering building an underground shelter in advance of the inevitable. I think that is a good point. The final scene shows a sign that reads, "There Is Still Time...Brother." Perhaps they should have taken that to heart and tried to find a way to save someone before it was too late. Instead we have people simply walking around in a daze and the only people who show any life, seem to be trying to find ways to accelerate their demise, such as in a brutal and absurd car race that promises only death as the final prize.The scene near the end with the young sailor and his wife in bed reminiscing about how they met, "on the beach," was touching but her sudden announcement that she's "ready to have that cup of tea now," does not ring true. People who have not seen it, should check out the Showtime reprise of this film, from a few years ago. That scene is done in a far more emotional manner, with the couple sobbing as they end their lives in bed with their crying child between them. It is admittedly hard to watch, but looks far more realistic than what is done here, with the child not even on screen. You can't have it both ways.If you're going to show the end of the world and the despair of people to such a degree that they would even consider such a thing, you need to take it all the way and not pull any punches at the end.In spite of this reservation, this film and the book it is based on, remains an object lesson for all of humanity. It should be required viewing and reading for all world leaders who dare to place themselves ahead of and above the safety and the survival of the very people they profess to lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intriguing "what if..." post-nuclear-war drama, with a particularly unusual premise for a big Hollywood film, based on an excellent Nevil Shute novel. Yes, there are many things wrong with the film, notably the local accents (or lack thereof). Even as a Briton, albeit one living in Australia, I found this a tad distracting. The incessant use of "Waltzing Matilda" on the soundtrack is also a rather patronising irritant which becomes very very annoying by the end. But the movie remains interesting because of the humanity at its core. The effect on the characters of this scenario - which might seem incredible to those of us living in the 21st century, but which was a real concern for 40 years - is deeply affecting, and I occasionally found myself wondering how to cope with an impending deadline such as this.There is some memorable imagery on display, notably some striking shots of deserted city streets. The cast is interesting and dependable (accents aside), Gregory Peck turning in a fine performance as the sub skipper initially unable to accept love because of the belief his wife is still alive, and Anthony Perkins as the young Australian coming to terms with the inevitability of the situation.Be warned, it is at times very melodramatic. And its central message - that Mutually Assured Destruction will not be enough of a deterrent - is clearly now not true and in retrospect hopelessly idealistic. But there is still enough simple human character drama to carry the piece, particularly in the last 20 minutes. Bleak and depressing then, as well as being implausible and preachy, but nonetheless - against all odds - a quite thought provoking and haunting picture.(6.5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, it was a stark, powerful film and all that. But, truthfully, I had difficulty at times trying to decipher who was supposed to be an Aussie, so bad were the accents. Ava Gardner's was the worst, and Anthony Perkins' wasn't much better. At the very least, they could have resorted to that phony-Brit accent that Hollywood used to require actors to do all the time (and what's the deal with THAT, anyway?!!); but, at least it would have been closer to the mark. Also, the depiction of Aussies as larrikins who sit around getting stone-drunk while singing "Waltzing Mathilda" all night is a rather pathetically narrow-minded depiction. Interesting bit of trivia regarding the movie: the oft-recited quote from Ava Gardner about how Melbourne is "the perfect place" to film a movie about the end of the world never really happened. The quote was inserted by a copy editor at "The Age" - Melbourne's newspaper - who thought his editors would get a good chuckle out of it and delete it before it went to press. With perhaps some justification, his editors actually believed that some self-involved Hollywood starlet could be capable of uttering such a remark while on location, and so it was never edited out. (For the record, Melbourne is a beautiful city repeatedly voted "world's most livable" by one or the other of those travel magazines.)</fullReview>

He meets some of the people that are just as puzzled as to what happened, while they know their lives are dangerous close to the same end the rest of the world experienced. It is only a matter of time.A mysterious signal is being received by the Australians. It is coming from the San Diego naval station. Immediately, Towers sees a ray of hope. After all, there might be survivors to the tragedy, if what is being received is true. The only thing is the transmission does not make much sense because no one can decipher its message. Could it be that there is still hope? Towers must go and see for himself taking a few Australians in a voyage to check the signal in San Diego that will reveal whether there are possible survivors and what they are living at present is just a bad nightmare.Stanley Kramer directed this 1959 production which was based on a novel by Nevil Shute. The adaptation for the screen is credited to John Paxton, who probably tried to get the most interesting points of the novel into some sort of cinematic form. The main story line in the narrative is well developed, giving the viewer the sense of the approaching doom in a film that is rather long and might not hold the attention of today's audiences as much as it did when it was first released. The best sequence in the movie is the arrival of the submarine in San Diego where a man is sent to investigate where is the transmission coming from. The eerie feeling we feel when the ship goes up North to a totally empty San Francisco, stays forever in one's memory.Gregory Peck was at the top of his career. His Dwight Lionel Towers was one of his great characterizations in the movies. Ava Gardner had a good opportunity to shine as Moira. A surprising Fred Astaire in a dramatic role was a rare treat. Anthony Perkins is fine also as the young Navy officer who must deal with the impending doom he and his family face."On the Beach" is an interesting film dealing with a serious subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Stanley Kramer Effort That Will Haunt You For Days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ON THE BEACH is quite a monumental achievement. Nevil Shute's dark and gloomy novel about Australians (and not a few American refugees) awaiting the end of the world in the form of fallout from a nuclear holocaust in the Northern Hemisphere certainly seems an odd choice for a Hollywood film.Kramer's film makes a few changes from the novel: Fred Astaire's character is a much younger man in the book, and his name has been changed for some reason from John to Julian. The American submarine, called the "Scorpion" in the book, is here called the "Sawfish." But by far the biggest change from the novel is the romance between Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck) and Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner).In the novel, the two spend a great deal of time together, and even spend a weekend in the mountains fishing (staying in separate hotel rooms), but stop short of having an affair; Dwight is aware that his family back home is dead, but he will not dishonor his dead wife by "cheating" on her, and Moira respects that.Naturally, in the film, they do fall in love. Yet even this major change is really a minor quibble, for the romance grounds the film emotionally in a way that the sublimated relationship probably would not. Besides, Gregory Peck is his usual wooden self here, and it takes all of Ava Gardner's considerable acting talents to thaw him out.Gardner, yet another beautiful woman in Hollywood who never quite got the recognition she deserved as an actress, is the emotional center of the film. A good thing, too, because in the one scene where Peck tries to work up emotion about his dead family, the results are almost embarrassing; it is simply beyond him.There is fine work here, too, by Astaire as a former flame of Gardner's, a scientist who joins the submarine crew for an investigative cruise that takes up a good portion of the center of the film, and Anthony Perkins and Donna Anderson as a young married couple with a new baby facing the fact that all their hopes and dreams are about to come to an end.My only other quibble is that the American actors playing Australians (Gardner, Astaire, and Perkins) have varying degrees of success with the accent. Perkins pulls it off the best; Astaire's comes and goes; Gardner does not even attempt it. But again, this is a small quibble and I cannot bring myself to take away stars from this film.The score, too, contributes to the dramatic impact; Ernest Gold's score's use of the archetypal Australian tune "Waltzing Matilda" adds to the poignancy of the proceedings.This is a bleak and disturbing film, but I dare you to forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful study of human nature. Every anthropology and religion student should see this film. In fact everyone should see this film - and then ask "What would I do?" Every aspect of human nature is covered here-- without preaching, without vulgarity. This picture is put together like a painting by master artist- stroke by stroke it comes to life before our eyes, until the final flourish in the last seen makes us draw a breath- and hold it.Kudos to Kramer for enlisting Fred Astaire in his role. I don't know why he was inspired to cast him- but he let us see how much we take for granted from Mr Astaire. The fact that he can act- and has been acting for the 26 years prior to this movie. I once read where a fellow actor said of Mr Astaire that "he makes it look so easy we take him for granted." Fortunately Mr. Kramer did not.This movie is timeless and so is it's message. It could have been made in 1949 , 1959 , 1969, 1979 , 1989,m 1999, or 2009.</fullReview>

Who would you be with? what would you do with the time spent? Would it be worth doing anything? It's questions that this film presents along with many questions aimed at the government. The film begs many questions of life and love, and romance with the inevitability of the end of the world. The writers manage to instill a sense of both urgency, and impending doom as we watch this variety of characters seal old wounds and await their evident deaths. Director Kramer gives the audience an eerie and truly horrifying finale of an ending that will stick in your mind forever. It stuck in my mind.**** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but Powerful 'End of World' Drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Subtlety was never producer/director Stanley Kramer's strong suit, which is both a blessing and a curse when viewing his 'Message' pictures. On the 'plus' side, a viewer is left with powerful images (in THE DEFIANT ONES, Sidney Poitier, his hand grasping Tony Curtis', at the film's climax, is as potent a statement about racial equality in a world of bigotry as has ever been made on film); on the 'negative' side, characters are often underdeveloped, serving more to illustrate Kramer's point of view than 'real' people.ON THE BEACH, Kramer's 1959 anti-nuke 'Message' picture, re-enforces his best and worst qualities as a director. Full of startling, provocative imagery (the banner, 'THERE IS STILL TIME, BROTHER', the film's final image, is a chilling testament, and so effective that it would reappear in the 2000 TV-movie remake), the story is far less effective when telling the 'human' side of the tragedy, relying on Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, and Fred Astaire's long-established screen 'personas' to make up for a lack of characterization. Only Anthony Perkins and Donna Anderson, as a young Australian couple with a baby, facing the heartbreaking decision of either killing themselves and their child or dying by radiation poisoning, come across as believable.Ultimately, the film comes down to a series of 'set' pieces, scenes which work better individually than in the whole fabric of a nuclear war statement. Peck and Gardner's tryst at the inn, while drunken fishermen in another room sing 'Waltzing Matilda' (becoming more in-tune as the couple become more passionate); the last Australian Grand Prix, where drivers, facing death, anyway, drive with total abandon, providing Astaire a chance to live out his fantasy, by winning...and, afterward, happily committing suicide by revving his engine in a sealed-up garage, his victory trophy on the hood of his car; the valet of a men's club, watching the dwindling membership drink and shoot pool, until only he is left, to sip a brandy, and roll a ball across the table; Gardner, facing death alone, as she stands by her car, and watches Peck and his submarine crew begin their doomed final voyage back to America. The scenes are powerful, yes, but at the same time, generic. Had the impending doom been by a plague, a meteor, or some other factor, they would have played out the same way. If anything, ON THE BEACH is too antiseptic, too civilized, in dealing with a tragedy of our own making.As a product of it's time, ON THE BEACH was a courageous 'message' picture, from a director best known for taking stands. Viewed today, while the importance of the underlying message remains, the film seems more dated than similarly-themed films from the same period, such as FAIL-SAFE and DR. STRANGELOVE.Yet the banner, "THERE IS STILL TIME, BROTHER" remains an indelible, timeless warning to us all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good End of the World Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1959 nuclear war film has a lot going for it. It does not rely on nuclear devastation such as burned out buildings and charred corpses for effect. Instead, it focuses on the struggles of the people who were outside the zone of immediate destruction, those who have to wait for the arrival of the fallout cloud. The performances in this film are excellent. Fred Astaire is good as a scientist who predicts the impending calamity and is haunted by his guilt as a scientist for the creation of nuclear weaponry. Anthony Perkins is convincing as a naval officer in one of his final roles before his performance in Psycho caused him to be type cast. Finally, Donna Anderson is good as Perkins's nervous wife who is in denial about the tragedy. It is a pity that she did not appear in more movies. The film has some flaws. Towards the end, there is a scene where it resorts to implausible tearjerking, and the tone tends to be overly propagandistic. Furthermore, the time table for the coming of the fallout cloud is scientifically implausible. Nevertheless, this is a classic film that should be on everyone's to watch list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor SpoilersIf you are sick of films like Deep Impact or Armageddon and how they portray an 'end of the world' situation, see On the Beach. This is a film which shows what it would really be like if some catastrohphe were about to destroy the earth. No hairbrained schemes. No funny comic relief characters. No unlikely heros. No one saves the day. Everyone just hopes a little, but mostly waits. There is no pulling on your heart strings, just a really spooky feeling, because everyone is just dying.I rented this movie because Tony Perkins was in it, and he's one of my favorites. I was not disappointed by his performance, in fact I thought it was one of his better ones. I was also not disappointed by the rest of the cast. And I got something much more than I knew I was in for. I got a really great, chilling, hauntingly realistic film- one of the best ones I've ever seen. Stanley Kramer's direction is brilliant. I especially like how, specifically toward the end, there are many cockeyed shots that give the audience a slight feeling of sickness. There are many other shots in the film which are great. The whole thing seems ahead of its time. It's really a film that I think will speak to anyone of any generation. Timeless. A great one. See it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There Is Still Time.... Brother"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This haunting look at the end of humanity is unsettling, realistic, and the perfect topic for a motion picture. The makers of "On the Beach" hardly miss a mark in their sorrowful creation of a world where all humans are either dead or doomed to die. Anthony Perkins plays his role splendidly convincing me, aside from his missing accent, that he is a young hopeful Australian fated, as I can imagine myself, to die in a short while at the hands of the advancing radiation. Gregory Peck part as a Navy submarine captain seems to fit him like a glove, although his particular story interested me far less than Mr. Perkins.What makes "On the Beach" so relevant to modern times, and perhaps all time, is the banner that the religious zealots in Australia put up towards the end of the film. I chose those chilling words to title my comment because they really are the most meaningful in the entire movie. As all characters wait for death to take them this singular image of hope swings high above a large crowd of Australians, the last people in the world. (*beware spoiler for those who have no idea what this movie is about*) Ironically this swinging banner is all that is left in an empty city at the film's close. What is it really saying? Is there still time to turn around a nuclear holocaust, one that brews between our countries even as you read this? How long will it be before terrorists are able to harness this kind of power themselves? What if they are already able to? Or do these words really mean that we have time but we choose to squander it like fools while the world slides towards destruction? The words from "Amélie" spoken by Hipolito, The Writer, seem all the more potent now that I've seen a more cryptic movie. Something to the rhyme of "not living life as a rehearsal for a play that will never be" or something like that.In finale, "On the Beach" is chilling and hardboiled. Its shot in black and white, in a time before I was born (almost a time before my parents were born) yet its still cutting edge, both for entertainment value and for its look on life and the world. I highly recommend it to anyone who dares to stomach a possible truth. And stomach it we must, for how else can we avoid meeting this destiny for real?</fullReview>

The human race seems to know no other way except greed (in any manifestation) and self-hatred. Good.

I thought she would use them way before the film despite her protests about such a way to go.Gregory Peck is a very complex character here. He really doesn't seem too devastated by the fact that his wife and two children perished in the U.S. Instead, he finds love with Miss Gardner.The real surprise is Fred Astaire here who gives a moving performance.

		<fullReview>"On the Beach" (1959): Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire, Anthony Perkins, directed by Stanley Kramer. We find ourselves in the near-future of 1964, Australia. There is an odd, "informal" feeling to what we see. People are tired or depressed or drinking excessively?is THIS was Australians are like? We then learn that the Atomic War is OVER, the rest of the planet is, they suspect, now dead, and radioactive clouds are finally headed for Australia ? the last location with clean air. People are in denial or trying to prepare. There are no scientists madly searching for a last-minute cure. Everyone does a decent job depicting people trying to be stoic or fatalistic or casual as their deaths approach. The photography is good, but if I could, I would rip 90% of the scoring OUT ? since it uses "Waltzing Matilda" REPEATEDLY (in a variety of styles for moods), which really got under my skin - and I don't mean in a good way. The individual situations we see are powerful, the reactions to their realities thoughtful and sad. This is one of the ultimate Cold War/anti-war films. It may not be equal to "Failsafe", but it's up there.</fullReview>

The newer version plays entirely to the emotions, as opposed to the older version which plays on the intellect. The end of the 1959 version has a message to make one ponder. The new version has a U.S. Naval commander pleasing the emotions by deserting his ship and crew on it's final cruise, to stay with the lovely ingénue, who looked strikingly like Ava Gardner, and perhaps gave the best performance of the movie. Ponder history and the future, or bite off some self-serving, irresponsible activity at the end of the world?

		<fullReview>Ava Gardner's remark about Melbourne- "a perfect place for a story about the end of the world" - was spot on, if not for the reasons she had in mind. (I don't know what reasons she had in mind.) Contrary to popular belief Melbourne is the nicest city in Australia, both to visit and to live in; Sydney appeals chiefly to people who haven't been to Melbourne. I suspect this is something that hasn't changed since the 1950s. Obviously they had to set the story in a REAL city, a somewhere that wouldn't otherwise feel isolated; and it also had to be a place where we could look around and think, "In other circumstances, this could be paradise."When I think of Stanley Kramer I think of dull, worthy "message" movies - which is more due to the titles and plot synopses than to anything else, since I've yet to see a single film of his that exudes dull worthiness. This one certainly doesn't. You could watch it and never realise that it was originally made for a Cold War audience, so completely is it concerned with what remains of the lives of the people left around AFTER the war.Just one thing bothered me: a dragged-out ending. It was as if Kramer had half a dozen satisfying conclusions before him, and, unable to part with any of them, showed us all of them one after the other, concluding with the weakest. But in fact this was a wise choice. It's best for us to hang in there until the story is completely over, and every single human being has perished.P.S. - slight spoiler -: I loved the car race metaphor. It's been Fred Astaire's lifelong desire to take part in such a race, and as it happens he "wins" - because almost every other car is destroyed. In a similar fashion ANZUS "won" the war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see there are major fans of this movie but you'd hardly know this movie is about the end of the world. There is so much upbeat irrelevant material that I would almost believe that the human race ending in a nuclear war was just a minor subplot they worked in during a rewrite. They know all life will end in five months but no worries, mates! The late 50's will live on. Plenty of time to pad the film with cocktail parties, frolicking on the beach, and racing those fast cars (uh, didn't they mention a fuel shortage?). People will continue to live their normal happy lives. Oh some social malcontent might mention an unpleasant topic like r-a-d-i-a-t-i-o-n but when you have 400 bottles of Port to drink, the only thing to argue about is how you're going to drink that much in five months. Turn that frown upside down, go find yourself the thickest steak in town and wash it down with a Martini just like you always did. You'll have plenty of time to head up to the mountains for a few days, do some fishing and sing drinking songs which will be the perfect soundtrack for a whirlwind romantic adventure and avoid what the movie is supposed to be about.If you're a fan of late 50's acting you'll probably enjoy this first hour. If you're expecting to see a chilling movie about how real people would face the ultimate demise of life on Earth, try another title. There's only one relevant subplot in the first hour and while it tries to get serious approaching the second hour, the romantic melodrama could have been pulled out of any random war movie where the soldier is about to head to the front. Nuclear war won't be all that bad as long as everyone finds a way to die with dignity.</fullReview>

The film underlines the existentialist position that the universe is benignly indifferent to humans fate. For the most part the characters themselves display a fatalistic attitude to their situation which I found quite affecting. For Melbournians there is also the added nostalgia of seeing the defunct asbestos blue trains running on the Williamstown line and the old W Class trams along Swanston Street.I suppose everyone has heard Ava Gardner's comment that Melbourne was the perfect place to shoot a film about the end of the world.

		<fullReview>Although this movie was made in 1959, it is set in 1964. Then, Kubrick made the 1964 movie "Dr. Strangelove" as if to show us, "Here's what happened to get to the starting point of "On The Beach." I have no idea if he was influenced by this movie, but the two of them fit together very well."On The Beach" is a cautionary tale of what could happen if modern man unleashed a no-holds-barred nuclear war, released at a time when such an occurrence was feared by many. In black &amp; White, it begins inside an American submarine preparing to surface off the coast of Australia. Onshore, we hear a radio broadcast, "War has ended, but there is no evidence of life anywhere but here." (And, I suppose New Zealand and South Seas Islands.)Gregory Peck is the sub commander, Dwight Towers. Onshore friends fix him up with Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner) as a casual dinner date, but they display deeper attractions. However, Towers has difficulty acknowledging that his wife and two children are no longer alive back home in the USA. Anthony Perkins is Lt. Cmdr. Peter Holmes, Royal Australian Navy , assigned to the American sub temporarily, and they all go to the California coast to track down a mysterious code being transmitted continuously, hoping to find life.SPOILERS. They find the source of the code, it is a Coke bottle draped over a window shade pull loop, and as the breeze from the open window moves the shade back and forth, the code key is tapped randomly. We see scenes of empty cities and an empty Golden Gate bridge. The last 45 minutes or so deal with the reality, back in Australia, that radiation will soon be drifting over them too, and they will all die. They dispense a "medicine" to all, taking it will allow a peaceful death after the effects of the radiation becomes too painful to continue. The submarine crew voted to head back for home, to die there, meaning Moira was left behind. Julian (Fred Astaire) sits in his sports car and runs the engine in a closed garage, with a big smile on his face.The final scene shows an empty and still city, all traces of life gone. There is a banner, "There is still time brother." A statement to us, the audience, as a reminder that we (in 1959) could still prevent this movie becoming prophetic.The title of the movie derives from a scene near the end when Peter (Perkins) and his wife were recalling the first time they met, "on the beach."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's Got Your Back?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film for the second time on DVD after viewing it in its theatrical release 45 years ago. I lack the attitude that can label a movie like this "as boring as the book"; or the cool detachment of one "scientific" reviewer here who claims that despite the worst, there are always options (though the writer failed to specify a single one). While the rationale to stockpile nuclear weapons no longer goes by the name mutually assured destruction (acronym MAD), the fate fictionalized by Nevil Shute and Stanley Kramer still lingers. It's a part of the context of the world we live in; but mostly hidden from view behind a Babel of words and images meant to delight and distract us.In the latest go round of "defense" spending, there are some in our government who do not want to make nice with North Korea. Disarming that crazy country's leadership (not its people who've been reported to eat tree bark and grass just to fill the hunger) might prevent deployment of the so-called anti-missile weapons systems. The development of this already dubious program is currently budgeted at 60 billion dollars. It's all told, there in the papers and media, should you care to go beyond the babble. The characters in the movie are baffled how the war began. That's true to life. Cuz if it does happen, a lot of last questions will wonder how and why. Who are the people we're supposed to trust with our fate? I've learned enough over the years always to listen but mostly decline belief in their words. Look at their deeds if you wish an understanding. Know that in the event of nuclear conflict, they've got places to go: places underground, in Colorado and elsewhere (see the movie War Games for a hint, or the evergreen Dr. Strangelove). These places are stocked with food and water; and IF the electro- magnetic pulse which shocks the atmosphere upon the explosion of nuclear weaponry fails to fry the electronics underground, well the country's leadership will get to preside over the dead on the surface with a command and control system too. In other words, by accident or design, the very people whose policies lead to catastrophe get to save themselves. Me, I don't have fantasies of violence which lead to much good any more. But it's also true that death can come in a second; life requires nine months. It's easier to destroy than create. Regard that as a challenge, the biggest doggone one facing the species today. That's what I liked about On the Beach. Twas thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again, the 'End of the World ' as we know it, has arrived. Where to start? Where to start? Nowhere, because that's where this movie is going.So one man in a protective suit goes ashore. Now I can understand, due to a radiation cloud, everybody is dead. But NO bodies? Not even from pets?It would stink to high heaven. And then the machinery (from a power-plant?) is running at full blast. SOMETHING would overload by then, and fires would break out. So the man throws 2, and only 2 switches and turns off the power to the whole city.This is a S L O W soap opera.Want to see a better movie? 'Panic in Year Zero!' was a much better picture.And I have to mention, at that time, 1959, there WOULD be bomb shelters, and some survivors. I'll give it 2 stars for Fred Astaire's fine acting. (And the vintage race car event. As a matter of fact, that was the best part!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull and lifeless melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very boring movie with Gregory Peck about nuclear holocaust aftermath. No emotion was raised except boredom because the characters are rather dull and there is no real drama or even spark of life in this movie. In the movie a doctor says "we aren't machines" talking about how each person will get sick differently from the radiation depending on their individual constitution but it was ironic because the characters may as well have been robots on account of how much vitality and emotion they displayed. Gregory Peck especially seemed like an automaton and in the one scene where he is supposed to be emotional struggled mightily to emote even a mild distress. Over two hours long, the movie drags and caused me to feel tired and sleepy. None of the scenes are memorable and it felt quite dated and old. A far superior film dealing with the subject of nuclear war from the same time period is "Fail-Safe", a movie that seems fresh, vital and exciting even today. This movie is not in the same league, not even close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Two Hours I'll Never Get Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in college, I remember hearing about a book (also movie) called On the Beach. The movie has Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astair, Anthony Perkins...and I'd heard it was good.I really need to try to remember which movies are recommended by college profs in the future.The movie was long, meandering, depressing (though there was some dark humor in it), and, overall, pointless.Can I give you a spoiler? If you really want to see the movie (which I don't recommend unless you're looking for a penance), skip the rest of this review.When the movie opens, nuclear war has already occurred. (The movie was made in 1959 but takes place in early 1964.) The entire Northern Hemisphere has been nuked, and everyone is dead. Not a soul alive anywhere. (Why this happened is apparently explained in the book, though it's never clearly explained in the movie.) A lone nuclear-powered US sub shows up in Australia, the only place on earth where people are still alive. Turns out that the Aussies are expecting to get the fallout from the nuclear war within five months, and so everyone is pretty much living in their last days. Ava Gardener plays a woman who never settled down, and suddenly she wants to with Peck. Problem is, he's married with two children, and talks as though they are all still alive. In one of the few vaguely touching moments, he admits that he'd always been prepared for his own death, leaving his family behind. He can't deal with them being gone and him being alive instead. Unfortunately, his "choking back tears" thing looked a bit more like "holding back chunks." Anthony Perkins and his young wife have a baby girl, and he worries about how soon the radiation will come and kill them all. The acting for both of them was old-fashioned wooden stuff. Astair's character had always wanted to race, and in yet another what-has-this-to-do-with-the-story scene, he races in a Grand Prix with a Ferrari he picked up for "a hundred quid." He wins, but there is - I kid you not - zero emotion from him throughout the entire scene.A strange Morse Code message is picked up and estimated to be from around San Diego, but it is gibberish. In a last-ditch, the US sub is commissioned to go see who is alive and sending this garbled tapping. The sub first surfaces near San Francisco. Beautiful town. Big bridge, trolley cars, pretty row houses...really. After a nuclear war. Lots of loud and suspenseful (award-winning??) music, too, in between absolute silence. The sub moves on to San Diego. They suit up one guy and send him out to try to figure out who's sending Morse Code out. After a bit of searching, he discovers the source of the Code. A Coke bottle has fallen down, catching in the rope-pull of a window shade. The wind is blowing occasionally, creating the tapping sound.Another pointless occurrence.They head back, and everyone goes back to "life." Gregory Peck apparently comes to terms with the complete annihilation of his family and moves in with Ava Gardner. More meandering.Finally, someone comes up sick. The radiation is here, and it's earlier than thought. And now comes the creepy part.Everyone is planning to commit suicide. The government is readying pills for everyone to take to kill themselves. Parents plan the murder of their own children. And everyone lines up to get their little pills while (in the only appearance of faith of any kind in the movie comes up) the Salvation Army Band plays under a big banner that reads "THERE IS STILL TIME ... BROTHER" Some preacher from the Salvation Army goes on about people turning to God, looking for answers as to why we did this to ourselves, etc. No real answers are given, no real theology is even touched. We see absolutely NO other religion of any kind in the movie, and this portrayal is shallow, at best.So we see Anthony Perkins and his movie-wife sitting down for tea, small pillbox on hand. They talk about how they met, etc. They are not even sick. They feel fine, show no symptoms, but we know they are about to kill themselves.We move on, and the sub crew is approached by Peck, their captain, and they decide that they'd like to go back to the US to die there. In spite of being in love with Gardner, Peck just flat leaves her. "I love you, but I have to go with them. They want to go." Yeah, whatever.So he sails off as she stands crying and watching him go away forever.Fred Astair climbs into his Ferrari in the garage and kills himself without the help of a pill. Happy smiles for ol' Fred as he revs up the engine.And then we are treated to scenes of empty streets. Papers blowing in the wind. Tables from the pill stations still there, now unmanned. Every human being on earth is either dead or on his way to death.And the last thing we see is the banner blowing in the breeze."THERE IS STILL TIME ... BROTHER" Oh! I get it now! It's a CAUTIONARY TALE! No wonder my liberal college professor loved this movie.Depressing, pointless...just the thing for the guilt-laden Left-wing liberal.As for me, all I can say is that I'll never get those two hours back again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Fictional post-nuclear war movie makes you think, wonder and reflect throughout the film with out showing carnage. Director Stanley Kramer takes you along for the enviable end in a calming way. The relationships between characters has that magic chemistry essential in a human tragedy. Moira (Ava Gardner) and Captain Towers (Gregory Peck) give you the illusion that they were always together romantically despite our submarine Captain had a family back in New London, Conecticut prior to the apocalypse in the Northern hemisphere. Even the Admiral and Hosgood have this special bond during the film. The Empty Golden Gate Bridge is the reminder that all is not right with the world and the borrowed time remaining is coming to a close. Showing the empty streets of a major city stays in the mind.You the viewer come to the realization how precious life can be.This is enhanced by the reactions of the Submarine crew as they viewed post-war San Francisco threw a telescope. As the movie moves along you tend to forget that tomorrow's days grow short. Fred Astaire in a dramatic role as scientist/race car driver portrays his character with dignity despite a few drinks. The editing is also unique with angle and shadow. Sottle mini plots during the film. The high brow waiter in the club who tries to level the picture on the wall. The footsteps of town hall with the crowds thinning by films end. I've personally watched this film many times hoping for a different ending but there's still time Brother!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very much a period piece film with a block buster cast. Gregory Peck, Ava Gardener, Fred Astaire, &amp; Anthony Perkins head it up. It contains very much the mentality of the cold war period. It does have an improved IQ over the schools at this time who were holding bomb drills and having students hide under desks to shield themselves from a nuke attack.The movie has subtle messages which add up. Man destroys himself according to this movie. Will that ultimately be how it ends? The surprise to me here is how there are pretty much no criminals in Australia, an island which was first settled as a prison. Everyone here is pretty much accepting their fate &amp; choosing how they are going to die. The folks left in this movie are much kinder &amp; gentler than now where today's Billionaires would not go this quietly.The most important of Kramer's symbols to me in this is the revival meeting. The minister preaches faith over and over again, but at the end of the film, all that is left is the banner &amp; silence. This silence is the scary thing about this movie. It is reflected in it often.There are people lined up in silence getting poison pills to end their lives before the radiation. The super powers have nuked the entire Northern Hemispshere into silence &amp; now the radiation is spreading south and Australia is the last civilized place left.The movie is a real downer, and kind of illustrates why a series on television like Star Trek became popular after this movie, Fail Safe, and others of it's type. Trek;s focus is the opposite, that man can always find a way to survive &amp; thrive in a future of continued growth. In this movie, we are as good as dead, and have in fact destroyed ourselves. It is a unique despair which I am glad will never happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood stars in an almost non-Hollywood movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A not so well-known but beautiful film about the world after an atomic war. Not so much a science fiction flick, as it's a very human drama piece about why we are doomed to self-destruct. A somewhat unconventional film that progresses from a somewhat playfull and vivid feel to a dark and unsettling mood of loss and emptiness. Unlike most post-apocalyptic movies of the 50s, this is not a B-movie. It's a big Stanley Kramer production, starring Hollywood icons Gregory Peck, the devine Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire - as a tough guy racecar driver! - and Anthony Perkins (one year prior to "Psycho"). Stanley Kramer of course is most known for "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" ('67), where he proved to be a social visionary. My favorite film of his is probably "The Domino Principle" ('77) with Gene Hackman, but "On The Beach" might be a new winner. The film follows Captain Towers (Gregory Peck), the commander of an American submarine. He and his crew who find safety in Australlia. This is merely plot though. The film is actually a portrait of four people who deal with loss, death, and 'the end of time'. Why are we all looking for love, meaning and human connection... and at the same time responsible for the destruction of all existence? That's what this film really deals with. It raises big questions and issues, but in a very subtle and human way. In a way, this a film about nothing really happening while everything is being touched. Very hard to accomplish that as a filmmaker. Next to the humanity and meaning, for me one of the most beautiful aspects of this film is the cinematography by personal hero Giuseppe Rotunno - famous from his work with Italian masters Federico Fellini, Luchino Visconti, Vittorio Da Sica and Robert Altman, Bob Fosse. Although it's a Hollywood movie it looks and feels like a European (sometimes even Russian) artfilm. Not unlike movies by Jacques Tourneur, like "Cat People" ('42),"I Walked With A Zombie" ('43) and particularly "Out Of The Past" ('47) this film looks very 'unamerican', in a very beautiful and elegant way. Gorgeous.As I'm a passionate admiror of cinema of the 40s and 50s I would love to write pieces about lots of great films of that time. But, since I love watching films more than writing about them I won't. Still, sometimes I'd like to make an exception. In this case, it's because of the unusual beauty and unconventional style of this not so famous but powerful film. My great love for cinema - especially obscure, unconventional and not-well-known films - feels richer and more alive when I take the opportunity to tell about it, in the hope that someone might be interested and touched. I recommend "On The Beach" to anyone who's truly interested in cinema, not only pop-cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Noble Role of Arts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This masterpiece shines among the movies which the cinema industry produced to help us humans to gain consciousness of the madness of the war doctrine known as mutually assured destruction. We will probably never be able to assess how much "On the Beach", "Dr. Strangelove" and other movies covering this most important theme contributed to world peace - or to nuclear peace at least, but they certainly influenced all who watched them."On the Beach" is art performing its noblest role: educating people for the highest good of mankind. And what a movie! All actors and actresses perform admirably, no doubt about that, but it must be said that Anthony Perkins and Ava Gardner are absolutely fantastic, both exploring a full range of emotions that few actors can cover. The plot is just perfect; the film is skillfully constructed from start to end. Watching it is a great experience.Needless to say, we remain very much in need of movies like "On the Beach" up to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An accidental World War III, possibly occurring quickly in 1963 between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R., has destroyed all life in those countries and beyond. The only survivors are living in Australia, as "On the Beach" begins, in 1964. But, nuclear fallout (radiation) is expected to reach these last people, in an estimated five months. An American submarine and its crew, led by Commander Gregory Peck (as Dwight Lionel Towers) was in the survival area. This crew will investigate a mysterious and continuous "Morse Code" signal from the otherwise lifeless US city of San Diego.On the land "Down Under", Mr. Peck is attracted to beautiful and boozy Ava Gardner (as Moira Davidson) - but, he having trouble accepting the loss of his wife and children. Meanwhile, Australian crewman Anthony Perkins (as Peter Holmes) is having difficulty planning for the imminent deaths of young wife Donna Anderson (as Mary) and their baby. The story focuses on these two couples, plus single scientist Fred Astaire (as Julian Osborne). A racing enthusiast and nuclear physics expert, Mr. Astaire appears to be fighting off some collective guilt for creating "The Bomb".This was a fine "message" film, by producer/director Stanley Kramer, for its time. But, its story structure and a changing political climate has not made Mr. Kramer's version of Nevil Shute's "On the Beach" a timeless product. The reluctant relationship between Peck and Ms. Gardner isn't engrossing; and, neither performer is served well by the script. Mostly treated as background, the surviving population of Australia, look like extras in any 1950s film - this is Doomsday? Other things work, however. Kramer does well with the secondary story involving the Australian-accented Mr. Perkins performing with a nicely debuting Ms. Anderson. Time and reputation dictates that all of Perkins' films are seen post "Psycho" (1960). In hindsight, Perkins' 1950s films show the actor on a different trajectory. Playing Alfred Hitchcock's "Norman Bates" probably adversely affected Perkins' acting career. And, co-star Anderson didn't reach stardom.Conversely, you have Astaire beginning a secondary career as a dramatic supporting actor, after decades of song and dance films. While his appearance herein never looks more than stunt-casting, Astaire's screen presence makes the running time easier to manage. Many of the changes Kramer made, from Shute's original novel, are unimaginative. But, one excellent cinematic addition is evidenced in the minor parts played by John Tate (Bridie) and Lola Brooks (Hosgood).******* On the Beach (12/17/59) Stanley Kramer ~ Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Anthony Perkins, Fred Astaire</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a mostly-well-made and very watchable film. Peck, as always, is fine and Gardner gives what may be the best performance of her career. But "On The Beach" is not without its flaws. Kramer lays the anti-war messages on a bit too thickly and some of the actors--particularly Perkins and Astaire--are wooden. Perkins in particular seems miscast as the tender and loving husband and father. It seems to me Kramer could have ended the film with Peck and Gardner kissing at the fishing camp, or when the sub goes under for the last time. We didn'need the shots of empty San Francisco or the revival meeting with nobody there. As much as I dislike remakes this film could probably be effectively remade today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A powerful message, yes, but one that does not pack enough punch. Characters that are strangely non-engaging, a situation that somehow does not quite punch its full weight, and acting that is too stagey. And an Australia that looks more like mid-fifties when novel was written rather than the year of the film being set, 1964 - the cusp of change. I saw this film at 13 or 14 (I sneaked in as an older person!) and it had the same impact as it did when I rewatched the DVD recently - not a lot. Far too much dialogue, an emptiness of consequences of Armageddon - bodies, destruction etc. - and a calmness that just does not sit too well in a drama about the end of the world, for goodness sake. Anthony Perkins fresh from 'Psycho' is the young romantic lead, and Gregory Peck (Ol reliable) steadfastly sees out his own denial of his family's death and then passion with a fast fading Ava Gardner in a very stiff upper lip fashion. His epic chat up line line to Ava when he returns from measuring the radiation in the northern hemisphere to start their sexual relationship - 'Is that offer to spread a little fertilizer around still open?' must go down as one of Hollywood's finest double entendres ever about sex!! Must give the novel a chance soon, not Kramer's preachy (although Hollywood can rarely be serious these days, so must not grumble too much) vision of black and white sun bleached southern hemisphere waiting for JUDGMENT DAY!</fullReview>

I'm not a huge Stanley Kramer fan at all but I liked this film in spite of him (and the terrible overuse of "Waltzing Matilda", an Australian standard), mainly because of the exceptional acting. Ava Gardner is such an underrated actress. She infuses warmth, vulnerability, humour and weariness in her role as the woman who a grieving Gregory Peck falls for.They have electric chemistry. We also have Anthony Perkins considering suicide-- a very touchy issue for the time-- and Fred Astaire in a non-dancing role (and he does it very well).

I read the book when I was in my early teens, a few years after seeing the movie on TV. I can't express the hopelessness it can provoke in children - what can they do to prevent total global destruction? Even more horrifying than awaiting death was the incomprehensible anguish of killing your own child to prevent its suffering. This movie had a crucial part in making me a life-long and LOUD pacifist - but your children can learn the same lessons without such fear and inconsolable terror. Obviously a very effective bit of literature and theater - if you can survive it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering his fondness for making clear-cut "message films," I must admit that I didn't attribute to director Stanley Kramer much of an imagination. However, that didn't prevent him from producing 'On the Beach (1959),' which tackles one of the most courageous science-fiction themes of all - the end of Mankind. The 1950s, largely due to escalating tensions between the US and the Soviet Union, brought new life to the sci-fi genre, and the threat of nuclear war brought such heartfelt indictments as 'The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).' Kramer's film, adapted from a novel by Nevil Shute, goes beyond the mere threat of a nuclear Holocaust, and instead opens with the entire Northern Hemisphere already irretrievably devastated by nuclear conflict. Australia has become the only surviving stronghold for human civilisation, but scientific predictions forecast that the toxic fallout cloud will reach the Southern continent within months. Perhaps one of the earliest big-budget post-apocalyptic films, 'On the Beach' professionally explores what happens to humanity when it knows that extinction is both imminent and inevitable.Gregory Peck leads an all-star cast as Cmdr. Dwight Towers, an American submarine commander who finds his Navy regiment among the final surviving vestiges of the United States of America. His vessel, the USS Sawfish, has surfaced at Melbourne, Australia where anxious military authorities contemplate their diminishing options. Even Towers, a strong and committed leader, struggles to appreciate the massive scope of this world disaster, and he denies the loss of his American wife and children, embracing and then rejecting the advances of haplessly-drunk local Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner). Anthony Perkins plays Peter Holmes of the Royal Australian Navy, with a young family whom he doesn't wish to abandon before the very end. Fred Astaire, in his first dramatic role, adds some class to the picture as Julian Osborne, a hard-drinking scientist who uses the chaos of civilisation's final months to fulfill his dream of race-car driving.These performances are pretty much sound across the board. The supporting players, many of them local Australian actors, contribute colourful personalities and some genuine "Downunder" charm. Though it sounded a little dubious on paper, Anthony Perkins is well-cast as an Australian underplaying the accent just the right amount {he can also be heard trialling out his Australian accent as Mystery Guest in a 1959 episode of the television show "What's My Line?"}. Ava Gardner, on the other hand, doesn't even attempt to alter her voice ? which is probably for the better, considering the range of ridiculously exaggerated "Aussies" I've heard in my time ? and Fred Astaire? well, he's Fred Astaire, and nothing he could have done would have convinced me otherwise. Stanley Kramer evidently saw promise in choosing fading musical performers for serious dramatic roles, as, the following year, he cast Gene Kelly in 'Inherit the Wind (1960),' perhaps one of the finest unsung supporting performances of American cinema.A key factor in the success of 'On the Beach' is the level of atmosphere that Kramer is able to develop. His characters shift restlessly between the claustrophobic confines of their underwater submersible and the chaotic rush of Melburnian traffic, and even the open paddocks of regional Victoria serve to make everybody seem hopelessly and inescapably exposed. Then, to drive the terror home for all his American audiences, Kramer shows us the city of San Francisco, now completely dead and still, imbued with a stifling air that feels like poison to the lungs ? it might merely have been that I was developing a cold at the time, but I could genuinely taste the choking humid air of the dormant bay-side metropolis. Composer Ernest Gold utilises Australia's unofficial national anthem "Waltzing Matilda" to fine effect, overusing it, perhaps, but generally employing the theme as a haunting ballad to represent Mankind's perseverance even in impossible times. Destruction, doom and hope? this is premium big-budget science-fiction of the 1950s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Then we thought the end of the world would come with 'the Bomb'. And in this film, it does, as the radioactivity from a worldwide nuclear holocaust finally reaches Australia and the last humans face extinction. This sombre classic, with its spectacular performances from some of the leading stars of Hollywood, and its magnificent script and direction by Stanley Kramer, is based on a best-selling novel of the time by Nevil Shute. This film shook up the entire world when it was released. Apart from being the first occasion when any Americans had ever heard 'Waltzing Matilda' (somewhat overdone on the soundtrack), or indeed had even realized that Australia existed, this film was about that subject which now faces us again: the end of civilization and of the human species. We now know that this will not come about by nuclear war, but by all the other causes too plentiful to enumerate (perhaps with the odd terrorist atomic bomb thrown in). The most shocking aspect of this film is the total calm and resignation of all of the characters in the film, their dignity, their self-control, their lack of hysteria. All that has gone. Today the same film would have to show people rampaging in the streets, knifing each other, getting dead drunk, vomiting everywhere, having sex in doorways, all the things they are already doing every day anyway, but somewhat more frenzied because they realize it's their last chance. No single film shows more clearly the total decline in society in the past half a century than does this one. If we needed a lesson in the hurtling speed with which hedonism, decadence, and collapse of values have overwhelmed us like a tsunami, this film provides it. In the entire film the sole character who even goes into denial and protests (but only to her husband) is the young wife with a baby, played by first-timer Donna Anderson (who strangely looks just like my friend Jenny Anderson, also once an actress: doppelganger?). The performance by Gregory Peck is a marvel of restraint and controlled emotion, Ava Gardner is intensely and passionately heart-breaking, Fred Astaire in a straight dramatic role proves what a brilliant actor he is, and above all, Anthony Perkins acts circles round all the others, which takes a lot of doing, considering how amazing they all are. His every twitch and gesture is inspired. Stanley Kramer's script and direction are miraculous. The visit to California by submarine and some of the scenes there are so spine-chilling that words are insufficient. This is one of those films of which one can unreservedly say that it is 'a great movie'. If only we could dismiss it as fantasy fiction, but alas, this looks like really happening to us before long, only in a different way. Really, all schoolchildren should be made to watch this film, and it would perhaps sober them up. Above all, what we have lost is dignity. There is so much of it in this film, there is so little left today. It seems to me, if it is not too obvious a thing to say, that the end of humanity is something worth two hours and 14 minutes of our time at least. Or can we stop binge-drinking long enough for that? Some reflection after watching this astonishing film will bring illumination to the thoughtful. People with their noses stuck in video games need not apply. But just think, when we all go down, all the horrible disgusting people will be wiped out too! It's almost worth it, isn't it, just to see the human vermin exterminated. It might be a great way to start again: with the lower mammals. Maybe a hundred million years from now, a more successful 'human' species will evolve, and let's hope they get it right. This film is really a kind of testament to our failed species, but our degree of failure in 1959 was nothing to what it is now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Anti-War Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering its genesis during the height of the cold war, it's amazing this movie ever got made. One might have expected some McCarthy-ite witch-hunt to have stymied its production.Recreating Neville Shute's novel with amazing fidelity, we encounter an American nuclear submarine, seeking sanctuary in Australia, the only part of the world apparently still habitable (the plight of South America is never addressed). Commander Dwight Towers surrenders control of his vessel to the Australian Navy, for the few months that everyone knows, but no-one accepts, is all that remains to life on earth.What do you do when you are doomed? This movie charts the brief, tragic aspirations of those survivors. Gregory Peck is ideally cast as the staunch American commander-in-denial, woodenly pretending that his family back home are somehow immune to the horror. Ava Gardner excels as the local society girl - or town drunk, as she calls herself - acutely aware that she is utterly alone, and that there is now no time to do anything about it. Fred Astaire features as a scientist with a predilection for racing cars. Boyish Anthony Perkins plays a young naval officer and father. He is easily upstaged by Donna Anderson, who plays his fractious wife, torn between hope and dispair. Hers is a truly nerve-racking performance. She seems to voice the wretched incomprehension of everyone. All the actors fulfil their roles with such fidelity and tenderness that sometimes the movie is hard to watch. Constantly aware that a slow, radioactive death is drifting towards them, they contrive any kind of distraction from the terrible reality. Fathers must superintend the death of their families (it was pre-feminist 1959), mothers must oversee the killing of their children. These are concepts that most of us never dream of.Somewhere, way up in northern latitudes, a radio signal is discovered. It is intermittent and makes no sense, but there it is: transmitting from a supposedly dead world. A team is assembled to visit the site in Tower's submarine. It's an impossible hope, but they must know. The result could not be more ironic.Production money is saved by the submarine remaining submerged. Everywhere is dangerously radioactive. Through its periscope we see no evident destruction at the ports of call, just peaceful empty streets. Yet these are even more terrible than chaos because they tell of the quiet mass-suicides of a population that has universally reconciled itself to death.Back in Australia the party starts winding down. Everyone finally begins to realise that the game is up for them. The salvation army gather under a banner which reads 'There Is Still Time, Brother'. A few desperate believers join them to listen. Each day they are fewer. People go about their jobs until the end. Planning for tomorrow is a hard habit to break.This movie is wonderfully poignant and at the same time horrific. Indeed; it is the supreme horror movie, because what it prognoses could actually happen within just 4 minutes of reading this text. It confronts us with a whole raft of issues about responsibility and what life means to us.Anybody who thinks that war is a good thing, that nuclear weapons are a wise invention, or that violent computer games are fun, should watch this movie. This is the last stop on the line of conflict: Total annihilation. And not just of silly humans, but just about every major living thing. No-one has a moral right to do that. No nation, no people, no single species can justly claim to be worth that price.I have only two complaints to make. Firstly, the exclusive use of 'Waltzing Matilda' as the theme tune, the incidental music, the drunken sing-alongs, whatever. Even allowing for Hollywood's complete lack of faraway Aussie culture in the 1950's, surely there was room for something else as well. It really does begin to grate after a while. Secondly - and bearing upon the above - although we see frequent interaction with the other species, especially in the reversion to horses as a means of transport, at no time are we shown any contingency plans to ease their passing. With the sort of selfish thoughtlessness that might well typify our species, they're re just abandoned to their fate. One horse in particular features in its ability to beg for sugar-lumps. It would have been appropriate to see its owner - say - reach for a shotgun and load it. We could then have cut to the horse performing its trick in anticipation of a treat... That scene would have served for the whole of the other domesticated stock.For both of these points I deduct a star. Otherwise it could not be bettered. This was demonstrated by a recent remake. It featured scenes of computer-generated destruction. It also featured needlessly graphic symptoms of radiation sickness. And absurdly, it depicted situations of sexual jealousy, this on the very eve of judgement day. How crass can you get?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Stanley Kramer Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film which deals with a global nuclear war which has destroyed the United States along with the entire world namely because all the nations decided they needed nuclear weapons and it destroyed the entire world. Gregory Peck plays the role as Cmdr. Dwight Towers who is in command of a nuclear submarine which has high tech equipment that can measure the radiation levels in cities like San Francisco, San Diego and Austrialia. Fred Astaire, (Julian Osborne) plays a straight acting role and no dancing and gave a great supporting role. Ava Gardner, (Maria Davidson) adds romance to this film where Maria tries to seduce Dwight Towers who is a married man with children. Anthony Perkins, (Lt. Cmdr. Peter Holmes, Royal Australian Navy) is a young married man with their first child and he tries to prepare his wife that this nuclear war has spread to their home town and they will all die sooner or later. Stanley Dramer asked Ava Gardner not put any makeup on in this film and she sure looked great without the make up. Enjoy this great classic film with great actors and good direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'On the Beach' is one of my all time favorite films. I saw it while I was very young when it was first released, and still recall how scared I was.Fine performances by all, that try and portray a group of ordinary people with limited time to live after a nuclear war. One of the best post apocalyptic films ever made- and done with class and integrity.Filmed down under in the largest city this far in the southern latitudes - Melbourne AU. Done in stark but appropriate black and white, On The Beach as directed by Stanley Kramer is a fine film, that has been somehow forgotten after 46 years- but as I see here being rediscovered and enjoyed in the early 21st century. The films premise may be dated (the cold war) but its message can easily be transfered into present times with Terrorism, Bio warfare, Climate change and a plethora of other modern day denizens that could produce the same outcome.A haunting musical score (Waltzing Matilda) Is used in various renditions throughout- adding to the futility and melancholy of a city and group of people at worlds end.</fullReview>

A proverb states: ONCE THE DOGS OF WAR ARE LOOSED NOBODY CAN KNOW WHERETHEY WILL RUN! On several occasions the powers nearly did just that. This movie is a gem for the ages. The acting was terrific. And who alive (male) could overlook Ava in all her glory. The scene where she and Gregory are closing the shutters and with WALTZING MATILDA in the background made the whole thing for me. It sums up the meaning of the book and film. Now that we have careless war making again this message needs to be heard again and again. I have read most of Shute's (Norway's) book and they all have an important moral center. I rate this as one of the best of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, yet haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got a chance to see this old classic again this morning. Stanley Kramer was a genius for his use of unusual shots...some of the best images in this movie were throwaways--a shot of Tony Perkins, silhouetted in darkness while talking to a fully lighted Fred Astaire, the surprise of the periscope of the sub suddenly appearing to have a chat with the fishing sailor--and they serve to build on the haunting feel of this fine movie.Others have commented on the performances of the cast, some negatively. It must be remembered that this acting style was common for that time, as was the almost brutal overuse of the musical score. Nevertheless, the quiet dignity of the cast, facing not just their own certain death, but the inevitable extinction of all life on earth, is timeless even if the movie itself is dated.If there was a fault to be found, it might have been in the over-the-top love story between Peck and Gardner. Yet, perhaps such a romance might have a believable nature, given the fate of the characters. I doubt it was so much a decision of the director as the demands of the studio executives who felt that ANY drama of this nature would be made better with a love story angle. Whatever the case, the sense of urgency in the lives of the doomed humanity makes this film a must see classic. If mankind were to actually be foolish enough to extinguish themselves, I would hope that the few left would live their remaining days with this kind of dignity and grace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unexpected Surprisingly Intelligent End of the World Flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[[Spoiler Warning Ahead]] Quite unexpectedly so, I found myself 25 minutes into watching the film, finding myself in need to witness this film to its conclusion whatever it maybe.First, I must confess being of a skeptical mind, I expected a happy go lucky, feel good film, that would end with Gregory Peck saving the world, 'ya know' the stereotypical tripe that 'unholingly' [sorry for my own coined word] born from Hollywood.I expected that the war would be the proverbial "elephant in the room which no one talks about" throughout the entire film. Then this 'bomb' was dropped by the guilt riddled, self hating scientist, Julian Osbourne, played impeccably by Fred Astaire, (which was the first time I have ever seen him in a film).Small details made this film great. The fact that barely anyone in Australia drove their cars, resorting to bikes and horses, due to the obvious 'petrol' shortage now that OPEC would have been obliterated in the war; The false alarm regarding the San Diego telegraph; The use of cyanide pills for suicide; the inevitable ending.Each character is a complex, real human with his or her own ambiguous flaws, who honestly and realistically reacted in their own manner to this nightmare worst case scenario.A FAR MORE DARK, COMPLEX AND WORTHWHILE FILM TO WATCH AND OWN ON DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those stories you read in school and then one day out of the blue you catch on TV. I thought it was a great movie and it explores the `flip side' of nuclear war. I'm not one of these guys that scream `Disarm.Disarm' but I've often thought our politicians are playing with fire.This is a quick look into a war scathed by nuclear war, set in a different time and a different place. An American sub (that has survived the war) ends up in Australia as it is in search of safe harbor (a radioactive fall out free zone). Life continues as normal until they get the news.they are no longer safe from the aftermath. They are sentenced to a slow death and there isn't anything they can do about it. And to make things worse.they didn't even fire a shot.I won't ruin the story or give away all its secrets.but this should be a film every American or any person that holds public office should take the time to view. It's very entertaining but at the same time carries a deeper meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We watched this in English class, after reading two excerpts from the novel that were incorporated into this adaptation. I have not seen the 2000 version, though I would love to, as I can imagine that it's superior to this. I can live with the majority of the cast not being Aussies, and not speaking in that dialect. And obviously you can't directly translate word for word from the pages onto the screen. However, once you get past the excellent acting(Perkins, Peck and Gardner are impeccable, and there are hardly any instances of any performances that are less than great), the high production values and a couple of golden lines(yes, the majority of the dialog is good), it is so much a product of its time that it really hurts the potential impact, seen in how attractive and charming everyone is, despite the situation, for example. The music is hideously inappropriate and oddly used, going with monster-flick sci-fi 50's B-movie schlock score to terrify(?) the viewer, rather than a somber piano arrangement that would allow us to take in the scope of what has, and is, happening, as opposed to the assault on our senses that we do get. Also, was someone getting paid more by each time Waltzing Mathilda was played in this? The script has a preposterous amount of holes, and cannot decide how bad things are, and how down people are about it. There is marvelous psychology in this, and strong themes are explored. If it was not so bound by the opinions of the time, and being made in Hollywood, it would have been a masterpiece. As it is, it's well-done, but comes up short. There is disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am afraid the previous reviewer was a little premature with his suggestion that the premise of the movie turned out false. That, frankly, is still an open question. True, the human race seemed to have dodged the nuclear bullet with the end of the cold war, but the chances are even greater now than then, in fact, that miscalculations could bring an ending not too dissimilar from Shute's book. Both the United Sates and Russia have more nuclear weapons and more powerful delivery systems by far than in 1959, even with treaties and the dismantling of stockpiles. And instead of it being only the US, Britain, France and Russia, there are now four other nations with nuclear weapons and even less secure systems to protect against mistakes. I wouldn't count out the possibility that the stupidity ingrained in some human animosities could still leave this planet unlivable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREATEST KOOL-AID MOVIE EVER MADE! possible spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one reminds me of Jonestown. You of certain age remember Jonestown in the 1970's. While dramatic at the time (I saw it in 1961) and certainly was on the minds of everyone who, as a child, had to duck under their desks when a nuclear alert was sounded, it certainly was timely. But the melodrama took over the fear as the years passed. I saw it recently on TV, and having discarded the fear, found it overly done in that respect, and almost unwatchable. "Waltzing Mathilda" stood the test of time however. It is played almost constantly throughout the movie, not only sung, but as a haunting melody. Gregory Peck did an outstanding job as only Gregory Peck can. Ava Gardner was as beautiful as ever and did a journey woman's job in her role. I didn't think much of Anthony Perkins in his role. I think he was miscast. The best part of the movie was the suspense created by the Morse code signals. It really provided the hope that someone was still alive (as well as the seagulls and the cop in S.F.) When they found out what it was it really slammed home the fact that it was over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie one time years ago, and came looking for it after seeing the TV show "Jericho" the past couple weeks. It's a very "good" movie, as good as an apocalyptic movie about the whole world dying can be. I give it an "8" only because it's B&amp;W and I prefer color movies, and because the Special FX are not great, but as the movie was made in 1959, neither of those things are the movies fault, because in 59, many live action movies were still B&amp;W, and FX in 59 were what one would expect from 1959. So that aside I have to give the movie a 10, because FX and lack of color is not the fault of the movie. Great acting, dark chilling story, and makes you want to wipe your brow as to what we avoided as a planet.Thank God no one (ahem, SOVIETS) was ever actually stupid enough to force the use of the global nuclear arsenal. I'd put this movie right up there with, "The Day After", but it MUCH less graphic and less harsh. Though, in "The Day After" the whole world doesn't die, in "On The Beach", EVERYONE is toast. You can only live so long in an underground bomb shelter. Can't have enough food and water for years no matter how hard you try. Excellent movie, but sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this is how the world ends, not with a bang but with Ava Gardner standing on a hill waving goodbye to Gregory Peck.Stanley Kramer's cautionary film, released in the late 50s and set in the early 60s, had a built-in "window of pertinence." After 1964, however, the tale tended to become somewhat dated and passé. Not that there isn't the threat of nuclear disaster hovering today; it's just that Kramer's signal now seems more historical than contemporary.This dated quality tends to diminish the film's effectiveness, despite fine cast work and production values. Also, Kramer likes to take a particular musical theme and play it for all its motivic effect. Sometimes this can be done to the breaking point.As always, Kramer's work is clean, well balanced, and thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the Beach was quite a dramatic film for its day. It told the story from the point of view of the people in Australia after World War III who face certain death from radiation. Outstanding performances were given by Gregory Peck, Ava Gardener, Anthony Perkins and in a dramatic role Fred Astaire. This was Anthony Perkins biggest film outside of the three Psycho movies which typecast him. Donna Anderson, Stanley Kramer's new discovery was a one movie wonder. The photography by Guisippe Rotunno was outstanding. The auto race scene was dramatic. I first saw this movie on television in April of 1981 when Fred Astaire was being honored with an award for all his outstanding work in cinema. It made quite an impact then with the cold war still raging. One of the things that I liked about the original version vs. the remake in 2000 is how they kept playing Waltzing Matilda throughout the film. The photography during the romantic scene at the lodge is particularly good. Also the scene towards the end where Ava Gardener is running towards Gregory Peck with the sun setting is also good. Stanley Kramer's direction is very effective. The two things I disliked about the movie was the science was flawed about how a nuclear holocaust would play out, also I think it would have been better had it been filmed in color. This movie was nicely updated with the 2000 TV movie remake. Although this film is somewhat dated now it is still worth seeing.</fullReview>

Stanley Kramer played upon the worst fear of all Americans in the 1950's, that of an Atomic War. Back then, we had air raids in school and people building A-Bomb shelters in their back yards. One day when our generation is gone, the younger ones left will simply not grasp the real meaning and feeling of this movie.

A group of people try to come to terms with this fact.A well regarded film by the critics, and lauded by the makers at the time as an important and potent piece of cinema, On the Beach is still a film that's not for everyone.The star appeal holds weight, though much of the narrative is tired and weary, trite and cheesy. In fact Shute himself was less than happy with what Kramer made of his literary source, the director in his element with a message movie.If it was Kramer's intent to make the viewers also feel like what it's like waiting for death? Then he achieved it, while Gold's overuse of Waltzing Matilda in his musical score also ends up boring the senses. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're doomed! Doomed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kramer is to subtlety what Satan is to decency. In "On the Beach", Kramer uses all his powers of stating-the-obvious to inform us that nuclear weapons are bad. Real bad.Glossy, immaculate and straining to be "prestigous", "On the Beach" opens with most of planet Earth already decimated. Following an accidentally triggered nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, humanity's survivors congregate in the southern hemisphere. Here they slowly die; radiation is killing off man's last vestiges.At its best, "On the Beach" boasts an unusual premise, a palatable sense of doom, several haunting sequences evocative of early Antonioni ("Red Desert", "Eclipse") and a fine performance by the soon-to-be forever typecast Anthony Perkins. It also embodies all of Kramer's worst qualities. It is self-righteous, self-congratulatory, hides banal platitudes behind an air of faux "sophistication" and, like most of Kramer's films, believes that "serious subject matter" is inherently "more artistic". Like Steven Spielberg, Kramer makes hokey "serious movies" which mostly miss the points of the topics they're "about". There's also something tasteless about such a self-pitying film aimed at the only nation to ever actually use nukes on human beings."The trouble is, you want a simple answer!" a character in "Beach" states, before providing a simple explanation as to why nuclear weapons are bad news. "Everybody had an atomic bomb, and counter-bombs, and counter-counter bombs! The devices outgrew us; we couldn't control them! Somewhere, some poor bloke probably looked at a radar screen and thought he saw something. He knew that if he hesitated for a second that his own country would be wiped off the map. So he pushed a button and the world went crazy!" In one sense, the character is right. Nukes and nuclear arms races are stupid. But the whole race to build nukes stemmed from old fashioned, early 20th century Imperialism. This accelerated in the 1940s. Here, the British Admiralty, America, Germany, France and later Russia, all began designing neo-weapons so as to maintain their colonies, maintain their Imperialist designs and counter the weapons of their foes. World War 2, of course, then ended with Japan nuked, India and Pakistan split (both would become nuclear powers), Israel born (a nuclear power), France, the US and Britain victorious (all nuclear powers), Russia barricaded and Germany and her Allies crushed. The victors of this conflict then set about looting the planet, making more nukes and conquering the Third World. They also forced upon the weaker nations conditions which prevented them from creating nukes or indeed even conventional armies. This was all sold as "benevolent policing", but really marked a shift into a new form of colonialism.But the point is: the imperialism which ushers the creation of nukes is also achieved without nukes, today the possession of nukes protects smaller nations from imperialism (no country with nuclear weapons has ever suffered a serious attack), and the imperialism spurring the creation of nukes already does more damage than the damage caused by nukes themselves (humans are already dying, for example, to poverty related starvation at the rate of one atomic bomb being dropped on a densely populated area every 3 days)."On the Beach" is specifically about a nuclear slugging match between the United States and the USSR. In real life, Russia developed her first nukes in '49, four years after the US nuked Japan. This bombing has been rationalised as "humane" and "necessary", but everyone in command at the time stated otherwise. "Japan was already defeated and dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary," Dwight Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, outright stated. "The Japanese position was hopeless even before the first atomic bomb fell," Henry Arnold, Commanding General of the USAF would say. Making this equally explicit was Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman, who said, "The use of the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender." And Admiral Chester Nimitiz, Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet: "The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan." The US' own Strategic Bombing Survey report would say: "Prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped." So why nuke Japan? Not for "protecting Americans" - most ventures by US military planners are known to decrease national security ? but to freak out Russia and prevent it impeding Western neo-imperialist designs. Fast forward several decades, and both superpowers had become expert at using each other's nuclear arsenals as bogeymen to both rally their masses and rubber-stamp more naked exploitation. With regards to the United States, economist J. K Galbraith once called this "military Keynesianism": the creation of state-guaranteed markets for high technology waste (armaments), and the using of giant arsenals to leverage policies of intervention in other economies. If nuke wielding baddies didn't exist, the Pentagon would have to invent it, because you can't look good stealing crap if there aren't bogeymen on the block. Thanks to oil and grain shortages, various embargoes and debts to foreign creditors, the Soviet Union collapsed in the late 1980s. The Cold War thus ended without a nuclear kerfuffle. Today, no leader is likely to use nukes. In politics, public fallout over nuclear fallouts keeps fingers off red buttons. Ironically, if futurologists are correct in their belief that tomorrow's economies will require nuclear energy so as to maintain their insane, accelerating growth rates, then the nuclear fallouts of the future may prove to be even more insidious: slow, wide-spread and sold to you as being 'necessary' for your very survival.5/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nuclear Holacaust As Soap Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nuclear War and the End of the World. Now there is a Depressing Thought. But there is Absolutely No Reason to make a Depressing (read detaching) Movie. The Point Can be Made with Drama and Dread, Chilling and Disturbing Images, and Thoughtful Dialog about the Why's and the Whatevers. But this is Certainly one that is Shallow and Dull with only a Modicum of Resonance and Even Less Intellect.Philosophy about Nuclear War and Humanities Propensity to Destroy is Almost Absent and in its Place We have Philosophies about Marital Infidelity and Suicide by way of a Kevorkian Escape from Pain. A Totally Misplaced Engagement. We are Dealing with Global Annihilation and the End of Human Existence, not Someone Deciding to Pull the Plug because of Cancer.There is so much to Consider in this Cold War Scenario and it is All Reduced to Soap Opera. This is one of the Most Overrated Movies of All Time that Attempts to be Meaningful about its Subject (a noble effort) and be Oh So Important. But why make it so Interpersonal. Sure Everybody has Someone They Care About and Everyone is Special. But this is a Global Scenario, not some sort of Last Backyard Barbecue of the Fifties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Many, The World Has Already Ended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My buddy did not want to watch with me my DVD of the 1959 film On the Beach, because it is a depressing end of the world drama, as absolutely no one survives a third world war, yes, humanity is extinguished.Yet in essence, upon death, the world ends for many people every day. Before you pass on you may provide for remaining friends or family, and you feel consoled by anticipating their remembrance of you. Except you simultaneously realize that eventually they will all die too, and memories will fade among their descendants.Look at world history - countless civilizations have been eliminated although monuments and numerous artifacts are extant. The movie merely speeds up this process because all remaining life soon perishes, so no one is left to take notice of these losses.Succeeding motion pictures have depicted world wide cataclysms where select individuals endure. On the Beach distinguishes itself by sparing us violent death scenes, while recognizing our mutual fate is to finally give up the ghost. Rather than loot or savage others, most people faced their own demise privately by reflecting on the meaning of one's life. This is not defeatist: when dying from an incurable disease such as radioactive poisoning, you must prepare for departure.I found myself contemplating how lead actors Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner have in real life died, so fiction became fact since their personal world actually did expire. This is the root of the sorrow I felt, and why On the Beach is paradoxically an authentic characterization, despite we the living temporarily overcoming its premise of annihilation. Sorrow is also a cause for belief in a Supreme Being who we desperately wish to save us. In the film, worshipers and non-worshipers alike fall, paralleling what occurs in reality. But if you maintain faith in an afterlife, take comfort as your being on earth concludes.On the Beach provides an invaluable commentary on our tenuous existence in this sometimes wonderful but always deadly world that sooner or later will end for all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world after a nuclear holocaust is a nice place. Off the shores of Australia in Phillip Island people live a semi-idyllic life. The illusion of peaceful living is of course a farse and a lie, which realisation slowly creeps on various inhabitants of the island.The story isn't bad in itself and has some really strong moments. I just got the feeling that the way it was presented has really become outdated and was too melodramatic lacking realism. Also the island itself doesn't convey any sort of realism. Top grade performance by most of the cast, especially Gregory Peck. Unfortunately women at the times act very stereotypically and Ava Gardner just overcooks the role.Would really like to grade this film higher, but too much of Gone With the Wind in this post-apocalyptic drama. The 4/10 mark may be bit harsh, but I am actually torn to give this movie a 6 or a 7. In the end it just wouldn't be justified, but nonetheless don't treat my review as a NO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"On The Beach" has strongly influenced my life since I saw it as a teenager on TV in the late sixties - not long after the film was set. Some scenes are spectacular, others are historically significant and some are really painful - especially where a group of Aussie blokes sing a Walting Matilda marathon that lasts all day and into the night. I'm sure that scene was designed to make suicide seem a very attractive option for the impending future.I like the encouraging closing sentiment for the viewing audience. We are no less likely to wipe out the world nowadays, whether through Global Warming &amp; Dimming or nuclear catastrophe, but the window of opportunity for preventative action is closing fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gregory Peck struggles against temptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the Beach is noteworthy for its depiction of the repressed sexuality that characterized entertainment in the '50s. The story's hero, with the Eisenhoweresque moniker Dwight Lionel Tower (Gregory Peck), will do practically anything to avoid a good lay.A nuclear holocaust has destroyed most of civilization. Commander Tower and his crew aboard the submarine USS Sawfish have been prowling the oceans for signs of life. The atomic death cloud hasn't yet spread to Melbourne, Australia, where the movie begins. Tower has been confined for weeks or months to a submarine with only men. The first woman he sees is the voluptuous Moira (Ava Gardner). She is clearly on the make, but Tower is standoffish. We learn that his wife and two children were vaporized. He clings to the delusion that his family still lives. He suffers wrenching humiliation when he accidentally calls Moira "Sharon," the name of his dead wife.Moira does everything but give the commander a lap dance, but he is steadfast in his determination to remain loyal to his dead wife. We get to see Peck's familiar facial twitches as he struggles with the urge to give in to Moira's considerable charms.With Commander Tower telling the crew every move to make, the Sawfish embarks on a journey to find out if the lethal cloud has spread to the Arctic North. A good chunk of the movie is devoted to this expedition, which confirms that the Sawfish crew and the citizens of Melbourne may be the only survivors.Returning to Melbourne weeks later, Commander Tower comes to his senses and rushes into the arms of Miora. By the time we see Peck and Gardner frozen in a 10-second lip lock, the song "Waltzing Matilda" has been playing in a loop from the beginning and the viewer's patience has likely worn thin. But press on we must.For a brief interlude, we get to see how a guy might act when the world is coming to an end and he's lucky enough to have a beautiful new woman in his life. Tower seems to actually be enjoying himself.It is perfectly understandable that Tower would then tear himself away from Moira to be with his men, who have elected to return to the homeland, even if it has been engulfed in the toxic cloud. It makes perfect sense because sex is no big deal to this type of '50s movie hero. He'll jump at the chance to go back aboard the submarine with his men.With "Waltzing Matilda" sawing away one last time, Moira watches from the shore as the Sawfish departs Melbourne for the grim death that awaits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I hear "Waltzing Matilda" again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who sees this film is likely to never want to hear "Waltzing Matilda" for as long as they have the power to run away or face the enemy by destroying the source of the music with a hammer. Just because most of the movie focuses in and around Australia the decision had been made to squeeze the last drop out of the tune, which has real Chinese-torture potential. Australians themselves are portrayed as happy-go-lucky drunks who sing "Waltzing Matilda" for a whole day, every day! Needless to say, this melody is also a very poor choice for an end-of-the-world drama.This is quite an uneven film. The first half is much weaker than the second half, with the (silent) scenes on the US West coast being the best parts of the movie. There is too much romance - considering the circumstances. Peck is solid as a high-ranking Navy guy, Perkins is totally miscast as another Navy guy (he is neither tough nor heterosexual-looking; the Navy may have gays but they don't LOOK like gays), and Gardner does another one of her "I'm so drunk and spontaneous" shticks; additionally, she does a somewhat pathetic "I'm not worthy of you" routine in her relationship with Peck.Hollywood does a rather "romanticized" variation on the post-Nuclear War world, so some of the things in the film strike me as quite na?ve, but the b&amp;w-ness and the gradual impending doom do combine to create a mood and keep the interest going. There was a "oh, come on...!" moment when it turned out that Gardner and the ancient Astaire had an affair once. When?! When he was 30 and she was 11?For an even more unpopular IMDb comment, check out my "Der Untergang" review (1 out of 178).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviews are generally good for this, but the negative ones I've found to be pretty unfair. Yes, this is a gloomy topic - every movie wasn't made to watch with a date on Friday night. Yes, the Australian accents are bad - but it's 1960. I find movies like Amadeus where Germans talk with British accents to be much more distracting. You see more risible movies every day at the cinema. There's less to mock here than detractors would have you believe. More problematic is the movie's polite absence of even a single dead body, or any disorder in the empty streets. They just subtracted the people and traffic from otherwise normal streets. No one died in delirium walking the streets, or at their jobs. Granted the empty city scenes are better than those in 'The Mouse the Roared.' I rented this thinking, 'I've already seen the last hour of it. Gregory Peck is a stiff, chilly actor. This probably isn't going to be good.' I expected to be mocking it here. But after seeing it, I'd watch this ten or twenty times before I'd watch The Longest Day again. Peck, Gardner and Perkisn are all decent. Astaire is not as annoying as he would become yet. It steers clear of the super-maudlin melodrama which Towering Inferno (another later Astaire role) fails to do. And of course as everyone notes, the photography is very good.The hoo-haa with Anthony Perkins and wife overacting their "feelings" is pretty bad. How do men pick women so dumb/delicate they need the logistics of the end of the world explained to them? Or rather, why do movies continually foist this woman on us? I don't kow any women this dense.Keep your eyes peeled for a silly, surreal scene where a fisherman has a conversation with a submarine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling heart breaking story of the end of the world as the result of nuclear war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie at a suburban picture theater as a teenager in Brisbane, Queensland after its release in 1959. It is a sobering view of how the world could have ended if the two post super WW11 powers had actually clashed in a nuclear war.I never imagined in my life that such an event could ever happen, (but it nearly did in reality as the result of the Cuba crisis three years later), which is the inspirational substance of this great movie. I noted the calender shown within this movie as 1964. What a great close forecast at the time of such an impending event.I watched it again last night on Pay TV and my appreciation of its message of over 50 years ago conveys to me the great fragility of which our own mortal kind, exists in this uncertain world of today, and seems to be bent on descending into an eternal disaster of terrorism and destruction.Set in my own home country Australia, it features the ever capable magnificent Gregory Peck as American submarine commander Towers arriving with his ship No. 623 in Melbourne, before the worldwide cataclysm of descending lethal radiation from a nuclear war, which has already engulfed the northern hemisphere will finally reach the shores of our down under happy go lucky continent and all oblivious to our citizens of this unavoidable maelstrom.Enter Anthony Perkins as Australian Naval Lieutenant Peter Holmes with his devoted wife, Mary (played lovingly by Donna Anderson ) with their daughter Jennifer, and then the appearance of the lovely Ava Gardner (Moira), as an Aussie liaison officer who ultimately indulges in a passionate affair with Peck in a doomed but magical relationship in the beginning of the end for the time they have left. Ava was outstanding in her role in this movie.And also the unusual part of Fred Astaire as Julian, more known for his outstanding song and dance man roles on American stage scenes, playing in this instance the off beat down trodden racing car scientist aboard the submarine, delegated to provide an assessment of the remainder of the time to come, before it becomes necessary for those left to end their lives with prescription pills. Great emotional drama of an event which shows how our own race can be so destructive to the point where leaders can display their selfish principles in pursuit of power, decide the worth of their personal living, and ultimately those of the fate of their own kind.Very tear jerking scene towards the end in which Lt. Holmes and wife Mary confront the final plight of their lives together and re-affirm their vows of genuine love for each other.This movie was derived from the talents of absolutely brilliant novelist Nevil Shute who wrote the original book, translated into a magnificent production and direction by Stanley Kramer with the added musical tune of our proud now alternative national theme "Waltzing Matilda" played at those important intervals to such effect, which just makes this movie click perfectly.P.S. I have a minor connection to this film through my brother in law who is Spanish by birth and was a very young refugee of the Civil War in his country in 1936. Twice he tried to stowaway on board a ship to the U.S. but was discovered and returned home. He later stowed to Australia, and accepted as an immigrant refugee, got a job as a dishwasher in a high class Melbourne Restaurant in the early 1950's. Through hard work he was eventually promoted to head drink table waiter and was personally assigned to serving Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, and Anthony Perkins who regularly dined there after their daily filming roles for this movie.Ava Gardner made it quite clear to the management of the restaurant that she would only dine there if my brother in law (Tony) would be her personal waiter. He did well in salary and tips for that recommendation.I believe she had a great attraction for Spanish gentlemen, well reflected in some of the movies she made during her time.There is a street in the Melbourne suburb of Berwick where a lot of this filming took place, and under development at that time, and had her name - Gardner Street - placed up in the honor of her contribution to the role she played in this local production. Even Stanley Kramer got his last name on a street there for his contribution.Great movie, well done in black and white - watch it and see for yourself. You wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RE: "On The Beach") -- My father was a career US Army officer and he thought I was "wasting my life" on "science fiction". At the age of about 10-15, I tried to explain that THIS was science fiction, while he was arguing that it was "potentially" factual-actual. I could never get him to distinguish the difference, even until his death, and we were never friends for years because I was "wasting my time" on "skiffy", while I devoted my life to seeing to it that it didn't happen. (He didn't like "Dr. Strangelove" at all and consoled my little brother and me that "Fail-Safe" was pure fiction and couldn't happen, either -- the former being farce and the latter impossible ...)Now I write and illustrate SF for a living. "Wasting my life" indeed!This is the purest -- and scariest -- science fiction novel (and movie!) I have ever experienced! "ALIEN" was cool -- THIS is scary s*h*i*t, kids, because it's 17 minutes into your potential future! (As is Fail-Safe)Don't let it happen because our parents' world hated everyone else in the world who didn't agree with their point of view. There are really *bad* people out there -- but as some clever wag pointed out, we are opposing parties standing in a room full of gasoline up to our knees. One has four matches, the other has five. (Now there may be three or four who have one or two as well.) If only one scratches a match, who wins?My little brother retired as a full-fledged USAF pilot, I respect and admire his service (and my dad's and all military vets), but they preserved my right to speak against policies I disagree with. Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) should not be ANY nation's foreign policy.Not all Americans are blind to what happened on Nov. 22, 1963!

		<fullReview>I love the book. It is simply told yet deeply moving, and the characters feel like real people we all could know.But the movie, in spite of its skilled cast falls far short. Each of the characters has a unique way of dealing with the crises at hand, which forces their emotions into the background, but only just below the surface. But only the two female leads, Moira and Mary, bring this out in their performances. The male leads are all too uptight, with the emotion which should be boiling just below the surface held too much in check. As the actors themselves are terrific in other roles, I blame the director...But the real failure in this movie is the musical score. It relies nearly entirely on "Waltzing Matilda" and fails miserably to convey any drama or sense of emotion relating to the individual scenes. Worse, it becomes downright annoying by the end.This is a great story, and I hope it gets remade someday because this version was a huge letdown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Should a twelve year old be exposed to the concept of nuclear apocalypse? This movie haunted me from 1960 until late March of 1974, when I was driving into San Francisco from the east early on Sunday morning.There was a popular TV show at the time with Michael Douglas and Karl Maulden called The Streets of San Francisco. That's not the picture I had in my mind, it was something else, more sinister. The streets were absolutely deserted: no tourists, no traffic, no trolleys. It was just like that movie On the Beach, when the submarine Swordfish sailed into San Francisco harbor to investigate a strange radio message. In that movie, the streets were totally void of life, too.It wasn't until after noon that the tourist shops finally opened up on Fisherman's Wharf and an old man at a crab shack enlightened me. A perfect storm of urban terror and dysfunction had hit 'Frisco all at once.1. The Zodiac Killer was looming large. 2. Patty Hearst and the Symbionese Liberation Army were running amuck. 3. The bay sanitation workers were on strike (no fishing on the docks.) 4. Bay Area Rappid Transit (BART) workers were on strike.So I decided to head back to the relative safety of Idaho, but I still had to run the nightmarish gauntlet of just-tripled gas prices (from 25 to 75 cents/gallon) and the new, oppressive double nickle speed limit.But that's another IMDb movie review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Mild and Restrained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>5 out of 10 Nuclear war was waged and the entire northern hemisphere was annihilated. The nuclear cloud has not yet reached Australia nor did it hit the American crew of a underground water sub. The rest of the film revolves around these people and the adjustment to the inevitable. This is indeed a rather unique nuclear war movie. There is no billowing mushroom clouds here. Australian society seems to continue to run in a very orderly fashion even after the knowledge that half the world is gone and they are next. Everyone seems to remain very civilized and accepting to their fate. There is no panic, no rage, no madness, no looting or even general chaos. There isn't even a mention of a underground shelter. Maybe there would be a segment of society that might respond to their impending doom in this fashion, but by making it like everybody would be this way seems to be giving us a very limited scope of the true situation. The film also has a rather odd view of the landscape in a nuclear aftermath. Peck and his crew venture back up to the American shores. Yet there is no dark clouds, no cold temperatures, no destroyed buildings or even a dead body or two. The sun is shining and San Francisco looks as beautiful as ever except that it is completely empty. Yes viewing the empty streets (and a very empty Golden Gate Bridge) does give off a certain eerie and surreal feeling, but it certainly doesn't coincide with any of the accounts of a nuclear winter that I've read about. The film also concentrates on too few characters who are, by and large, not very interesting. Only Gardner, as a lonely and desperate woman, comes off as memorable. Peck seems even stiffer than he usually is. Having him go on normally even after knowledge that his whole family has been killed seems more inhuman than stoic. Astaire, in his first dramatic role, isn't too good either. He seems unable to exude the deep cynicism that his part demands. He also takes part in a car race. There are some shots of him driving his car with the other cars driving behind and around him. It was done , or course, in front of a blue screen and it has to rate as one of the poorest and most obvious blue screen format shots ever seen. The movie could have used a little more of a dark sense of humor and not been it so achingly serious. There is some attempts at humor, but it is very weak. It would have also been nice to see everyones reactions when they first heard the news instead of just starting off well after it has soaked in. The film also has a bad tendency at falling into a soap opera type mentality. Yes the very nature of the story makes it compelling, but it is too slow and restrained to be really powerful. The intent is to make it thought provoking and even a cry for action. Yet it is so unrelenting and maudlin that when it is all over all you want to do is forget about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nuclear doomsday machine not mentioned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write because this 1959 movie contains no mention of a dooms day machine--not even in Fred Astaire's nuclear physicist soliloquy--and there is no Special Features section which explains that this film is NOT about a nuclear war: it is about a nuclear war in which a nuclear doomsday machine has been detonated, hence the end of the world. Further, it is clear from other comments that IMDb readers do not realize this distinction and do not realize that the world can be destroyed: I quote:Times Online August 08, 2007 Dr Strangelove and the real Dooms day machine by Christopher Coker P. D. SmithDOOMSDAY MEN The real Dr Strangelove and the dream of the super weapon 552pp. Allen Lane. ?20. 9 78 071 399815 3...Smith's study is the gripping, untold story of the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, which first came to public attention in 1950 when the Hungarian-born scientist Leo Szilard made a dramatic announcement on radio: science was on the verge of creating a Doomsday Bomb. For the first time in history, mankind would soon have the ability to destroy all life on the planet. The shock wave from this statement reverberated across the following decade and beyond.What Szilard had in mind was the third of the "alphabet bombs" that came to characterize an entire age. The first, the A-bomb, had been used to incinerate two Japanese cities. Teller's H-bomb blasted its way into public consciousness a few years later. Finally, there was the ultimate weapon: the C-bomb, a hydrogen bomb that could "transmute" an element such as cobalt into a radioactive element about 320 times as powerful as radium. A deadly radioactive cloud could be released into the atmosphere and carried by the westerly winds across the surface of the earth. Every living thing inhaling it, or even touched by it, would be doomed to certain death. In the autumn of 1950, Szilard's fears were given independent validation by Dr James R. Arnold of the Institute for Nuclear Studies in Chicago. Arnold, slide-rule in hand, had started out to debunk Szilard's arguments. He finished by publishing a set of calculations that showed that a Doomsday device, perhaps two-and-a-half times as heavy as the battleship Missouri, could indeed be built...The Cobalt bomb was largely forgotten after the Cuban Missile Crisis came and went. So too disappeared the fear of a Doomsday machine that could not be overridden by human intervention. Only after the Berlin Wall had been breached and the ice of the Cold War had begun to thaw did military analysts realize the Russians had actually built a version of the device. The details of this top-secret Soviet system were first revealed in 1993 by Bruce G. Blair, a former American ICBM launch control officer, now one of the country's foremost experts on Russian arms. Fearing that a sneak attack by American submarine-launched missiles might take Moscow out in thirteen minutes, the Soviet leadership had authorized the construction of an automated communications network, reinforced to withstand a nuclear strike. At its heart was a computer system similar to the one in Dr Strangelove. Its codename was Perimetr. It went fully operational in January 1985. It is still in place. Its job is to monitor whether there have been nuclear detonations on Russian territory and to check whether communications channels with the Kremlin have been severed. If the answer to both questions is "yes" then the computer will conclude that the country is under attack and activate its nuclear arsenal. All that is then needed is final human approval from a command post buried deep underground. It would be a brave officer, adds Smith, who, having been cut off from his superiors in the Kremlin, could ignore the advice of such a supposedly foolproof system.Bruce Blair has speculated that President Bush's September 2001 proposal for a new generation of weapons, including the robust nuclear earth penetrator, or "bunker-buster", might be intended to knock out the underground command post that controls the system. The Bush administration withdrew its request for funding for the program at the end of 2005, after facing fierce domestic opposition. Some military analysts, nevertheless, believe that research is continuing into these weapons. We all face the prospect that, if Russia were ever attacked, its strategic nuclear warheads could be launched by a computer system designed and built in the late 1970s. Those of us who think Dr Strangelove to be the most telling commentary on the nuclear age should not be surprised. To paraphrase the novelist J. G. Ballard, old or not, the system remains a vivid demonstration, arranged for our benefit by the machine, of our own as a species. http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25350-2648363,00.htmlSee also http://www.slate.com/id/2173108/pagenum/all/#page_startIn addition to this, there is the problem recounted in an article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that when scientists created the atomic bomb, they calculated the odds at about one chance in a million that such an explosion would end the world by starting a chain reaction in which sea water would separate into hydrogen and oxygen and ignite, turning our planet into a star and our solar system into a binary star system. But those calculations are now old and should be redone with a modern computer.These details need to be included in a special features section of the DVD so that viewers will not assume that On the Beach is a mere cold war relic with no modern relevance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potentially good film that get's far too "preachy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kramer was a first rate producer and a moderately talented director but he could never resist over kill. This is a well acted cautionary tale with a message from the 50's liberal point of view. Peck and Astair are particularly good. The script is literate and interesting. The science is nonsense but I was perfectly willing to suspend logic for the sake of the story. I think most everyone is the theatre when I saw this film all those years ago "got it" early in the playing time. The banner flapping in the breeze that seemed to stick with several people was just plain silly! My feeling at the time was essentially, "Yeah, Stan, WE ALREADY UNDERSTOOD!" When I saw the film in '59 a segment of the audience actually laughed at that closing shot. It would have been far more powerful had the shot been the same, but without the banner. That would have prompted some thought. Certainly well worth seeing, but it is a flawed film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a fair excuse to say that "You had to be there" to appreciate fully the impact of this film, but in fact you had to be there, or more grammatically "you have to have been there" to get it right. The atmosphere of fatalism and gloom in the '50s and '60s permeated life. You can't appreciate it until you see a "fallout shelter" or this film.I remember how utterly shattering it was to see the outcome of the discovery in San Diego that had given so much false hope, and I still say "There's still time, Brother" when I see a lost cause. Never mind all the goofs in plot and continuity, the arc of the film is simple: you develop sympathy for the main characters as they come to a realization that they are doomed, you watch their coming to terms (or not) with the inevitable, you feel for them in their end. Simple, really. All this is done through drama, without special effects that will age gracelessly.The "end-of-life-as-we-know-it" scenes are chilling. Gregory Peck is flawless, Ava Gardner is convincing, Fred Astaire is creditable except for the absurd scene on the racetrack that strains suspension of disbelief beyond breaking. Do I need to explain to other reviewers why Anthony Perkins does not play a convincing heterosexual lover?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of the movie didn't make any sense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler On the Beach?so much about this movie is bad. First, I'll touch on the positives about this movie: Ava Gardener is 37 years old and is smoking hot; thanks to a white one-piece bathing suit you can see Dona Anderson's nipples; you also get to see Gregory Peck grab Gardener's ass a couple of times; Gregory Peck's acting is phenomenal; still can't get over how hot Gardener and Anderson were; Australia is beautiful (even in black &amp; white); and the submarine shots are awesome.Now I'll get to why I rated this film so low. The movie takes place in Australia, but no-one has an Australian accent. Anthony Perkins's character is supposed to have been a born and bred Aussie, but doesn't even pretend to have a hint of an accent. Anthony Perkins and his wife have a child that they always hover over, yet we never see the child and it never makes a sound. Fred Astaire commits suicide by inhaling carbon monoxide fumes, while in a garage that is not sealed. That's right, the wooden garage door has an inch gap between every wooden board and there is a shot of an open window. There is a scene where the sub, which is supposed to be nuclear, but is clearly diesel, explores a bombed out San Francisco bay. When we see the bombed out city, there is no damage?seriously everything is intact. Now I understand this was made in 1959, but come on have some common sense. Not everyone is going to die from radiation poisoning. Look at Japan and how many people survived the bombings in WW2. Wouldn't there be other submarines underwater? Wouldn't the US president been in his secure facility? I could go on for hours, but I don't want to spoil the movie. The chemistry between Gardener and Peck is very believable, but there is zero chemistry between Perkins and Anderson. Also, watchers beware this movie has a lot of homosexual overtures, but they may have just been the type of humor they had in the late '50's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic, poignant, unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you knew you were going to die, that everyone was going to die, how would you say good-bye to the world? What would you want to do one last time, while there's still a chance? Win one more race, even if you were killed trying? Catch one last fish? Fall in love one more time? Or just go home? Quite simply, this is my favorite Stanley Kramer film. It is dated, perhaps a bit melodramatic, certainly not plausible from a scientific standpoint. But it is also an unforgettable portrait of people bravely continuing life, a tragedy in slow motion.I won't reveal the somewhat thin plot here. It's not really necessary anyway; as the end is clearly explained at the beginning: the world is over, they are all going to die and there's nothing they can do about it. All that can be done is to face the fear, each in his own way.Rather, the strength of this film is not in the story, but in the moving performances by its stellar cast, each of whom portrays exactly the character they were meant for. Gregory Peck is stoic and stolid as the commander of the submarine that is all that's left of America. Ava Gardner turns to alcohol in facing the end as Moira, an aging beauty. Anthony Perkins, still a year from his infamous role as psycho Norman Bates, is convincingly innocent as a young naval officer, trying to be brave, but helpless to save his wife and baby. And Fred Astaire, in his first non-musical dramatic role, shines as he confronts his inevitable death with a last grasp for life. Even minor characters, from Admiral Birdie and his secretary, to the waiter at the club, are perfectly believable as doomed souls putting the best face on things that they can."On the Beach" is an under-appreciated film, simple yet profoundly poignant, that will leave you stunned long after it ends. One warning: once you see it, you will never --EVER-- hear "Waltzing Matilda" the same way again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional film...except for the casting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"On the Beach" is an exceptional and grim film--one I strongly recommend. However, before I get to the good (and there's a lot of good), I can't help but bring up the film's biggest shortcoming--the casting of Americans in roles that by all rights SHOULD have gone to Australian actors. Of the Americans pretending to be Aussies, at least Anthony Perkins attempts an accent. It's bad and he forgets it a lot, but at least he tried. But what about the rest? Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire?! Now I loved both of them in the film--they were great and convincing Americans...but they were not cast as Americans! Why did they feel a need to do this? It took an otherwise realistic film and deadened the impact.The film is a grim apocalyptic film about worldwide nuclear contamination as a result of an all-out nuclear war. You assume it was the US and USSR, but the film never says--not a bad decision, as it could have also involved other countries, but as they later said in the film, does it really matter who started it?! After all, the entire planet is paying the price. However, it is not in a manner many would assume--it is NOT a planet blown to pieces, but a cloud of radioactivity that very slowly spreads that wiped out the human race. By the beginning of the film, an American sub is in Australia--one of the last parts of the world still alive--as the Northern hemisphere is apparently dead. And, sadly, it appears as if it's only a matter of time until the cloud spreads everywhere and no one is left.In light of this impending death, Gregory Peck (who is in command of the sub) takes it on an expedition to find out if there are signs of life. While the cities are intact, the people all are apparently dead. So the rest of the film is an extremely well written and well acted waiting game...waiting for the seemingly inevitable end.Some may see this as a "left-wing" film, however, nuclear annihilation was a serious worry back in 1959 and so the film does not seem unduly alarmist--just a call to everyone about how serious and deadly nuclear war could be. And I assume no one--not even the craziest of the crazies--would want that! Unrelentingly grim yet compelling--a wonderful but sad film. Too bad the casting was so bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting carries this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nuclear war has killed everybody in the world--except for Australia. However it's just a matter of time before the radiation hits and kills them also. This movie focuses on certain people there. There's Cmdr. Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck), whose wife and children are most certainly dead, being romanced by married, alcoholic Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner). Then there's Lt. Cmdr. Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins) and wife Mary (Donna Andrson) who just had a baby. She doesn't want to accept reality and he's trying to force her to. There's race car driver Julian Osborne (Fred Astaire!) who is very negative and complains nonstop about it.In 1959 this was considered quite shocking. There was no happy ending and it seemed nuclear war could happen any day. Now it's terribly dated. The script is OK but we've seen these characters and situations before. They're all clichés and it's pretty obvious how things will end. It's also too long and I was bored. Still the acting is great. No one is bad in this one. Astaire and Perkins even fake credible Australian accents. There's also very effective use of "Waltzing Matilda" throughout. All in all I was bored and knew exactly how things were going to end. Still the acting in this makes it work--somewhat. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that captures the essence of Nevil Shute's great novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about the end of the world is going to be neither happy or have one coming out of the cinema with a big beaming grin on one's face, but then On The Beach was never meant to be that kind of novel or film, and it was very courageous of Stanley Kramer to make a film about just that subject. I have read Nevil Shute's excellent novel and I found it tremendously moving for it is about ordinary people facing an extra-ordinary, and very tragic, event namely the end of the world. John Paxton's screenplay, for the most part, captures the essence of Nevil Shute's great novel, even though, as with most screenplays, he takes certain liberties, namely the end of the story, which in the book has Moira taking the tablets whilst sitting in her car, after Dwight has departed. This has a grim finality that, for some reason, Mr Paxton changed, although the banner reading,' Brother, there is still time', is inspired. Mr Paxton also blows up the romance between Dwight and Moira into Hollywood proportions, which tends to defeat the exercise rather, and the over-use of Waltzing Matilda becomes annoying to say the least. It would have been much better to have brought it in for the final few moments of the film, and give the excellent Ernest Gold full control of the rest of the score. The casting, for the most part, is excellent; Gregory Peck is excellent as Dwight, as are Fred Astaire, a very young and unspoilt Anthony Perkins, and Donna Anderson, but Ava Gardner is rotten as Moira, totally miscast and out of her depth. The film has some very chilling scenes; the deserted San Franciso and the Power Company, the lone sailor fishing who has chosen to die in his home city, and here, Mr Kramer has added a touch of humour with the appearance of the periscope appearing and a conversation ensuing between Dwight and the sailor, the deserted streets of the Australian city and, of course that banner. A very brave and commendable attempt to bring to life a classic novel that almost comes off. I think all war mongers should see this film, it is just as timely today as it was then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I largely agree with burp-2 (see below). The Aussie accents attempted by Hollywood's finest (Perkins, Astaire, Anderson) were atrocious and very distracting. Ava G didn't even bother trying. She just looked scrumptious and trotted out her lines in her annoying all-American drawl. What a waste of a great idea this movie was. The end of the world is something that would have interested everyone then (and still should now) but this meandering morality play went nowhere: except - amazingly enough in the space of two hours or so - from Melbourne to San Francisco, then back to Australia, then back to the States again (and who can blame them for wanting to?). Plus, why wasn't it shot in colour? The seedy looking greys 'on the beach' looked particularly insipid. Kramer obviously had no interest in Australia other than as just a cheap shooting lot (as it is for so many American directors today). Apart from a few brief shots of real people in Flinders Street in Melbourne (which were quite impressive), the Aussie 'characters' simply stood in as cardboard cutout cameos. And that incessant wailing of Waltzing Matilda by the cartoon drunks. Purlease. If you want to see more realistic movie portrayals of Australians of yesteryear, try A Town Like Alice, Picnic At Hanging Rock or even Les Patterson Saves The World.

		<fullReview>I never saw this until recently, despite its supposedly sexy allure.I came to it because of its Australian connection, and discovered that it was intended to be deep by mining deep fears. In that, it is similar to "The Day the Earth Stood Still," which I recently saw. That was unfortunate because I nearly applied the same reaction to this. That was so dependent on the fears of the time that it really has no effect today. None at all. I can tell you that those fears were real, visceral and for some among us, prominent enough to shape lives.This is different because like many films, it imposes great "political" events on personal lives. And it digs into those lives like few other Hollywood pictures of the era. You trace three stories. One is of a young couple with an infant. Another is of a scientist, now a drunk who is incapable of a relationship. And then you have the foreground situation of the main couple. Its a pretty complicated situation they portray. Unfortunately they are poor actors. But it still comes across: hunger.Browsing through the comments, one would think that love has something to do with the urges here, the tensions. No, its about the urge for home. All the personal stories are about home, and the tragic end has our sailors ? doomed and knowing it ? deciding to head for home to die. Our captain is on board, not because he cares about the destination, but because his duty is as the father of the floating castle.Events occur throughout that initially seem odd, but that register through this lens.So it works in a sort of clinical way. You can see all the urges as if the wires were made visible. But because we do not fear the specific threat this depends on, we lose the blood of the pull.We stay in Melbourne.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching political / historical nuclear war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'On the Beach' is one of the typical 1950s films with a political message about nuclear war and the effects that it has upon society and the world. The message is quite evident, particularly at the end among the dying society. An empty street has a few banners hanging that read something similar to 'There is still hope.' The film follows the lives of a few people in their dying days, and through their final moments, we realise what they each enjoyed out of life. One of the young men finds romance. Another spends his time with his young wife and their baby. Another decides to spend his last moments with a racing car that he bought and enjoyed winning a race in, which was probably the happiest moment of his life. Based on the aftermath of a nuclear war, this is obviously a sad film. I would not recommend this film to those who are overly-sensitive about films with sad endings. However, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys older films and films with a political and historical significance. I thought that the film was a good portrayal of society in these circumstances, and I thought that the talent involved in the film was excellent. There was also some great cinematography here, and I think it succeeded in getting some people concerned about what was going on.</fullReview>

Eva Gardner's performance is especially noteworthy, as she captures the essence of an alcoholic who has just about given up on life, and finally finds love.But the script has lines of people waiting for their suicide pills, and the some key characters taking their own lives.

I remained especially impressed by the brilliant performances of the young couple: Anthony Perkins (hard 2 overtake) &amp; effective Donna Anderson (I haven't seen very much of her). The story is awesome (but it should B regarded much more as a warning than as a real story): the world (&amp; Humanity) has been the great victim of the last (surely the last) world war.Many people say at this point that the plot pays no attention 2 who &amp; what started it all: it doesn't really matter, the result would B the same &amp; the main starter is anyway Mankind, that has destroyed itself. Some may say this is a very sad film. Of course, I partially agree: it's a serious warning 'bout a serious matter, &amp; 4 being effective it must B as chilling &amp; moving as possible. The main problem that I find is the "connection" between the general (nuclear threat come true) &amp; particular (love affair of the starring couple), paying the script very much more attention 2 this than 2 that. I think it's, perhaps, 4 demonstrating the real "last choice" of a woman like Moira (Ava Gardner), single in mid-age &amp; alcoholic, &amp; the widower Lieutenant (Gregory Peck). The last thing I'd like 2 say at this point is an answer 2 the critics that this movie received Bcause of its endin': it's not as sad &amp; tragic as it seems: like a warnin', the final message ("There is still time, brother") is 4 us, the audience.

		<fullReview>And On the Beach is probably the only thing that could make one sick of hearing it. This film is about the impending nuclear destruction of Australia. The rest of the world is already gone. We spend the last few months of life on Earth in the company of a navy man and his wife (Anthony Perkins and Donna Anderson), their sister (Ava Gardner), a scientist with a guilty conscience (Fred Astaire), and an American sub captain whose family died (Gregory Peck). By the film's end, only one of these characters appeared human to me, the one played by Anthony Perkins. The rest seemed underdeveloped.Most of the fault rests in a morbid desire for melodrama. Just how many Gone With the Wind style kisses do we need to see between Peck and Gardner? Little with the human characters rings true. And whatever power there could be in the film is absolutely ruined by the constant score. It never knows what it is doing, and it is too strong almost everywhere you hear it. Silence goes a long way, and the couple of scenes where there is silence, especially the scene where Perkins talks to his wife for the last time (although the music does eventually crop up there, too), are powerful.And it's not just that the film is dated. I can deal with dating. It's just not a very well made film to begin with. All the great films that deal with this subject are science fiction, and I suppose that, since sci-fi is never taken seriously enough, this was provided as an alternative. Dr. Strangelove does a lot more to show us the absurdity of nuclear war. Maybe the best anti-nuclear sci-fi was made before this, The Day the Earth Stood Still. The best film that shows both the absurdity of nuclear war and the absurdity of the human race in general would not come for 9 years, but when it did it would be called Planet of the Apes, a much maligned film which ought to be considered one of the best ever made. On the Beach should not. 6/10</fullReview>

If it just uses the ambient air, then that one was already filled with radiation before that homesick set off to go back home to die.

But I completely hated this film. Well acted and reasonably well directed, however the pace is so leaden that you will wish for death twenty minutes in. The director gets sidetracked by tons of pointless sub-plots that don't go anywhere. It is also not nearly as chilling as many of the other cold war films of the 1960s. Oh and maybe two or three of the "austrailians" actually have Aussie accents. Oh and after viewing this film, you will never want to hear the song "waltzing matilda" ever again.

		<fullReview>The movie on the beach is not as intimidating as one might suspect given the premise that the end of the world is actually upon us.The inability to provide more than just a walk-thru landscape allows for a rather difficult premise to remain rather difficult to place.How indeed can you place this rather end time thinking without the proof that this indeed is the end.The illusion is not as convincing as perhaps you would like to think however that is not what sold this picture.The suggestion that what sold this picture was a real political idea about the use of nuclear weapons and the ultimate outcome that that would provide for.The clever idea here is how in fact to convey such a catastrophe while still keeping the audiences attention.This film with all its promises and threats and so on does not provide for a belief in the end time,weather that be of devine guidance or by the hand of the evil of this world.It is largely a failure in that regard as the end so it would seem can not be realized.That I believe is what the Peck character attempts to convey in a event that is in fact not believed in,in that way it is not so simple now is it?However dramatic the storyline and indeed it would seem to hold promise as a popular idea as witness to the fact that this was a motion picture with some pretty big names as well as pretty big ideas it simply provides more a background then a reality in this promise of the end time.The result of this kind of mis-direction has a point about what would be represented if indeed such would be the case and in fact the end of the world would be upon us.There is,what I called a study in failure and I think that is what this film is about.The failure of love to triumph over evil,the failure of life to triumph over death and ultimately the inability to change the outcome.This is not only about what is not believed in but what is not believable.We see in the Perkins romance that type of picture developing with the need to see death to the end.Be reminded that it is death that is escorting us through this film and all the while we feel bored though there may be a knot in your stomach.This is to allow the reader a glimpse into the psychology of this film and view it somewhat without care,because it does not care and were we to take this too seriously I would want to remind the reader that we are in fact witnesses to a shameful illusion.However that does not seem to stop the ways of a desperate world as Ava Gardner makes very real, it is sometimes said that she gets what she deserves,that seems not to matter because when it does matter no one will know the difference.I don't think that premise is as workable as one would hope but there is no hope,you see this is the end.The end is about being defeated and in being seen as being defeated.The end like the study in failure is meaningless because it is the end of the world and that is what takes the life of the Astaire character.If in the reading of this review you as a reader ever felt as if something terrifying were approaching your consciousness,perhaps like the end of life due to the onset of Nuclear annihilation it is what this film attempted to convey in a overly dramatic portrayal.The stumbling block is of more than just believability it is of War as this worlds answer to the end.The result to all this is that for one reason or another the promoters sought our cooperation and assistance in the making of this film and as well received that through awards and profits and all kinds of self important considerations and anyway the point being that this is reality and reality is agreed with.We seemingly are going to mastermind our own demise weather we like or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Scientist and film lover, I have never accepted the basic idea of this film. Though well acted, the idea that several thousand reasonably intelligent people would put themselves to sleep, permanently, to avoid deadly radiation just doesn't make sense.Clearly, there had to be options. And this is the reason why good authors, like author Neville Shute, should consult Scientist before coming up with such a preposterous story line.Even if such a war had been fought with Cobalt warheads, there would still be optionActing= 10 Story line= 0</fullReview>
