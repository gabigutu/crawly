		<shortDescription>Excellent, but probably the most depressing movie I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nightmares are very personal things. Probably because I was in the military at a time when nuclear war seemed more probable than it does now I occasionally had nightmares involving nuclear weapons - the end of all things I hold dear. Regardless of what that says about me, it is a problem that has not been resolved with the end of the Cold War.I had read some negative reviews about Showtime's remake of the classic picture, so I wasn't sure it was worth watching. That was a mistake as large as the one that frames "On the Beach." This version far surpasses the original in presentation, depth of character, and, of course, effects.Quite simply, "On the Beach" is the story of the crew of the last surviving American submarine, an Australian Naval officer, and that officer's wife and friends. A nuclear holocaust has created a cloud of radioactive dust that destroyed all life in the Northern hemisphere and is gradually making its way south. Worse, the Australian survivors have a good idea of when the radioactivity will arrive and kill them. When it does, humanity, and presumably most other life, will vanish from the planet. We may as well not have existed.I've felt up until now that the 1959 classic with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner was the most depressing film ever made. However, director Russell Mulcahy and an excellent cast including Armande Assante, Rachel Ward, and Grant Bowler make the 1959 version seem stilted and pale by comparison. This remake - perhaps reinterpretation is a better word - gives the characters a depth that now seems missing in the original film. Commander Towers displays an increasing disorientation as the film progresses. Moira has more to her character than that of a lush. And Lt. Holmes is clearly not happy about the time spent away from his wife who, in this version, better illuminates her increasing disconnection from the real world.Still, I find one thing missing from both films. Dylan Thomas exhorted us not to go gently into that good night. Yet Australians and Americans - at least those in Alaska - seem to have no trouble taking suicide pills (with injections for pets and children - seems like it should have been the other way around.) There is a great ethical issue in taking the pills and injections that is not explored in either version, and yet what deserves more ethical and moral debate than whether it is human, in the best sense of the term, to slip silently and uncomplainingly from life? Aside from the insanity of humanity eliminating all higher life on the planet, this lack of exploration of ethical issues is the point that most bothered me about "On the Beach."I've not read the book so I can't comment on which picture is closer to it. I will say that I think the ending of the newer version seemed at odds with Towers' character - perhaps it was merely a fantasy of Moira while she was dying, or perhaps a critical scene was deleted for timing. I hope it was not just the tendency of modern film makers to sweeten the ending! The earlier movie is much more consistent with Dwight Power's character.So. This is a movie well worth three hours of your life. Aside from occasional histrionics from Julian Osborne in both versions, it presents people going about their lives as best they can. You are left to decide the meaning behind it, as we always are as individuals. There are no simple answers here, and even the questions the movie raises aren't simple.The movie will leave you depressed. That shows you're thinking. Perhaps there's no solution to the conundrum of stellar forces, chemicals, and biologics available as weapons. Some serious thinkers have postulated that the reason we don't receive any radio signals from others in the galaxy is that civilizations reach a certain level, and then, when they have learned to unleash powers far above what evolution trained them to comprehend, destroy themselves.It's a serious thought and a serious movie. I recommend it highly. A solid 9+ from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I still get nightmares from it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 'On the Beach' on tv about 2 years ago now and I still have nightmares inspired by it. Bryan Brown, Rachel Ward, Armand Assante and Jacqueline Mckenzie are all credible actors in their own right and they all give fine performances. The film focuses around these people who come together in Australia after a world nuclear war through various predictable plot devices (see plot summary). The acting, direction and even the script don't really make an impact but it is the topic that hits home. I think the purpose of this remake is to remind the world of the horrible results of any nuclear war that could so easily take place. As an Australian, watching this is even more horrific perhaps because this is a rare movie where the world's end is focused outside the U.S.A for a change. Watch this horrific movie (really it is mini series) if you aren't scared by the "what might happen" scenario then frankly your head is in the sand.10/10 for being a very welcome piece of anti nuclear propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grimly competent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can't help but compare this to the 1959 version and it stands up pretty well. At least there are Aussies portraying Aussies. Heck, there's even Aussies portraying Americans, some sort of indication of how advanced the Australian film industry has come since those far off days of the original.I found this tv-movie more watchable than I first suspected it would be. Being Australian and made for tv I knew that there would be a very high romance factor to secure the female half of the viewing audience. And I was not disappointed in this presumption. Love interest was there in spades. True love in the form of the Holmes family, new love between Moira and Captain Towers the US sub commander, lost love between Moira and Professor Osborn (real-life married couple Rachel Ward and Brian Brown), and a more masculine love between Towers and his crew.The expedition to Alaska to investigate the mysterious message was handled well, as was each aspect in general. From the breakdown of society, to the pathos of seeing the portrayal of the end of humanity. All assisted by clear camera-work, excellent sets, competent acting (in the case of Armand Assante as Towers bordering on the very good) and a competent presentation of the "message" of nuclear doom.I note in some of the other comments here a technical question about nuclear warheads on the submarine. The most obvious goof I noticed in the movie was that there should have been no need for people to have resorted to horse and pedal power so soon. Australia being self-sufficient in crude oil and possessing refineries. This was probably not the case when Neville Shute wrote the novel in the '50's. That is just one of my own little observations.All in all a very watchable made for tv movie, even tho it be one that put a downer on the rest of my evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking. This movie lets you realise that the end of mankind is not unthinkable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would I do when I was confronted with my certain death and the end of mankind? That question was getting more and more to me when I watched On The Beach. Very confronting and on the eve of a war in Iraq, not at all unthinkable.The plot is simple: War has broke out (in this case between the US and China, but it could be Iraq or North-Korea too...) and the US strikes with nuclear weapons. Australia gets spared initially, but its inhabitants face certain death as clouds of radio active fall-out nears. Within two months, no one human will be alive. Unless... There is a chance that some people close to the north pole survived. An American nuclear submarine that survived the war is boarded by an Aussie liaison officer and a cynical scientist, that used to date the sister-in-law of the officer, to search for possible survivors.Not much action, but for those who like to think while watching a movie, this film will stick to you. There are story lines that resemble soap opera's. That might be true on the surface, but it is completely different when you keep in mind that they all are going to die. You feel the difficulties in the way the characters choose to die.The movie is played well, directed well and has great photography. The director uses several filming techniques that are rarely used so that the viewer gets time to think about the situation and feel the dilemma of the character.Unless you cannot bear to be confronted with your own mortality, this is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Words: Depressing and Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie depressing as hell. But I also found it haunting. I thought the acting and direction were really superb. And, by the way, I saw the original with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. If anyone thinks a remake can't approach the original in style and quality, you will change your mind when you see THIS remake. The other thought that you will mull over in your mind, as with the original, is how human beings could be so monumentally stupid as to allow this to happen. I came away from this movie with the same sensation I had after I saw the movie The Day After. Other than a few references to the nuclear war that got the cast of characters into this dilemma, the movie did not dwell on nuclear war--only the aftermath. The aftermath of such folly is what the movie DID dwell on and how a species, namely homo sapiens, become extinct. What stands out in this movie is HOW they die. Each character or couple ending their lives in their own way and on their own terms. This movie remake is a must see...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaker better than the original movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little on the long side, but the impact builds to a heartbreaking finale. Rachel Ward is spectacular as the boozy spurned woman played by Ava Gardner in the original 1959 film. This film has more emotional depth and the characters are more believably human than in that classic anti-nuclear film. However, without the Cold War raging the premise seems more imaginary than it did then, when nuclear war was an all too plausible scenario. But that puts the dramatic focus on the human story rather than the propaganda. It made me choke up a few times (but I am a softie about these things).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that is far superior to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version of ON THE BEACH has always been one of my favorite movies and I was very sceptical when I heard there was a remake, a TV version at that. In fact, the new version was so superior to the original that it took my breath away. All of the updates (like adding email and electronic broadcasting) were perfect. Also, all of the Australian characters were played by Australians (even as a kid I wondered why all the Australian characters in the original had American accents!) - except for Rachel Ward who's British but close enough. The casting was brilliant except for Armand Assante as the Sub Commander (not to mention him being about 4 inches shorter than his love interest, Rachel Ward). This role called for a Harrison Ford, or (young) Robert Mitchum or Gregory Peck type - it was the only sour note for me in the whole movie. I also don't think as many people would opt out they way they did - I think most of us will hang on to life until the bitter end - just as most terminally ill people do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too real to be science fiction?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even writing the most basic mention of On the Beach's plot involves spoilers, so I've checked the spoiler radio button and will proceed to discuss the film with minimal reservation. I won't give away the ending, however.On the Beach is based on the mid-20th century novel of the same name by Neville Shute, and offers a more elaborate and engrossing treatment of its subject than the original classic film (1959) starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire. This Showtime original is an hour longer than its predecessor, and will likely bore some of the more impatient members of its audience. Unlike most contemporary sci-fi, this is no action film, but a sombre, depressing, examination of the self-destruction of the human race through nuclear war.Never over-the-top, alarmist, or politically biased, On the Beach simply presents the stark reality of its premise, and uses finely developed characters to give context, shape and meaning, to the experience. the cast is easily equal to its predecessor, with Armand Assante and Rachel Ward particularly illuminating their roles.Assante plays an American nuclear submarine commander who has outrun the nuclear fall out and managed to surface near Australia, as that continent prepares to experience the first effects of the radiation now permeating earth's atmosphere. All around, people are preparing to die. The most sought after commodity is a do-it-yourself family suicide kit. Immediately enlisted by the Australian government to carry out a top-secret mission to investigate an IP signal coming from Anchorage Alaska, Assante is assigned an Australian military liaison (Grant Bowler) and a scientist (Bryan Brown)and asked to turn his boat around in search of humanity's last hope. In his few days on land before this fateful journey, Assante befriends his liaison's family, developing a special affinity for his sister-in-law, the playful Rachel Ward.My plot summary takes us about 1/3rd of the way through the story, but sets up all the major elements of On the Beach.Why does this film work so well? The cinematography is good, but not excellent. The direction is excellent and the cast is exceptionally good. But more than anything else, On the Beach makes its point because the script and story are deeply humanized by the complex and bold characterizations. The characters have interesting back-stories and deal with their harrowing predicament in very different ways. You not only feel as if you know these people, but you like them and sympathize with them - even the more despicable characters.This is a great piece of classic science fiction, recommended to all, but those with a limited attention span should opt for the 1959 version instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How I came to see this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DISCLAIMER: Text contains hints with regard to the ending of this movie. -----------------I came to this movie accidentally. I never read the book, nor did I knew that there was an earlier version of it.I was temporariliy working far away from home, when late one evening I zapped through my english tv channels and I saw something about a submarine. As I enjoyed the hunt for "Red October" and "Crimson Tide" a lot, and submarines are always of interest, I took a closer look - and found that what I saw was kind of boring. Too much relationship-blabla, too much "feelings" than I wanted to see at that time. (I am not that type of person who only watches Action-movies all the time, but what I saw really bored me at that time.)As the other channels did not offer too favourable alternatives, I had a look from time to time into that "submarine-movie", and I wondered about the combination of this feelings-and-relationship-stuff with a submarine ?!? Every time I stayed a little bit longer and I learned more about the background and the plot, with the nuclear disaster. However - part 1 ended, and, at that time, the movie was of enough interest that I looked out for part 2 in the tv magazine.I still had not too many details on the content of the movie when finally part 2 was on tv. I watched it from the beginning, and although there were some parts which really did not interest me too much (maybe because I never saw the complete developement of the characters), I could not resist to watch it to the end...But what kind of end is this ? An american movie without an happy ending ? Mankind all dead ? This was too realistic, and it was surprisingly detailed. Where in this famous "1984" movie they had to change the end for some audience, this movie ending was the direct opposite of it, and I was not prepared for it in some way.This was not the first time I was confronted with the nuclear theme and thinking about it, but I was unprepared for this direct, extreme and final ending that the movie had a kind of impact on me for almost a week. (And normally I am really not the type who is affected by movies that much!)While writing this, the movie is repeated on tv and I see once again people drinking final drinks or racing with ferraris into death. And once again, I have this terrible feeling that all of this is too realistic.Some people may be able to write about this movie only with regard to the performance of the actors, comparing with the book and the old version, or complaining about technical details. They may be right, but for me personally, this seems to be a kind of irrelevant compared to the content and the story of the movie. I consider that a bad movie could not have such an impact on the viewer, and I was glad to read that I am not the only one with this kind of experience.I agree with most other comments, that as many people as possible should have a better understanding of the effects of nuclear warfare, and if this movie can be effective to increase this understanding, it is a good movie. Maybe people should watch it like me, not knowing too much about the ending and not taking too much care about single characters. Movies like this you should not just watch, but you must also think about.Before switching now back to Cartoon Network, I am sending this little comment to IMDB and I start to wonder if I could mention this movie on my website...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First half bad, ending really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie across two nights on television.I found that the first half dragged quite a bit with too much time spent on setting up the love triangle.However, I found the ending really affecting and quite emotional. To put not too fine a point on it I was a little sleepless last night thinking about it. The acting in the ending is really quite good.I also think that for its interesting premise - what would happen to society in its possible final dies - this film doesn't go into much detail. I would have thought that there would be lots of interesting things to would happen.I think the stand out actors here are Jacqueline McKenzie (Mary Holmes) and Bryan Brown (Julian Osborne). They conveyed the emotion of their characters very well. I was quite disappointed with Armand Assante (Dwight Towers) as he didn't seem to have much of an emotional range.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first viewed the film "On the Beach" in its original 1959 version when I was about 10 years old - it was quite a big thing then, shown for a long term engagement in "Cinamascope" at the Cineramma Theater in San Diego, CA. The story and film frightened me, but made a big impact - and it has always stuck with me - I never forgot it. Now I have just finished viewing the 2000 version of "On the Beach" with Rachel Ward, Armand Assante and Bryan Brown. I was mesmerized - especially good was the second half, when the central characters are coming to terms with the reality of the end of the world and their own forth-coming deaths. The ending scenes with father Lt. Peter Holmes and his wife Mary and little daughter were so touching and broke my heart (and the tears flowed freely). Although the characters of the submarine commander Dwight (Armand Assante) and the single party-hearty Moira (Rachel Ward) were interesting, I never grew to really care about them, at least not Moira. Rachel Ward just didn't come through for me enough to make Moira genuine and someone you could care about. Armand Assante did a good job as the tough commander who revealed an inner core of love and caring. Bryan Brown as the cold unfeeling Dr. Julian Osborne was all right, and Brown managed to give him some sense of emotions at the end. The cast of the submarine crew were all excellent. All in all, I was greatly moved (once again) by this new version of "On the Beach" - and I think the makers of this film did an outstanding job.In 1959, the film "On the Beach" was relevant and very frightening to us Americans living at that time. Several of my neighbors were building "fallout shelters" and we regularly had "nuclear strike drills" at school with scary sirens blaring (diving under a desk! "Tuck &amp; Cover" our teacher told us as we tucked ourselves into a ball under our desks and covered our heads with our arms - as if that would save us?). Those were frightening times.Perhaps today, almost 50 years after the first film was made, it is not as likely that we humans will totally annihilate ourselves, families and children with nuclear weapons, at least I hope not. But we sill have that capability - and with the current "clash of civilizations" (and religious beliefs) between Islam and the West, ultimately destroying ourselves may be even more likely now than in it was 1959. Watching the 2000 version of "On the Beach" is a stark reminder of how it all may turn out if we are stupid enough to do so.I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid (about 10) my late Father used to ask me to get "On the Beach" regularly (well, maybe 3 times a year) when I cycled to the Warwick (UK) library to get my own kids books. Never understood his fascination with it. When I moved to Finland, 40 years later, one of my "hobbies" is ferreting through the local 'Salvation Army' shop, and the book was unbelievably there, paperback, in English. HUH??. ?0.10!!! When I read it, and wept buckets, I understood why. I ordered both the 1959 and the 2000 version DVD's from Amazon. 2000 version vastly superior. (As an aside, delete if irrelevant - My Father also had a fascination with the song, "Waltzing Matilda". Never understood why, till I read the lyrics. Then I did. He served in the Somme, you see. This week is kinda appropriate.)</fullReview>

This scenario is very real and the threat of a nuclear apocalypse hangs over us all every single day. All it takes is for one lunatic politician to push the trigger and then the world will descend into chaos.If everyone in the world watched this, they would all cry out to rid the world of not only nuclear weapons but all weapons and to stop fighting each other.A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie over a year ago and I still can't shake it from my mind. The movie is a very well done depiction of man's final insanity as it has nuked itself into oblivion. The movie alternates between despair, hope, and then finally despair. What I can't shake is - a) the plausibility of the movie and b) the depiction of the families and main characters as they approach the end.This movie really has left its mark on me. It's a very depressing movie overall and left me with a feeling of melancholy for a few days after seeing it. This movie is similar in feel to The Day After which aired on TV in 83 although it's actually a bit darker.I recommend this movie with the caveat that it is depressing. I'm not sure I would let my kids watch it.</fullReview>

Imagine this being a reality, it brought back all the chills I had about nuclear war in the eighties.The romance is not annoying but functional although there was one point: I wonder how many times one can come back to one's perfect love without getting the boot. Apparently a lot of times and a lot of running into each others arms, again and again. At some point I as yelling: What is it going to be !!! Sjeez.But that's about the only lesser point I could find. The decor is excellent, with deserted cities and scenes of anarchy, chaos and dispair.Enjoy but be prepared. This is no family movie, this is scary reality. I even dare to say to - with me at least - this movie made a bigger impact then The Day After.The movie also contains a perculiar shot of a burning skyscraper wich doesn't have a scratch later on in the movie seen from a train station. Watch for it just after the submarine arrives in Melbourne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw Emotion that trumps Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the young couple go out with their daughter and their love for one another made me think about how alone I am personally. If I had to go out in this situation, that is exactly how I would want to go..with my spouse and baby on a bed in an embrace. Beautiful.At first I hated Rachel Ward's character and even her acting, but then I realized that she was real. She admitted that she was a floozy, but that doesn't mean that floozies don't have feelings or the need for genuine companionship. Her acting was actually quite good.Armand Assante nailed this one. Very intense, real emotion. Loved it.I think there should have been more if any, mention of the fact that the U.S. is not the bad guy in geopolitics. There was an implied guilt. I guess in this film it was the Chinese. That's fine, but make it clear.I don't know about many people being from S.F. on the crew. That was just borrowed from the original. How many white guys in the marines are from urban S.F. in modern times? Even the black guy in this one was from the suburbs.The photography/scenery is spectacular. The movie was a bit too long. They really drew it out, but I was never bored.Yes, there are some sappy love stories, but those exist in real life. If they annoy you in movies, this one will drive you crazy.The most important scene involved the new rendition of the stopover in Alaska. They changed some things from the original film, but it was great. Armand had a break down and showed real emotion. The Gregory Peck character was very stoic in the first one. Some other commenter mentioned that men of the 50's weren't supposed to show emotion.The Bryan Brown character was tough to take. I found it hard to believe that an award winning scientist was also a loudmouth playboy, even given the reputation of Australian men. It was like he was the guy from Cocktail again.One thing that I kept on thinking about was the fact that we are all going to die anyways, with or without nuclear war. But I guess the heaviness was also about the fact that the world was coming to an end. We all wind up getting sick and dieing, so that's no different. Although granted, most of the people in this one were too young to die.I really felt the desperation of the people when it showed them wanting to take one last look at the ocean or make love one more time, etc. It's so hard to accept death. Like bed time when you're a kid and there's company over, or a good movie on.This one will stay with me for a long time. Nice job overall. Give it a chance if you like intense drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are better alternatives if you are interested in this subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have to admit I did not read the book nor did I watch the original movie from 1959.Screened as TV miniseries, the whole film runs three hours and is way too slow paced to be watched in one go. The subject itself is interesting, yet somewhat spoiled by illogical and unrealistic turns in the plot: A full nuclear exchange between China and US leads to "radiation poisoned winds". While certainly not beneficial for humankind, seems a bit far-fetched and will probably not lead to death within several days, but higher cancer rates or infertility. A biological or chemical hazard would have served the purpose better. And why seems everybody to have suicide capsule with them - Not they guys going on the mission, but obviously the people being caught in surprise as well? And none of the characters really developed to a point (a three hours movie!) I started to care about them.You are better off watching "The Day After" which is far more realistic. If interested on the subject how a conflict could escalate, give "Countdown to Looking Glass" a try. And if you are interested in "the world is coming to an end"-subject, see "The Last Night".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This stretched out cinematic experience certainly must be one of the most realistic end-of-the-world movies so far. The absolute horror it relates to the viewer is sure to keep anyone awake in the clutches of the most fierce agony of death. How humans of all kinds and backgrounds face certain death in their own ways, is wondrously depicted in 'On the beach' which clearly hasn't received the fame it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film ought to have been good. It isn't. It is far inferior to the 1959 original.Some people have said it is an improvement to have Australians playing Australians - and Americans, rather than Americans playing both, as in the 1959 film. I am not convinced that is an improvement. Americans played Australians reasonably convincingly in 1959. I am afraid that the Australians in this film sounded fake - even when playing Australians! The dialogue was phony, and far too contrived. The politics too obvious.Special effects were very weak, even for a TV movie. The Ferrari crash was unbelievably poorly executed.All-in-all not a pleasant experience - and that had nothing to do with the subject matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, far better then the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic plot line is that the world came to an end due to a nuclear war, hitting only in the Nothern Hemisphere. As the film starts, there is a nuclear sub returning from a patrol, though not specified where it had been. The sub surfaces and gets in contact with some other survivors, but they are dieing out. I can't remember if they are already in contact with the Austtralian government or not, but they are asked to pick a local scientist and bring him in with them. The story revolves around the question: did someone survive the nuclear fallout in the north and if so, could those in Australia could also survive. The original story and film had a random Morse code message being sent, and the sub is sent to explore. This time, it is a Net broadcast, repeating itself. Other than this point, the film remains faithful to the book. One major difference between the films, the Austalians are played by Australian actors. In the first one, Americans played all the roles.</fullReview>

At that very day, I played with my friends in the rain that contained the radioactive dust. Somewhat before, I had seen the original movie, with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. It had fulfilled my dreams with many nightmares.But I prefer the 2000 remake. It's more realistic (traffic chaos, anarchy, looters, groupy-sex orgies...).The movie talks about people who are not too old but they are about to die and there is nothing they can do but euthanasia. This is not the problem just-in-case of a nuclear war, but a problem faced by all those who suffer of some terminal illness (cancer, leukemia, AIDS...). This movie makes you scratch your head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if I was never overly fond of end-of-world movies, this one caught my attention. I never saw the original movie from the 50s, but "On the Beach" is far from a cheap remake. The only negative thing you can tell about it is the bit of soapy scenes between the characters (especially Rachel Ward's and Bryan Brown's) toward the end.The acting is great, especially Armand Assante, who seems to be born to play his character as a charismatic submarine captain. He does a really good job in portraying it, both in the character's strength and weaknesses. Jacqueline McKenzie does a great job, too.I'd like to say, who cares if some technical details are not accurate ? "On the beach" is not "The hunt for the Red October", it's a movie about human beings confronting the aftermath of a nuclear war, their possible death and the possible end of humanity. That's the whole point of the story. This movie is about hope, hope that humanity can survive despite what happened. And on this precise point, "On the beach" does it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Is Usually Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, we're on the beach again. And the first question that comes to my mind is - why? What was so very wrong with Kramer's 1961 original that the whole thing needed re-jigging? Here, we have Armand Assante replacing Gregory Peck as submarine commander Dwight Towers. Someone called Rachel Ward steps into Ava Gardner's shoes as Tower's love interest. And preposterously over-the-top Brian Brown - who got his big break in 'Murder By FX' - makes a determined but completely failed attempt to supplant Fred Astaire as the scientist. Various other B-movie nonentities cling fast to their ancillary parts.I'm sounding a little scathing, I know; when in truth this is a very competent little movie in its own right. It just happens to be inferior to its original of nearly 50 years vintage in almost every respect. And that's the point. Modernisation does not necessarily mean improvement.What does it add? Well, the first think to notice is photography in colour, instead of black-and-white. And I don't like it. For me; as a child, the cold war was represented in B&amp;W. Not just on the movie screen but on television at home. Newsreels were always monochrome, and that is how my generation largely remembers that stark, terrifying period of history. Think of any cold-war movie, and you'll know what I mean. Moreover the social and political philosophy was also black-and-white: capitalist or communist, east or west, enemy or friend, right or wrong. There was no middle ground.Secondly, and obviously; in the intervening time, special-effects have advanced in leaps and bounds. Here we get to see some of the nuclear destruction that was denied us in Kramer's slightly flawed masterpiece. It's breathtaking stuff. But does it advance the story? Not one jot. Does it make for a better, more shocking, more convincing experience? I think not. To me, those still, silent, deserted streets viewed from a distance in the original, spoke volumes. What both these movies demonstrate is the complete irrelevence of special effects compared to a good story well told, whilst at the same time, modern movies' almost-addicted dependence upon them to carry the day.Then, we get to see the onset of radiation sickness. And once again it's more graphic in its presentation, with some good, hearty honking. But do we need it? Finally, there is the love triangle thing. And that too is needlessly more graphic and hysterical in a way that detracts from the constrained and understated original. Frankly; it's unbelievable. To see this Rachel Ward character strutting about amongst men as though sexual desire were still the biggest story in town, and all of them in turn fawning over her, as if the universal thought of imminent hideous extinction could be completely eclipsed by the sight of a well-figured slut, is just too ludicrous to countenance. And if that were not enough, we have the Dwight Towers' character becoming petulantly jealous over this woman's sexual dalliance with the Professor, despite the fact they're all going to be dead in a week anyway. So how in hell can it matter? Might as well go for a threesome.If there had been no Neville Shute novel, and if there had been no previous movie; this would have been the standard-bearer for the cinematic portrayal of nuclear extinction. And it would have been - and is - reasonably good. However, there was a novel and that was extremely good. And there was an earlier movie which both maintained an adequate fidelity to that novel and was quite excellent. Which brings me back to the original question: If you can't improve upon the original - why bother trying to replicate it? Well; I guess you can read the book. And I guess you can watch both of the movies. I have, and my comments are here. Decide for yourselves. Perhaps in the end, each is a movie of its time, and reflects the social mores of its generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect but Impacting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It didn't take me long after 'Highlander' to see that director Russell Mulcahy had struck lucky in creating one of my favourite movies of all time. I've really not been a fan of his, so watching 'On The Beach' was a bit of a strange experience. Thankfully, it was filled with just enough originality and reasons to be liked for me to go the distance with it! Firstly, and most importantly to those looking for a thrill, this is not your movie. It's entirely character driven with a smattering of symbolism and it might be a bit too emotional for the action movie crowd. It's a show with an anti-nuclear message.That being said, Mulcahy did infinitely more with $10 million than 'Blair Witch Project' did with $15 million in the same year and much of that comes down to the efforts and chemistry of the cast. That is a testament to the effort put into this production, though, as you really have to wonder; random camcorders and camping in the woods cost $5 million more than a submarine, a cast of international actors and a soundtrack? How? Moving on, I've never seen Armand Assante take the lead and now I'm looking to see what of his I can watch next. He was captivating from start to finish, taking up his character's mantle as though he'd been in the navy all his life. As for more tender and emotional scenes, it's quite endearing to watch such a gruff and edgy man portray all that he did. He carries much of the movie, but sometimes it's rushed outcome overshadows him.Bryan Brown suffers an impatient or rushed cinematographer, not to mention a script that needed reigning in, whereas Rachel Ward and Grant Bowler came across as very natural and understated until it really counts.As for any action, unfortunately it's the edgier scenes that Mulcahy was better known for that he consistently failed at. It really made me wonder what happened to him as a director because how could he mature as a dramatic director and then becomes so bad at what made him famous? All faults aside (including some horrendous editing), it's still a good effort and after all is said and done, if this TV movie and its culminating scenes don't blow your mind and leave you chilled to the bone, then I fear for the future. I think you have to want the message in order to want the film in this case!</fullReview>

A bit long but riveting none the less, well directed and well acted. The scenario was a pleasant change as the bulk of the movie is set in Austrailia as opposed to the US where I live. It is of course an Austrailian film. It was sobering to see the city of San Francisco post apocalypse as well as Alaska where you can always go to drop out and escape your demons. The war itself was over and done with at the very beginning of the movie, leaving the entire 3ish hours to deal with the aftermath. There are human diversions to break up the overwhelming seriousness of the southern hemisphere's impending demise from the radiation cloud making it's way south from the utterly obliterated north. The final solution kits that were being handed out by public health services containing poison, (a syringe for kids and pets and a pill for the grownups) designed to offer a quick death as opposed to suffering through the radiation sickness to meet the same inevitable end pose a moral question. Well worth a look.</fullReview>

Perhaps it is because I am the parent of a two year old daughter but that scene conveys a moment humanity has come to that should never be.I didn't realize the film ran 3 hours because it was so enthralling and alternated so effectively between despair and hope.

Grant Bowler is incredible in this film, and is as good as Anthony Perkins in the original- and Jackie McKenzie also does a great job as his wife.Worth watching because it updates Shutes Novel and the original film effectively.</fullReview>

Throw in a couple of rouge military generals that want revenge for an attack at any cost and it is all over. I thought "The Day After" was medically graphic. At least the characters in this film had time for the government to issue suicide kits so you didn't have to die slowly from radiation sickness. I really hope this never becomes a prophecy.

		<shortDescription>A very good remake of the Stanley Kramer Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kramer's 1959 production of On the Beach is a tough act to follow but this movie passes the test. I only bought the tape a few months ago, I had always hoped they would do a remake of On the Beach in modern times, in color, with VCR's, DVD Players and laptop computers and they did. The film is set in 2006 following a nuclear world war caused by China invading Taiwan. Now there are several elements of this movie where you have to stretch your imagination. Since Jimmy Carter abrogated our mutual defense pact with Taiwan in 1979, it is doubtful as to whether we would go to war over an invasion an occupation of Taiwan by Mainland China. Armande Assante does well as Captain Dwight Towers, of the USS Charleston. Bryan Brown gives credence to Fred Astaires role as wisecracking scientist Julian Osborne. Bryan Brown's wife, Rachel Ward, gives a terrific performance in the Ava Gardner role of the alcoholic Moira Davidson. I thought it was interesting how in this film Moira Davidson is supposed to be Mary Holmes sister, which gives it a new dimension unexplored in the original.I thought the trip to the United States is much more interesting in this film because Captain Towers and another officer go ashore in Seattle. It was so interesting to see the film updated with the Internet and e-mail and the television transmission that keeps repeating from Seattle. Showing the Golden Gate bridge and San Francisco a wreck is much more compelling than abandoned but intact in the original film. The ending is one of the worst ways a film can end, but it is well done and essential for the storyline and the message the film is trying to convey. Fail Safe had a TV movie remake but I think it was a mistake to set in in the same time as the original in 1964. Updating everything, and making it in color, make this a good film. It is true that Armand Assante is no Gregory Peck, Rachel Ward is no Ava Gardener, and Bryan Brown is no Fred Astaire. The topic does not seem as timely as it was in 1959, but it was a very good movie which I highly recommend as an acceptable update of the Stanley Kramer classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the current climate on the world stage and just how unpopular the USA is with other nations, mainly over the gung ho attitude over the last 3 years, this movie has some severe punch. The world mentality is now far more war orientated, terrified more bombs will go off. Into that mix this (tele-miniseries) movie arrives.Right at the start we are abruptly introduced to the idea that The Buttons were pushed, bombs sent, the Northern Hemisphere irradiated. Gone. Kaput. The remainder of this long story is what happens after. It's not terribly realistic (one American submarine survives; that the main place to go is Melbourne, Australia - despite the fact we have Tasmania which is even further south, AND Antarctica; plus how many bunkers do the Americans have anyway?) but if you suspend that bit of disbelief, it's compelling viewing.I would recommend watching it all in one sitting (as I did) as it had great punch and I became involved with the characters. Maybe it was because I am Australian. I'd like to think not. I think every major politician on the planet should be made to watch movies like this every 6 months. All of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile Remake of 1959 Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easy to take potshots at a Made-for-Cable remake, particularly when the film remade is a cherished classic, such as 1959's 'On the Beach'. "Armand Assante is no Gregory Peck", "Bryan Brown is no Fred Astaire", "Stanley Kramer made the point better, in black and white, in an hour less time"...These are the most frequent criticisms, and they certainly have merit!But if you take the time to watch this film, you'll find the 2000 version actually compares favorably with the original, and, in some ways, actually improves upon it. First, Australian actors are finally playing the Australian roles. This is not meant as a slap at Anthony Perkins, Ava Gardner, or Fred Astaire; Stanley Kramer casted easily-recognizable screen icons so he wouldn't have to spend much time developing character (Only Perkins has any real backstory in the film), but, by casting Americans, an y Australian flavor is either diluted or caricatured. The remake is rich in character, with an authenticity that can't be faked.This carries over to the casting of Armand Assante as Commander Towers, as well. Gregory Peck was such a legend by the time the original was made, that his character, other than the lack of acceptance of his family's death, isn't explored; it is simply Peck playing Peck. Assante, bull-like and clearly in charge, is given several scenes demonstrating the love and loyalty he shares with his crew, explaining why his sense of duty has to take precedent over his new love with Moira (Rachel Ward) more effectively than Peck could. Assante is remarkably good in the role, as is Ward, taking Ava Gardner's role from the original.The remake takes a much harder-edged view of a civilization facing death. Riots and looting are commonplace, there is less comfort from religion, and authority is breaking down, piecemeal, throughout the country. Anti-U.S. sentiment, never exhibited in the original, is rampant, particularly when the U.S. submarine arrives in port. The ravages of nuclear holocaust are shown; San Francisco, which was inexplicably intact in the original, is here a shattered husk, twisted and ruined. Powerful images are frequent in the remake, and won't soon be forgotten.Not that the remake is without faults. The final Australian Grand Prix, Astaire's shining moment, is gone, as is his suicide by carbon monoxide, with a smile on his face, behind the wheel of his championship car (Brown's crashing through a billboard in his Ferrari just doesn't pack the same emotional wallop). Having Moira fantasize that Towers abandons his crew and returns to her at film's end lacks the poignancy of seeing her, standing alone beside her car, as she watches the sub, and her love, sail away to die. And I MISSED hearing 'Waltzing Matilda'!As anti-war statements, both versions deserve credit, and as a human story , full of joy, sorrow, and ultimate tragedy, 2000's 'On the Beach' certainly holds it's own with it's illustrious predecessor.It is a film worth having, in any collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very true to the book; sobering, thankful it never happened...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie compares very favorably to the earlier movie and the book by Nevil Shute; a viewer of this movie should have read or be familiar with the plot of the book to understand the first few minutes (film begins about 3-4 months after the apocalyptic nuclear exchange). The casual viewer should recognize that in remaining true to Nevil Shute's book and the 1959 earlier screenplay not everything will be as gruesome and realistic compared to other movies of the post-nuclear apocalypse -re: 1st reviewer's comment. Other comparable movies -("The Day After", specifically)- were overtly graphical and realistic; a more comparable movie would be the 1983 film "Testament"; and I've not been able to personally review/ see the British counterpart Threads but it would appear even more realistic than "The Day After"). The British animated film "When the Wind Blows based on the book by Raymond Briggs is a comparable view from the British experience. The Australian experience at Maralinga is also pertinent; see the movie "Ground Zero" for more background to Australian opinion.I believe that the film accurately draws the viewer into the life of a small group of individuals who collectively have to face the unthinkable- the end of the world, slowly, with a bang, not a whimper. It made me reflect on what is truly important to one's life- family; friends; and cherishing the memories of times shared with both. It will impose on the viewer some serious questioning of "What would YOU do if you were in their shoes? It also gives one pause to consider that this scenario was all-too-plausible- and not at all unthinkable for most of the Cold War (1950-1989); indeed, the film is made more compelling because one knows that this could have indeed happened- and thankful that it didn't.Parent's advisory- due to the nature and serious content of the film, this movie should be viewed by adults only or mature teens.- slight profanity, some graphic images of results of nuclear exchange in San Francisco and Alaska) Parents- If you have children, hug them a little tighter the next time you put them to bed; be glad that they can wake up healthy with a full life ahead of them the next morning.I would also recommend the book "The Last Ship" by William Brinkley"; a more detailed view of what life would be for the crew of a naval surface ship caught in the same situation (as opposed to the submarine featured in "On the Beach")</fullReview>

They always cheer me up, because no matter how many troubles or problems you mite have, things are always much worse for the folks in these movies.I saw the original of this movie and always thought it a great movie. (well, it has got a submarine in) I was worried for the first hour of this remake, thinking they'll never fit everything in. Then I realised its 3 hours long. Every detail is there, what a story. It really takes you off the planet in to another world. (ok, maybe I mean alternate reality) I really get into these things just like I was there. Luckily, when the 3 hours is up, it ends and I'm still here. Phew. Great acting, Great characters and check out the Fabulous Rachel Ward, who seems to walk around barefoot for most of the movie.

I would like to have seen more on the plight of the people rather than having 100% dedication to the major characters.That said I thought the main characters were excellent, and it was good to see so many Aussie actors get a gig in such a major production.It's pretty funky to think that if the world were going to end that your city would be the last one remaining but it's also chilling because it makes you think about what you would do if you were one of the last left.I highly recommend this, but if you watch it on video there may be a few minutes of the second half that can be fast-forwarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Longish . . .but it still pushes the button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new mini-series "On the Beach" is a successful rendering of Nevil Shute's novel of nuclear destruction. Its story of nuclear destruction downplays the special effects for the more human story of how normal people face up to the end of their lives. This is the story's strongest point--whereas ABC gave us soap opera characters and terrible effects in "The Day After"--those who have read "On the Beach" and seen the earlier filmed version have ties to these characters (especially Peter, Mary and baby Jennifer).Bryan Brown's Julian did get on my nerves, but his last ride through Melbourne made up for his attitude. As for Armand Assante, I think he did a tremendous job as Dwight Towers and played the character as more human--at least more emotional--than did Gregory Peck in the original. The couple playing Peter and Mary Holmes (Grant Boler &amp; Jacqueline McKenzie) are the real fines of this picture and I hope their works are available in this country. The only problem with the casting is that certain of the American characters have Aussie accents. As for Moira, as played by Rachel Ward, she has all of the sex appeal that, in my eyes, was lacking in the performance of Ava Gardner in the original. Her character is much fuller in this new version. The new version also viewed the collapse of the country in understated ways--the vandals attacking the stores, the camp in the alley where people live in tents and one couple is having sex--although fully clothed--in the open easily reveal how the social fabric of society was breaking down. This was also emphasized when Dwight was attacked when he left the hospital and during Julian's last ride in Melbourne.Is the production perfect? Of course not! It has the problem of all mini-series--certain scenes do seem to go on for a bit longer than necessary--especially the scenes with Moira and Julian discussing their dead relationship. The scenes of San Francisco--while true to the book--were poorly drawn. (The lack of destruction in the city was a highlight in the first film.) However, these are small potatoes to a film that pushes the buttons in the same way that the original did almost fifty years ago. There is still time . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first movie of this kind I could ever sit through. Not because I've got a weak stomach, but "romance" type movies like this just don't interest me. This movie though, the premise behind it, watching how people react and think, it just kept me interested.I've read some of these other comments, and one of the points that gets on my nerves, is "How could Australia NOT be a target of attack?" Now, I don't know, but I do know that it wasn't a target of the 1959 version either, or from the book. So from that, we must figure that the author felt that the reason Australia wasn't nuked was not needed in this story.And also, for the person that had a gripe because the sub had nuclear warheads, but was referred to as an SSN, a technical note here. Attack submarines can be loaded with TLAM-N, the nuclear warhead version of the Tomahawk cruise missle. So yes, the sub could have been loaded with nukes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite different than the original, much more chilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original in the late 1960s when I was an 8 years old and it helped form my belief systems on war, peace, the value of life and on how terrifying such a end-of-the-world scenario would be. I saw the Showtime version last night and it gave me nightmares all night.The 1958 version was very stark and didn't have a lot that one could relate to in terms of deep interplay between the main characters; the updated version changes all that. It seems to start out very slowly leaving me wondering when the director was going to get to the meat of the story which is finding out if anyone has survived the nuclear war in the Northern Hemisphere, but the time is well spent because by then end of the film you're deeply engrossed in the approaching, inevitable death of the characters and the utter finality of what has happened not only to them but to every person one the planet and the planet itself.The updated technology references really hook you, especially the use of the Internet. There are several homages to the 1958 film -- look for the coke bottle. The fact that this version is in color adds a reality apart from the original. The only quibble I have is the portrayal of the populace of Australia as being relatively calm (in terms of lack of social unrest) in the face of the end-of the world is hard to swallow... however since the focus is really on getting to know the characters and their interactions I'd let the former slide...Excellent remake of a classic. One important safety tip: if you're impressionable or easily upset, DO NOT watch the film alone, it can really freak you out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on Showtime last night. It wasn't a mini series. Though that might have been more merciful. Overall it wasn't a bad remake. I prefer Kramer's original. But having the story updated was nice and it points out that though the cold war is over there are still alot of nuclear warheads around and nations ready to use them. A reminder that the world is not safe from the threat of nuclear holocaust.I don't see where Rachel Ward and Bryan Brown "sizzled" in this remake as their characters were adversarial toward one another throughout with one exception. I thought Ward and Asante worked well together. And most of the cast fit for an updated version of the story.The only drawback I saw was that the film tended to drag on in places senselessly. Keeping in the spirit of the original would have been better in my opinion. The length of the film made it difficult to watch at times. But overall I thought it was good. Just as depressing as its predecessor. If not more so because of the contemporary feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand how this movie has managed to get a 6.9 . Have the reviewers actually read Neville Shute's novel ?I was really looking forward to seeing this 2000 remake because On The Beach is a favourite of mine and have read the novel many times. The 1959 movie really did not do the tale any justice.However the tone of this movie, its pacing and script are just wrong. Too much time is spent on the sub and little time developing the characters.Special effects...appalling , corpses that were supposed to be two years old blinking. Did the radiation preserve the bodies ? San Francisco and the golden gate destroyed but Sausalito sparkles in the sun without a broken window.Worst of all is Dwight Towers and the changed ending. In the novel Moira sits ill behind the wheel, dying from radiation sickness abandoned. In this we have an ending which destroys the whole tone of the original novel. I do not really like remakes per se but we need a decent director to remake this blockbuster story but one which sticks to the characterisation and tone of the novel.If the novel needs extending in anyway then that should focus on the ways in which radiation sickness destroys the body. this movie did finally become involving once the sub arrived back in Melbourne but it was a long and dreary wait. 4/10 at best</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See both versions (and read the novel)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that a review of this teleplay is inevitably going to take the form of a comparison with the 1959 film of which it's a remake! So let me start out by saying: I don't agree with some of the reviewers at this site, who say it's a simple case of the remake being superior to the original, period. Both versions have their high points and both versions misadapt this or that detail from Nevil Shute's novel. If you have the time, the two versions are best seen in succession. And by all means read the novel.The most glaring fault of both versions are their violation of the character of Commander Towers, especially on the occasion of his fishing trip with Moira, the lady he has been companionating with during his Australian mission. Novelist Shute's submarine captain remains faithful to his wife, even though she's obviously dead along with everybody else in the northern hemisphere, and he registers himself and Moira in separate rooms at the fishing lodge. Why does he feel this way? Because he chooses to believe his wife is still alive, along with his family, in their cozy Connecticut home which is in reality an uninhabitable wilderness of radioactive crud. Moira, a somewhat vulnerable woman in need of affection, is somewhat hurt, but she respects Towers' feelings. And thanks to Shute's way of telling the story, we know that without his irrational belief that he's "going home when all this is over", the commander would not be such a source of strength to his crew and to the Australians he's lending his services to. Neurotic as his belief may seem, it's sensible because it works. And he's not pretending, he believes it--even when he finally takes his sub out to sink her with all hands, he brings along the presents he bought for his family in Connecticut. And he sure as anything isn't going to cheat on his wife.But the director of the 1959 version, Stanley Kramer, stupidly insisted that the film must "have some sex" and that no viewer would find Towers' restraint believable. Consequently, the film makes it clear that Towers and Moira do consummate their relationship. Gregory Peck argued with Kramer, and told him how wrong he was, but to no avail. Consequently, novelist Shute hated the film, and we too should hate this particular violation of Shute's concept. Particularly because the 2000 version made the same change, by default.The merit of the 2000 version is that it goes much more deeply into the characters and their motivations. It also updates the story, and I think Shute would approve of that, because the danger of nuclear Armageddon is actually much greater nowadays than it was in 1959, due to the increasing proliferation of these weapons, the instability of the world situation, and the irrationally warlike nature of the present U.S. leadership. The updating of the story helps to underscore the fact that the nuclear danger has increased. ** spoiler ahead **But the more recent TV version also contains extra badness, of which the most glaring example is the change in the ending. There is after all a reason why Shute's story must end with Moira standing at the headland, watching the submarine disappear into the mists for the last time, unable to share her last moments with her companion: "This is the way the world ends." I can't imagine why a conclusion so poignant - and in terms of the logic of the story, so inevitable - was replaced by a silly portrayal of a fantasy of Moira's, in which Towers fails to do his duty and deserts his ship and crew to return to her. Were the makers of this version afraid that using the real ending would make people think it too derivative of the 1959 film? I can't imagine.We certainly need a third version, one that will show Towers caught between his alternative reality (remaining loyal to his wife) and Moira.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As others have said, the romantic part of the movie is very bland, it detracts a lot from what might have been a good TV movie. For the average viewer, that is. But if you are one of those unlucky fellows that likes to use their brains a little bit, you'll be disappointed with the premise:- Warning! Spoilers ahead -So, the premise is, after a nuclear way, the northern hemisphere is polluted with radioactive waste, but one scientist suspects that increased UV might have removed the nuclear pollution near the North pole. Interesting, maybe even plausible. What is totally un-plausible is the following: they send a submarine to check this out, because all communication with the north has ceased and only a submarine can go there, avoiding the radiation. Now why wouldn't they just send a plane? Well, duh, because... hmmm... yeah, why not? In this movie, moreover, Australians are waiting for their destiny as the pollution from the fallout approaches, without even trying to use the time they have to build underground refuges, even though the supplies seem to be aboundant, as well as the time. Again, why not?Contrast this movie to "The day after", which in a much shorter feature time describes all the doom humanity can bring upon itself, all the humane tragedy, even the romantic aspects, without spoiling it all, and all along keeping some scientific and logical sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning, this compares the original and the remake and might spoil the ending for those who haven't seen them.I have two complaints about the remake and one solution for both complaints. My first complaint is the length of the movie and the second is the depiction of the submarine crew. The main reason the movie is too long is the added scenes when the sub goes north. The crew's behavior on this particular cruise would be questionable on a pirate ship with Blackbeard as their captain. There is no way the captain would act so undignified when speaking to his assembled troops. No way would the lieutenant be gambling with the enlisted men, certainly not in full view of the captain, and absolutely no way would the captain allow it. No way would a man as emotionally fragile as the captain reach that rank. No way would the captain leave the boat to undertake a dangerous mission. He might send his second in command, but absolutely no way do both senior officers leave the boat, leaving the destiny of the mission, not to mention the crew, in the hands of the third wiper. No way would the captain react as he did after entering the house and viewing the results of the war. He might have gone on the mission and reacted as he did, if Anchorage was his home and I believe that would have made for a more compelling story, like he wants to go to Anchorage and the crew doesn't. The original movie and book did not include the above nonsense and were much more belieable.I guess my point is that these scenes were only added to make the movie longer and my solution would be to lose them. The movie (if not the world) will be better off without them. A few of the scenes in Australia could be dropped as well. For instance, the bed scene with Moira and Julian was added either to fill yet more time, or as I suspect, at the insistence of the participating actors. (For those who don't know Ward is Mrs. Brown in her other life.) Dwight's hanging around until his buddy died was contrived to keep him out of the way until Moira and Julian could get it back on. With all the bye-bye pills being passed around like popcorn, why would Dwight's buddy put him (and himself) through that. There are only two scenes added, with which I would agree. One is the scene where Dwight and Moira witness the family driving off the cliff. This shocks the couple back to reality and I though it was well done. The other scene is Dwight's returning to Moira for the end. A bit `Hollywood,' but based on the remake's premise, that the crew was sick and wanted to die on the ship versus a strange land, true to life. Who would not return to love versus death aboard a coffin ship? This is about the only scene I would consider changing in the original. I wouldn't because it would mean losing that evocative concluding scene where Ava watches from the cliff as the sub departs Australia. Another reason not to change would be that the crew in the original wanted to see their homeland one more time before they died, while in the remake they were sick and would die in the sub. To take his crew home would have been a strong reason to take Dwight away from Moira. Both endings fit their plot lines.As for the casting, character for character, with the possible exception of Jacqueline McKenzie as Mary, the original cast was better. While Gregory Peck was the epitome of the American officer; Asante was over the top most of the movie, and would have been better cast as the ship's cook. While Fred Astaire was the gentleman personified, Brown didn't convince me that he was an egghead and he seemed to be glad the world was ending. Despite not being Australian, Anthony Perkins seemed more convincing as Peter, and as good as Rachel Ward was, Ava was better. Some parts of the movie were good, but for the most part they were the parts retained from the original. The only thing better about the remake is that it's in color, allowing the majestic coastline of Australia to be fully appreciated. Maybe what they should have done was saved the money and colorized the original. Maybe not.</fullReview>

I was much more emotionally involved this time around now that I am older and can relate to the emotional pain of the characters. Anyone with spouses, children or grandchildren will be torn by the stories outcome.This is not really a special effects movie. It is more about the reactions of the people in the story. The effects that are used are well done though.I also thought that the ending of this version is more believable than the book or the 1959 version of the movie. Watch this one to see the difference.Many might think that this story is not longer possible in todays world, but remember, the number of nuclear weapons has not decreased that much.

In the movie people choose to die with their beloved ones, or at least on homeland. Is it ethical to commit suicide when you know that death is unavoidable? This is a movie that YOU really should see... it might change your opinion about wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes CAN be better than the original, even in this genre. I'm reminded of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" done in 1956 and again in 1978. Both versions are great and I feel that way about "On the Beach". The original 1959 film has been an alltime favourite of mine, but the remake exceeds the original.I had my doubts it could be done better but it did.The remake's characters were more believable. The trip to Alaska was a great addition and the solar powered laptop with its corrupted video clip message brought the whole plot to the present in a very convincing manner.Brian Brown and Rachel Ward were excellent. I only disliked the actor playing the submarine commander. He was so wooden and unbelievable.The scenery of the Victorian coast was spectacular.I thoroughly enjoyed this remake.I noted that many comments say that politicians should view this film. I feel this attitude has lead to the plausibilty of the film. ALL PEOPLE should see this film, so they will insist on BETTER POLITICIANS.Don't be afraid to support Ralph Nader next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They still make movies like they use too.Armand Assante's performance as Dwight Towers is convincing. Suspension of disbelief - the goal of art - is achieved. The intersection and interaction of the main characters, Assante, Ward, Brown and McKenzie, was sheer mastery. And, maybe I'm just a sucker for this kind of stuff, but the romantic elements enhance the movie immensely. The movie translates to recent times more than the original which demonstrates the enduring qualities and contemporary currency of this classic movie.Every politician on the planet must see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First a warning for the guys, don't be seduced by the nuclear sub on the box, this is a chick flick. It's after the war, and there is nothing more to shoot at. It's long, but moves along alright, although you can FF through the mood scenes. It's lots of relationship stuff and crying, and a little suspense as they try to locate life in another area of the world. There are tons of cliches and platitudes, and the plot is straight formula. The acting is adequate, and if all you want is a tear-jerker with an adequate story, this might be enough for you. If you're looking for action, this isn't it. -Bob</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blame the author of the book I guess but I don't see any point whatsoever to this film. The human race dies in a nuclear war, most presumably in horrid flames, but we see it from the viewpoint of neat and tidy deaths of affluent suburbanites. Three hours to tell you what I could say in a few seconds, if there is a big nuclear war we would all suffer and die. The makers of this film chose to illustrate this point with a slow and tedious bomb of their own. The final moment is the greatest insult of all. The author envisioned the triumph of love over all else, but I see instead the refusal of the protagonist to acknowledge humanity from any motivation short of its' destruction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both this film and the big-screen Gregory Peck / Ava Gardner vehicle were based on the 1950s Cold War sci-fi novel by Nevil Shute. A full-scale nuclear war has killed most of the world's population, and it's just a matter of time before the trade winds bring deadly radiation to the last bastion of human life - Australia.The original film, though melodramatic at times (and set in far-off 1964!) was a champion of special effects for its time - the busy ports of Long Beach, San Francisco, and eventually the unnamed Australian port that is actually a pre-skyscraper Melbourne, appear deserted. Apart from cultural changes over the past 40+ years, the story and its outcome remain unchanged.This well-intentioned and competently acted TV update merely adds color, digital effects, grisly corpses and updated language to the original. It's well worth a look, but not at the expense of depriving oneself of the much more sobering effect of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having resolved my self at an early age, to avoid nay to despise TV movies in all their shameless forms, I found my self at a bit of morale dilemma bringing my self to watch "On The Beach"; On the one hand a Modern take on a book I had read in my childhood. On the other Armand Assante. It was a difficult choice I can assure you.Depressing and Dark, Convoluted and contrived simple yet strangely stirring. The telling of what is to happen after the bomb has been dropped from the Australian point of view is simple. The wind has been slowly but surely sending death down under. There is little to but wait and plan for the inevitable. An American nuclear vessel travels in out of the deep blue and provides a glimmer of hope to the survival of the human race. The Book was strangely profound in its telling, or at least it was to a boy in his early teens when I first read it. Too many "but why's" ruined this film for me in the present. Its story though updated for the millennium still provided me with one to many questions un-answered. Perhaps I require more holes to be filled in at the end of the day. Having put these issues aside in my mind, I resolved to look at the good points; Bryan Brown is a good point, as is Rachel Ward. The Acting all round was for the most part superb. As was the some what tear jerking finale that provides nuclear war a very human face. I must say given these statements I might have started the destruction of the universe as we know it, A TV movie good? Surely not. Well provided the productions values were good for a movie made on TV budget, splendid acting and an great couple of closing moments. It's severely hampered by a dish water weak love story, unanswered questions a plenty and perhaps the worst American accent ever recorded Beyond these quibbles, This some what easy to hate but still strangely stirring movie is not bad. Its not particularly good, but I have been biased though years of poor TV movies. I would perhaps advise those of you who liked the drama of say Die Hard, to look else where for your entertainment. However if you are not terribly afraid of a little tear jerker and a downer ending, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who expect a war film with submarine action will be utterly disappointed by "On the Beach". A submarine boat plays an important part here, but the film is rather a drama than a thriller. "On the beach" paints a depressing scene of how a post nuclear war world could look like. The main focus are a few of the last people on earth and how they struggle to deal with their situation. The whys and hows of the nuclear war itself are not important. Despite the sad theme, there are surprisingly humorous elements in the film - after all, it was based on an Australian novel. Laughter and tears are very close to each other in this film, so that the story far from being pathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uneven, thought-provoking, poignant; worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an emotionally tough day, I saw a broadcast of the new On the Beach last night, and had strongly mixed feelings. I was born two years after The Bomb, and grew up during the most hellish years of fear about nuclear devastation. It left an indelible impression on me, having reached its greatest crisis when I was at my most vulnerable age. The risk of all-out nuclear war increased after the original novel and movie in the '50s, peaked in the '60s (the subject of many bad dreams when I was in junior high and high school), was still a nightmarish worry in the '70s, declined steeply in the '80s and then--thanks in no small part to the disorder following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the new availability of Soviet fissile materials and scientists--increased in the '90s. And although technologies change and antagonists shift, human nature is eternal. Now India and Pakistan detonate bombs within days of one another, and China is turning up the heat on Taiwan. I am getting disquieting feelings of 1962 again.That is the background against which the remake of On the Beach is played. It is an uneven film, mixing flashes of brilliant and poor editing, excellent and bad acting, scientific inaccuracies and gorgeous scenery, and four love stories, two of which I found compelling. But I found it both poignant and thought-provoking despite its faults.I didn't know Armand Assante. I missed Belizaire the Cajun, Gotti and whatever else he's done (that's the peril of having a life aside from being a movie reviewer!). But I had the distinct impression he stole his portrayal of a US Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarine Commander straight from Al Pacino's character in "The Scent of a Woman." Sad to say, Pacino did it a lot better. Assante was over the top in much of this movie. So was Rachel Ward--to much and too one-dimensional in her aging party girl portrayal. Bryan Brown was a disappointment--especially compared with his wonderful job in Gorillas in the Mist--but the writing for his character was ridiculous (He is portrayed as a super mathematician who also happens to be a race car driver serious enough to own both a Ferrari and a Formula I car who's a total dunce at love. I am a scientist, and although I have colleagues who are brilliant and dunces at love, none has even a touch of the Mario Andretti in us.) By far the best acting job--despite writing that made her denial seem hysterical--was Jacqueline McKenzie. If she gets good opportunities, she'd going places in film.The movie strains credulity in its geopolitics and science. I have some difficulty imagining how Australia avoids being a target in an all-out nuclear war. A puncture of a radiation suit should be fixable by slapping a hand or some duct tape on the material to keep contaminated air out, and would give a modestly risky, not fatal exposure at radiation levels depicted in the film. But the San Francisco scenes of devastation were silly; nuked cities don't have standing buildings or bridges looking like that, and radiation levels that would kill people in a few days would kill conifers too; they're about as sensitive as we are.There are four main love stories in the film. The triangle between the climate modeler and sub commander with the party girl (unconvincing), the one between the sub commander and his crew (medium), the one among the Australian naval officer, his architect wife and their daughter (wonderful) and the one between the camera and the Australian coast (wonderful). Along with the very disrurbing possibility that nuclear weapons will be used by nations or terrorists in our lifetimes, the latter two love stories are what gives this film its emotional resonance.I also found the sub commander's comings and goings irrational. He changed courses and locations so many times in this movie without clear reason that I wondered whether he had the male equivalent of PMS. Someone with divided loylaties--in this case between his crew and his lover--showing such indecision was more silly than touching.Despite and because of the problems, I gave it a 7.</fullReview>

Pine Gap would definitely be targeted by China if a nuclear exchange would take place between that country and the United States. There would be no need for radiation to seep southward from the Northern Hemisphere.As for this film, Bryan Brown is obnoxious, the ending with Towers deciding to remain behind with Moira terrible, and for these reasons I can only rate this as fair.

I wish I could write these words, instead ?On the Beach is translated into millennium Australia, China and the USA have done the inevitable and bombed each other, the USA have sent their last horse to Australia ?. No more plot.The acting is poor, stiff, unengaged, the soundtrack sounds as if it has been borrowed from the 1959 movie, the colorists got a bit over exited and made a somber film brilliant colour, the vision mixer got exited with his fades and mixes and the cinematographers got exited with their spinning shots. The suspense, the romanticism is missing and replaced by hapless Hollywood stories and lines we have all hearted another time.In the three hours it has taken to watch this movie I would suggest reading the book, perhaps as a TV mini series it was worthwhile, challenging, high budget but combined into a film it is poor, long and needs to be consigned to the shelf.</fullReview>

Now as a much older adult, I rented this newer version by mistake from Netflix, as they sent me the 'updated' version in error. After I got done 'spitting tacks' since I really wanted the 1959 version, I settled in and really enjoyed the 2000 iteration. It is filmed mostly (if not all) in Australia (like the original), yet it is updated with 21st century technology and mentality. They even pay homage to the Coca-Cla bottle sequence. Initially, I was quite ready to write this film off, but after seeing it I am glad I stuck with it. It is a great version, and I think parents must show this to their adolescent children, esp. now with the GW Bush administration at the helm. Very scary all around.

		<fullReview>Both the original book, the first movie and this one ignore (probably for dramatic effect) the real effects of fallout and the movement of weather from northern hemisphere to southern hemisphere.In the real world fallout decays using a rule of 7/10. If you had a lethal radiation dose of 1000 rads one hour after detonation then 7 hours later the dose is down to 100 rads. 49 hours later down to 10 rads etc. It seems that a decreasing dose of 5-10 rads per day is survivable..not pleasant and with horrific genetic problems etc..but people would live. Also the air itself isn't radioactive its the dust carried in it. In the case of the Alaska mission by the sub, 2 years after the event the radiation would have been minimal. Also there isn't that much mixing between northern and southern weather systems. That much radiation would never reach Australia in the first place.Enough comments here on wooden acting...there should be a prize given for the worst American accent. The showing of 2 year old bodies was also strictly for daytime TV viewers..they assuredly don't look like the corpse of the unfortunate girl in the TV station with the famous solar powered laptop...The submarine used was apparently square in shape in some scenes..entirely studio based with stock photography used for outside views..would have been nice if the same class of sub had been used in all the shots. I counted at least 3 different vessels used.Some scenes worked but the hour or so of TV soap setting the relationship triangles was just tedious. Some scenes did work. The original book and movie were noted for how passively people accepted their fate. No riots, no social breakdown. Everybody just quietly went home to die. In this one we had riots, social mayhem etc.The endings of the characters were a mixed bag. Some worked, some were out of character. Scenes that did work were very very strong. The father walking around his house for the last time, carefully turning off the power before joining his wife to inject their baby girl with cyanide and them both drinking down the suicide pills, powerful powerful stuff.The final scene in both book and first movie works well. Moira, already dying of radiation sickness either sitting or standing by her car watching the submarine leave to be sunk out at sea and asking Dwight Towers 'If you are already on your way..then wait for me..' In this movie she was hale and hearty with what looked like a picnic in a basket. odd sort of scene. this leads onto captain Towers abandoning his command in their ultimate 'hour of need' is completely OTT. A captain would never do that.So a real mixed bag but worth a view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really awful rethink.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite frankly, I think that this television rethinking of Nevil Shute's superb, and very moving book is, for the most part, awful. The screenplay has, more or less, jettisoned all the tragic components, and appealing characters of Mr Shute's great novel, in favour of bringing the story up to date, so much so, that the producers might as well have commissioned an original story and screenplay. The 1959 version was, for the most part, much more faithful to the original novel than this sorry effort. 'Truth to tell, neither version does justice to the book, although at least Stanley Kramer's version tries it's best to capture the dignity and quiet heroism of the ordinary characters facing a tragic consequence. The only thing in favour of this rethink is that the facts are brought up to date and we are shown how the mob would react to the end of the world but, apart from that, I will stick to the original film version, despite nearly being driven to distraction with umpteen variations of a theme on Waltzing Matilda, and the terrible miscasting of Ava Gardner. And talking of miscasting, this TV version has more than it's fair share of that; Armand Assante, who has as much charm as the holocaust he is involved in, Rachel Ward who seems all at sea with her part and, like Miss Gardner, is totally wrong for the part of Moira and, surprisingly, the usually excellent Bryan Brown is another casualty of the miscasting department. A1, however, are the brilliant special effects; the scene of a devastated San Francisco makes one's jaw drop, the nuclear dust like falling snow, and the dead victims are the only memorable moments, and as for the end, ugh!!!! The scriptwriters should have been shot for writing such dross and slop, the ending in the book is much more powerful. Maybe one day someone will make a remake that does full justice to a magnificent novel that is just as timely today as it was in the late 1950's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The power of the original movie version of "On The Beach" lay in it's haunting and admirable restraint. Stanley Kramer mercifully kept the polemics to a bare minimum and instead focused on the strengths of people facing the end of the world with quiet dignity. This abysmal remake is a different kettle entirely. Number one, we are served up a mega dose of political correctness that blames America for a nuclear war with China because (horror of horrors) we didn't appease the Communist Chinese who were blockading Taiwan. How nice to see that the Blame America First crowd is still alive and well after all these years.Number two, the cast is awful and can't hold a candle to the likes of Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire. Armand Assante, in Peck's role as Captain Dwight Towers, is woefully miscast (not coming across as a bona fide American for a minute) and in contrast to the quiet strength, dignity and honor projected by Peck, is an unstable, neurotic, immature fool who elicits not one whit of sympathy from me. Even worse is the insufferably arrogant Bryan Brown in Astaire's old role. In the name of "realism" the character has acquired quite a potty mouth. The dignity and gentleness of the characters in the original was what made you weep for the end of humanity because we saw how senseless destruction had eliminated so much that was good and full of promise. By contrast, the people of the remake make you feel as though you might as well say good riddance to the human race if this is emblematic of what's left. This is a living example of why the best movie ideas are best left alone by pompous filmmakers who think they can somehow be more effective in a remake by being more "realistic." In the first place, the entire premise of "On The Beach" isn't even realistic to begin with so what seems like "realistic" behavior in this remake only comes off as pretentious, pompous and hopelessly inane. Avoid this and stick with the original!</fullReview>

I was immediately turned off by the film's inattention to military detail. For example, our hero is both a Captain USN and captain of his submarine but he is often called "Commander," a gaffe in any man's navy. His boat is designated a "SSN," the designation for an attack sub, but it is supposed to me a missle submarine. The mistakes don't end there but you get the idea. The writing is pedestrian: scenes that were genuinely moving in the original, in this one come off as either bathetic or laughable. In his veddy, veddy dramatic scenes, Assante sounds like George C.

		<fullReview>The premises of this mini-series were promising. The major nuclear powers of the world cause a worldwide catastrophe, eradicating all life on earth, except for Australia and the depths of the ocean. And even their destruction by radiation will only be a matter of time. The Aussies set out with a submarine to seek a place that is still habitable, from where civilisation can be rebuilt.After the first episode the series get terribly dull. The Australians' mission has a rather trivial result and on retrospect the way they approached it seems ludicrous. Besides this, the plot gets mixed up with family relations and their coping with the disaster. This is fine, but a choice should have been made; either go for the epic action film about survival of humanity, or make an interesting character study of families with grim prospects. This film tries both and fails in both, resulting in a terrible product.To make matters worse, the acting is utterly unconvincing. Only Grant Bowler manages to put on a credible performance and Rachel Ward seems to have at least some consistency in her play. The other actors don't really know their characters and what drives them. Altogether I would rate this mini-series with a score of 4 out of 10. Don't think this makes it worth your time though; the 3 points in excess of 1 are only because I like the premises and I know there are so many even worse flicks.</fullReview>

Subtlety, character, and the sense of hopelessness and horror are replaced by incredibly bad acting (sometimes just downright weird acting), questionable special effects, lots of corpses, and a plot that simply lacks sense. The novel still haunts me, the original film devastated me and gave me nightmares. This production was simply irritating, unnecessarily long, and populated by people I just could not care about. The issue of suicide seems to ignored completely and replaced by a passivity that's odd in the extreme. I suggest a reading of the Shute masterpiece and a viewing of the original film (seen in the context of the times, when nuclear war was all to real a threat and left many of us with nightmares about the horrible possibility.) This film is a travesty and a morbid curiosity at best. It lacks the powerful message and empathy of the intent of the author and producer of the source material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly heartbreaking look at the end of the world...with some humor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Australian production was aired as a 4 hour film in the US on some cable networks. It should have gotten a wider viewing. It's tremendous. Based on Neville Shute's novel of nuclear Armageddon, it's got a lot of Aussie humor as well as some stark images, and it's far more graphic(people throwing up with radiation sickness) than the original film. It drives home the point-or pointlessness-of nuclear war far more than anything like The Day After done here. All of these films wound up being a little nostalgic of a time when we worried about nuclear war.( Now, thanks to Bush and his idiot cronies, we're worrying again, because he's effectively re-created the feeling of the Cold War by provoking war, and recently Russia, again to a more defensive stance. One wonders if these people could watch a film like this and it would make a difference. Bush and his minority of right wing-nut religious supporters sadly want "Armageddon" because to them, they're going to some afterlife and, it in turn creates-to them-a "Biblical" prophecy fulfilled-rant over). The film has stand-out performances from Armand Assante, Byran Brown and Rachel Ward, and without giving away spoilers(you know the general story) it's griping and graphic in spots, pulling no punches on the effect that impending nuclear radiation has on a society. Brown has some fun throw-away lines, and in one case he "steals" some art from the national gallery, only to realize, everyone else is...what's the point, who will survive to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of faith in Shute's story is sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As noted by one other person above, Nevil Shute would indeed be rolling in his grave over this miniseries. The acting &amp; direction were adequate, however, the bastardization of Shute's powerful story weakens the overall effect of the film. The modernization of the film in several instances is positive (laptop, email, etc.), but there is no need to try to modernize the morality as well. Tower's remaining faithful would have only furthered the development of his 'heroic' character, without significantly damaging the plot. This should be a movie regarding how one person deals with his/her own mortality, not a story of love/lust. That being said....I would like to go further and say that everyone, not just the politicians with their fingers on the triggers, should read the book (or see the 1950s movie if the book can't keep your attention)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible remake-stick to the 1959 original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of remake that would do well in drive-in theaters (if it weren't so darn long and there were still drive-ins). They've managed to "improve" on the classic 1959 Gregory Peck/Ava Gardner film by showing closeups of dead bodies. a little simulated sex, some unnecessary profanity, lots of vomit sprinkled about and a Disney-like ending different from the book and original film. The acting of Armand Assante as the US sub commander was so stiff it's a wonder this "Moira" fell for him at all. Kudos to the actor who played the young Aussie Navy Lieutenant however.If you saw this TV film as your FIRST experience of "On the Beach", immediately go back and rent the 1959 original to see how POWERFUL this filmed story can really be, beyond the mere "nuclear war is bad" kneejerk review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trust me the end of the world is much more appealing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>after being dragged through 3 hours of this film i wanted one of those suicide pills , apart from the bad acting and cheap special effects, which they were somehow impressed about because thats all we ever saw, stock footage of a submarine. The romantic aspect of the film threw it completely off track, If it ever had one, and was completely unbelievable that the last American submarine commando would take two short breaks when submarines are the only hope of survival of the human race! The shiny clean submarine looked more spacious than a palace and the crew seemed pretty happy all the time, maby because they were all clean shaven and had feasts that could feed the five thousand. The only positive part of this film was the Family plot, where the mouther was in denial and left with a very very strong scene at the end but sadly this wasn't going to save this film, it had already sunk (im sorry but u cant have a film as bad as this without some sort of boat-sinking pun)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened? Inane telling of a great story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, where to start! This move was a BIG, and I do mean BIG disappointment! Nevil Shute would be rolling in his grave if he saw what a fine mess they made of his classic story. There was no need for improvement (of Shute's novel). I can understand modernizing the story, to create a greater impact on today's audience, but this was ridiculous! Only remnants of the original story are present. It says "based on the novel by Nevil Shute," but rather, it should have said "the screenwriter simply borrowed Shute's premise, and generated his own story!" Utter tripe! Plain and simply, a travesty of novel adaptation. The nuances of Nevil's book that lent it charm and effectiveness were completely lacking in the movie. I felt little for the characters, as there was no true development. We see a peek here and there of each person, and with the exception of Peter, I didn't like ANY of them! It's not supposed to be like that! If we take a peek at the book, we find that Commander Towers is an overwhelmingly faithful man who pledges his life to his wife and country, to the very end. He could not fathom being with another woman. But, in the movie, what do we have? Torrid love affairs, innuendoes galore, and a Commander who seems to get past that "spot in {his} brain" awful easy! There was no struggle to come to terms with the fact that his family is gone, as in the novel AND the 1959 version. No, instead they just portray Dwight as a much more unscrupulous fellow than in the book. It's not just that, though. The character of Dwight Towers is a noble one, in the book. He has depth, character, feeling, and a soft touch with people. Not so, in this movie. I wanted to smack Armand's character so many times, I was annoyed. He was a boisterous, obnoxious, and blunt captain, and nothing like the original character. I didn't care for him at all. I even like Armand, but his acting was part of it. He craned his neck too much, talked with his lips pursed together, and generally looked like he was sucking a lemon throughout. NOT his best work! Let's see, what else? There are so many things! If you've read this far and are intrigued, I'll tell you more! The character of Julian Osborne (who was actually "John Seymour Osborne" in the book) was never on an island. I have yet to figure out what that had to do with anything! Moira was NOT related to anyone in the story, and in fact lived with her parents on a farm. The race scene in the book was completely alleviated, although there is a hint of it in the end. The way "Julian" died in the film was MUCH different from the book, and I thought this was a big mistake. The book's portrayal was a very poignant telling, and should have been included. If you haven't had the honor of reading it, it may be tough to understand, but let's just say it was a much more powerful scene. The scenes in the streets were not in the novel, other than the garbage. The rioting, violence, sex, and so forth, are a figment of the screenwriter's imagination. I don't think it added anything. I guess they felt like they had to have violence and hatefulness somewhere. The helicopter in the film complicated things, and made the story even MORE different. It wasn't necessary either. In fact, because of its inclusion, the departure scene had to be changed. Not NEARLY as effective! And of course, the big kicker that angered me more than anything else? The fact that they changed the ending!!!!!! What's up with that?! Wasn't Nevil Shute's version good enough, or was it "too outdated?!" How lame is that?! HELLO! I know I keep talking about "the book said this," or "the book had that," but I'm tellin' ya'... the ending of the book almost made me cry, while this made me think "Good riddance!" It was SO insipid! Nothing like the power the book had. NOTHING! It was a bad move on the part of the filmmakers. If nothing else, they could have salvaged the ending and made at least THAT scene a poignant one. It's not that I am basing my review solely on comparison with the book; it's just that it's not even a good film. When I do think back to the book, or even the old movie, this movie just stinks! It doesn't have the potency of either. Perhaps if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't be so harsh. It's hard to get that book out of my brain, though. I have to compare just for the simple fact that this movie is supposed to be based on the book. I'll tell you that if you see this movie, you have no idea what the original story was. Very little of Nevil Shute's ideas exist. I know; you can't include everything from the book, in a movie. But, you'd think they could include SOME of it! Sheesh! The 2 hour, 1959 version with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner was FAR more accurate in its portrayal, than this! They had 4 hours to do this movie justice, and instead chose to make it meaningless drivel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will someone tell me why the US is raving about this inspid aussie TV movie? Most Australians who saw it hated it, and its a well known fact that Aussies cant make action films, we'll leave that to the americans and the europeans who make spectacular action films. On The Beach is basically about a nuclear holocaust that has destroyed most of the world except for a small part in melbourne, australia where everyone is coming to terms with their inevitable doom. I have never watched a mini series so boring, it is completely lifeless and sleep inducing. Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward sizzle? PLEASE!!!!! They couldnt sizzle up the screen to save their lives. Both Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward are hopeless in this, with laughable, feeble dialogue to match. Armand Assante who has done good work is wooden and miscast. The only decent above average actor in this is Jacqueline McKenzie, although she couldnt save it. Dont listen to the hype, On The Beach is a disaster.</fullReview>

Updated version of "On the Beach" from the 1959 movie -- Don't waste your time with this version -- its long side tracks into the realm of romance diatribes - made this quite dull.Too much of a departure from the original movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ever wanted to see how to make a post-apocalyptic scenario unexciting, then look no further. It bears all the markings of a cheap made-for-TV movie, from the flat, over-lit look to the lethargic actors playing boring archetypes. Instead of actually showing us the world ending convincingly, or creating characters that we care about making tough choices, this Hallmark production spends most of its time muddling around with a JAG-like submarine captain and his dull crew of soldiers, as well as an Australian scientist and his ex-wife, as they suffer through trite love triangles, and sit around Australia as nothing much happens for the majority of the running time. This movie lacks both the pathos and the terror of the best end of the world scenarios. Avoid like the plague unless you are an insomniac looking for the DVD equivalent of warm milk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the acting was OK, this was another run of the mill flick that infers that all of the world's ills can be traced to actions by the United States. In this one, if only the US had not come to the aid of Taiwan as China attacked, the world would be a better place. With this line of "PC" or "correct" thought, I wonder what the world would be like if the US had never interceded in WWII or hadn't brought down the Soviet Union. What a wonderful place the world would be to live in today! And of course, the US President bears a striking resemblance to "W" Bush. I wonder why?</fullReview>

It is certainly an anti-military movie, and to some degree, anti-USA. This movie will suck the human spirit out of you.
