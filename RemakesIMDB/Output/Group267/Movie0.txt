		<shortDescription>How to change the face of your life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disfigured girl marries a broad ruffian who loves her for what she is. Plastic surgery will change their life and change this sensible and cultured working class girl into a "femme du monde"... He does not accept it... she escapes him...But matrimonial duties are strong and, remorseful, she turns her back to a mundane future and flies back to him.This movie is about solidarity, it is also about an intelligent woman's condition in an ordinary French milieu. Bourvil did not let her down when she was ugly, Mich?le Morgan will not let him down because surgery miraculously turned her into a beautiful woman.The characters are very well interpreted and their parts are impeccable. I don't know of any remake so far... the theme is nevertheless very actual, quite feminist and would adapt marvelously to our world where one's physical appearance tends to have more importance than one's intellect...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gross misreading of Bourvil's character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is an answer to Eric Sayettat's review: Eric, the husband did not "love her for what she was". He wanted an ugly wife. He was assured that an ugly wife would need him, never cheat on him and never leave. Once she is no longer ugly, a development neither of them could have expected, that assurance collapses. He doesn't love his wife, he uses her.With that in mind, the film poses an interesting idea when the surgeon "makes his pitch" to the husband: With a woman who is so intelligent and sensitive, why shouldn't her beautiful inside be matched by a beautiful outside? Which leads to the question, if she were born with a beautiful outside, would she have been so admirable? Would she have needed to be?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mistranslated title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the movie since its original US release around 1959, but I remember it vividly. Of course I had seen Mich?le Morgan before, so that I knew that her "ugly" appearance before the operation was the result of makeup, but I found it effective. I am still (after almost half a century) touched by the scene in which she brings home the young man who had befriended her in the music store, only to lose him to her pretty but shallow sister.I also remember the mistranslated title (in which the preposition ? was mistaken for the verb a, so that "the two-faced mirror" became "the mirror has two faces"). The mistranslation apparently remained in Barbra Streisand's remake, which I have not seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ugly duckling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American "remake" was concocted by Mrs Streisand ("the mirror has two faces").It's an interesting case because it shows how much a remake can betray the initial writers' intentions.BS made a movie for BS,a movie which takes place in a chic milieu,with of course characters with big prospects (if you've seen Cayatte's movie,just compare Bourvil's seedy school with Bridges' university;Bridges giving lectures in the whole world and Bourvil,in his nine to five world)Let's stop here.Except for the title ,and although BS credits Cayatte for her movie,the two works have nothing to do with each other.André Cayatte,a former lawyer ,became the champion of the good causes.His best works remain his earlier ones,such as "justice est faite" and "avant le déluge".This one ,by no means a remarkable movie,is watchable and thanks to Morgan and mainly Bourvil ,deals with an interesting subject.But more than Morgan's desire to become an attractive woman by the cosmetic surgery way,this is Bourvil's part which retains the viewer's attention:a mediocre teacher,not what they call a handsome man,he's not prepared to accept a beautiful woman.After the operation,he shows Morgan their faces in a mirror and yells:"is this the woman I married?"Abetted by an over-possessive mother (Sylvie,excellent as always),self-satisfied and narrow-minded ,he's from a generation who cannot accept woman's lib;he wants a housewife.That's ,for 1958,the most modern side of the movie.The main flaw is perhaps in the first part:an ugly Mich?le Morgan -thanks to a pretty ridiculous make-up - was not really believable. And the ugly duckling story has not always a happy end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beethoven ....je l'emmerde...et en avant la musique !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting and well acted film with stunning performances from Mich?le Morgan and above all Bourvil. Bourvil is a calculus teacher looking for marriage thru an agency. Michele Morgans parents come across the advert and try to fix up the two together. It should be said that Morgan is portrayed as initially unattractive ( not very convincingly ). The two marry, go off to Venice for a honeymoon, where things start to go awry. Later Morgan has a face lift to become more beautiful and Bourvil gets jealous of this or rather, he doesn't recognize his wife any more and gets violent and takes to drink, and holds the doctor responsible for the face lift ( played by Gérard Oury ) responsible. He then assassinates him whilst Morgan goes off with her sisters husband who has been deserted by his wife. You think they will be happy together in Montréal, Canada, but Morgan learns about her husband having assassinated the doctor and decides to return to France. Used to seeing Bourvil in comic roles, it is strange and rather unnerving to see him in the role of a violent jealous husband who takes to drink. Indeed the title of my comment represents words he spoke whilst under the influence of alcohol. In fact he only pretended to be interested in Beethoven because Morgans parents told him their daughter liked Beethoven and it was to demonstrate a common interest between the two. Needless to say, Bourvils conversation whilst drunk is impressive and violent, and reminds me of a comic sketch he did later on in his life called "L'eau Ferrugineuse" ( iron water ) in which he also portrays himself as a drunk person albeit this time in a comic rôle and not a serious one. A violent film then, without a happy ending, but nevertheless to be recommended for its magnificent actors' performance. From what I have seen, André Cayatte seems to have turned out a number of good films in his day, notably "Justice est faite" .</fullReview>
