		<shortDescription>Mirrors, Puccini, and the triumphant Ugly Duckling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the third film directed and starring Barbara Streisand. It did get a whopping big two Oscar nominations for the best song and for best supporting actress (Lauren Bacall). Neither won. Ms Streisand hit the Oscar gold with best actress for FUNNY GIRL, and since then has met with indifferent success - and almost none with her three directed films. This film is a modern spin on Hans Christian Anderson's tale of the Ugly Duckling. She is the "homely" daughter of Lauren Bacall, a beauty specialist, and her younger sister Mimi Rogers is also beautiful to look at. But Mimi has had two unsuccessful marriages, and is seen at the start having her third marriage - this time to Pierce Brosnan, who initially showed an interest in Streisand. Throughout her entire life she has been having a low esteem problem regarding sex. She is seen breaking dates with Austin Pendleton. We learn her closest friend is Brenda Vaccaro, who has also failed to do well with men. Yet she is a highly articulate and intelligent English professor at Columbia University. It is Columbia University where the other part of this equation is found. Jeff Bridges is a leading figure in the math department. He is finding it difficult to recover from repeated failed sexual relationships. So he puts an add in the newspaper requesting to meet a suitable mate. Mimi Rogers notices the ad, and puts in a response for Streisand. After watching Streisand handle her English class (far better than Bridges can handle his calculus course), he calls her up and sets up a date.Bridges has worked out a perfect solution for his sexual failures. He will marry a woman he can be chummy with, who is intelligent, and who will not require a sexual relationship (and who is so plain looking as not to invite his own sexual responses). Streisand follows this, not knowing to be insulted or to go along. Finally she agrees to go along with it, and they get married. But can they maintain this palsy-walsy pseudo-marriage, or it doomed?Bacall gave a terrific performance as an apparently bitchy woman, who likes to show up her younger daughter (even at the latter's wedding), but who turns out to be more caring and wise than we first suspected. Brosnan gives a good performance, but it could have used a few filler scenes to broaden his character's history (we don't know how he and Streisand first met, nor how Rogers stole him away). Bridges is wonderful as a variant on the absent minded professor, who can't see the trees for the forest he wishes to plant. George Segal (who co-starred with Streisand in THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT two decades earlier) is good as Bridges' friend who sees too clearly how wrong-headed the experiment is. Rogers does well as a nymphomaniac who does not mind marriage as a badge of sexual success, but cannot stand the actual reason for that institution. In the end Streisand does triumph - and she does hear Puccini in her ecstasy (TURANDOT by the way). You see, you are supposed to "hear" great romantic music - especially Puccini - when achieving sexual climax. The film's title is a reminder of the whole issue of surface appearance that bedevils Streisand's ugly duckling (and several other characters too). It is a reminder of dressing up for dating, of looking attractive to men, and of the fact that we face ourselves in the mirror - and so do we face ourselves honestly or lying to ourselves? But watch carefully - in many scenes Streisand will shoot the scene from the point of view of the mirror. It becomes an all encompassing theme in this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barbra Makes Cast Shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say that despite mixed reviews and public jesting, if it weren't Barbra Streisand that made this movie and it were someone else, no one would make fun of it like they do. Everyone just likes to pick on Barbra. But this movie is actually good! This film, about a man (Jeff Bridges) who goes looking for a nonsexual relationship and finds it with a middle-aged dateless professor (Barbra Streisand). As the two leads, these actors shine immensely! Mimi Rogers and Brenda Vaccaro are equally good in their supporting and often comic roles, as is George Segal. But the star of this movie, I must say, is Lauren Bacall as Streisand's beautifully aging mother. Bacall, who is not really known for her comedy roles, took the role and ran with it, making her character hilarious at times, heart-pouring at others. She is terrific! As for the actual storyline of the movie, it is somewhat predictable in its final outcome, but the routes it takes along the way are always interesting. The music is terrific; who doesn't like Luciano Pavarotti's "Nessun Dorma"? A very delightful romantic comedy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can tell you: Wonderful! On the other hand...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mirror has two faces: Barbra Streisand and ... surprise! ... Barbra Streisand! More explicit: the funny Barbra Streisand and the divine Barbra Streisand. Well, this miraculous metamorphosis is of course kind of disgusting and I wouldn't be the first person to argue that Barbra Streisand has a tendency to fancy herself pretty much (and I myself was already able to tell so from the unnecessarily long ending of "The Prince of Tides" - a very good movie). But as annoying as it may sometimes be, this is an extremely well-done and multi-faceted movie. Let me try to tell you, why I voted "7".It starts rather mediocre when Streisand and Jeff Bridges get to know each other, talk some silly stuff and behave like little children. From time to time it gives a number of very good lines to Lauren Bacall, who is perfect as Streisand's mother. By the time Streisand and Bridges get married you are tempted to say: "Yes, very nice, but it's crap actually, isn't it?" But you won't think of saying that in the end.The movie is a romantic comedy - containing a couple of cliches, fine - but with a new, non-cliche structure. This is no kitsch, not at all, oh no! Instead, it's made up of very good lines and very truthful moments. These are connected in a way that makes our emotion rise but leaves us unable to tell which words, which gestures made it rise. How come? The romance doesn't develop in the way we would expect it and have seen it many times before, no, this romantic comedy goes the long way round: First there is only a small deal of attraction, then there is previously unknown disillusionment - a black hole almost - and then love enters the stage. The final romantic scene fits into romantic comedy conventions, but it also fits into the picture and Streisand and Bridges deserve it. What a wonderful movie!Basically Barbra Streisand is a good actress, but she loves exaggerating. She is able to manage difficult scenes, but she tries to be funny where being funny can't work and sometimes she's just hopping through the scene like a twittering sparrow instead of performing the emotions required for that scene. And after her metamorphosis she's more interested in her make-up than in her character.Lauren Bacall plays a mean, self-addicted and vain old beast with a heart and a vulnerable soul. The scene where mother and daughter talk openly in the kitchen is wonderful. Even Pierce Brosnan is better than I would have expected.Finally, the movie shows us the great versatility of Jeff Bridges: you've never seen him so very soft before (rude as he was in "The Fabulous Baker Boys", cool in "Nadine" or smooth and evil in "Jagged Edge"). However, he is exaggerating, too: which man can act this untruthful and affected?! In the scenes from Streisand's and his marriage his character is almost eerie - may this be good or bad for the movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mirror Has Two Faces is one of Barbra's finest works. In this movie you have two people,(Barbra and Jeff Bridges),who are both weary and skeptical about "true" love, but both have different outlooks on it. Barbra is optimistic and hopeful, while Jeff Bridges feels that the only way to make a relationship last is to completely take the sex out of it and have a loving friendship only,(one based strictly on companionship). The movie explores both of the main characters inner fears and inner struggles in a way that, not unless you're not human, you can certainly relate with. For instance: In reality, Barbra's character felt inwardly about herself that she wasn't good enough....wasn't attractive enough. She liked the idea of marrying Jeff Bridges character under the premise of strictly a loving companionship only because her character feels...well, my goodness! Here's a really handsome man that really likes me and likes being with me. He wants to take sex out of the equation, but...that's okay. It's NOT what I really want, but I'll "SETTLE". On the other hand, Jeff Bridges character, Gregory, feels that with all his failed relationships of the past, that if he takes sex out of the picture, that maybe, just maybe, it'll last. He wants a true, loving, one on one relationship with another woman but he really doesn't want to have it be without physical love either. But...out of fear that it wont last, he decides that he's got to take the physical part out of it, even though deep down inside, he doesn't really want that. So...he "SETTLES" as well. In reality, they have both truly fallen in love with each other, but both are trying to abide by what they both agreed to; a loving friendship only, with absolutely no physical love. This creates many, many tense situations between them that end up creating very funny scenes and lines. Theres a scene right after they get married and the two of them are in their home, all done for the day unpacking and getting settled. Jeff Bridge's character says to Barbra's..."So! What do you want to do now?" Barbra, innocently meaning to suggest they both go to sleep, shrugs her shoulders and says..."Go to bed". Jeff's eyes get all nervous looking and he starts having difficulty breathing. Barbra's character replies..."No! I mean, to sleep, that is! One goes to bed...to sleep!" A little later on she is unloading all this frustration and tension to her sister Claire in a phone conversation. She says..."I don't know how to ask for it Claire!" Meaning sex. She continues to say..."Sometimes we're so "polite" to each other I feel like we're two roommates living in a charm school!" Her sister replies..."Just give him a "look" that makes him "know" you want sex!" Barbra's character then replies..."I tried that once. He thought I had something in my eye!" Yes indeed, there are many great moments in this film. In the end, what's great is that both of the characters understand that what they did was "settle", and "settling", especially with something as important as true love is never a good idea. But more importantly, they learn that in the end, anything truly worthwhile, sometimes you have to take risks for. Unless you are really that jaded, you can not leave this movie by it's end without feeling,(even if just a little),good! The supporting cast is great, including Lauren Bacall, Brenda Vacaro and George Segal. A wonderful film. Truly one of Barbra's finest. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Streisand fans only; a no-holds-barred exercise in Ego</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know other people think highly of Streisand's skills as a singer and an actress, and I understand their reasons for feeling that way. In fact, I agree she was excellent in "Hello Dolly", "What's Up, Doc?" and "Funny Girl", I agree that she can belt out a Broadway show tune with the best of them, and I agree that she has enormous charisma.But I am not a member of the Streisand-As-Diva Fan Club. As great as her talents are, her taste sucks, and she consistently overestimates and overreaches her talents in pursuit of really cheesy and juvenile self gratification. So we get misfires like "Yentl" (which Isaac Bashevis Singer hated), and we also get bloated exercises in ego,like her remake of "A Star Is Born", "The Prince Of Tides", "Nuts", and this piece of fish-wrap.The problem with this movie isn't in her performance, which is good in the service of the script. The problem is in the writing, and it's the same problem with every other recent Streisand film: she wants to be viewed as some kind of beauty queen and sexual powerhouse, and apparently she also wants to be seen as 20-30 years younger than she actually is. But with her face and features, that just isn't going to happen. Well, if your definition of sexual powerhouse includes overwhelming belief in and seriousness about your talents (ie, Diva-like self-importance), maybe she could skate by there. But no one will ever include her in a Playboy calendar or a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. Accept it, Barbra, and move on. But the goldarn movie just won't let it rest. In every scene, even the ones where Streisand is supposed to be a dowdy ugly duckling, her skin is perfect, her makeup is perfect, the lighting on her is perfect, and her every line and delivery is calculated to frame her in the most sympathetic and flattering way possible. In every scene she's in (and Streisand is front and center 90% of the time), Streisand the director is shoving herself in the viewers' face, saying "Aren't I sexy? Aren't I precious? Aren't I actually the most winsome, lovable, attractive young thing you ever saw, even if the script says I can't get a man - yet?' As Joe Queenan puts it, her entire 'transformation' from ugly duckling to desirable goddess "consists of losing six ounces, getting a frizzy poodle haircut, and buying a cheap dress." She looks exactly the same as before, only now Jeff Bridges' character is supposed to be stunned by her desirability and beg to take her back. And let's face it, even in the persona of a nerd math professor, Jeff is still one of the sexiest leading men of the last two decades. So this is about on the same level as me fantasizing about Dominique Swain begging me to take her back after I buy some new suits and lose an inch off my waist on a low carb diet.And in response to Jeff begging to get back together, Streisand the director has Streisand the actress deliver an "I desired you once, but now I've moved beyond you" oration that is a patent by-the-numbers REVENGE fantasy put down; it's the speech composed in the fantasies of any girl who was ever dumped by any boy in the history of romance. Hell, it's not a speech, it's a bumper sticker. And it is delivered with such relish that you can literally see Barbra getting her own back from every unhappy romance or unrequited longing she ever felt. It is completely self indulgent and has a stale musty aura of intellectual and emotional self-diddling. IMO, this is supposed to be the emotional climax of the film, but it's got the maturity of an old "Virginia Slims" commercial. On the positive side, this is an 'A' level production, with great sets and costumes, good performances from Lauren Bacall and Mimi Rogers, and even a few funny lines. And Barbra sounds great on the sound track singing the title piece. Note to Barbra Streisand: You are one of the most admired and respected singers and actresses in the world. You have millions of dollars and unlimited license to undertake any recording project you want. You even look pretty good in a middle-aged-dynamic-businesswoman kind of way. You've won. Please, please, stop scoring easy points in self-indulgent movie fantasies about how gorgeous and young you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is my favorite film because I love Barbra's talent and charisma! The film has major heavy hitters. I knew everyone in the cast! Even Lauren Bacall was in this ! I thought Babs looked better at the beginning than in the end. I couldn't function through the week if I didn't see this film ! I ain't kidding. The movies beginning got off to a good start and continued to develop interest. I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Babs and hasn't seen it. Even though the critics hated the film it still was fun and sort of like Cinderella in ways. Great Soundtrack! Lots of great moments and see it around Thanksgiving time, I did and I loved it10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly enjoyable film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those people out there who are thinking 'how could a movie directed by and starring Barbra Streisand be good?' please leave your preconceptions at the door! This film, in my opinion, is a thoroughly enjoyable and delightful romantic comedy.Babs stars as Rose, a Professor of Literature at Columbia University in New York who is basically, desperate and dateless. Jeff Bridges (in a humorous and charming performance) plays Professor Gregory Larkin, a man who is constantly losing his mind over unobtainable women. In his frustration and belief that "sexual attraction ruins all relationships", he decides to place an ad in the paper for a female companion, "appearance unimportant". When Rose's sister (Mimi Rogers) answers the ad on her behalf, the 2 begin a relationship that eventually reveals what love is really all about.This film is funny, moving and romantic. My husband really doesn't really enjoy it, which could indicate the average male's perspective, but I'd highly recommend it for someone looking for a soppy night in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weeper for Just the Right Movie Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. If you accept this movie for what it is, it's actually pretty entertaining. It's a Cinderella story for middle-aged folks. I won't recap the film. That's not my job. I'm here only to give you my impressions on the watchability and impact of this movie. If you love Barbra Streisand (and I do) and you love Jeff Bridges (and I do), you will love this romantic comedy. Both are at their funny, witty, comedic best in this film. Mimi Rogers is gorgeous as Bab's sister. (Oddly, Netflix has her mistakenly identified as Fran Drescher on its website.) Lauren Bacall is stunningly beautiful - still. Overall, the film has a lot of heart. What I love about Streisand is that she knows her weaknesses and her strengths, and plays both up to much effect in this film, which she directed and, I believe, co-wrote. This is a quintessential "chick flick," the kind you enjoy on a raining Sunday night with a big bowl of popcorn. If you are in just the right mood for a film that shamelessly exploits your feelings about romance, this one is it. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Mirror Has Two Faces" is, actually, a great romantic comedy. It counts with all the elements of a successful one. It has a sympathetic main character(Barbra Streisand's Rose), a charming good looking man that falls in love with her (Jeff Bridges) and a great supporting cast(including an Oscar deserving performance from Lauren Bacall). But it's main problem is that it is directed by Barbra Streisand. Those who are familiarized with Streisand's previous work (Yentl, The prince of tides) will agree that she loves to be the center of her movies, and she hurts her films by making this, and "The mirror has two faces " is not the exception.The story centers on Rose Morgan(Barbra Streisand), a literature teacher in Columbia's University, and on Gregory Larkin(Jeff Bridges), a math teacher on the same university. Gregory looks for a relationship based on mutual respect and not in physical attraction, and Rose looks for any relationship with an average good looking man. So when Rose's sister joins them by answering an internet advertisement put by Gregory, they begin to date and the even get married, without having any physical contact. But when Rose looks for it, Gregory argues with her and she decides to go to her home with her mother(Lauren Bacall).Until this point of the film, Streisand looks at her character(Rose) with objectivity, never making of her a very desirable good looking woman. But in the second half of the film she works in her characteristic self absorbing way. Rose decides, thanks to her mother's advise, to change her appearance. So, she begins to do some exercise, to wear make up and very elegant clothes, and to eat less. But when Gregory looks at her, he only criticizes her and she goes from home telling him that she doesn't love him anymore. At the end, Gregory realizes that he loves Rose, and they both end up together in a very romantic closing scene.Many people, specially critics, hated the movie arguing that it was another vanity project made by Sterisand, but it much more than that. "The mirror has two faces" is a serious analysis to the relationships and how the physical and intellectual part influences them. It is true that the movie would work better if Sterisand had chosen another woman to play her character, but at the end the result is a satisfying movie with great performances and a good story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mirror Has Two Faces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand the meaning of the title, although the leading actress did look in the mirror quite a bit, anyway, what appealed to me about seeing this film was a good cast, and the fact that produced and directed by Barbra Streisand. Basically college professor Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges) has been let down with sexual relationships many times, and places a personal advert to find a woman companion, only condition a good knowledge of something, and he has no care of looks and (although they wouldn't know) no sex appeal or interest. Then he meets plain English literature professor Rose Morgan (Golden Globe nominated Streisand), after her sister Claire (Mimi Rogers) answers the personal ad. For a long while it seems they both have the same opinions of how sex and true love can complicate a good relationship, and they eventually marry not for true love or sex, but just a good companionship. Of course Rose is getting very bored, and starts to get desperate for sex, and even though Gregory might be the same (slightly) he backs away from the opportunity. For a while, they split and she tries her chances with a man she once loved (and probably vice versa) before he married Claire, Alex (Pierce Brosnan). When that doesn't work she decides to change her image to be more appealing to herself and others, of course when Gregory sees he is quite shocked, but don't worry, he sees he has true feeling for her as well. Also starring Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Lauren Bacall as Hannah Morgan, George Segal as Henry Fine, Brenda Vaccaro as Doris, Austin Pendleton as Barry and Elle Macpherson as Candice. There are a couple of giggly moments, and the cast of a few good stars kept me interested, but it did have its many moments of pure cheesiness, but still worth watching. The Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song "I Finally Found Someone" by Streisand and Bryan Adams in the end credits is good, if only Streisand and Bridges weren't doing a long dance in the streets. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Marvin Hamlisch. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mirror Has Two Faces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mirror Has Two FacesWhen our local cable company started running this film a month ago, I had almost forgotten that I had seen it in the theater when it first came out. I was reminded of how much I had missed the film and started watching it again. I was surprised and pleased to find that I still enjoy it and I've watched it faithfully every time that it's shown.Jeff Bridges plays a Columbia University mathematics professor, Gregory Larkin. He is good looking but a boring, lonely man, whose relationships with beautiful women never work out. He wants one that is platonic, which is founded on respect, intelligence and a passion for ideas. Inspired by a television ad, he takes out his own personal ad and finds several applicants, which includes another Columbia University literature professor Rose Morgan through her sister, Claire, who answers the ad. Gregory calls her one night after visiting her class and asks her to dinner where the two of them hit it off. Three months later, Gregory proposes and explains the arrangement, although, he tells her that if she wants sex, given enough of a warning, he'll be able to provide that. Rose accepts, even though she wants more. She gets her chance after she helps Greg with his teaching and he asks her if he can return the favor. And that's when things go horribly wrong.While I'm not a big fan of Barbra Streisand, I find this romantic comedy to be witty and intelligent. The acting is sensational on all fronts, especially from Barbra Streisand, Jeff Bridges and Lauren Bacall who are its standouts. The chemistry between Ms. Streisand and Mr. Bridges is perfect and their romantic scenes are wonderful to watch, especially the final scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES **** There are close to no gentlemen callers who are waiting to romance professor Rose Morgan (Barbra Streisand), so she's learning to settle for a life with no man by her side. To her surprise, she is eventually pursued by a Math teacher (Jeff Brydges) who seeks a platonic marital relationship. Needlessly appreciative of the fact that any man - much less an attractive man - wants her, she becomes frustrated with the lack of intimacy between them as they draw together and eventually wed. The role-playing between Streisand and her antagonistic mother (Lauren Becall) adds intensity to the story. A fine work by Streisand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable romantic comedy; much better than it's reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Streisand's third directorial effort was greeted with surprisingly vicious reaction from both fans and critics, nearly all of whom immediately labeled it as an over-the-top vanity piece. It also had considerable difficulty at the box office. After opening with strong numbers, the $45 million budgeted film took a nose dive and did not recover. It ended up taking in $46 million domestically ($65 million worldwide), which was a respectable take, but far from the blockbuster status of films like A STAR IS BORN or THE PRINCE OF TIDES. When considering all of the above information, it's a bit surprising to discover that the film is nothing more than an entertaining and heart-felt romantic comedy. In hindsight, it's hard to understand why a such a harmless and light-weight film became such a lighting rod for scathing reviews and harsh comments.While the storyline is predictable, the movie is actually very well-done with a brisk pace, compelling characters, and a witty screenplay. The finale may come down a bit heavy-handed on the "message" end, but the build-up is effective enough to merit this indulgence. Though MIRROR doesn't match her previous two directorial efforts, Streisand does once again pull off the various actress/producer/director roles with great efficiently, and this results in an effective star vehicle for the then-54-year-old film legend. Jeff Bridges received a lot of flack for his completely unselfconscious portrayal, but I admire how completely he throws himself into the silly role. Lauren Bacall is brilliantly biting and luminous in her turn as Streisand's mother, a role that earned her first (and so far only) Oscar nomination. Mimi Rogers is also fun as Streisand's slutty younger sister, as is Brenda Vaccaro as her self-deprecating best friend - although Pierce Brosnan is wasted as a gigolo-like suitor. All in all, an enjoyably fluffy film, undeserving of the criticism it routinely receives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair to middling romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All my life I pretty much avoided films starring Jeff Bridges (although I really liked his brother Beau). Looking back, it was more due to the movies Jeff Bridges appeared in, which didn't suit my taste. Here, however, Bridges is excellent as the somewhat befuddled math professor who is afraid of intimacy. The other reason I didn't watch this film until now (and it has been out for 20 years) is that I somehow had no idea it was essentially a light romantic comedy. And, it's a very good one.But I think there's a huge flaw in this film -- the Streisand character seems totally inconsistent in terms of behavior. And I'm not even talking about how the character changes when her life situation changes. I'm talking about inconsistent in terms of being an ebullient college profession by day and a near shut-in by night. Nope. I don't buy it.Lauren Bacall is interesting as the mother; quite stereotypical, but still interesting. George Segal has a rather mundane role as a friend for Bridges. Pierce Brosnan and Brenda Vaccaro have significant, though not interesting roles as friends who move the plot along.It's good, but not great, overly long, and very nice fluff. Not one of Streisand's best, but not bad. ehhhhh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirror's Two Faces Are Barbra Streisand and Jeff Bridges.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996): Dir: Barbra Streisand / Cast: Barbra Streisand, Jeff Bridges, Lauren Bacall, Mimi Rogers, George Segal: Clever romantic comedy regarding relationships and our warped expectations. The two faces of the mirror could have a variety of meanings but the theme that emerges the strongest is the sex and marriage issue. Barbra Streisand removes sex to demonstrate the value of friendship. She plays a teacher who lives with her mother and is insecure with regards to her appearance. Jeff Bridges sits in on a teaching session and admires her methods. They strike up a friendship and agree that sex is ruining relationships. When they do marry the pressure of sex invades her. Intelligent film delivered with wit and humour by Streisand. She previously directed The Prince of Tides and Yentl. She plays a smart yet sympathetic woman of independence and insecurity. Jeff Bridges completes the chemistry as her husband. Strong supporting work by Lauren Bacall as Streisand's mother who brings comic wisdom. Mimi Rogers plays her sister whose husband was the sight of Streisand. Both roles are more or less comic placements yet portrayed with great care. Outside the leads, other roles are either brief or flat. While somewhat predictable it is still a wonderful portrait of relationships that make the mirror worth looking into.

It gets a bit too standard rom-com in its last 3rd, and I don't think many male viewers can (or want to) relate to a lead who nearly faints each time he encounters an attractive female. I agree also with other reviewers writing this film is a vanity project of Streisand (e.g. the reaction of the male students after she loses some pounds and wears nicer clothes - c'mon!). On the other hand, the film just does so many things right that it ends up being very enjoyable (that is, if you like romantic comedies). The dialogue is smart, there are a lot of funny scenes, and especially the great chemistry between Streisand and Bridges as well as Streisand and Bacall stands out. Bacall steals every scene she is in and has the best one-liners, Bridges and Streisand also do a great job. I especially liked the scenes somewhere in the middle of the film, where both of them get more intimate (which is actually quite hot), followed by an argument. This argument just feels so rough and real. This more toned down acting is where Streisand really shines. It is also nice how Bridges comes to realize how much he misses his wife whilst he travels, which has nothing to do with how she changes her appearance later on. So it's not the typical ugly duckling story, where the male lead only shows interest after she turned into a swan (he actually rejects the swan - as probably much of the audience will do - we want the 'old Rose' back!). This is a nice contrast to Brosnan's character, whom he portrays as a wonderfully shallow, simple-minded pretty face. Unfortunately, in trying to wrap things up, the film becomes a rather formulaic rom-com with cheesy ending. A bit more of fine-tuning by another director (removing the Streisand-vanity-scenes and the sometimes too strong female wishful thinking) could have made it a great flick. For me though, the acting (of the entire cast) and many funny and witty lines save this movie to be still well above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clichéd Romantic Meant for Barbra Streisand's Biggest Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters in "The Mirror Has Two Faces", all neurotic, intellectual middle class types, are tired of the manipulations of classic Hollywood. You grow up with an understanding that your first kiss will be set to the sounds of triumphant orchestral melodies; you expect that you'll find someone so perfect for you that doubt will hardly ever be a factor in your relationship. But in real life, things like that don't happen. More often than not, you settle, afraid of becoming a spinster ? and if you do happen to become a spinster, you may as well mope around about your loneliness while dreaming along with "It Happened One Night".Rose (Barbra Streisand) falls under the category of the latter. She doesn't mope around though: she has completely given up. She knows that she isn't a great beauty, and she knows that her biological clock is falling into the pre-stages of menopause. Instead of fretting over her consistently non-existent love life, she embraces her solitude, filling up voids with fattening muffins you find in those plastic wrappers defined by their gigantic, illegible Swedish titles.Rose, around fifty, still lives with her mother (Lauren Bacall), a past beauty who spends her days as a critical showoff who wishes she were 25 again. Rose teaches literature at a local university, analyzing the doomed lust of Shakespeare's ensembles to the delight of her students ? to her surprise, she captures the attention of Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges), a mathematics professor who lectures at the very same college. Gregory isn't interested in her like Clark Gable was interested in Claudette Colbert, though; he wants to find love that doesn't have to be strewn together by sex. He wants an emotional connection, a union that requires two souls to unite through their minds rather than their bodies. Rose is skeptical, but she doesn't want to be an old maid the rest of her life ? so she throws caution to the wind and starts dating this seemingly asexual oddball.After courting for months, they get married. But only a few moments into the marriage does Rose realize that she can't handle a relationship that isn't, you know, normal. In the process, she rediscovers herself, giving herself a makeover (a part of a cringe-worthy montage sequence that involves lots of treadmills) and a new attitude. A fresh appearance can't instantaneously change things, however; Rose is forced to decide whether she wants to continue being a part of a sexless coupling.It's ironic that so much of "The Mirror Has Two Faces" is spent criticizing cinematic romantic comedies for being so manipulative, with their obligatory happy endings and scheming instances of mood music. Because, like those "manipulative" rom-coms, the film is pretty manipulative itself. It has an obligatory happy ending and scheming instances of mood music too ? so what's the deal?Streisand, making her third directorial feature here, doesn't have anything particularly deep in mind. She wants to create a romantic comedy without the seemingly flawless young people with nothing at stake, instead focusing on middle-aged obsessives that have quite a bit more baggage than charm. Putting Streisand's manipulations aside, "The Mirror Has Two Faces" is a successful film, only because it doesn't have a problem with being likable. Likability is nearly a distraction; this is far from an excellent film, but Streisand's indestructible appeal makes it impossible not to slightly, slightly hope that Rose and Gregory will, against the odds, have sex (GASP!) and live happily ever after.Fans of the immortal Babs will figure that the film is the best thing since chicken fried steak; but those who simply appreciate her star power (me) won't be so sold. Streisand is, as usual, impossible to dislike, yet some of her co-stars, particularly Bridges, don't fit into her syrupy vision so easily. Bridges may be one of the leads, but his character's "no sex" theory is difficult to sell, considering Bridges portrayal is shrill, stuttering, and awkward. Most of "The Mirror Has Two Faces" is formulaic romantic comedy-drama glitter, set to the tune of your grandma's movie preferences (not a bad thing; formula can be effective, and the film is good); its bright spot is Bacall, who steps out from behind Streisand's Hallmark sheen and represents something real. It's worth your time if you can stomach sentimentality and appreciate Streisand's warm talent. If your gag reflex is weak, though, avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Streisand wants to be sure we don't miss a trick--but I missed the "Ugly Ducking" Babs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>College professor Rose--bubbly, amiable, but dowdy--enters into a sexless marriage with another teacher; she attempts to seduce her celibate hubby, cries when he rejects her (ostensibly because she's unattractive), but eventually becomes gorgeous with some Zen-like wisdom (and a make-over). Remake of an obscure 1958 French drama, "The Mirror Has Two Faces", directed by star Barbra Streisand, emphasizes its points about inner beauty to the nth degree. Barbra underlines everything--either with a shot too many or with BLARING romantic music--but when Rose makes her transformation, the whole center of the picture slips away (and the main characters never regain their balance). A much more telling story would've started where this picture actually ends. Don't give us kisses in the street after two hours of yammering about the short shelf-life of modern romance. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frivolous, satisfying rom-com, but bog-standard for all that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears that conventional paint-by-numbers romantic comedies are the order of the day. While writing these reviews, I try to be as original as possible, whenever possible. But when films (particularly rom-coms) are so alike, it's really a case of changing names and writing pretty much the same thing. So while `The Mirror Has Two Faces' is quite satisfying, it's hardly earth shattering or anything we haven't seen before. The world won't collapse if you don't get to see the film. One thing that bogs down the standard of these movies is the `playing it safe' aspect. The inability to take risks doesn't guarantee consistent interest. Also, it more often relies on fluffy, glossy charm as opposed to good laughs and memorable situations. But it has its moments. It also makes some good points in showing the superficiality of `love'. But it soon falls into line with the slick `deux ET machina' ending which may be appropriate with most movies for this genre, but giving the circumstances, it was a wrong move. Directed by singer/ songwriter/ actress/ newcomer director Barbara Streisand, there is a gently unpreachy tone throughout, but things are all too much in her favour. While she brings a spunky (if not increasingly feministic) charm to the proceedings, it's just not realistic. She takes it upon herself to recreate New York as the perfect haven for frumpy, single, middle-aged women. It's highly questionable that se should be the `coolest' person in a class of hundreds of college students, and also by able to memorise all of their names. And it's true what they say. She looks better before, as opposed to after, her transition to a `sex goddess'.The support, on the other hand, is quite good all round. While none of them are suited to this genre, they're good all across the board. The standout is Lauren Bacall (on Oscar nominated form) as the typically overbearing mother. And Jeff Bridges finally finds a definition of character with an underwhelming, but convincing performance.Certainly not flawless and very much cliched, `The Mirror Has Two Faces' is latte-light material. But certainly not the worst of its type, this is satisfying for what it's worth, and most importantly of all, there are a couple of laughs to be had along the way. My IMDb rating: 5.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as it is built up to being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to begin by saying that, yes, I am a Barbra Streisand fan. However I am not the type of fan that regards everything she does as perfect. For instance I can safely say that "Yentl", while a very good idea and a noble effort was overindulgent and in desperate need of editing. Now as far as this film is concerned I never went to see it because I was told that all it was about was some ugly Jewish girl who in order to get her man bleaches her hair and loses weight. But after a spontaneous rental I was surprised to find myself actually enjoying it. At the end I realized that it wasn't as "sexist" and "anti-woman" as I had initially believed. Instead, it took seeing the "made-up" Barbra for Jeff Bridges to realize how beautiful the "un-made" Barbra was. The film was well acted all around, and well directed by Ms. Streisand.</fullReview>

With a running time of 126 minutes, here's a film we'll not forget for at least the next 2 decades! Streisand's direction is perfect, so is her signing and her acting. An all-rounder! Jeff Bridges pitches in an Incredible performance. The Academy Award-Winning Actor never disappoints! Lauren Bacall is fantastic as Streisand's old and groovy mom. Pierce Brosnan is very okay, mainly because he gets nothing to do but stock his wife everywhere! On the whole, 'The Mirror Has Two Faces' is a classic... Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

It exists mostly as a vanity project for Streisand, who goes from frump to glamour puss over the course of its two-hour running time. Jeff Bridges is always winning and likable, and so he is here as Streisand's love interest. His presence is almost enough to make up for the tired and generic theme song.The film is probably most famous for NOT bringing Lauren Bacall a much-anticipated Oscar, which went instead to Juliette Binoche in one of the biggest upsets in recent memory.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lovely Romantic Comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so pleased as I read the previous posts for this film and was pleasantly surprised to learn that the "Death To Barbra Streisand" Knell that seems to pervade Hollywood seems to be limited to just Hollywood and there are people out there who keep an open mind regarding Streisand and her work. Streisand mounts one of her most entertaining and romantic films with THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES, a beguiling story about a romance between two lonely college professors that ends up turning into a platonic marriage. Yes, you can see how this is going to end thirty minutes into it, but the journey to that the ending is such a pleasure. Yes, despite Rose Morgan's Plain Jane demeanor, this is a bit of vanity piece for Streisand, but not so much as YENTL was. It's a very "Barbra" film with very "Barbra" themes and messages that we expect from her and for those of us who love Barbara, that's OK. Streisand has surrounded herself with a superb supporting cast. Lauren Bacall was robbed of an Oscar for her performance as Rose's vain, insensitive mother and Mimi Rogers was amusing as Rose's vain, insensitive sister. I loved the scene at Rogers' wedding where she threatens to have her mother's birth certificate blown into a birthday card and Bacall dryly replies, "I should never have encouraged you to speak." Pierce Brosnan and Brenda Vaccarro also offer some strong moments. But the most pleasant surprise for me in this film is the performance by Jeff Bridges as the slightly nerdy calculus professor, Gregory Larkin. Bridges makes this character so likable and injects him with a perfect combination of nerdiness and sexiness at the same time. Very few actors can pull that combo off, but Bridges does it so effortlessly. You just want to take Gregory in your arms and say, "It's OK, baby, it's OK..." Streisand has directed this film with a surprising amount of quiet sensibility and has given us an albeit predictable, totally winning romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the problem with the character before?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About the only redeeming characteristics are that Jeff Bridges' character realizes that he has been a schmuck, and Lauren Bacall's character realized how hurtful the cumulative effect of words can be. Otherwise, I found myself becoming annoyed at the overall message.First off, why must a woman re-make herself totally in order to be seen as sexually attractive? Rose looked far better at the start of the movie than she did at the end. Secondly, What was wrong with the way "Rose" looked at the start of the movie? Totally comfortable, quirky, and sensible. And the idea that a size eight is considered "fat" .... well, I just rolled at that one.Rose does repudiate sheer looks by the end of the film, but the moment is almost too tiny to be noticed. The bulk of the film shows a woman thinking she's ugly, when she is far from it (but that's a Streisand trope: Babs, you have a big nose, and who cares? You look fine and very attractive), and thinking that comfortable clothes mean frumpiness. It encourages the over-awareness of body--since when has a size eight been "too fat"?????? Basically, Rose's re-awakening to the importance of mind and self, not external standards of beauty, is too little to compensate for all the rest of the film.</fullReview>

And as for playing Mimi Rogers' younger sister... well... it really doesn't help that she looks fifty rather than... what... thirty-five or something?

		<shortDescription>Your Own Private Math Party</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mirror Has Two Faces is one of those old fashioned romance stories, in which Barbra Streisand and Jeff Bridges prove that love can be had in middle age and romance might even be better at that point.Both Streisand and Bridges are a pair of Columbia University professors, she of English, him of Mathematics. They've come to opposite conclusions about life and love. Barbra wants some love in her life, but Bridges having been burned a little too often in relationships is swearing off sex. I like what director Streisand did with Bridges's character. I can identify with the students in his class, you spell it B-O-R-I-N-G. There are some people who are turned on by math, I'm not one of them. I sat through too many teachers who could not pique my interest in the slightest and many who were like Bridges as Barbra describes him, having his own math party at the blackboard. No one ever made it relevant for me in my academic career.Barbra didn't do too bad with the rest of the cast which includes her mother Lauren Bacall, her sister Mimi Rogers, her wolfish brother-in-law Pierce Brosnan, best friend Brenda Vaccaro, and Bridges best friend George Segal who is a cheerful middle aged hedonist and loving every minute of it.Lauren Bacall got her one Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress and I thought sure she would cap her career with that Oscar. She lost to Juliette Binoche for The English Patient. But Bacall is absolutely stunning as the mother who Barbra convinces that her life isn't over either.For the acclaim it got, The Mirror Has Two Faces should have gotten a lot more, including a Best Director nomination for Barbra Streisand. And this review is dedicated to all of us who had to sit through a boring professor having his own private math party at the blackboard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started to watch "The Mirror has two faces" because of only one reason: Lauren Bacall. She was one of the very greatest actresses of the golden age of Hollywood and late Humphrey Bogart's charming lady in Howard Hawks' classic Philip Marlowe thriller "The Big sleep" (1946) and I was simply interested in finding out what was she like 50 years later, at the age of 72. I have to admit I was surprised to notice how wonderful she still was. Her performance is the best part of "The Mirror has two faces". The movie itself wasn't really the type I usually love to watch. Barbra Streisand clearly aimed up to direct a peculiar, refreshingly different kind of a romantic comedy. Truth is this was pretty much a basic love story: very unsurprising, very traditional, very trivial. Still, this is one of those movies you have to watch all the way through when you've started. And that's what I did.</fullReview>

Barbara and Jeff were funny, cute, and to a point overly affectionate. When Rose finally pins Jeff and Jeff rejects her...That scene is terrific, but sad.

		<fullReview>Well, after watching The Mirror Has Two Faces, I felt that I had to comment on it. I know that the film didn't do so great at the boxoffice, but I still believe that the film encaptures a very significant point: that being a lesson about beauty and vanity. The film portrays a woman who has waited all of her life for Mr Right - until she finally realises that to wait for it isn't enough - she has to seek it aswell. Lauren bacall is brilliantly cast as Barbra's mother - a woman who has been beautiful all of her life, and Jeff Bridges is great as a man who looks for something deeper than sexual attraction. I thought that the film had a hidden message which is evident in the way the story develops. I enjoyed the film, which encompassed dry patches of homour, but still maintained emotion and drama within the story. I thought that the film was well cast, and that the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and barbra Streisand was apparent - even though the script required them to feel uncomfortable around each other. At the end of the film, the movie has defined itself as a romantic comedy which should remain timeless, and be a lesson to us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If a Girl Isn't Pretty...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the name of a comically mocking song from "Funny Girl" when a group of yentas discuss the romantic prospects of a young Fanny Brice. It seems the harsh sentiments still resonate with Barbra Streisand nearly thirty years later in her third directorial effort. While she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy, the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded, self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this 1996 movie down considerably.At an epic length of 130 minutes, the story, adapted by Richard LaGravenese from a forgotten 1958 French film, is quite slight as it focuses on Rose Morgan, a wildly popular Columbia literature professor but also a fortyish, baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister Claire and glamorous mother Hannah. Her lot in life seems crystallized at Claire's wedding when she weds Rose's longtime crush Alex. Meantime, Columbia mathematics professor Gregory Larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic, intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage. Greg places a personals ad to which Claire responds unbeknownst to Rose. The budding relationship between Rose and Greg turns on the inevitable moment when Rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested Greg. This leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale.As Rose, Streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way, even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall. Like the yearning Barbra of long ago, she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night. However, once Rose transforms herself, Streisand's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable, soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in "The Prince of Tides". Looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves.At the time of release, Lauren Bacall received all sorts of kudos as Hannah, though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave, make-up-free scene where Hannah admits to Rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted. Mimi Rogers provides sharp bite as Claire, while Pierce Brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow Alex and George Segal (Streisand's one-time co-star in "The Owl and the Pussycat") is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role. As with her previous two films, Streisand imbues her film with lots of background music though this time it feels somewhat more intrusive. What she does achieve is the romanticism in tone and self-image reinforcement she obviously felt a need to convey. The DVD came out only two years later in 1998 and consequently has no extras to offer.</fullReview>

So some bits where hard to believe but I did not think Barbra did too badly for playing a woman in her late thirties - if I could only look that good when I hit 55.If you enjoy a good love story and a happy ending then I can recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most romantic movie I've ever seen. Barbra is very good in her own way, Jeff Bridges is gorgeous, smart, and looking so good in this movie. How seldom is it that we find a movie that delves into issues such as love verses insecurity and self image!? The Mirror Has Two Faces is such a film. I think this is a very wonderful movie and worth watching again and again. I enjoyed every second of it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always like a movie Barbra acted, actually she's not a real actor but her job is excellent. I love every movements of this movie. Jeff who not playing romantic movie much is so good in this movie. I love every conversations and every scenes in this movie. My favorite scenes: The first date when Gregory try to explain about "twin prime conjecture" to Rose. One morning after married, they sit in front of the TV ,Rose look at Gregory with a sweet eye, Gregory asked What, Rose said the jean and the t-shirt is great look on you. You should wear to the class sometime.My favorite quotes: "I just want to see how you are tonight?" "I'm fine, how you are?". "Romantic love keeps people separate and alone, like you said, romantic is a myth and manipulation!" "Once upon the time, there is a ball, and it throws to the air and the height... may be I should only write the book", "why? no-one understands those either, just kidding" "Gregory just proposed to me, do you need a valium?" "By the way, would telling you now that I want sex tonight be enough of a warning?" "I love Rose, the old Rose, who has no make up and has a baggy cloth and perfect bite. It's real no on the passion although I feel that or lust although I feel that. She eats carrot now, is that tragic?" "You start rotate the plate, cut as a clock wise, cut on the diagonal, now it comes to my favorite part, you start loading the fork, to create a harmoniously balance perfect bite." "I don't care if you are pretty, I love you anyway." "D, congratulation, you improve it.", "I still don't understand about twin prime." "Don't you know, it's possible to remove an infinite no. element from infinite set and still have infinite no. of element left over. we spend quit a bit of time already. My wife understood this on her first date." "Class dismissed.. get out of here, go, go." "What's problem what I look like, you never look at me anyhow. Physical appearance doesn't matter, what's wrong with disappearance. I'm sorry I upset your mathematical equation, hansom frighten man married unattractive desperate woman, that's what the ad read?" "When we fall in love we hear Puccini in our head, I love that." "Oh Oh I feel a little dizzy", "that's alright, it will pass, just hold on to me." "What do you doing?", "Nothing..much", "Could you terribly mute the TV?" "would you mind if I sit down?" "Please", "That wine makes me warm." "I can fix that", "that's alright." "good game?", "I can't hear". "You see my daughter for a couple of the months, if don't mind may I ask, I want to know what your intention are?" "My intention.. Oh well?". "You don't use make up, do you?" "what's a point? I still look like me only in color." "No, you're too smart for all that no frill kind of girl. You don't need all of that, Rose." "Thanks."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A praise for Richard LaGravenese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard LaGravenese has been a part of the Hollywood Machine since he was able to sell his quirky, dark but utterly engaging screenplay for "The Fisher King". In "The Mirror has Two Faces" as in his adaptation of "The Bridges of Madison County" and his directorial effort "Living out Loud", he finds a unique way of intellectualizing love in his story lines and resolves what the mind has assembled with a pure emotional pay-off. Something you mostly see in movies from France, Spain or Scandinavian countries. LaGravenese always finds the perfect traits for his characters, and the speech Rose give's at the beginning in front of her class is such a beautifully crafted soliloquy about love, and especially our fear of and pining for it, that it could be recited on its own.When it comes to the matter of the heart we are all at the mercy (not to say slaves) of our feelings and as far as traditional American movie-making is concerned there are very few others like Mr. LaGravenese. So for the fans of the above mentioned movies, maybe this will also be a reason to get past their aversions towards Ms. Streisand and give this beautiful, if not perfect movie a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cannot believe this movie did not receive more accolades. The team of Bridges and Streisand was phenomenal! Bacall was enchanting as ever. The story line was unique and the dialog superb. Streisand has a unique knack for identifying with the "ugly duckling" woman -- although she is absolutely beautiful. Sometimes I think she develops these story lines out of some deep-felt inferiority complex; if that is true, it is certainly unwarranted.I look at "Prince of Tides," "The Way We Were," "Yentl," and "Funny Girl" (which still happens to be my all-time favorite. I truly believe that she shows us this type of movie to make all of us women feel important, strong, and yes, even gorgeous...and who's to say we're not?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is great movie, every line has a beat of its own!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has rhythm and I like that! Every line has a beat of is own! The CD is fabulous! I have both the video and the CD. Multi talented, Barbra Streisand (Yentl, Funny Lady), directed and played Rose Morgan, a professor of Romantic Literature at Columbia University, who knows how to teach well. You can tell that her students are enjoying her classes because of her teaching methods. She is very likable, intelligent, witty, and wears old fashioned outfits, which by the way are my favorite costumes in the movie. She loves football, loves to eat, (who doesn't?) and lives with manipulative mother Hannah Morgan, Lauren Bacall (Key Largo) who was nominated for an Oscar for this part. She has a sister Claire, Mimi Rogers, who is supposed to be prettier than Rosie (I think not!) and has stolen Rose's beau Alex, Pierce Brosnan (James Bond) and married him. Claire sets Rose up on a blind date because she finds an add in the newspaper of a man looking for a date, who turns out to be Gregory Larkin, also a professor (of mathematics) at Columbia University who is very boring, played by Jeff Bridges (The Fabulous Baker Boys) who's best friend is Henry Fine, George Segal (Lost and Found) a lots of male perspective on their dialogue. Rosie's best friend is Doris, Brenda Vaccaro (Midnight Cowboy) the friend everybody likes to have. They are confidants, they have fun together, they break their diets together, they order extra salad dressing together. Her mother is beautiful but self-centered, she keeps saying: "I raised a daughter, I buried a husband, I made my coffee".Favorite Scenes: Rose's hair piece falling off; the restaurant scene where there are two mirrors and the camera shows the two sides of the mirror; Rose rooting for her favorite team; the favorite bite dinner, the odd numbers of cufflinks, the next door neighbor.Favorite quotes paraphrased "When my date takes me home and I don't hear the philharmonic in my head, I dump him."; "A wedding is the final scene of the fairy tale, they never tell you what happens after. They never tell you that Cinderella drove the Prince crazy with her obsessive need to clean the castle and that she missed her day job."; "Curls! I tried that once, I looked like Shirley Temple on crack."; "You are the mother of the bride not the opening act."; "I will have your birth certificate blown up as a Christmas card."; her mother saying. "I should never have encouraged you to speak."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trivial and clichéd, with slightly cloying rankness, except for Bridges.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We see lots of romantic comedies, and this one has left the most rancid aftertaste since Moonstruck or one of the ones with Hugh Grant. It is artificial and contrived, as well as simultaneously polemical and narcissistic. We stayed with it for one reason only: Jeff Bridges. His performance is in fact whole-hearted and engaging, even though he is given a character upon whose implausibility the entire film depends. Streisand's limitations as an actress are painful to watch, and Bacall somehow seems aware that she is playing her part in a Streisand vanity project. The actress cast as Streisand's sister (the pretty one of the two), is not really beautiful enough to justify Streisand's character's angst, which makes it all even more fishy, as does the paper cut out role given Pierce Brosnan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good exercise of star's prerogative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I put this on my Netflix list because I was in a Jeff Bridges mood - anyhow it arrived in the mail and I was happy to watch it. My main reaction: this is a great illustration of how much fun it must be to be able to make yourself just the movie you want to.In this movie, Barbra Streisand is able to do the following: be a super-smart but plain-looking woman professor who is loved by her students; as this character, and against her expectations, get herself a man who's both hunky and brilliant (Jeff Bridges); go through an ugly duckling-swan transformation; and have Lauren Bacall for her mother (though the mother is pretty toxic until fairly far along).Pretty satisfying if you're looking for a feel-good story with a bit of a feminist spin. I wish however that someone had asked me for my opinion about the makeover, the body and dress were fine (from shapeless to fit &amp; foxy), but oh, that hair!!! Why not really splashy blonde, or leave it alone, instead of that too-silvery highlighted frizz? And why no red lipstick? Lauren Bacall was right, she needed more color.The bit of psychologizing between Barbra &amp; Mom was effective as far as I was concerned, and I like seeing the potential it released in our Barbra. Overall - a B+ chickflick, a good resource if you can't watch any more Hugh Grant or Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan stories &amp; need a nice sniffle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film again the first time since 1996. The production values for this film were great, but the sentiments are false. First I have to say that the acting is superb, especially Streisand and Bacall. Their mother-daughter revelation scene is wonderful, a gem shared by 2 consummate actresses.Here's the dishonesty: In the first half, we see that everyone who's attractive is also defective in some way. Husband is a jerk, sexless, a bore, mother jealous and vain, sister has no personality. In fact, why is Streisand so madly in love with a man who's such a jerk? Streisand shines as funny, intelligent, personable, well-liked by everyone. And our view of what's pretty has changed a lot since Streisand came along in the 60's. Meryl Streep's long nose or Jolie's oversize lips would never have been acceptable before Streisand. OK, she doesn't know how to dress, but is certainly printed as attractive. The camera, as usual, loves her. And in real life Streisand has always been attractive to attractive men.After showing us that physical beauty is not that important, the film then goes on to prove that the same woman, made more physically beautiful, can now attract her cold jerk of a husband and her sister's shallow ex. Husband even tells her that he's always found her sexy, it's just that he hadn't been interested. Such inconsistency in the writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back when I saw this at theaters in November of 1996, I was blown away! I couldn't believe Babs could direct such an astonishing, and down-to-earth love story. Regardless of its mixed reviews, I firmly believe that this is Barbra Streisand's best work to date ( The Way We Were was also truly her #1 film!). It covers the awful subject and nuances about horrid, sexless marriages, and in how they, eventually, drive the couple to insanity. The film is revolves around two very unique characters (Barbra, and Jeff Bridges) , and tells how they have been hurt from failed past relationships. The setting is Columbia University (they are both professors) and meet when (again after a failed relationship) Bridges places an ad for someone who has the same likes and dislikes, and whose "physical appearance is not important". Barbra's character,Romantic Literature Professor, Rose Morgan, gives Math Professor, Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges), this notion after he steps in to one of her classes where she is teaching a lesson about relationships, and how sex ruins it. He foolishly believes this and asks her to marry him..............I will say no more. Anyone who wants to see this film, should definitely see it very quick, for I know you will be amazed! Don't listen to all the horrible reviews, see for yourself. You'll LOVE It! I guarantee it, especially if you're a Babs fan.(1996) 130 mins. Rated PG-13 for suggestive scenes and some mild language.</fullReview>

From an emotional standpoint, it rings true from the perfect bite to the search for a perfect bod. There aren't a lot of movies out there that are made for adults and still lack sex and violence. With this film, you don't have to worry about the kids walking in at the wrong time.

He wants her to be his "life partner" and chose herspecifically for all the reasons she hated herself. He didn't wantsomeone confident and beautiful or desirable. He wanted a no stringsattached friendship. So here she is left with practically everything sheever wanted, but it is hollow, and empty, which in turn makes her feelmuch worse about herself than ever before. She stumbles upon an old homely guy she used to date in central park wholooks blissfully happy and in love with a woman who is equally asunattractive (ok, trite, but gets the point accross). She notices thatdespite how much she longs for beauty that if she could just find reallove she'd be satisfied.The climax comes when her husband reveals to her that he "specificallychose her because there would be zero threat of physical attraction".Anyhow, this is the story and I think it's pretty good actually.

		<shortDescription>A gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my quest to see all of Lauren Bacall's films, I finally sat down and watched this one, reluctantly. Like 90% of the American population, I've always found Barbra Streisand annoying as hell. I was very pleasantly surprised to find a film with enormous depth and insight into relationships and how men and women relate to each other. And I saw a lot of myself in both Bridges and Streisand, which would be ideal I guess, for anyone.Yes, the basic premise of this pseudo romantic comedy is pretty absurd, but then, you can say that about practically every romantic comedy ever made. They always have some sort of silly or ridiculous complication that keeps the two leads from living happily ever after in 20 minutes of screen time. And there were a few moments that Streisand (the director) stumbled over, like the weight loss montage and some of the dialogue in the climactic scene, but overall I thought she shined and was very convincing as both actor and director. Who gives a **** if she's 55 years old in real life? She still looked damn good and played a convincing 40 something. Pierce Brosnan's character, while crucial to the story, is very underdeveloped and a throwaway in general. But clocking in at a lengthy (for a romantic comedy) 2:06, some concessions had to be made. Probably the best thing about the film is Jeff Bridges, who has become the master of the bumbling stumbling and stammering oddball. Though this film is nothing like The Big Lebowski or The Contender, fans of Bridges in those films will love him in this, too. His soliloquys about the ideal relationship in this film are priceless. As for Bacall, I just assumed that her Best Supporting Actress nom was a gift from the Academy for a lifetime of work without a hint of recognition. And as big a fan of Bacall as I am, she never deserved one. I was happy to see that she earned this nom fair and square. An excellent film, and very enjoyable. A rather careless error in the script is worth mentioning: One of the early scenes is between Bridges and his ex-wife. Later, in a scene with Bacall, he tells her he's never been married.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A complete vanity project of the highest order"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does this movie have anything to do with Barbra Streisand? - You'd be blind if you thought otherwise. She directs the picture, she produces the picture, she stars in the picture, and she even writes the picture's theme song? all to an average and substandard level. This increasingly tedious and unbelievable plot just appears to spiral out of control as Streisand's character appears to get prettier and prettier. How can a handsome (but incredibly dull) man yearn for just a sexless marriage with a self-proclaimed 'ugly duckling'? What was the message of this film?... In order to rekindle an almost broken marriage you should aspire for external self-improvement and a "bitta' makeup". Secondly, where does 'The Mirror Has Two Faces' title come from? In one reflection, you're pretty and in another you're not so pretty? The final question I have with this movie is: is it a romantic comedy or a romantic drama? Streisand's cliché jokes are completely inappropriate in the scenes where we're just about to find some sensual passion that could excite us and revive this bomb.The appearance of legendary film icon Lauren Bacall provides the only authentic and raw acting emotion that was definitely lacking in this picture. Bacall, in what would be her career-resurging role, plays Streisand's mother in the picture who fails to reckon with the fact that she has wronged her daughter in a way that she can't seem to deal with. The only shame is Bacall's scenes were very limited and more of a featuring role rather than a supportive one, but nonetheless it won her Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination.This is a complete vanity project increasing the ego of Ms Streisand of continuing the legacy of being the first and only woman (at the time) to have directed, produced, scripted, stared and composed the lyrics to a single picture. What would have worked if Barbra stayed completely out of the picture, stuck to behind-the-scenes (which would have, maybe, improved the camera angles to this shoddy film - or perhaps not) and casted perhaps either Geena Davis, Michelle Feiffer or even Jodie Foster rather than the 54-year-old Streisand trying to portray a 40-something late bloomer.Since 'The Mirror Has Two Faces', Streisand's film career has plummeted to Razzie-nominated leading and supporting roles and 'Mirror' seems to have been the final nail in the coffin for Streisand's all too descending Hollywood career. Stick to being the greatest singer of our generation, and you'll be alright, Babs! Nonetheless, our girl did manage to increase her ego FURTHER by receiving an Oscar nomination for co-writing "I Finally Found Someone" ? the picture's theme song ? now, to mention it; I did think it was a catchy duet with Bryan Adams ? Streisand's first significant hit since 1981.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible as it seems, "The Mirror Has Two Faces" is based on a French film of 1958 directed by Andre Cayatte, something the creators acknowledge in the credits. The American version has nothing much in common with the Gallic model. The great Michelle Morgan was the star of the original, in which the viewer is asked to accept an ugly version of the radiant actress. Bourvil played the opposite lead.This, being a Barbra Streisand project got a lavish production. Richard LaGravenese, wrote the adaptation to suit the talented Ms. Streisand, who had not attempted to direct anything after "The Prince of Tides", which came out in 1991. The vehicle was perfect for the star because in the film she is supposed to go from one of her kooky characters that she did so well, with a more serious side of her. The end result is a film that is pleasant, if a bit predictable.Ms. Streisand plays Rose Morgan an English literature professor at Columbia University. She attracts the attention of Gregory Larkin, a mathematician, by the strength of her rapport with her students. Unknown to Rose, her sister Claire has decided to submit an ad in the personals as a way to find her a boyfriend. When the two finally meet, it's a match made in heaven. The only problem is that Greg does not believe in having sex, even the kind performed by a married couple.Jeff Bridges plays Greg with flair with a good dose of chemistry between him and his co-star. Ms. Straisand does better during the first part of the film before it becomes more somber as Rose decides to leave Greg because there is nothing to hold them together. Lauren Bacall, Mimi Rogers, George Segal, Pierce Brosnan, Brenda Vaccaro, and Austin Pendleton are seen in the large supporting cast.We remember the time when this film was shot in New York's Upper West Side where the filming went on for quite some time while the neighbors became angrier by the way the night schedule interfered with their daily routines. One certainly hope they might have enjoyed the looks of their area when the film was finally released!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, great, great and very sweet movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mirror has Two Faces is a very beautiful movie, directed by the brilliant Barbra Streisand. It tells the story about Gregory, a math teacher at Columbian University, who doesn't believe that sex and love should go together, that's the reason why he meets Rose, because he wants a relationship without sex. When they get married Rose needs to feel different things but Gregory does not want to have sex with her, so Rose decides to change his appearance for her husband, but she does not know that Gregory loves her just in the way she is. Beautiful love story,about human relations and that you discover that you love someone when is far. Great performances from Barbra Sreisand who plays a wonderful Rose Morgan, who doesn't believe in her real beauty, and Jeff Bridges who plays the professor who is not interested in sex, Gregory. Without doubts is one of the best movies from 1996 and is one of the best romantic films ever, because it shows very well the real mean of love, that it is stronger than another things without importance. If you love Barbra Sreisand's movies, and good love stories you have to see "The Mirror Has Two Faces". My score: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was forced into watching this movie and I completely regret it. It was completely unbelievable. It centers around an ugly woman who is looking for Mr. Right. There are plenty of not so good looking guys who she could have ended up with but she was waiting for a georgous guy. This movie proves nothing about "true love" because the only quality Rose looked for in a guy was looks even though guys were supposed to overlook the fact that she was beyond ugly. She was ugly but she refused to settle for an ugly guy. Why should a good looking guy settle for an ugly woman like her? They wouldn't and thats why this movie is complete BS. And there's absolutely NOOOOOOOOOO way Pierce Brosnan would have ever hooked up with her in real life. She still looked ugly after her "transformation" and once you take off all that make-up she's going to look like the same ugly rose she was before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Streissand's "Mirror": An Inevitable Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996): Starring Barbara Streissand, Jeff Bridges, Lauren Bacall, Pierce Brosnan, Mimi Rogers, George Segal, Elle McPherson, Brenda Vaccaro, Leslie Stefanson, Amber Smith, Lucy Avery Brooks, Taina Elg, Ali Marsh, David Kinzie, Rabbi Howard S. Herman, Brian Schwary, Thomas Hartman, Trevor Ristow, Randy Pearlstein, Stacie Sumter, Jill Tara Kushner, Jimmy Baio, Thomas Saccio, Emma Fann, Mike Hodge, Anne O'Sullivan, Laura Bailey, William Cain, Rudy Ruggiero, Adam LaFevre, Carlo Scibelli.....Director Barbara Streissand, Screenplay Richard LaGravanesse." I want to be upfront with you. I am not interested in sex." "When my date takes me home and kisses me good night, if I don't hear the philharmonic in my head, I dump him." Directed and produced by Barbara Streissand herself, this 1996 film is actually a re-make of a 1958 French film "Le Miroir a Deux Faces", but altered to fit into New York City in the 1990's. Barbara Streissand's signature is all over this, much like it was in the 1991 film "Prince of Tides" where she was paired with Nick Nolte. Here she is paired with handsome and talented actor Jeff Bridges and their chemistry is remarkably good. Several aspects of this film make it truly great, even though it was not a very successful film when it was released, despite a star cast - Pierce Brosnan, Mimi Rogers and most notably, Lauren Bacall, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actress. Babs plays Rose Morgan, a plain, intellectual Columbia University English professor. She has been married once- to self-absorbed and successful Alex (Pierce Brosnan) who, tired of her strong feminist attitudes and disinterest in her looks, dumps her for the more attractive and exciting Claire (Mimi Rogers).After answering an ad, she finds herself drawn to Professor Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges)who has himself been in an unsuccessful marriage. Both of them know that marriage is a risky venture and they both consent to marry with the condition that sexual and physical love will not be part of the equation. With this premise, Streissand explores the age-old issues of male and female conflicts, women's sexuality, women's empowerment and the human fascination with romance. We're all suckers for a great romance set to romantic music like Puccini's operas she says. While she tries to escape this, she and Gregory find fulfilling this condition difficult. Inevitably, they consummate their relationship with sex, but they have fallen for each other's souls and deeper selves before they were ever drawn to each other's sensuality. Lauren Bacall got the Oscar for Supporting Actress in her role as Rose's mother. She is a social-climbing and materialistic woman who does not genuinely care for her daughter's happiness. Rose rebels against her mother by opting not to look attractive and to stroke a man's ego but to find happiness on her own terms and to support herself financially. The chemistry between Lauren Bacall and Barbara Streissand, two famous women at this time, is superb. Jeff Bridges, an actor who could take on roles as different as night and day, plays Professor Gregory Larkin with nuance, human warmth and wit, which matches Barbara Streissand's strong-willed and sharp-witted Rose perfectly. A sexy nerd, he attempts to find happiness with a woman through a strictly platonic relationship but eventually discovers that the appeal of sex and romance is too strong. This is an intelligently written film, with comedic flair a ala Woody Allen. It's a delightful film about relationships, about inner beauty and about self-discovery. It's about the irresistible appeal of romance, which we are fed to by romantic movies and fairy tales. With superb music, including an Oscar winning original song, great cinematography and feel-good quality, this is one of my favorite romantic comedies to come from the mid 1990's. It stands out because it's so intelligently expressed. Other great romantic comedies of the 90's with a feminist slant include "The First Wive's Club". Fans of Barbara Streissand will enjoy this high-caliber film, with many wonderful moments. Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it is One of my most favorite movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just saw the movie from HBO and I feel it's just great! With deep thinking and passion for love and life! Esp. the speech that Rose gave in her class:"Is love a myth or manipulation?!" Well, that's a good question, right? and I love the way that rose changed and finally found her confidence and at last she told Alex:"I never worried about how I would feel, I only ever thought about you. I only wanted to make you happy, I never thought I was good enough for you." and but Alex, you're not good enough for me!" Unfortunately, men in that movie don't appear clever at all, though charming, like Alex, and cute! Anyone agree with me ? Please contact!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy at it's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A light comedy with a good subplot. Great one liners delivered on time. Fantastic cast lead by Barbra Streisand, Jeff Bridges, Lauren Bacall and Mimi Rogers. Some may say it's just a movie about the meaning of beauty. But it's more. It's also a story about relationships, about love, about friendship, the value of life. And you don't get slammed with messages. No, Ms. Streisand sells you the story in a funny way. The funny girl has returned. What a joy to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really romantic and funny film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not particularly a Streisand fan, but I really liked this movie. It has an old style of subtle humor that somehow ends up in a belly laugh here and there. The premise is one that probably makes it a "chick flick", but even macho guys should be touched by the romantic feelings it conveys. This one is a keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a guy, but I still like this movie. I think Babara handled the movie pretty well and the story is "believeable." Acting is great too. There might be some parts that is a little bit "over-done" or too much but overall a great movie to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching movies is my passion,for i love curling up on the couch in a big blanket and watch movies all day. I was in writing class when i watched " The Mirror has Two Faces.' I was excited, for our teacher told us it was about a unique love story, and a woman who struggled with her self image. Sure enough, the movie was completely opposite of what i thought it was going to be. It was unrealistic, In-sensible, and cheesy beyond imagination. It was bad enough watching Barbara Streisand pretend to like sports, but when Gregory larkin came into the picture, i nearly died from laughter. He was boring, a horrible,HORRIBLE actor, and very a very dense man when it comes to what a woman wants and how a relationship works. Watching this movie was the most painful thing i have had to do in ages. The bedtime scene after they got married was completely overdone and a lot more awkward than it would be in real life. He is a completely dazed man, and ungrateful when he sees Rose's new look. His Equation about love is ghastly, for there is no equation for love. The only thing that makes any sense is how and what she goes through on a daily basis during her old life, and her new life. Over all, this movie was a big big big F!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mirror has two feces, and both of them are called Barbra.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I even f****** begin with this piece of trash?First of all, this formulaic garbage for lonely middle-aged spinsters features two of the most notorious witches (you can also replace the "w" with a "b") in the history of Hollywood, two arrogant, unlikable ogres: Streisand and Bacall. Streisand, the ugliest major actress for so many decades now (although Aniston, Barrymore, and Tea Leoni are hot on her heels) has made yet another self-indulgent piece of crap. The movie isn't about love in general, it's specifically about Barbra's undying, limitless and infinite love toward herself - though like most narcissists, that is probably largely based on a deeply repressed sense of low self-worth. (Aren't I a great from-the-distance psycho-analyst?) In this dumb movie she is supposed to be younger than Mimi Rogers, which is so extremely pathetic that it isn't even funny any more. In reality Mimi is FOURTEEN YEARS younger than the old the-way-we-were Marxist hag. In fact, Rogers looks 20 years younger, simply because ugly women like Streisand always look automatically older than they are. And anyway, even though Mimi is nothing to shout about (apart from the phenomenal breasts) she is a goddess next to Streisand, hence if they're to play sisters, I demand an explanation in the plot as to what DNA screw-up happened when their parents were making Barbra, having previously (ha-ha) made a normal-looking human female.Equally pathetic/funny/ridiculous is the fact that Barbra gets to smooch with Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Bridges, two guys who would in reality sooner vomit on her ugly nose than kiss it. Pierce, the most effeminate Bond ever, looks like a school-girl next to this Loch-Ness monster. The two of them kissing and flirting was like something perverse straight out of a manga comic or something. I was half-expecting her to grow tentacles out of her breasts and choke Pierce with them. Of course that would be a dumb horror film, but that would be much better than a cheesy romantic comedy that is just as predictable as one would expect. It was predictable that it would be predictable.Bridges is 7 years younger than our singing ghoul, and Brosnan is a whole 10 years her junior. What a strange way for Barbedwira to want to appeal to audiences: by showing yourself to be a deluded egomaniac! There is an unintentionally funny scene in which Bridges lists why he is so attracted to Barbra: he says something like "I love her eyes... her mouth... " and at this point he made a pause as if he were thinking about the nose! Of course, he doesn't mention the nose, as I'm sure that anyone on the set of any BS movie would get torn to shreds if they so much as even mention the "n" word. Bridges, whom I don't consider to be great actor (merely solid), should have gotten an Oscar for this role, and both him and Brosnan deserved no less than a Purple Heart each for the bravery they showed in the face of such... a face.It's pretty ironic that this overlong snooze-fest is based on a 1958 French film, because in French movies we usually have a 50 year-old man ogling and eventually molesting a 14 year-old girl (the French viewers apparently love that pedophilic stuff).The movie was made in 1996... Hmmm... Where did Barbedwira get the confidence, the CHEEK, to make this kind of embarrassing, self-adoring crap? Could it be due to her alleged brief romance with tennis star Andre Agassi, which was only a few years earlier around 1992? Did this romance give her the courage she needed to make "The Mirror Has Two Faces"? Of course, it's very easy for us to laugh at Barbra in hindsight; after all, she didn't know back then that Andre is attracted to big-nosed uglies! (Hence his marriage with the hideous Steffi Graf.)</fullReview>
