		<shortDescription>Seemingly Simple, But Quite Satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While seemingly rather simple, "Floating Weeds" is quite a satisfying film that combines Ozu's usual thoughtful tone with characters and atmosphere convincing enough that they almost immediately make you feel as if you know both the principals and their surroundings. Much of the running time is spent on apparently routine activities, but each scene serves a useful purpose in developing the themes, settings, and characters.The story ties together the fortunes of a traveling troupe of kabuki actors with, in the forefront, a crucial point in the relationships of Komajuro, their leader. The setting in a seaside village offers a suitably languid atmosphere that sets off both plot lines very appropriately. One of the things that is so interesting about Ozu's films is that the settings are so definitively Japanese, with plenty of well-conceived details, and yet the way that he approaches the story and characters makes his movies seem universal, confined neither by time nor place.The characters here are an interesting assortment of theatrical types and villagers. Many of them are relatively one-dimensional, but they are portrayed with skill and sensitivity, making even the simplest of them seem worth knowing. Especially good is Machiko Kyô as Sumiko, who is also the most interesting of the characters. Ganjiro Nakamura is good too as Komajuro, but Kyô usually gets the best of their scenes together.Two particularly good scenes between the two are the tense dispute in the rain and the encounter in the train station. In the former scene, Ozu's setup for the scene is a perfect complement for the characters' dialogue and actions. In the latter, the characters convey deep feelings with the most economical and satisfying of means.This is the kind of movie for which subsequent viewings might even be more enjoyable than the first, in the way that coming back to a familiar place can give you an odd sense of peace or security. And it leaves you with the feeling that it would be nice to come back again sometime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Komajuro Arashi and his acting troupe arrive in a small fishing village on the coast of Japan. Komanjuro goes to visit a woman who runs a sake bar, and who, we learn, is a former lover, and with whom he fathered a child, though the child is unaware of this fact and believes him to be his uncleTheir son, Kiyoshi, has just finished high school, and Komanju comes to see him as much as his former lover. He hopes that Kiyoshi will be able to become something in his life and not end up like Komanju himself, a washed-up actor drawing small crowds for his failing samurai productions.When Komajuro talks with his gorgeous young son, we can see the excitement in his eyes, in his face. The acting here is all rather flat, or better, it's reserved. (Ozu adds a little joke to this later in the film, when on a fishing boat Kiyoshi accuses his father of being "too muggy" in his performance.) This adds to the impact of the few emotional (and physical) outbursts later in the film.The conflict in the film is that of Komajuro's double lives. When his current mistress, Miss Sumiko -- a jealous and conniving witch of a woman -- discovers that he's been seeing some other woman, she's enraged, and plots what she believes will be his sort of downfall. By hiring a young woman, Kayo, to seduce Kiyoshi and embarrass Komajuro, she plans on making the two seem like different generations of the same person, both relating with unimportant actresses, thereby ruining Komajuro's hopes of his son becoming somebody important.Unlike most, Ozu is an auteur because of what he doesn't do. His unmoving camera, which is famous, sits placidly, observing the characters with interest. I do sometimes wish that the camera would move around curiously, interested in the conversations of the characters, but maybe Ozu's point was that his camera is (or we should be) too interested to move, and that the events of everyday life need not be jazzed up for entertainment purposes. (He seems to mock this idea when he has Komajuro say to Kiyoshi about his plays that, basically, modern audiences can't appreciate good drama.) The entire film is restrained; on the rare occasion when people cry, they cover their faces and softly whimper.The ending shot of a dark blue sky, with red lights from a rolling train, reminds us that whether it's 2003 in North America or 1959 in a small Japanese fishing village, we're all the same people with the same problems.In and of itself, the film is terrifically simple: a simple story, with simple acting, simple music, and made even more simple by the simplicity of the static camera. But what makes the film something special, rather than just some family drama, is the honesty. Ozu isn't after anything big here. Any enlightenment comes from Ozu's realization that the most important conflicts are in the home, the ones no one sees, the ones we all feel.****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Balance of Comedy and Moving Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote this after I saw my first Ozu's film, "Tokyo Story" about a year ago: "As with every great work, the film has its own unique perfection in style, rhythm, details, and artist's vision - but Tokyo Story is very universal in its appeal, simply put, it is for every parent, every son or daughter - for everyone. It was made 50 years ago in Japan, about people who lived far away, but it is also about all of us, our families, our problems, our guilt and our search for love and meaning. Ozu's film does not require one to be a movie buff or to try to solve complex symbolism to appreciate and love it. It brings smiles because it is a comedy (for at least the first 2/3) and sadness with a high drama of the last 1/3 of the film." I feel absolutely the same about "Floating Weeds". The film is quiet and deceptively simple but its simplicity reminded me the words of Michelangelo Buanorotti. When asked how he created the perfect statues from the shapeless marble lumps, he answered, "It is very simple, you just cut off all unnecessary pieces".Ozu's films are perfect - they touch us with rare warmth, soft enveloping tenderness and power of human emotions not necessarily with striking visual or sound effects. "Floating Weeds" is a remake of earlier silent black and white Ozu's film "The Story of Floating Weeds". The story is simple: an aging, traveling actor who is the manager of a kabuki troupe returns to a remote village where he secretly meets his former lover and her 19 year old illegitimate son, to whom he is known as "uncle." The older man finds happiness in communicating with his son who turned to be a fine young man. His current mistress, filled with jealousy because of his attachment to his secret family, hires a young beautiful girl, the member of a troupe to seduce a boy. Something in this story attracted Ozu so much that he remade the film twenty five years later."Floating Weeds" is a beautiful color film and it is the first color Ozu's film for me. The colors are bright and fresh, tender and kind - they match the director's style perfectly. The delightful music by Kojun Saito reminds me of Nina Rota music in Fellini's films - nostalgic, innocent and rhythmic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand drama on a small scale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, one of Ozu's last films, has all the elements of a Shakespearean tragedy played out among people living simple, workaday lives: deceit, jealousy, betrayal, vengeance, love, hope. It's all there. The acting by an all-star cast (at the time) of Japanese actors, including the gorgeous Ayako Wakao, is uniformly excellent. The cinematography may be the best I've seen for any color film made in the 1950's. The overall pace was a bit too slow for my liking, but it works well with a static camera taking every shot below eye level. This gives the viewer a visual perspective similar to looking at the actors on a slightly elevated stage, just as the audience does when watching the plays put on by the itinerant group of actors that centers the film. Overall, a well-crafted work by a recognized master, but not for the 'explosions &amp; car chase' crowd. Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a week I saw this movie three times. Why? Because its charm really got me, it should get you too! Set on an small island in the warm southern Japan summer, a struggling kabuki troupe comes by boat to stay there for a few shows. They actually stay much longer than that because the leader of the troupe has some personal matters here.The characters in this movie felt so real its as if I know them. And I think back on them fondly. I and the cynic, but unexperienced son (was it Kiyoshi?), the jealous femme fatale Sumiko, the lovely mother of Kiyoshi, the sweet flower Oyoshi and the others are almost like friends. Ozu succeeds in getting the very best out of the actors so they cease to be actors. Best is Kyô Machiko as Sumiko and Nakamura Ganjiro as the troupe leader. I am not all convinced on Kiyoshi though, esp. during the Sumiko confrontation.Stylistically this is a perfect film. Camera is fixed in well composed shots and we get to mediate on the surroundings and the people and let it all sink in. Look out for the quarrel scene, its simply one of the most powerful scenes I've seen.Music carries the feelings in the movie even if its just too simple songs (that I remember). The heat is felt and I'm there sweating with them.Some noted that this is good soap opera, I disagree, this is drama of the highest order, the kind of drama you don't see much in movies at all. This was my first Ozu, and its not everybody's favourite it seems, still its hard to surpass this..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisitely restrained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Floating Weeds by Yasujiro Ozu is an exquisitely restrained film about a failing acting troupe that travels to a small town and engenders a conflict of generations in a Japanese family. As the film opens a boat moves slowly into the harbor a Japanese coastal village. A Kabuki troupe arrives and begins to pass out leaflets announcing their opening performance. Sadly the opening crowds are small. Komajuro (Ganjiro Nakamura), the principal actor in the troupe, goes off by himself to visit Oyoshi (Haruko Sugimura), a former lover who runs a Saki bar. She has an adult son, Kiyoshi (Hiroshi Kawaguchi) who Komajuro had fathered many years ago. Komajuro has hidden his identity from the boy because of his shame at being a traveling actor and Kiyoshi only knows of him only as "uncle".When Sumiko (Machiko Kyo), Komajuro's mistress and leading star, finds out about this relationship she goes into a jealous rage and hires a young actress, Kayo (Ayako Wakao) to seduce Kiyoshi in order to humiliate his father. Kiyoshi, however, falls in love with Kayo. Komajuro disapproves and shows his anger but cannot exert parental authority since he has not told his son the truth about his parentage. As the troupe continues to draw small crowds, Komajuro's inner pain becomes visible and he strikes out physically against Kayo, Sumiko, and Kiyoshi. It is only in the surprising conclusion that he seems to regain some sense of acceptance of his circumstances.Floating Weeds is a very intimate experience. The camera does not move but remains focused on the characters as they engage in discussions about commonplace events. As in Bresson, the actors show little emotion and speak in a monotone with long silences between questions and answers. The overall effect, however, is not banality but a sense of the natural rhythm of life. Ozu is a loving observer of human nature not a moralist. There are no saints in this film and each character is vulnerable and deeply human. Komajuro has been stripped of his career, his relationship with his son, and his female companions who still beg him for forgiveness. He is alone but he has retained his humanity and we feel only compassion for him. The ending is, in the phrase of Donald Richie, "a kind of resigned sadness, a calm and knowing serenity which maintains despite the uncertainty of life and things of this world". Floating Weeds is a masterful film from a director who truly respects his audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure elegance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Floating Weeds" (Japanese, 1959): The first few things I notice about films by writer/director Ozu are: the incredibly consistent, artful composition used in his shots; his patience with the "ordinary"; and his intentional avoidance of "action" and blatant "drama". His films are meditative exercises on the daily truths we humans must face, which contain their own realistic challenges. Like Bergman and Allen, he too often uses the same actors, non-exotic locations, and stays within a philosophical area of interest that is obviously not market driven?which earns them dedicated followers...even after death. Ozu's films are pure elegance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ozu is a wonderful experience just to watch the musical formations. Each shot is composed in the most careful way so that the assembly has a geometric rhythm. It is soft and melodic, this visual overlay, painting in motion. No one does it better that I know.There's a talk between two troubled lovers in the rain, then in opposing shelters, that is especially noteworthy, but it is all so cinematically lovely...The way he's put this together is very Japanese. Each shot length is nearly precisely the length of the one before. Each employs a stationary camera only, but the positioning of the camera only sometimes is where a human eye would be. As I've mentioned, The composition in terms of elements, space and color is perfect in each shot and follows in a deliberate, engineered pattern from the previous shots.The narrative isn't integrated in the way Kurosawa would do ? and be considered un-Japanese for. But the story does much of that for us.It is a story about pretense and staging, with most of the actors playing characters who are actors and have trouble in being an actor.You'll have to work to be engaged in the story. But its rather easy to just sit back and admire the loveliness. Ozu is always worth it for this. I don't know many of his films, but this is the most formal of those I know.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absorbing and visually stunning film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scene with the lighthouse in the distance and a bottle on the beach in the foreground (which is worthy of being a famous modern minimalist landscape painting) the view is pulled back to a shot of the lighthouse from between two boats, then to a store front. These shots are the equivalent of a powerful opening paragraph to a novel, they draw you in in anticipation of what is to come. Throughout the film the artistry of the color cinematography does not disappoint. Each scene is composed as if it were a painting and the use of color is singularly striking. A black-and-white viewing of this film would lose about 80% of its appeal.The story is that of a traveling Kabuki theater troupe arriving to perform in a small Japenese village. This is not the troupe's first visit to the village and the leader of the troupe, Komajuro Arashi, had fathered an illegitimate boy there some eighteen years in the past. When Komajuro visits the mother of his son, for the first time in twelve years, complications ensue.Some remark that this is a simple story simply told. As far as its being a simple story, it is no simpler than, say, "Othello," which could be summarized as "Proud soldier meets tragic end due to jealousy." The treatment of the corrosive effects of jealousy, pride, deception, and male ego in "Floating Weeds" make for anything but a simple tale. As far as its being simply told, it is in fact most skillfully told - as the movie progresses the combination of sound and image have a subtle accumulating effect on mood, heightening awareness. It is frequently the case that the *appearance* of simplicity in a work of art, as in "Floating Weeds," is difficult to achieve. The music is a cross between the score for a French comedy and a work of Arvo Pärt, but it adroitly reflects the shifting moods of the film which alternate between serious and comic, sometimes being simultaneously serious and comic. Ozu does not allow his movie to become overly ponderous; it is leavened with humor. For example, when the troupe is enjoying a day at the beach one of the members says with seriousness, "The sky's so blue, it's sad," to which another replies, "Don't be silly, I want to eat a big cutlet."It is difficult not to be offended by Komajuro's physical abuse of his mistress, his son, and his son's lover. And the general acceptance of male dominance is hard to digest. I am not sure what we are supposed to feel about Komajuro at the end, but I found that his particular personality flaws distanced me from any deep caring about him or his fate. I had more concern about the future of his son and the women who were involved with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This, not "Tokyo Monogatari" is Ozu's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This time Ozu does not settle his film in Tokyo, but in a small town at the coast. And it is not a home-drama. At the centre are the experiences of a Kabuki-troup. Thus Ozu can play with the cliches of the Geisha and Samurai film. But not only Geishas and Samurais have become outdated, but also the representation of the latter by Kabuki-theater. The educated miss "social relevance" the others the pink panties of the dancing girls. The show of the theater group is a failure, and all the actors ask themselves for which reason they have come to such a place. But they get top know that the head of the troup visits an old lady whose son thinks he is the actor's nephew.... From this constellation originates a typical Ozu story of love, betrayal, disillusion with an ending you would not have expected seconds before. The whole film is characterized by beautiful and symbolic arrangements of Japanese interieurs, though mostly of the traditional type. I hope that other dubbed versions are not as awful as the German one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ageing, washed-up actor Komajuro (Nakamura) rolls into a sleepy 50s seaside town with his rinky-dink, outdated Kabuki troupe (the film's title being a Japanese term for itinerant actors). Here he seeks to reunite with former lover Oyoshi (Sugimura) and their illegitimate son Kiyoshi (Kawaguchi), who believes the old man is his uncle.When Komajuro's sour-faced mistress Sumiko (Kyô) learns of the affair, she engineers a doomed seduction between beautiful young actress Kayo (Wakao) and Kiyoshi to humiliate the troupe master via his unwitting son - Kiyoshi's tawdry, failed romance will serve to remind Komajuro of his own. Can Komajuro exert parental authority over his 'nephew' without revealing his true identity? Tokyo Story may be Ozu's most famous work, but the elegiac and refined Floating Weeds ranks among the director's best. A director, incidentally, whose gravestone is marked by the Japanese word for "nothing". Appropriately so: as critic Derek Malcolm points out, such was the restraint of Ozu's film-making, "it hardly seemed like art at all".Less is so much more. As Ozu biographer Donald Richie notes: "What remains after seeing an Ozu film is the feeling that, if only for an hour or two, you have seen the goodness and beauty of everyday things and everyday people." Floating Weeds may well concern issues of betrayal and loss, but in its refusal to moralise, affords its all-too-human characters something approaching grace. Prefaced with the fairytale like caption "Somewhere in the South of Japan...", Weeds goes about its business with a quiet dignity - chiefly distinguished by Ozu's celebrated static camera, allowing a richer degree of intimacy and contemplation.This is complemented by exquisite framing from cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa - evoking 19th century Japanese prints - and dedicated, understated performances from the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lovely little film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a lovely little Japanese film about an acting troop's visit to a small town. One of the troop's members is an older man who fathered a child in this town many years ago and it has remained a secret. His arrival is greeted by the boy and his mother as a visit from an uncle, not his father. These relationships and the relationship between the man and other women in the troop are interesting. While not the very best Japanese film I've seen, the acting and direction are excellent and this film is well worth your time. However, it is possible that SOME may find the ending somewhat unsatisfying, though I did not feel that way. In other words, the typical Hollywood-style ending is NOT what you get from this movie.This film was originally made by Ozu in 1934--though oddly this version is silent. And the original is nearly identical in many, many ways. Because of this, I actually preferred the remake, though both are well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Psychological Drama with Great Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story here is simple. It's about responsibility and betrayal. It's about being a coward and removing oneself from uncomfortable situations, but then expecting to pick up the pieces when someone else has done all the work. This is a masterwork of visual cinema. The camera raises a somewhat mundane story to new heights. Every shot is rife with beauty and intensity. The background images contribute to the angst that the characters are feeling. It gives us a portrayal of a group of tired actors, doing their thing, being under-appreciated but going on. When their foibles get them in trouble, they manage to land on their feet, but what does the future hold for them? It also means that unlike many films of this time, there may not be a happy ending. There may be no ending at all as the pieces must be picked up and the characters move on. Roger Ebert picked this as one of his favorite 10. It's a quite, understated but powerful two hours of great art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The play within the play--again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of people seem to have difficulty with Ozu films, thinking them slowly-paced, static, or plain boring. But with a little use of patience and reflection, Floating Weeds is brilliantly appealing. Let me expand upon one particular angle that might make this film more accessible.Other reviewers have already commented on the films beauty in color, the pace of normal, real life in a seaside village, and the intimacy of the film. Others have also mentioned in negative commentary that they really didn't like any of the characters. This point, actually, is the reason why the film for me passes beyond "good" to "brilliant."Although the characters have charm and appeal, they also have many unappealing flaws: Sumiko's jealous vengeance, Kayo's blind following of malicious orders, Komajuro's blatant concealing of the truth of his being Kiyoshi's father and subsequent pathetic attempt to reenter his life and become his acting father, and more. But this made me a more active audience member--much like real theater does--made me want to reach out and grab the actors, saying "You fools! What are you doing!?" You can see them make the poor choices that lead to recklessness of Sumiko and the breakups of Kayo and Kiyoshi as well as Komajuro and Kiyoshi, for example. The characters seem to think that they are trapped, that it is their fate. And Komajuro and Sumiko feel that resignation as they come to accept each other and their flaws at the end. But for me, it was a wake-up call that moved me out of my seat. The major human relationship problems could have been helped with better choices. The characters give up too easily on trying to understand each other. Instead of trying to save face by hiding their problems or violently repressing them, Komajiro could have been forthcoming about his past with Sumiko, Komajuro and Kiyoshi's mother could have gone straight to the truth with their son about Kiyoshi's father and about Sumiko's jealous rage in getting Kayo to seduce him. These choices seem to be more difficult to carry out, but they would have nonetheless eased the tension of the plot and averted catastrophe. Communication and striving to understand each other, even the ones most important to us, is not an easy thing.By setting up these struggles on the screen, Ozu empowers his audience to take their own lives beyond that of the characters limited to the fated script. I think it's the colorful beauty of the scenes, the serenity of the seaside village, the fact that the characters have likable aspects as well as all-too-human flaws, and the masterful construction of the film as a whole that helps drive this process. Movies do well to inspire us, but they don't always do so by showing us flawless heroes to live up to or tell us what the moral of the story is. Sometimes, we learn by understanding how others have failed while coming to our own conclusions on how they could have fared better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, pure delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with all Ozu films, the plot here is so simple it is scarcely worth mentioning, even if this film has slightly more than usual by his standards. A struggling theater troupe, at a time when TV and Cinema has doomed this style of entertainment hitches up to a small coastal town to sell its slightly tawdry version of Kabuki. But the lead actor and owner of the troupe, Komajiro (played by the wonderfully impish Ganjiro Nakamura) has an ulterior motive - an old flame lives in the town with their son, who thinks he is just an uncle. When his current girlfriend, the leading lady Sumiko finds out, she tries to spoil things by bribing the younger actress Kayo (Ayoko Wakao) to seduce the young man. And of course, things go horribly wrong. And thats it really, as usual with Ozu, there is little or no melodrama and no big revelations. The pleasure is in watching this little world, getting to know the characters and really care for them so that even the little setbacks and joy they go through affect us as if it happened to us.What is striking about this film in contrast to his earlier ones is the fabulous colour photography. Even the simplest things - a decaying pier, an aging boat, a simple noodle shop is rendered both mundane and beautiful. Ozu never gives us fancy tracking shots or elaborate montages. Just the simplest of composed images and simple, but always relevant little images to move the story on. The acting is wonderful, from the leads down to the minor characters who make up the troupe. The gorgeous Michiko Kyo is admirably lacking in vanity as the visibly aging actress, and she is thoroughly believable as the former prostitute turned actress (not, at the time, considered a big step up in society) who nearly destroys everything in a fit of jealousy.For those who hesitate to watch an Ozu film because of the perception of his being very 'Japanese' and 'arty', just get this film out and see why he was adored by ordinary fans. His films haven't aged, because they are about universal themes that effect us all.</fullReview>

A story which spans over years unravels in a couple of hours, but it seems slow, appropriately slow. Nothing is rushed, even the movements and the dialog delivery. Every emotion is expressed and suspended briefly before the next one appears. The suspension is subtle. Desire, relationships, drama, intrigue, conflict, hope ? all appear intertwined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawless introduction to Ozu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler alert*A mediocre troupe of actors in a traveling production of a kabuki play roll into a small port town in southern Japan, and quickly run aground as money dries up (and their manager abandons them) and the troupe's leader (Master Komajuro) devotes increasing amounts of his own energy towards salvaging the relationship with an ex-girlfriend (Oyoshi), and their now-adolescent son Kyoshi (who thinks the aging Komajuro is his uncle). One of the rare Ozu films not set in Tokyo, or revolving around a middle-class family, FLOATING WEEDS offers a very different setting for Ozu's crystalline examinations of evolving social dynamics in post-war Japan. Both the fragile beauty, and the claustrophobic stuffiness of the small town is depicted perfectly, and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa (RASHOMON, UGETSU, TOKYO OLYMPIAD) also manages to somehow convey the oppressiveness of the summertime setting in a way that meshes perfectly with the disquieting drama ? perhaps because of the undercurrents of romantic turmoil, FLOATING WEEDS is marginally more propulsive than the typical Ozu drama. Still, the measured pacing, the stillness of Miyagawa's camera, and the meticulous photographic composition is hypnotic ? when interpersonal clashes (a rarity in Ozu's films) occur ? Komajuro's explosive argument with fellow cast member (and mistress) Sumiko, or Kyoshi's anger in the wake of discovering who Komajuro really is ? they hit with shocking force, arriving after the deceptive calm of most of the story. The overall effect is unbelievably moving still - if Komajuro seems, at times, cowardly, his humanity and vulnerability is brought to the surface by the uncluttered story and camera-work. Ozu also was able to indulge ? in the most subtle fashion ? in parodying kabuki and samurai dramatic conventions in the brief theatrical segments. Ozu regular Chishu Ryo (among the least known but most memorable 'leading men' of film) has a small role as the theatre owner. FLOATING WEEDS ? perhaps owing to the non-urban setting ? is perhaps Ozu's most beautiful film (the rainshower scene, halfway through, is incredible, as are the shots of the town which link scenes), and is among the greatest of the brilliant works produced at the end of his extensive and accomplished career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese Unique Sense to Accept Ups and Downs of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A drama revolving a theater troop conveys Japanese unique sense to accept ups and downs of life as they are. Ozu distills the sense with his original techniques, such as frame-inside-frame shots, absolutely fixed camera without panning, zooming and dolly, and disoriented editing, along with precisely composed color shots. An unforgettably beautiful scene is Kyo and Nakamura's brawling-in-the-rain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly Entertaining Eye Candy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed on DVD. Restoration = ten (10) stars. Pictorially, this film is a work of art: static scene by static scene (the camera never moves). Color cinematography is simply gorgeous . Set decoration is stunning. Costumes are eye-popping beautiful. It is by far the most end-to-end sumptuously mounted film from the "classical" period of the Japanese cinema! The director also leaves out most of his customary trademarks of ugliness (overhead power lines, clothes lines, ungainly mass transient, etc.). The script has been punched up sufficiently to hold the viewer's attention through patches of dramatic tediousness and outright boredom. Events are usually well telegraphed in advance so there are few, if any, surprises. The film is too long. There is the lingering impression that the director may have had a hard time letting go of his creation and bringing matters to an end. Acting is first rate (some actors are from the director's excellent in effect repertory company). Sound is fine and crisply captures Western-accented (Kansai-ben) dialog. Subtitles seem just right. The score copies music from the Italian cinema of the era. Best watched on a large screen to fully appreciate the artistry. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch Ozu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Floating Weeds from 1959 is a film from Yasujiro Ozu's final period, and also one of his first in color. He told the story before, in 1934, only that was a black and white silent film. But he followed the plot of the first film very closely.The story has a mediocre traveling Kabouki troupe reaching a small port village in Southern Japan to perform. Their performances only attract a few townspeople, but to Komajuro (Ganjiro Nakamura), the troupe's leader, the visit is an important occasion to meet his old lover, Oyoshi (Haruko Sugimura) and their grown child Kiyoshi (Hiroshi Kawaguchi), who is about to enter college and believes Komajuro is his uncle. When Komajuro's current lover, the pretty Sumiko (Machiko Kyo) learns about this, she blows in rage, and persuades another actress of the troupe, the pretty Kayao (Ayako Wakao) to seduce Kiyoshi. Kayao succeeds in the mission, so much so that she falls in love with Kiyoshi. When Komajuro learns about their relation, he doesn't take it so well (Komajuro repeatedly beating Sumiko and Kayo while shouting to them "you slut" are scenes that would probably not be filmed today), especially since he wants his son to have a life above that of a traveling acting troupe.This is not the very best of Ozu (I put the so called Noriko trilogy there, one of the crowning heights of cinema) but is still very good. There are a lot of Ozu's characteristic style to watch here (the camera put at a knee's height, the so called pillow shots, etc). The movie includes a famous scene with Komajuro and Sumiko fighting and arguing over a street where the rain is pouring. The performances are terrific, especially those of Nakamura and Kyo. Chishu Ryu, who was in dozens of Ozu's films, has a bit role here as the theater manager.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A colorful interpretation of human relationships.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ozu's remake of his 1934 silent film establishes its own independence and importance with the opening shot, which consists of a lighthouse in the background and a sake bottle in the foreground against a backdrop of a gorgeous blue sky. Within this singular shot, Ozu shows the beauty and artistry which color film allowed him to partake of as well as the further establishment of his unique visual style, enhanced by the now limitless color palette he could enjoy.In this case, a simple story about a traveling kabuki troupe visiting a small seaside town reveals certain traits and themes which appear in almost every Ozu film. A man trying to reconnect with his old lover and son affects his current mistress and the end result is a quiet, pensive evocation of looking at human relationships and life itself. For any fan of Ozu's previous work, this film is perhaps the culmination of his craft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece in terms of cinematography and introduction of characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece in terms of cinematography and introduction of characters.For nearly 5 minutes, we just know there is a troupe coming to town to perform a play. Is this story about the play, or anything to be derived from that, does it relate to the people of the town who are there for the first few minutes, we can hardly make out anything. Yasujiro Ozu the director of this film seems to be a master of intrigue. The beginning is so very intriguing that the first 15 minutes made me sit through the whole film. Also, the unrelated shots that are shot geometrically with perfect symmetry. Be it of the light house, or the rain drops through windows or close ups or long shots. I was amazed by a family drama story being told with such perfection of framing It's a story of a father and so, the father knows the son, but the son does not know the relationship between the mother and this man and only at the end realizes that the man who often comes to his house is his father. There is a confrontation scene that's done well. But above all actors, I loved the acting of the stepmother (don't remember her name) who determines to undo the conspiracy and unveil the relationship between her husband and a woman, he frequently visits. It's a movie, thats simple in many ways but yet the grandeur is bought to it by the intrigue and the sublime cinematography that's done beautifully. Through the journey of this film, I have understood that Yasujiro Ozu himself was one of the finest cinematographers ever. I am going with 3/5 for a movie that is good, but a 5/5 must be given for cinematography alone. This one must be watched for the way camera is handled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs Weeding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A theatre troupe comes to a coastal town in Japan, including the leader of the troupe who had previously visited twenty years earlier and fathered a child with a local woman. It starts off with too many characters engaged in random conversations. Although it takes a while for the main story line to emerge, the film becomes more interesting once it gets to that point. As one would expect from Ozu, the acting here is generally good if somewhat theatrical. The cinematography is quite colorful, helped by the picturesque seaside setting. Unfortunately, the plot is rather mundane and melodramatic, with themes of seduction and infidelity more suited to a trashy Hollywood movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ozu a master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yasujiro Ozu was perhaps the greatest obsessional filmmaker in history. Thus, it's no surprise that not only did he rework the same themes over and again in his films, but that he also redid earlier films of his own years later, such as 1932's I Was Born But... as 1959's Good Morning. The most famed examples of this trait are 1934's silent black and white A Story Of Floating Weeds (Ukikusa Monogatari), written by Ozu and Tadao Ikeda, and 1959's sound color film, Floating Weeds (Ukigusa), written by Ozu and Kôgo Noda. Both films, whose titular metaphor revolves around the lives of itinerant actors, tell basically the same tale, in slightly different ways, with differently named characters. They follow the ups and downs of the leader of a really bad theater troupe, on its last legs (not unlike the characters from Federico Fellini's first film, Variety Lights), who lands in a town and visits an old girlfriend who bore him a son. In both films, the son believes his father is really his uncle, and the major development in the films is how the father's jealous actress girlfriend tries to sabotage things by having a pretty young actress seduce the son, thus recapitulating the father's key moment in life, one the father believes ruined his chance at stardom and happiness.If one is thinking that this is the stuff of pure melodrama, it is. But that's true only on the surface. This is where depth and execution of an art come into play. It also abnegates claims that Ozu eschewed plot in his films for melodrama is about nothing if but plot. While it's true he did not strive for A to B to C narratives, and preferred 'organic' story growth, the fact is that all his films had plots, and good ones. But they were not plot driven, nor dependent upon the heavyhanded machinations most drama and films rely upon. The difference between having a plot and being plot driven is something most critics seem to not understand. Ozu simply removes the superfluous plot moments and adds contemplative, poetic, and metaphoric shots in their place, what are termed 'pillow shots.' The emphasis is thus not on the driving, but the driver, of plot. After all, the tale of a parent who has a long lost child is not fresh, although the way it's told can be.As for the films, the earlier one is actually the slightly better film, mostly because it's more concise- clocking in at 86 minutes vs. the two hour remake?.In defense of the later film, it has more humor (one character from the troupe claims his name is Toshiro Mifune- the great star of so many Akira Kurosawa films; a nod to Ozu's rival), and the son's reaction to the news about his father seems a bit more mature and realistic than in the earlier film, while the mother seems more resigned to her lover's leaving, rather than being devastated- as in the earlier film. But the ending of the earlier film, on the train, is better, for when we see the troupe leader reunited with his love, and see the sleeping child, the earlier film leaves no doubt that the leader is wistfully thinking of his son, while the later film does not. Another plus that the later film has is its use of color and symbolism, which is far more striking. The opening scene contrasts a lighthouse in the background with a foregrounded bottle. It is a stunning visual image, and such phallic symbols abound in the film, as bottles are repeatedly seen, and there is a scene where the local prostitutes tease the male troupe members as they suck on popsicles. We then see the lighthouse from other perspectives over the course of the film. The earlier film is not set at a seaside town, but in a rural area, and the scene of the father and son fishing is superior in the later film, for there is no oddly stylized synchronization of the pair tossing their fishing lines into the river, over and again, as in the 1934 film, and what the duo speak of- their views on the father's approach to acting, is far more cogent than in the silent version, whose major moment is when the father drops his wallet into the running water. The later version also mimetically puts the father and son in the position of the bottle in relation to the lighthouse at the film's opening. What this means, from a phallic perspective, is open to several interpretations. Another major difference between the two films is that the earlier film has more motion in it- literally. It was made before Ozu got caught in his tatami mat point of view mode, and therefore the emotion of the drama is recapitulated better in the earlier, more kinetic, film?.Both A Story Of Floating Weeds and Floating Weeds are proof that not all obsessions result in negativity, a thing one might remind oneself of the next time someone speaks ill of that trait. They are also fine examples of what made Yasujiro Ozu a great artist, even if the art in them might fall just a bit shy of overall greatness. Viva obsesión!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Ozu's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A run-down Kabuki-troupe comes to perform in a fishing village where the leader visits an old mistress and his son, who believes him to be his uncle. When his current mistress finds out about this she plots revenge by having a young actress seduce the son. The plot thickens when the actress falls in love with the son. Stylistically, this is probably the most overtly brilliant of all the Ozu's I've seen. The argument between the actor and his mistress in the rain, where the vertical bars of the traditional houses seem to form a cage around these two characters or the almost silent seduction of the son, these are prime examples of great filmmaking. However... An uncle who turns out to be the real father? Revenge-plots involving seduction? Femmes Fatales falling in love with their intended victim? This is the stuff of soap-opera. Very beautifully filmed soap-opera, but soap-opera nonetheless. Floating Weeds is a remake of a silent Ozu-movie and, although I haven't seen the original, I have the feeling this story would have worked better as a silent, where we make more allowances for characters acting melodramaticaly. This version, certainly when compared to the elegant simplicity of his other movies from the late fifties and early sixties, feels contrived and overwrought. It all culminates in a scene filled with arguments, surprise-revelations and reconciliations that feels talkie and stagey, like a very mediocre Arthur Miller play. The next scene on the other hand, the wordless reconciliation between the actor and his current mistress is again a brilliant example of Ozu's skill and sensibility and one of the scenes that save this movie from forgetableness. **1/2 </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew that this Japanese film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but I didn't know some of the critics did not rate it very highly, I saw one review giving it two stars out of five, so with the book inclusion was interested to see what I would think, from director Yasujirô Ozu (Tokyo Story, An Autumn Afternoon). Basically, set in the summer of 1958, at a seaside town in the Inland Sea, there is the arrival of a troupe of travelling players, headed by lead actor and owner Komajuro Arashi (Ganjirô Nakamura) the other players promote their acts. Komajuro goes to visit old flame Oyoshi (Haruko Sugimura) who had a son with him, Kiyoshi Homma (Hiroshi Kawaguchi), but the grown up son who works in the post office believes the visitor is his uncle, not his father. Komajuro's current mistress and lead actress Sumiko (Machiko Kyô) becomes jealous of her lover being with his old flame, and so that she cannot say anything to ruin him he takes her away and breaks up with her. To get some kind of revenge Sumiko pays fellow pretty and young troupe actress Kayo (Ayako Wakao) to seduce Kiyoshi, after initially refusing she does give in to this, and in the long time they spend together she does actually fall for the son, and she tells him the truth, he says it does not matter. Komajuro confronts Kayo when he finds out the couple are engaged, she says it is no longer for money from Sumiko, and angry he goes to talk to Sumiko, who refuses any kind of reconciliation, and with business bad he decides to break up the troupe and for them to play one last night. Oyoshi persuades him that if he is leaving soon that he should tell Kiyoshi about his true parentage, he agrees, but angry to see him and Kayo together he has a violent moment and beats them both, and he leaves without saying much at all. Kiyoshi is prepared to talk to and forgive Komajuro, but he leaves before he gets the opportunity, and on the train Komajuro happens upon Sumiko who has nowhere to go, so they reconcile and decide to go to Kuwana together. Also starring Kôji Mitsui as Kichinosuke and Chish? Ry? as Theatre Owner. The cast and the direction was fine, I can see why critics say it is the less memorable of the films from Ozu, it is not a terrible film, but is certainly does not have much interesting material, besides the unknown father and son storyline I was not always paying attention, so overall it is a moderately alright drama film. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually nice to look at, but the story drags just a bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yasujiro Ozu's cinematography and directing style fascinate me. The utterly unmovable camera is such a strange way to tell a story. It's almost like watching a comic book with its tight borders, except that the characters within those borders are allowed to move, enter and exit freely, yet the borders never move, as if utterly uninterested in their comings and goings.So yeah, visually this is a great movie, masterpiece even. The viewing angles change from sweeping scenery shots to extreme close-ups where the characters stare right into the camera, which at some points creates a feeling of uneasiness, but that works for the movie's favour. Plus, all the colours, all the traditional Japanese clothing, all the over-the-top facial expression on Komajuro's (Ganjiro Nakamura) face, they all come together to form a movie that's definitely nice to look at.Unfortunately the story itself is a bit boring. It's not that bad, not really, but I just couldn't get all that much into it. A group comes to town, the meet some people, some secrets are revealed, there's drama, there's hurt feelings. It's all very basic, and while the actors do manage to get into their roles and give good performances, I was left expecting just a bit more. A new twist, especially brilliant speech, something touching, but nope... nothing.So yeah, it's not a bad film. It's actually rather good, great even for those that will appreciate it for its visual style and simple, yet classic story. The latter just wasn't my cup of tea in this case, unfortunately.</fullReview>
