		<shortDescription>A great inside view of two people who are so married, but so far apart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie and Anne Archer! This is definately a woman's story and I think we all can identify with the range of feelings she has, even if we are happy within our own relationships. I think there are a whole range of issues being dealt with: she and her husband have grown apart and no longer have the same views/goals and also she is coming into her own now and I really feel it partly due to her age and maturity. When a woman gets to that time of her life (40's or 50's) she is moving on to her "next phase" and if her husband is unable to grow and change with her - he risks losing her.I would love to see this movie again so that I could tape it. I have looked all over for it and it is not in print to purchase (except for the original made in 1954).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Anne Archer in this film and fell in love with her (so to speak). She is perfect in this role, a woman realizing that life is not perfect and sometimes you have to take a chance on love, regardless of your age, station in life, or your current relationships. As the Italian vintner says, "What are you besides your husband's hostess?" She had never looked at herself that way with raising their daughter and being the diplomat's perfect wife. She was willing to take a chance on love because looking at her life, trying to be the perfect wife, mother, "her husband's hostess", a diplomat's wife, she had disappeared. A truly wonderful chick flick.</fullReview>
