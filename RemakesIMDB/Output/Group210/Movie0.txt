		<shortDescription>Two Heartfelt Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like fine wine, "Stazione Termini" seems to grow better and better with age. Generally "written off" as a lesser De Sica work, this film offers two beautiful performances by Jennifer Jones and Montgomery Clift. The two, with different types of acting training, sensitively mesh their discrete styles through deeply felt emotions. Highly gifted, vulnerable, and insecure, these top performers reach for the bottom of their feelings in bringing to life two desperate, lonely lovers. It's been said these thespians enjoyed a close off-screen relationship due to the leading lady's deep infatuation with her co-star, and that she was distraught when he, due to personal circumstances, was unable to mutually respond.That's not at all surprising, for it's all there in their work in this drama. A deft melding of romance and neo-realism, which marks the distinctive De Sica style, "Stazione" now seems just the right length for its content. It almost seems to unfold in "quasi-real time," with shots of clocks ticking away before the train leaves at the story's finale to emphasize the time element. What emerges here is a kind of slice-of-life vignette: two people in love, who must part due to one partner's domestic responsibility. We are allowed to briefly share their intimate, final moments together before their inevitable parting. Zavattini's script (along with Truman Capote and Ben Hecht's dialogue) nicely capture these fleeting minutes, while the score lushly points up the pathos of a tragic unfoldment. De Sica's unique direction (with Selznick's uncredited contribution) rounds out a small gem of a film whose vintage grows increasingly more sweet and more special with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever Allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is full of ironical metaphors. We have a running Joseph and Mary / Adam and Eve biblical subtext. The surface sentimentality can be misleading. Rome Termini Station contains enough iconography of Heaven and Hell to make up an ironic parable. I'm surprised that so many critics have not picked up the clever gags. I suspect that the butchering of the film down to 63 minutes has something to do with it. The serpent and the apple, seeking refuge in the manger, Dante's innocent descending into the purgatory of the police station, two passionate innocents caught up in orthodox role structure, it's all there, if rather clumsily re-edited. The film clearly belongs to an era where film language a la Welles or Hitchcock was more sophisticated than much of today's mainstream cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive tragic romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of "Stazione Termini" has always been highly appealing to me. In the mode of "Brief Encounter," which director David Lean brought successfully to the screen earlier, "Stazione" potentially offers the same rewards.The combination of director Vittorio De Sica and writer Cesare Zavattini was natural. Likewise, the pairing of Montgomery Clift and Jennifer Jones was intriguing.Yet, the efforts of all these great talents failed to produce the monumental work expected. What went wrong?The contribution of David O. Selznick, while thoroughly professional as always, may have strangely thrown off the delicate balance.This was very much an Italian work. The American actors were portraying characters who were essentially visitors to a foreign land--guests and tourists operating within the cultural discretion of their Roman hosts. Where these characters failed to completely understand and operate with respect to the Italian sensibility and heritage, so Mr. Selznick may likewise have inadvertently intruded upon the proceedings by introducing his own distinctive American values and approaches to filmmaking.In short, Selnick and De Sica did not mix well here. To this viewer, the production would have been much more viable had Selnick remained more in the background, allowing the proven creativity of the De Sica team to work its own magic.Likewise, a more distinctive score could have made a considerable difference. While the music was most appropriate, it did not make a truly "classic" statement. Finally, the unfortunate editing paired the film down to so short a duration that the drama simply lacked the time to make a moving impression. "Stazione" seems as much a mood as character piece, and De Sica required footage to accomplish this.Despite these shortcomings, "Stazione Termini" contains beautifully modulated performances by Clift and Jones, as the sad lovers who must part and go their separate ways. De Sica's direction is sensitive and compassionate, and the film remains a poignant moment in the lives of two lonely people clinging to one final opportunity to express forbidden love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such evocative scenes, the light and mood!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiscretion of an American Wife (1953)This is such a contained, focused film, and demands so much of its two actors, every little nuance matters in a kind of exciting dramatic way. The closest thing this compares to, as two lovers or would be lovers talk in a train station, is Brief Encounter (1945), and that's a masterpiece of acting and cinema both.Here, with Montgomery Clift and Jennifer Jones, it comes close. I found the slowness of it magical, and the filming, in the ultra modern station, very beautiful. If director Vittoria De Sica clearly has a different style than David Lean (though both pile on the romanticism), the effect is still one of longing and loneliness. The weakness here, most of all, is simply the writing, which is so important when two people are sitting around in conversation most of the time.Oddly, and sadly, it was the producer (Selznick) who got in the way. He was married to Jones at the time, and she was unhappy both during the filming and in her marriage. She also seems to be overacting sometimes--she can be marvelous, and nuance magnified might be exactly what was needed, but it often seems distracting. Clift, for his part, liked De Sica and he did what he could with what he had to work with under the director. It was Selznick who interfered with De Sica, and who altered the script using a series of screenwriters, and even though Truman Capote was one of them, the whole thing was hampered.The fact it is still a marvelous film is something to wonder at. Flawed, yes, but short and intense and it has a special feeling that Hollywood (and British counterparts) were unable to pull off. The whole atmosphere and mood are enough alone to make it worthwhile. I saw the short version, and I think it's probably plenty, but if you find the original, with 20 minutes extra, and you like this one, give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film will not appeal to everyone, but even with the ravages executed by Selznick on the American cut, Stazione Termini (Selznick's U.S. version: Indiscretion of an American Housewife) remains a powerful film for those who can appreciate it.To be sure, there are faults, especially unfortunate in light of De Sica's credentials. Most striking are that Montgomery Clift as American-Italian is a spectacular error, not so much in casting, as in characterization (American expat would have worked); far too much English comes from the mouths of early-1950s Romans and other Italians; and the American housewife is perhaps overly oblivious to the italianit? around her. Otherwise, mostly spot on, at least in the full version.Jennifer Jones, beyond radiant in her prime-of-life womanhood, exudes a sensuality that both contrasts strikingly with her 1950s-prim exterior and celebrates the troubled woman within: proper well-brought-up ladies can have passions, too, a marriage ceremony is no guarantor that all will be well 'til death do them part, and she, like so many before her and after, struggles when smoldering embers flare and she senses that the 'groove' of her comfortable, uneventful marriage may actually be 'rut'.As would be expected of De Sica, his rendition of the setting -- the newly rebuilt Stazione Termini itself, trains, travelers -- is so accurate as to pass for a recording, and protagonists as well as the concentrically-involved supporting cast embed within it void of staging, with total plausibility.The arrest scene and its aftermath also verges on documentary in its genuinity. The strict proprieties of post-WWII Rome -- for some Romans very genuine, for others hypocritical sham even then -- may seem contrived to a young American or British viewer today, but the inevitable tension was very real at the time, and De Sica presents its effects honestly, and with éclat.Give Stazione Termini a chance. Enter the time and place. De Sica managed to do a fine job of it, in spite of Selznick's ill-advised meddling, and he deserves far more more credit than he's normally given for this effort. So does Jennifer Jones, who is magnificent here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't recapture the magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monty Clift and Elizabeth Taylor lit up the screen in A Place in the Sun with their performances. My belief is that David O. Selznick thought that with his wife Jennifer Jones opposite Clift, some of the magic from that film would rub off here.But there's no magic in Stazione Termini. I saw a butchered version that reached the American cinema. Now it's possible that what now would be called a director's cut would have been better, but I doubt it. Jennifer Jones is fine as the American wife who is leaving Rome after an affair with a local played by Monty Clift. But basically I sat through 63 minutes of one long goodbye.Up to a few minutes ago I had seen at one point every Montgomery Clift movie except this one. I wish I hadn't seen this one. Poor Monty Clift is about as Italian as Lech Walesa. I think Monty knows this one was going to be a stinkeroo for him and it shows. At one point director Vittorio DeSica explains that Clift has an American mom to explain the lack of Italian accent. Why didn't he cast someone like Rossano Brazzi in the part, God only knows. I'd guess that Mr. Selznick had something to do with it. David O. Selznick was not terribly rational when it came to his wife's career. Maybe in an American story Jones and Clift might have set some sparks off. But not here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodramatic, Boring and Dated Romance in a Mutilated Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Rome, the American Mary Forbes (Jennifer Jones) arrives in the central station to get the first train to Milan to return to her husband and daughter in Philadelphia. She calls her sister's house and asks her nephew Paul (Dick Beymer) to bring her luggage to the station. When the train is ready to go, Mary sees Giovanni Doria (Montgomery Clift) seeking her out in the platform. Mary has had a torrid love affair with the Italian man and she decided to break off with her lover without saying good-bye to him. She misses the train and decides to take one direct to Paris later to stay with Giovanni. They go to an empty wagon and while making love, they are arrested by the chief engineer and sent to the police station where the commissioner will decide their fate.I have just watched the 63 minutes running time version of "Indiscretion of American Wife" and I found it a melodramatic, boring and dated romance. However I noted in IMDb that the original version has 90 minutes running time; therefore it is unfair to review such mutilated version, unfortunately the only one available on DVD in Brazil. I only do not understand how a distributor can cut one third of the film and release the crap work credited to Vittorio De Sica. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "Quando a Mulher Erra" ("When the Woman Makes a Mistake")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such talent wasted in a talky drama that takes forever to get off the tracks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At 63 minutes long, the American release of this Italian filmed drama seems eternal in trying to get and keep one's attention. Jennifer Jones and Montgomery Clift are cast as an American wife on a holiday and her Italian lover who are at a Rome train station wrapping up their affair. Jones previously tried to leave a "Dear John" letter for the emotional Clift who won't let her go, and when her nephew (a young Richard Beymer) shows up to say goodbye, it is apparent that there is a possibility of a scandal brewing. There seems to be footage missing that explains what lead to the romance and why it is so hard for the two to say goodbye. Jones plays a married wife and mother who seems to have no reason for infidelity, and while her attraction to Clift is clear, this absence of details is hard to make the viewer be really interested. There are some nice twists and turns in the story which do briefly increase interest, and the scene where Jones helps a sick pregnant woman with three children is very touching. The city of Rome itself seems to be a character, overcrowded with people in Jones and Clift's way in their desire for privacy. The scene in the police station (afer the two are caught trespassing on a train) is fraught with tension as the time clicks towards the departure of Jones' train, but the ultimate farewell of the two is less than dramatically intriguing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming after "ladri di biciclette"(1946)"miracolo a Milano"(1950) and the absorbing and rather unrecognized "Umberto D"(probably De Sica's masterpiece,1952),"Stazione Termini" cannot be put on a par with these former works.It is an interesting effort though.Montgomery Clift and Jennifer Jones are par excellence the romantic couple ,but in an Italian environment,they look like extra-terrestrials.Do not get me wrong,I do enjoy these two actors' talent ,but I wonder why De Sica ,one of the neorealism high priests, has chosen Hollywood stars whereas ,for instance,he refused to engage Cary Grant for the "ladri di biciclette" lead,and he used rather obscure actors for "Umberto D".Besides,I wonder whether both Jones and Clift are dubbed (or not?) in Italian.I wonder too whether this actress was not influenced by Ingrid Bergman's coming to Italy.When she buys chocolate for the children and when she wants to help the poor family,Jones' character makes me think of Bergman's in Rossellini's "Europa 51" (1951) for a very short whileThe plot is banal and the railway station becomes the star of the film.De Sica completely succeeds in showing the life of this hive,with its travelers,its priests,its soldiers,its poor families packed into 3rd class waiting rooms,its trains heading for darkness .The lovers' faces are nicely filmed as if they were the only lights of this obscure world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling portrait of inner conflict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bored Philadelphia housewife meets sexy Italian guy in Rome and flirts with both him and the idea of abandoning her husband and 7-year-old daughter.Jennifer Jones, clad in a form-fitting, Dior "New Look" suit, is wonderful as a woman who has never done anything the least bit unconventional. Montgomery Clift is just as good as a would-be Latin lover with a "gather ye rosebuds while ye may" mentality.Director Vittorio de Sica -- who in real life simultaneously maintained two separate families -- does an excellent job of conjuring temptation and conflict. There are incredibly eloquent scenes here involving nothing but wordless closeups, but they manage to say a lot.I remember a scene from Garbo's "Anna Karenina," in which she runs away to Italy with Count Vronsky, leaving not only her loveless marriage but also a beloved young son. The abandonment couldn't bring happiness, and, with Ms. Jones's persona, it wouldn't here, either.Effectively playing the role of Mrs. Forbes's conscience is a young Richard Beymer, eight years from his break-out performance as Tony in "West Side Story." He is used to great effect in his questioning of Giovanni's presence -- and shocking face smack -- in his aunt's life.I thoroughly enjoyed the gritty, train-station backdrop to this classic drama, which memorably features dialogue by Truman Capote.A fascinating work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiscretion of an American Wife (1953)** (out of 4)An American wife (Jennifer Jones) needs to leave Italy for Paris but she's having a hard time letting go of her Italian lover (Montgomery Clift). Originally this was released as STAZIONE TERMINI at 89-minutes but when it hit America, the producer chopped it down to just 63-minutes and added this new title. I'm not going to try and review the original since I haven't seen it but I really do hope it's better than this thing here, which is just a boring mess. Again, I have no idea why David O. Selznick decided to cut this movie down and I'm not certain if it helped or hurt it. I can say that this version here is just one big, boring melodrama that thankfully features two good actors or else this would have been a real disaster. I knew I was in trouble early on during a scene where the woman is writing a note, can't finish it and just crumbles it up. This is when the first loud, swelling music happened and this here was a clue that we were just going to get a boring, wannabe tear-jerker. Throughout the movie there were at least a dozen moments where the music would go loud and over-dramatic but I guess they were trying to use the music to make up for the fact that nothing you were watching was dramatic or emotion. This movie is really, really trying to make the viewer feel for these characters but that's pretty much impossible especially when you know so little about them. The majority of the time they just come across as two people who need to get a life. Both Jones and Clift are good in their roles but I'd say that both of them had much better days. I think just knowing how great they are made up for the fact that they weren't given much and I'm not too convinced that Monty was the right person for the role. What's really shocking is that director Vittorio DeSica made the masterpiece UMBERTO D before this thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Derailment: When Hollywood collides with Neo-Realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between his two classic works The Bicycle Thief and Umberto D. Vittorio DeSica and GWTW producer David Selznick got together to make this turgid melodrama that chugs along sluggishly the entire ride. Neo-Realist Master De Sica working with big Hollywood stars made for an unorthodox pairing and the results are disastrous.American Mary Forbes (Jennifer Jones) has a brief passionate affair with young handsome Giovanni Darvi (Montgomery Clift) while visiting Italy. She attempts to break it off but he remains persistent and she weakens amid the chaotic atmosphere of the Rome train station where they have come to exchange bittersweet goodbyes.This truncated 63 minute version of a longer film is all the proof one needs to see what an abysmal undertaking it is. De Sica who had the magic touch of perfectly casting leads with amateur actors errs in a big way by miscasting an American Method as a Latin charmer. The introspective Monty Clift is downright embarrassing as he exhibits little passion and a bad accent that makes you want to cringe. Vapid beauty Jennifer Jones is also a bad coupling as she roams the station key lit with a pained expression, incapable of stretching beyond screen queen. The cinematography is uninspired and the setting itself utilized poorly as De Sica has the same extras scurrying about like ants racing for trains from beginning to end. And with nearly a third of the film excised the editing suffers immeasurably. Even the one shot match cuts are uneven as it jumps from the expressive Clift to the blank beauty of Jones. The laughable climax of this steam less melodrama adds insult to injury as the lovers are treated like recalcitrant teens. However, it matters little since Stazione Termini never gets on track from the outset.</fullReview>

JENNIFER JONES is absolutely gorgeous as a straight laced and noble American woman who enters into an affair with an Italian man (played by MONTGOMERY CLIFT). The film takes place entirely at a train station with the two lovers going back and forth in their commitment towards each other even as they stave off red tape.The love story is interspersed with slice of life scenes at the station. - both comedic and heart breaking. I think the film would have been better in the hands of a more conventional American filmmaker. But even then, a really nice watch mainly due to some intense acting and the chemistry between the two leads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it this morning on TCM and was three-quarters of the way through it before I realized I'd seen it before a few years ago. Now that is the definition of a forgettable movie. Jennifer Jones can be excused, but you'd think that Montgomery Clift could have done more with a Truman Capote script. This is what happens when the writer only does dialog and leaves the stage direction wholly to the crew. The most interesting thing in the entire movie was the subplot between the American aunt and her Italian puppy-eyed nephew. Too many marching bands, too many bizarre scenes (after all, it's not supposed to be lighthearted, is it?). Way too claustrophobic, but trains are like that sometimes. This one, I believe, is a wreck, a sleeper-car of sorts. Perhaps it's Truman Capote's fault, but that's unlikely Next trip I'm taking a bus.</fullReview>

I've never been particularly enamoured of Jennifer Jones, finding her a tad sultry from my taste but I have to confess that here I can find little fault with her and she almost equals Monty Clift in both acting skill and intensity. There is enough evidence both from the photography, set-ups, imagery and even the way De Sica fills the frame with other people, some recurring, others just passing, to regret what might have been although on the other hand what we have is pretty tasty and on the whole is illustrative of what can be done with a run-of-the-mill story of doomed love when you have people of this calibre involved.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Despite its short duration on screen, 64 minutes, the movie "Indescretions of an American Wife" is almost as torturous to sit through and digest as a six course Thanksgivng dinner including seconds! It's in fact the fine acting of it's two leading actors Montgomery Cliff and Jennifer Jones as half Italian and half American University of Pisa professor Giovanni Doria and bored and lonely Philadelphia housewife Mary Forbes that save the film from total destruction. Originally titled "Terminal Station" still both Cliff &amp; Jones which sounds like the name of a Wall Street law firm or San Francisco detective agency almost had their fine acting careers terminated in being in the movie.What really sunk the movie was the behind the scenes quibbling between the films Italian director Vittorio De Sica's and American and Hollywood producer David O. Selznick who was married to Miss Jones at the time. It was the always having it his way, and getting it, Selznick who by wanting more out of De Sica's efforts in the film who ended up butchering the movie. It was those deranged efforts on Selznick's part that ended up cutting out all the good parts in the film shrinking the 89 minute, which is now available on DVD, soap opera by almost a third to just over an hours time!The movie itself has to do with American Mary Forbes who's about to leave for Paris at the spacious Rome Terminal Station who then runs into her Italian and half American lover Giovanni Doria. Giovanni who after a month long hot and heavy love affair with Mary is heart-broken to see her go without as much as telling him she's leaving. Mary went to Rome to visit her sister and after meeting the handsome Giovannie fell madly in love with him and promised to never ever leave him. You can imagine the shock that Giovanni felt when he saw his beloved Mary leaving him for good without as much as say goodbye but only sending him a dear John or in his case Dear Giovanni letter in the mail.The dark and gloomy look to the movie is the fact that director De Sica decided to shoot the entire film not only inside a train station but, because the real time duration of the film is about three hours, at night! It was because of that on De Sica's part that made the film watchable and entertaining. It's the critical time element in Mary waiting for the train to come and pick her up that was keeping her and the audience on pins and needles all throughout the movie. In spite of the ridiculous part, as an Italan lover, he had in the movie Montgomery Cliff came across very convincing and the ending when he's falls and almost gets himself killed running after the train carrying Mary almost brought tears to my eyes.As for Jennifer Jones as Mary Forbes she was, at age 33, as beautiful as I've ever seen her in a movie and was lucky enough to be called upon by director De Sica to show mostly emotions not read her corny lines, which for the most part were idiotic, which really showed what a great actress she really was. Jennifer Jones came across like a grown up and far more mature Judy Garland in a similar film that Judy was in at age 22 was back in 1945 called "The Clock". In that film Judy's co-star being of all people Jnnifer's husband at the time Robert Walker! As for what turned out to be the real star of the movie Rome's Terminal Station, or in Italian Stazione Terminl, it was one of the late Italian Dictator's Benito Mossolini's biggest projects in trying to modernize but never finishing it, he was thrown out of power before he could, which coined the phrase attributed to him in having the trains come on time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Very) Brief Encounter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The briefest of brief encounters. Vittorio De Sica's one hour romance plays like the last half of a longer movie. Jennifer Jones is an American leaving Rome pursued by Italian lover Montgomery Clift. Their long goodbye makes up the entire film. It's very well-made with some great acting (particularly from Jones, who's NOT out-acted by Clift). They have great chemistry. De Sica, relying on dialog by none other than Truman Capote, pulls off a miracle of sorts by creating a full fledged film in less than 65 minutes. It's sad but never pathetic, full of irony (Jones tells Clift she's a housewife and has no imagination!) and even some suspense. Clift is exceptional and does not affect any sort of phony Italian accent. The stunning photography is by G.R. Aldo, who also shot SENSO and Welles's OTHELLO. Even in a truncated version (pared down by Jones's husband David O. Selznick), it's a terrific film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very brief "Brief Encounter" re-staging with an Italian milieu...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cesare Zavattini's slim story "Terminal Station" turned into somewhat-overblown star-vehicle for Jennifer Jones and Montgomery Clift, who manage to create romantic tension despite director Vittorio De Sica's insistence upon an overly-busy background. These indiscreet lovers (she a married housewife from Philadelphia and he the half-Italian professor who adores her) are consistently spied upon by accusing eyes while saying their reluctant farewells in Rome's railway station. De Sica appears to be just as interested in the central couple as he is in the woman's young nephew (Dick Beymer) who simply refuses to leave, happy party groups, another group of serious-faced priests, an elderly Italian and his apples, a pregnant woman, the overachievers on the police force, etc. Told in 'real time', the looming faces of the many clocks (reminding our couple of her impending trip home) become a red herring in the proceedings, which do have intriguing moments in spite of the fact Clift shows no signs of Italian blood (he barely seems to comprehend the language!). Jones, in a tidy Jane Wyman-ish hairdo, ably manages to convey the torn emotions of a woman with a family who has found passion at last, and her performances is certainly worth-seeing. Clift makes a fantastically dramatic exit from a moving train, but otherwise just fills the bill. David O. Selznick production has the requisite gloss, but could have used a bit more fire under its icy exterior. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A married American woman has an affair with an Italian man while visiting her sister in Rome. This short film (a longer director's cut now exists) focuses on the last few hours spent at a train station as the woman is returning home. De Sica creates some striking imagery but the script is too slight to let the characters or the plot develop. Apparently producer Selznick cut the film to stress the romance and to make Jones (his wife then) look good. Clift plays a brooding, hot-blooded Italian but isn't given much to do. Both Jones and Clift have quirky mannerisms that seem well suited to the roles of the angst-ridden lovers. An interesting curiosity piece.</fullReview>

Jennifer Jones seems to emit no other expressions except pursing her face as if she's about to give birth - it gets old fast and so does her lack of ability to act. Montgomery Clift has his moments, but fails to convince me he has any remote Italian bone in his body, except his attempt to speak Italian isn't a half-bad effort. Montgomery Clift's character is more like a "wife beater"-wearing overbearing American. And Jennifer Jones is air-headed, fake and pretentious. The lack of development and believable character portrayal makes any personal investment in these characters impossible. You really end up wanting this movie to be over and done with, wishing the two lovers never got involved in the first place. You find it hard to believe either would be attracted to the other. Clift's character slaps Jennnifer Jones', and then somehow she's supposed to be excited to see him when he comes back for her? In such a short time she's gone from one extreme to another in her desires for him. This makes absolutely no sense to me, since all she seems to do is try to get away from him and make excuses to get out of his sight in the from the beginning. Everything not adding up and the poor level of over and under acting makes this movie utterly ridiculous. There is nothing romantic about this movie. Its nauseating. The trains are nice though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film with Great atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally don't like love stories, too schmaltzy, but this film, along with Brief Encounter are my favorites. Ironically they both have train stations as important location. However, I think that their major attraction is that they are about love lost in a time long ago before I was born, and made before I was born. Criticism has been made about the casting of Jennifer Jones and Montgomery Clift. However, I think that they are perfect together. So Monty does not have an Itallian accent. but if this film is shown in foreign countries, his voice is probably dubbed, and hopefully dubbed with the same performance that he is able to give in his English performance.He is able to give a great performance of a man who is going to lose a woman, though married, who he has had an affair with, and who is older than him. If you have ever been in that position of having been infatuated with someone who is older than you, or have had that love, and known you would not be having her in your life, Montgomery Clift gives that amazing performance, and you can feel his pain. His last shot in the film, is a classic. Jennifer Jones in this film, what can I say, if you are a man, you can understand Clifts feelings. It was rumored, from another source here on IMDb, that Jones was interested in Monty. If true, she is able to give those feelings in her performance. Their dialog together has the feeling of sexual needs that an American film could not have had at that time. Even young Richard Beymers character, I felt a young boy who wishes he could have a love affair with Jennifer Jones.Wonderful cinematography in this film, that takes place in this international train station, and wonderful supporting characters. Their arrest is quite memorable as well, though (according to the audio commentary on the Criterion DVD) elicited laughter in Italy, where they said such an arrest would not have happened, though another IMDb observer apparently claims would have happened. Which is the truth.A great film about love and lust all rolled into one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often dismissed as a failure in the film history books, this is actually an outstanding gem which deserves to be seen. I have not seen the Criterion disc, but I have seen the film twice. In a theater, it was re-released in the uncut version as STATZIONE TERMINI some time in the 1980's. I also saw the much shorter INDISCRETION OF AN American WIFE, which is also very good. The film works due to the outstanding performances of Jennifer Jones and Montgomery Clift, and also due to the outstanding location filming. Produced by Jones' husband, the camera adores her. She looks radiant (she was about 34 at the time), and the camera seems to be on her in nearly every frame of the film. Well worth checking out in any version!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could such a talented group of people make a film this awful?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most surprising movies I've seen in a very, very long time. The film's director, Vittorio DeSica is one of my very favorites and I try to watch everything of his I can. His other films such as THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US, UMBERTO D. and MIRACLE IN MILAN are masterpieces, so I naturally thought STAZIONE TERMINI would at least be a good film. Instead, it was absolutely horrible in practically every way. I think the main problem was that in this film, DeSica had abandoned the type film that made him so famous, the so-called "Italian Neorealist" style. In the movies I listed above, DeSica used non-actors and the films excelled due to their realism and down to earth style. However, here, DeSica was "cursed" with a larger budget and the talents of David O. Selznick. While Selznick was no doubt a talented man, his style and type of films he made were in no way like those of the neorealist school. Plus, being a Selnick production, the film had to star Selznick's live-in and perennial leading lady, Jennifer Jones. This was a bad choice, but it got even worse when the Hollywood-minded Selznick ALSO cast Montgomery Clift as Miss Jones' lover. These famous actors were all wrong for DeSica's style, but it got even worse because Clift was cast as an Italian professor--yet he didn't even have a trace of an accent!!! This was apparently an anti-neorealistic movie, as all attempts to film "normal" people went out the window. Apparently the big bucks that came with a Selznick production were just too tempting to DeSica and he sold his soul.Now if the problem had only been the casting decisions, I still could have lived with the film. Sure, I would have been disappointed, but there still could have been a good movie hiding under all the Hollywood glitz. Unfortunately, the casting was possibly the least problem with this awful film. I can't recall another mainstream film with dialog this bad or syrupy or as poorly written. I expected something artistic or meaningful but it delivered something like an Ed Wood flick--it was THAT bad. The repulsive gushing and mushiness of the dialog is practically stomach-turning, as Clift and Jones slobber all over each other and whine about their love. Sure, a tiny bit of this might have been okay, but to extend this self-indulgent claptrap for practically the length of the film was unforgivable. Also, some amazingly stupid dialog was in the film about how Clift loved Jones so much he wanted to make her his wife and beat her regularly to show he loved her. In fact, later when he was angry about her spurning his love, he back handed her---wow, now THAT'S a great way to show her you love her!! And Jones, being a total low self-esteem weasel, actually apologizes to him later after this altercation!! Another problem, and this one shocked me, was that at times the film had poor cinematography--with fuzzy or out of focus shots that made it look like the film was made by a rookie. I really think that the film looked as if DeSica just gave up and wanted to get the whole mess finished as quickly as possible. By the way, even the music was bad--way too loud and way too much at times.By the way, if you care about the plot (and I don't really think it matters), Jones has been having an affair with Clift. However, she has a daughter and husband back in America and is naturally torn. Clift comes to the train station and whines and begs her to stay and she is like a yo-yo in her decisions--one minute swearing to stay and the next declaring she'll go. Enough already--just GO!! In many ways, it's like an Italian version of BRIEF ENCOUNTER--just not nearly as well made. Apparently I am not the only one who hated this film. When it was shown in the same form I watched it, the audiences hated it and Selznick "re-tooled" the film and trimmed it significantly. I did not watch this newer version, but based on what he had to work with, the only way it would be significantly improved is if it were trimmed to the length of a movie trailer! Aside from tons of cash and alcohol, I doubt if there is anything that can induced me to watch the other version (INDISCRETION OF AN American WIFE)--my disgust for this movie is THAT great!! Sappy, poorly directed and cast as well as having some of the worst dialog in history--avoid this movie unless you are a masochist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interminable bore and a bleak indiscretion indeed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even in its truncated running time, INDISCRETION OF AN American WIFE (the U.S. title of TERMINAL STATION), is an outright bore from beginning to end with miscasting and lack of chemistry between the two leads--JENNIFER JONES and MONTGOMERY CLIFT.Each performs in a quirky manner--perhaps they do deserve each other, but the chemistry is clearly lacking despite the huge close-ups of Miss Jones' anguished face and Clift, before the accident that scarred his face. Whenever Jones gets overly emotional, Clift keeps a rigid, fixed look, almost robot-like in manner.He is as unconvincing as an Italian as she is as a housewife from Baltimore. Despite the neo-realism of the settings, the film never achieves a note of real anguish or believability. Vittorio de Sica's direction doesn't help the performers. Incredibly, the only decent performance comes from RICHARD BEYMER in one of his earliest roles as a child actor.Why Selznick allowed his protégé/wife to appear in this sort of trash is something I cannot understand, since he was supposed to be so particular about choosing just the right vehicle for the actress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vittorio De Sica has An Affair to Forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts out beautifully, thanks to director Vittorio De Sica, and camera-persons Aldo Graziati and James Wong Howe. Jennifer Jones (as Mary Forbes) is an unhappily married woman who has been visiting her sister in Rome; there, she has had an affair with half-Italian Montgomery Clift (as Giovanni). Ms. Jones and Mr. Clift, have, from the looks of things, fallen madly in love during the liaison. Unfortunately, "Indiscretion of an American Wife" (aka "Stazione Termini"), set exclusively in a Rome train station terminal, never progresses from its initial visual stimulation.Jones and Clift are worth watching, especially if you are a fan; however, their relationship does not exactly enchant. Although it would, admittedly, alter De Sica's artistic intention, some scenes of their initial meeting, and attraction, would have helped. The fact that Clift swats Jones rather forcefully suggests some cruelty in their relationship; additionally, Clift sometimes looks at Jones with a touch of madness in his eyes. The two seem to inhabit a slightly demented world of their own; but, not enough of their background is known to make it interesting. Richard "Dick" Beymer (who'll later be "Tony" in "West Side Story") is an unexpected highlight as Jones' overprotective young nephew Paul, who hangs out at the train station. ***** Indiscretion of an American Wife (4/2/53) Vittorio De Sica ~ Jennifer Jones, Montgomery Clift, Richard Beymer, Gino Cervi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls Short of Its Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This drama is fairly well-constructed, but never really pulls in the viewer the way that it could have. Although the story and settings have potential, there are never any compelling reasons to care deeply about the characters. It's watchable, and has its merits, but no more.The story is fairly simple, but is set up pretty well. A married American woman (Jennifer Jones) has gotten involved with Giovanni (Montgomery Clift) while visiting in Rome, and she has to decide whether to continue with Giovanni or to return home. The settings are chosen rather well, with much of the movie taking place in a railway station, and the secondary characters are used well to set off the decisions that the two leads have to make.But it falls short with the leading characters. Clift's character is possessive, brooding, and self-centered. Granted that we are meeting him at a time of relative crisis, but nothing about him is especially positive, and Clift's emotive style doesn't help. Jones's character is somewhat better, and she is convincing in her indecision, but she never becomes fully sympathetic either. As you watch, you want to know what is going to happen, but because there's little reason to care very much about the characters, the movie really never gets going the way that it could have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Railroad Terminal Station</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American married woman (Jennifer Jones) visited Rome and while being there got a relationship with another young man (Monty Clift). One day she decided to go back to USA going first by train to Paris. At the Terminal railroad station (Stazione Termini) she decided to send a message to his lover announcing her departure, but he got acquainted somehow before and went to Termini to see her. After several discussions, they made peace and decided to hide themselves in an empty wagon to be closer, they were surprised by the local police and were taken to its station inside Termini. Hopefully, the police commissioner (Gino Cervi) saw nothing wrong and let them go. As you may see the plot is nothing deep, the best of the film is that shows several Roman sites as Piazza Navona and the whole Termini Station as well as the behavior of some Italian people. When you see the film you think that you are there inside the station participating together with the actors. Probably this was the idea of De Sica when directed such a drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very poor film !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without doubt the worst film I can remember! I also cannot believe some of the other rave reviews for it here. It took me about 1 minute of viewing to realize what a looser this film is. It's so unrealistic and poorly done as to be laughable. If you want to see acting that is so overdone as to be ridiculous see the scene where Jones is leaving on the train. I am,as I write this , watching it for the first (and last) time. It is also a short film lasting less then 70 minutes. And it has a distinct film noire look that is very appropriate to it's overall affect. IF you have to visit the dentist soon, see this film first and the dental work will seem fun. Some of the other reviews here indicate that this is a diamond in the rough. Those reviewers are obviously legally blind!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie and thought it was really pretty weird, however somehow entertaining only I don't really know exactly why. I think in some ways it was because of the whole "train station" genre.You know the atmosphere of the old train stations, the crowds, the smells (the movie practically allows the smells to come through the T.V.!), BUT....I wanted to know if anyone else had this opinion.Obviously when the couple is caught in the empty train in one of the private compartments they were only just sitting with Montgomery holding Jennifer....big deal...yet they made a HUGE case of it. They forced them to see the commissioner and there was tons of ridicule of many along the long walk back to the headquarters despite the fact that Jennifer had to catch a train in 20 or so min. I think we are supposed to believe that they were caught in a much more illicit act, but of course given the time period that can't be shown in any detail. Anyone else have any thoughts on that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boredom of an American Viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I really can't stand Jennifer Jones, the positive aspects of "Indiscretion of an American Wife" seemed like they could outweigh this admittedly big (for me at least) negative. Directed by Vittorio de Sica, it has a simple setting (a train station in Rome) and a simple story: A married woman, Mary Forbes (Jones) is visiting relatives in Italy, and has an affair with an Italian man, Giovanni Doria (Montgomery Clift). She decides to leave him and travel home, but he catches up with her at the train station and spends the next hour and fifteen minutes trying to convince her to stay with him.Clocking in at an hour and nineteen minutes, I thought that would be one of the positive aspects of the film. Unfortunately, they were 79 minutes of sheer boredom. I still can't stand Jennifer Jones (who I still think always has the look of someone who is about to sneeze), but I thought that Montgomery Clift would be a great asset to the film at least. Again, I was wrong. He was as believable as an Italian as Kevin Costner was believable as Robin Hood. (I.e. Not at all) As a matter of fact, the two did manage to share the same accent. With two out of the three possible positives quickly proving negative, I then examined the director's influence on the film. I distinctly remembered Martin Scorcese, in his fantastic and educational documentary "A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies" mentioning de Sica as an inspiration for his work, so I at least had that to ponder. While my verdict on this aspect is not negative, it is not positive either, as I don't think a film with this narrow of a scope is the greatest indicator of talent and inspiration. Since my respect for Scorcese as a film scholar is so great, rather than completely discounting de Sica along with the rest of the film, I'll abstain from judgment until I see other examples.I have read some reviews of this film saying that this film was compelling and had powerhouse performances. I completely disagree; I found it to be dull and badly acted. When a film centers on very few characters and is in one primary location, it takes good acting and an even better script. (See Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope" if you want an excellent primer on how this concept is done right.) "Indiscretion of an American Wife" had neither of these aspects and therefore gets a 3/10 from me.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the fleeting vapor of your feelings carries greater sway than your commitment to family, have we got a film for you. For the low price of some mild embarrassment &amp; the restraints of secrecy, you can throw away all sense of fidelity &amp; the stability of family. True, you may have some casual, light, &amp; momentary reflections on your spouse or children, but these will pail in comparison to the cheap counterfeit to loving commitment that infidelity offers. You can always feign fidelity, harbor adulterous feelings in your heart, &amp; wonder what might have been...if ever your family life is less than ideal.Don't allow your conscience or the self-righteous convictions of others exaggerate the merely fatal poison you have fed your family &amp; your soul; you can easily build up an immunity to the regret of your self-inflicted destruction by hardening your heart, passing the buck, &amp; rationalizing your choice.</fullReview>

(as a PAL format was not available at the time in the U.K.) and I can play both formats on my VCR.Oh but what a hullabaloo about nothing!What was the indisretion?The Italians, of all people, dragging two innocent people out of a railway car up before the "beak".The couple as far as is shown on film, were not doing anything untoward! The whole film could have been cut in half for the paucity of action and dialogue.How could anyone cast Montgomery Clift as a native Italian?Were there no American/Italian actors sufficiently known in 1952(a latter day Al Pacino perhaps?) who could have been cast by Selznick and at least spoken some authentic Italian to his countrymen to give the film some credo? The highlight for me was seeing "Tony", Richard Beymer from the 1960 film West Side Story, playing a little boy and cast as "Dick Beymer"!The clash of contemporay American and Italian film cultures clashes dreadfully in this film.I did not care for either of the principal characters, the station was the star of this film!</fullReview>
