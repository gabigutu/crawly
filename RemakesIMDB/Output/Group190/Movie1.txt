		<shortDescription>This film was absolutely ridiculous, atrocious, annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of like-minded responses here. This film was asinine.The plot holes weren't just unbelievably silly. They were incredibly annoying. I registered just to come here and whinge about this pathetic film.By the end of the film, you're GLAD those two stupid college kids are being tortured by the hitcher.Why would you make yourself known in a dark basement/jail if you couldn't see the psychotic killer by yelling out nonstop - revealing your location - AND telling them you have a gun? Why would you be so stupid and selfish as to hide out in the toilet - where there are three sane people right outside who look strong enough physically to help you - when the whole point of you running into the diner is to call 911 (not just to order someone who obviously thinks you're crazy to call 911) and get an ambulance for the guy dying outside? Instead, you waste all your time getting PAPER TOWELS - which, yeah, are really going to help?!!! And if your boyfriend was in mortal danger of literally being pulled in half and you have a gun in your hand, why don't you just try and shoot him free or shoot at the wheels/engine of the truck? And to leave the experienced cop stuck to the car after an accident, without a gun, well exposed to the crazy dude when you're pretty crappy at using guns yourself to try and kill the bad guy is just unbelievably annoying. Other situations where the dumbest college kids on earth just endanger other people, especially members of the police by not communicating properly with them, and turn the audience against them.Many other similar plot holes that will drive you crazy. The female lead was written so badly. She was tragically annoying.Sean Bean can do so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even if you don't compare it to the original this isn't a very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is simple, a couple traveling on a dark and stormy night pick up a man who was hitch hiking and soon find they should have passed him by.The story has been often used but the immediate source for this telling is a film that starred Rutger Hauer as the title character. Hauer's John Rider managed to walk the fine line between insanity and reason as he upped the ante in everything he did in some twisted game that only he understood. In this remake Sean Bean is the psycho on the loose and its a wonderfully acted portrayal of a man on the edge of sanity. Unfortunately he's not very scary. Bean is somehow much to urbane to be frightening even as he's doing terrible things to people. He's simply to charming.Whats worse are the people who pick him up. I hated them from the start and wanted some one-anyone-to kill them simply so I didn't have to spend anytime with them. Stupid and vacant they seemed less like people than the victims Bean kills. C Thomas Howell in the original may have been a bit of a twit, but I really felt sorry for him as Hauer turned his life into a living hell, here I felt they had it coming.Different enough from the original to make comparisons pointless this film isn't very good on any level and really has no reason to be seen except for Sean Bean good, but nonthreatening villain</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just hope Rutger Hauer will not watch this!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many horror fanatics, I have nothing against the trend toward remakes of classic genre films?there are cover songs, so why not cover movies? But the 2007 embalming of Robert Harmon's 1986 masterpiece The Hitcher is the kind of mechanical exercise that gives not only remakes but horror in general a bad name. Witless and pointless, it's compelling only as a lesson in the importance of style when it comes to scaring an audience. Though the plot is close enough to the 1986 version to earn a screen credit for that film's scriptwriter, Eric Red, the execution is so botched that what was terrifying in Harmon's film becomes coma-inducing in the remake. Like the 1986 version, the new Hitcher tells the story of a young couple relentlessly pursued by an unstoppable, completely psychotic killer who frames his prey for murders he commits. The key difference is that in the original movie the love interest, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, didn't come into the story until late; a significant chunk of the storyline was devoted to a cat-and-mouse game between two characters, Rutger Hauer's chilling hitcher, and hapless victim C. Thomas Howell. In the new movie, the heroes are an item right from the start: college lovers Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton hit the road, and after some random babbling that's evidently supposed to pass for character development, they find themselves the targets of the psycho hitcher, played by Sean Bean. What follows is essentially a feature-length chase, as the kids have to evade the murderer as well as the authorities after the hitcher, in a hilariously implausible chain of events, makes it look as though they are responsible for his bloody crimes. The Hitcher is directed by Dave Meyers, a veteran of music videos, who is to plot and character what airline workers are to luggage. He excels in individual moments, like an energetic opening-credits sequence and some well-timed bursts of violence, but when it comes to connecting these moments into any kind of involving drama, Meyers and his collaborators don't seem to have the faintest idea what they're doing. Even though the film is practically all action, it has no momentum or intensity?the set pieces don't build, they just pile up on top of each other. There's no terror because there's no emotional connection to the characters; the noir-ish doppelganger relationship between Hauer and Howell in the original has been completely stripped from the narrative, and the lack of psychological subtext makes Bean silly rather than threatening. Though the movie is superficially faster paced than the original, it seems longer because there are no strong characterizations to anchor the action. It doesn't help that Meyers has one lone weapon in his arsenal of scare tactics?in the place of suspense, he provides scene after scene in which the volume goes down really, really low before someone jumps out with a loud "BOOM!": This isn't film-making, it's shock treatment. The director also has no apparent understanding of what made the original film scary. Whereas Harmon mounted Eric Red's audacious screenplay as a sort of hallucinatory nightmare, Meyers shoots the same action as though he's directing a beer commercial. There's no sense of poetry in his images, and the result is that a villain who came across as a supernatural force of evil personified in the 1986 film just seems silly here?the plot is absurd, so to play it on a level of literal reality as Meyers does is a choice that defies common sense. The decision to turn the movie into a sort of teen romance is equally mystifying given how few dividends the love story yields. Bush and Knighton are appealing screen presences, but they have nothing to do here?their relationship has no definition or depth, and when the movie hinges on one of the lovers avenging the other, the violence seems uninspired and gimmicky because it isn't an extension of any internal tension. I realize, especially for its target audience, that complaining about the lack of substance in The Hitcher is a little like complaining about the lack of musical numbers in The Hills Have Eyes. But The Hitcher doesn't offer even the most basic payoffs of its formula. The action sequences are so slick and impersonal that when a key character is torn to pieces it has all the emotional impact of a grapefruit being squashed on screen, and so little actually happens in the movie that when the end credits start to roll it's a little shocking. As I watched the final fadeout, I was still waiting for the movie to begin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Need I say more? The first one was actually decent. Now are we going to remake a movie every 20 years and throw CG at them? How about working on the script, story, and believability? I stopped counting all the ridiculousness of this movie. But here's a few examples. Heading east on a highway to Houston, then in New Mexico, then north to Lake Havasu. Get an atlas! The 442 odometer kept showing 15509 every time it was shown, even after driving many miles. The struggle for the motel bathroom door, are you kidding me? She's holding him out, then when the door closes it's evident there's no lock on the inside, he can come right on in? The LT says he's going to take her to a Trauma Center in Albuquerque then parades the bad guy right in front of her, like that's not piling on the trauma? The Bible spouting family doesn't pull over when they fly off the cliff? She doesn't want to initially go back and pick up the hitcher, but later after they kill someone she wants to go back to them? Where does it end? There is no backstory on why he is the way he is, it's just random scenes with absolutely no rhyme or reason. Like I said, throw CG at the mess and hope people like it. It's an easy substitute for coherent storywriting, plausibility, and sense. Not even worth your time if they paid you to see it. Makes FD3 look like a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Awful Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is 1 good thing in this film Sophie Bush. Having watched the original Hitcher with the legendary Rutger Hauer i always remember thinking how creepy the guy was. He was a natural and also pretty much unknown at the time. This remake however had nothing like the effect of the original. Yes maybe because I know whats going to happen even though there are some subtle differences but Sean Bean. I don't think an actor that well known fits this part. The other annoying thing is that no matter what happens to the kids in the film, Attacked, accused of murder blah blah they still continue to their ultimate destination. Any normal person would ring the police or turn around and go back... DOH !!!! Don't bother in my opinion</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original was highly enjoyable and Rutger Hauer had never been creepier.Jennifer Jason Leigh was memorable too,as she always is,even if she had limited screen time.In the remake they have sped everything up and added lots of more gore.The gore bit pleases all the bloodthirsty kids who usually shoot people's heads off in lame shoot-em-up video-games.More irritating still this one is shot like some long music video with totally out of place music.Sean Bean better watch out.Silent Hill was bad enough and he appeared in the ultra-silly Equilibrium as well.Now this.Fortunately the critics have given terrible reviews and this abysmal remake really deserves it.If you've seen the original don't EVER watch this remake.Learn this.Remakes are in 9 out of 10 cases a lot worse than the originals.Only remakes that are superior that come to mind is "the Fly" and "the Thing".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth picking up...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe, my expectations of this film were set too high. Frankly, I pondered why anyone would want to re-make what many genre fans (and movie buffs in general) already consider to be a cult-classic. Didn't anyone learn a thing about what usually happens to those who try to reinvent a classic (i.e. the poorly attempted re-make of 'Psycho', anyone?).For those of you whom have seen the original 1986 'Hitcher', it is best to leave your experience to that. The characters in this 2007 version barely conjure up a heartbeat, much-less able to hold the viewers attention for more than a few mere minutes at a time! That is not to say that the lack of dramatic affect is due solely to sub-par actors. It's complacency and sterileness is mostly due to a lack of vision and direction, rather than for a lack of competency on any of the actors behalf. Also, severely lacking is the film's score, which was a haunting staple in the original version, but which is barely of notice in this version.Did the 'Hitcher' require a reattempting? The answer is clear: No. The producer's of this film also produced the 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' reduxs and while those films were successful both artistically as well in terms of box office dollars, their attempt here is quite unsuccessful at attempting to recreate the nerve-pounding suspense that only the original appears to be able to offer.Do not slow down. Drive past this one and don't even bother taking a second glance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look I am sorry but this movie was not a patch on the first. OK it was nice to have a little role reversal... but make a different film. The first Hitcher drew its intensity from the aloneness of travelling those massive highways in an attempt to get to your destination without stopping. And to the acting of C Thomas and Rutger although I did think that Sean did a good job I definitely thought that the first had more skin crawling moments. In the first I liked the relationship between the waitress and C Thomas, which couldn't be replayed between the charming and loving couple, which had its own watchable relationship but not the point. The isolation gave it far more drama. So three thumbs down to Hollywood remakes. This was not as bad or as bland as some but still up there on the annoying metre. Sorry guys seek more original roles next time 'cos your acting was good, just chose the wrong way to launch your career. And to Mr Bean great work well done! But don't fall victim to this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing.... amazingly bad. Michael Bay has succeeded in ruining a cult classic. He didn't just "modernize" it like Ms. Bush said in an interview; he ruined it. Lt. Esteridge was supposed to live so that Jim can become a cop, go to visit Esteridge later on and thus we had The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting. But no! Jim, rather than Grace, was split in half by the semi; Esteridge gets shot in the head; and the annoying female lead survives. Bay took the scariest and most dramatic parts of the movie, such as the knife to the eye and when he's in the family's station wagon.... and winged the rest of it! I went in expecting something that resembled the first Hitcher, something that could at least lead up to Jake Busey being the 2nd crazy Hitcher. What I got was an entire disappointment. I wish I never saw this version; I want my money back. I expected more from a man who directed The Rock, Bad Boys 1 and 2, and even Armaggedon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>see the original if you don't mind "older" movies (its not even that old)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this at a preview screening, and I liked it. I think that if you haven't seen the original and have something against older looking movies then you will definitely enjoy this. On the other hand, I prefer the original and felt like society's money would be better spent actually purchasing the original on DVD (its cheap) then seeing this. That would be a great F YOU to Hollywood! Another idea would be for movie theatres to show the original movie for a little less price and see what kind of results they get.The movie itself is plenty intense, a decent amount of "boo scares", quick pace, attractive leads, decent acting (for the most part). Compared to the rest of the movies being released these days, I would say this is definitely above par. The only thing that I can't get over is how much alike the original it was.There are a couple differences (the girlfriend, and a few others) that didn't really add anything to the movie at all, and even with those differences (which you would think could actually change the movie a lot) a lot of scenes are almost shot for shot the same. Acting wise, I think the main male actor faired a little better than c thomas howell... and i like sean bean a lot, but unfortunately he seemed to be doing a rutger haurer impression the whole time (dunno if that was his choice, or the filmmakers) Sophia Bush, as attractive as she is... did not impress me very much acting wise, but she wasn't horrible either.All in all, I give this a 7, and I would personally give the original an 8.5. This one did some things better than the original, i think the original was more intense without feeling as "forced" as this one does (the level of brutality in movies feels pretty forced lately, you may understand what i mean, you may not) I honestly think that Hollywood could make some money if they would retouch some old movies and re-release them, and advertise them correctly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lackluster remake that had everything from the first without the heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1986 version of the Hitcher is still among my favorite road movies and in this case yet another misguided attempt at a remake. Both movies feature John Rider fishing for a ride and torturing the feature characters through and intricate series of frame-ups. The major elements from the '86 original are all still in tact here from (SPOILER---STOP HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE ORIGINAL FILM?SPOILER) picking up the Hitcher, kicking him out the door, killing an innocent family, killing cops, and tearing a featured character in half with a semi-truck. Really the only change is in the Jim Halsey character (Zachary Knighton for 2007 and C. Thomas Howell for the '86 version) with Jim driving out with his girlfriend for spring break rather than driving someone else's car from Chicago to San Diego. This may seem like a minor change but in fact changes the film quite a bit and not for the better.With many remakes it becomes quite clear the filmmakers don't really understand the depth of the original material and would rather just regurgitate plot for the sake of a quick buck. In both films Jim is a highly moral character and it is the stature of his character that originally motivates him to pick up the Hitcher. Grace (Sophia Bush) acts as a little devil on Jim's shoulder; she's not a bad character, just selfish and fearful. One wonders in a world more controlled or motivated by fear if she wasn't the more easily associated to character rather than highly moral character like Jim. This may be why there is the major shift at the end of the film with (ANOTHER SPOILER YOU'VE BEEN WARNED) death of Jim in the Semi truck scene.This dramatic shift also takes away from John Rider's character and motivations. In the original (MORE SPOILERS IN FACT CONSIDER THIS HOLE REVIEW A SPOILER AND SAVE SOME TIME) Jim inadvertently draws Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) into John's machinations and gets romantically involved with her along his arduous journey and meets her demise in the semi truck scene. Every intricate puzzle piece is laid by the Hitcher to darken Jim's character. To make Jim just like him theoretically so that he can leave a bit of himself behind and finally die. The motivations of John Rider may never been known but it was the depth of Rutger Hauer's pathos that drove the Hitcher character making him seem far more complex than it probably appeared on paper. Credit is due Robert Harmon for his direction in the 1986 version. Unfortunately this complexity is lacking in Sean Bean's version of the character who seems to be doing it for kicks more than anything else. Sure he has a death wish but he doesn't seem to be to broken up about it. In fact he seems to want to have his fun before he goes and hopes Grace will see it his way when she finally kills him. He only seems upset when she doesn't. There are no major turns to Grace's character as there were to Jim's in the original and you really just want to slap her most of the time for being such a selfish bitch. Oh well, who needs emotional character building or deconstructing anyway? The film itself just rushes from one remake version of an old scene to the next without really showing us anything new. It is just bigger and shinier. There are some editing glitches at the beginning and the old magically repairing window that plagues so many other movies. We could sure save a lot on window repairs or replacements if we had those movie versions. Scrapes, cracks, smashes and even bullet holes magically disappear, it is only when the entire window is smashed away that its done for. Please put these magic windows on the market if nothing else to save us paying our deductible and having our insurance payments go up. Magic window aside there are a few nice nods to the original with some of the old vehicles showing up in the new version, come on you got to love the old black T-Bird.All in all this is an OK film, but with everything that made the first film work missing, the audience really doesn't have anything to latch on to or care about. I think a complete rethinking of the original concept would have been worth it rather than a close remake and Sean Bean's natural accent probably would have added to the mystique of John Rider. Never ever have an actor cover up his accent; it just gives him more to act through. With the small amount of dialog you wonder why they even bothered to have him cover it up. On the upside the trailer for Simon Pegg's new film Hot Fuzz ran with the film and looks just as funny as Shaun of the Dead. There's your silver lining, but silver really isn't all that expensive so take it for what it's worth.---RG</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad remake,not even close to being as good as the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out to the theater and didn't know what to expect because I loved the original.I saw it again on DVD.I hated how this new one added the annoying girlfriend played by Sophia Bush,and Sean Bean wasn't as convincing as the bad guy.I think he's a good actor,but cannot portray someone as menacing,psychotic &amp; creepy the way Rutger could in the original.However then I realized I was glad it was different because copying the original would be difficult and disrespectful. The characters in this remake had no depth or emotion and came across flat and boring and I didn't like the storyline.In the original, C.Thomas Howell,Rutger Hauer, and Jennifer Jason Leigh were interesting,complex,and brought the perfect mood and depth to it and made the characters believable and realistic.In the remake the Jim Halsey character was very badly written and wasn't even a main character anymore.It was all about Jim's girlfriend,and she showed hardly any reaction at all at the end after her boyfriend was ripped apart.Sophia was obviously hired for her looks not talent.One of the reasons this new one wasn't as good is because it just isn't scary with 3 people in the car like it was in the original with just the 2 guys. There wasn't even any thunder or lightning in all that rain which would have added to the movie especially since there was apparently real flashes of it while they were making the movie from what I heard unless this was false.Even so it would have added to the movie.This is one thing I enjoyed about the original Hitcher because it made it more dramatic with John Ryder out in it. This remake just didn't have any atmosphere period, and it was rushed.The store clerk at the gas station got on my nerves with his unintelligent lame remarks.This dialog did nothing for this movie except show how tasteless the writer was for adding such crap. I resented the remark the producer(or directer) Dave Meyers made about the original film in the documentary.He says he decided to remake the hitcher by using only the parts he liked about it and eliminating the parts he didn't like,which in this case is most of the movie.I guess this is why he changed the whole script.As far as i'm concerned he ruined it.He had no respect for the original story and script and he should never have been aloud to remake a masterpiece.I did like the special effects.They were good and a lot of effort was put into them.And I enjoyed one of the bonus features called: the chronicles of a killer.It was unique and very real looking. I hope one day soon the original hitcher will be re-released on DVD with a better transfer.Unfortunately the picture quality isn't very good which is sad for such a terrific film.I was almost sure it was gonna be re-issued since the remake is out now.I am sure it won't be long since there already is a 2 disc special edition of the original Hitcher available in the U.K.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I am a horror buff and I usually will watch just about any horror movie.However, this remake stuff has really got to stop. This was yet another typical remake trash fest. Top 40 music songs spliced into the sound track, WB quality acting and actors, and of course bad writing. It is disgusting that these hack Hollywood writers can not come up with anything original. All these chumps can do is steal a premise that worked once 20 years ago and still find a way to destroy it. The writer of this filth, Jake Wade Wall, is a no talent hack that must have sold his soul to the devil to get gainfully employed. This bum also destroyed another classic horror movie called When a Stranger Calls.Regardless, I believe that this horror remake craze has peaked judging by the ever diminishing box office returns for these movies. Since both the Dawn of the Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes, each one of these movies has been doing poorer and poorer (can anyone say the Fog or Black Christmas).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Better Remakes Out There, Still Prefer The Original Though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror industry has had quite a big boom in the past five years or so, and most of the horror films you see today are remakes of older films. Some of them are really good, some of them are atrocious - but "The Hitcher" is one of the better remakes I've seen. This movie focuses on Grace (Sophia Bush) and Jim (Zachary Knighton), who are on a road trip during spring break. While driving one stormy night in the desert, they almost hit a man who is having car trouble, but speed off in fear. Later that night, they meet the man who they almost hit at a gas station, and end up offering him a ride to the nearest motel. Little do they know, the man who calls himself John Ryder (Sean Bean), is a maniac, and ends up pulling a knife on the couple. They manage to escape at the time, but the following day they are terrorized by the murderous hitchhiker along the highway, and become framed for a series of killings that he has been committing.Barely twenty years old, the original "Hitcher" was a great horror movie that wasn't really in need of a remake - but most of the horror films that are remade aren't in need of it either, so I suppose that's irrelevant. I'm glad I saw the original film (just days) before I went to see this remake, because it was interesting to compare the similarities and differences between the two. In some instances, this remake pulls things right out of the 1986 film, but also reworks the story and adds and removes certain elements. The reworking of the plot here is done really well - it stays faithful to the original movie while making it something of it's own as well, and I was happy with the way that everything was done in the writing department. There was plenty of action and some great scare moments, so people with short attention spans (which is probably the majority of this film's primary audience) will never get "bored" or find themselves unenlightened. The action and kills were very well executed though and the gore factor is brought up a few notches from the original, but doesn't go overboard. The classic chase sequence from the 1986 film is done here very well and is just as (if not more) exciting than the sequence was in the original. I have to admit, some of the action sequences were a little far-fetched, but the same goes for the original film too, so I can't criticize that. The cast wasn't bad. Granted, some of the acting was a little underdeveloped, but all in all the performances weren't bad. Sophia Bush plays the heroine, Grace, and while she doesn't give a great performance, she's likable enough to hold up her role and keep the audience sympathizing with her. Zachary Knighton plays her boyfriend, Jim (who is a variation of the original movie's hero), and is very good. Sean Bean probably gives the best performance though, playing the menacing John Ryder very well. He has the perfect look for the role, plus he's a good actor. I thought it would be hard to live up to Rutger Hauer's great performance, but I was surprised at how well it was done. Overall, "The Hitcher" is one of the better remakes out there. It could have been better, but not by a whole lot. It doesn't live up to the original film, but I wasn't expecting it to so I was pleasantly surprised with the way this film turned out. If you're a fan of the original, you may or may not want to see this, but I can say that I really liked the original myself and thought that this was an above-average remake. 7/10.</fullReview>

I'll be the first to agree that it is not a travesty to film like The Hitcher II but it still sucks none the less. I just felt it droll on and on as I sat there thinking if only C Thomas could come out and kill every one on the screen and every one in the audience who had never heard of the original and thought what they were watching was new and innovative, we would have a good movie on our hands. But old C. Thomas regretfully did not show up for the party. I was left alone. Rent or buy the classic and let this Hitcher keep on Hitching.</fullReview>

Lackluster and unnecessary remake of the cult '80s Rutger Hauer slasher vehicle this time with a bland one-note Bean in the titular psychotic role whose cross-country odyssey of terror targets young lovers Bush (arguably the stupidest genre heroine in some time setting the bar considerably lower than her previous thespians) and Knighton, as the bad penny from Hell with a high body count and a low threshold for audience suffering in misery. The only thing worth mentioning are the bloody inventive ways Bean's sociopath manages to slip himself out of with unlikelihood at an all time high (or would that be low?)

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher Remake - failed in my eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite disappointed in the remake of this movie. When I hear remake, I normally expect it to follow most of the storyline, even if the characters are played by different actors. They left out the scene with Jim Halsey eating at a restaurant and finding a finger in his french fries, or the time he was in this barn and keys were thrown at him by Hauer (scared the daylights out of me), or when Hauer was driving down a side road shooting at the helicopters and cops, but didn't bother Halsey or his then girlfriend. The connection between Jim Halsey and John Ryder was so strong in the original version it was eery, and I loved the ending much better than the 2007 version - much more action-packed, and that darned Hauer just won't stay dead!!! Glad I saw this, just to see if a good remake could be done. The original is the BEST and HAUER is the best Hitcher around - just don't pick him up!!!And I'm not saying I don't like remakes - a lot of times they are very well done. I just won't give this the rating I was hoping I could...I would give it a 6. Now, let's get Hauer back out there in another creepy movie!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don't bother. see the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the first and maybe the most noticeable thing with this movie is that the main character is no longer the boy but is now his girlfriend. secondly the only thing that they left in that has to do with the original is the scene with the truck pulling the girl apart. but surprise, they did not even get that right. they had the boy, the main character in the original get torn apart. that wasn't even the most notable part of the original. the best part was of course when Jim is eating with john and finds a finger in his french fries. in addition they of course wildly altered the plot. the original had a man driving a car cross country for someone else as a job, when he picks up the hitcher. the new one has Jim and his girlfriend driving to a lake for spring break. all of the obvious aside, they cut out the crucial point of the movie: the guy getting Stockholms Syndrome and being unable to kill the killer. in the new one they pretty much said "oh look he didn't kill the scorpion! he doesn't have a killer instinct even if he is in danger." there was sub par acting in the main characters because they, like the "The Fog" remake, decided to reel in potential teen ticket sales by using people from teen dramas on the "CW" such as one tree hill or Smallville. this move to make the movie more visually appealing by using hot teen actors killed the already terrible dialogue, although i am sure that some people thought that the movie was great due to their use. these people don't know what a good horror movie is, because anything a little more scary than supernatural is sheer horror genius. i also doubt they understand sarcasm. the only reason that i don't give this movie a 1 out of 10 is that Sean Bean was not a terrible actor. neither was Neal Mcdonough. all in all remakes have an inherent flaw. they cant seem too much like the original, but they cant stray too much from the plot. this swell of remakes is destroying the movie business. the fog was not even good the first time around. why remake it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmmmm, don't even bother with this one. I am not completely against remakes, but why remake a movie that's only 20 years old? Better yet, why remake a movie that many film buffs have seen and expect it to be a hit at the box office?Well, the same questions could be asked about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003, but the difference between that was that Chainsaw was a good movie that brought fresh ideas to a dying franchise. The Hitcher 2007 is almost exactly like the original, but everything that made the original interesting is lost in this one. No brutality, no sense of isolation, no creepiness to John Ryders character. The dialogue is also extremely lame, and even laughable at times, and the whole movie feels extremely rushed. The only few things that bring this movie up is a well choreographed struggled between Bush and Bean in a motel room and of course, Sophia Bush's performance, which is extremely impressive. This girl can act! Props to her doing the best she could with a zero script. As the credits rolled after the lame finale, I was glad this underperformed at the box office. A franchise being created out of this trash is the last thing I can see down the road.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I last saw this movie and thought it was a bit cheesy, the last time i saw the original "the hitcher" i was about 8 years old. so i took my original copy, dusted it off and watched it to compare the two. i can't believe that Rutger Hauer was replaced by somebody like Sean Bean anyway and the whole story line of the remake really was boring. maybe if they replaced Rutger by somebody like Micheal Madsen maybe then it would have been a believable actor in it's character. all and all i think this movie should be considered "never made" like "the matrix reloaded" and "revolutions" so if i could recommend anything to anybody... just buy the original it's superior to the remake. this movie was bound to fail and mess up a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yup. I agree with most of the reviewers here, those that admire the original version of now definitive cult classic.Actually last night it was my second effort to watch this remake, and I failed. First time it was two years ago. I stopped after 15 minutes. Last night I could not hold on more than 45 minutes. It was that awful.I don't know, to some, this is great remake, or great movie, even very good movie but original is better. My opinion goes with those who share the same: absolutely terrible.The reason for me to watch it, was my curiosity to see maybe something new, like sequel or something, and I was hopping to DIFFERENT plot, not repeating one, and deviating it in some stupid version.The cinematography, camera and music as well as acting in original were superb, really, but here, what we have is not only attempt to repeat the plot and its rhythm, yet destroying the true sense that was delivered by original.Some of the scenes that remains classic, like police chasing and slow motion of rumbling law enforcement cars. That was amazing in original but here, I almost needed to puke.I also realize that director tried to copy the same cinematography style as it was in original, which ends in, of course total failure.And something about characters. Sean Bean is one my favorite actors, but here he was terrible. If there are no original movie, his acting might pass, but mimicking Rutgher Hauer was terrible. I can't forget the scene in the car with those family and kids (beggining), when he shows his face behind that big toy. It was obvious that this was absolute lack of the face expression of original character. Sean Bean completely lacks in Ryder character. (Hopefully it is only this or maybe two more movie where Bean lacks his in fact great acting gift)Those two victims, terrible. C. T. Howell and J. J. Lee can't be replaced, period. OK those two are probably not the bad actors but in this, terrible, terrible. All of the other casts is also too far from casts in original (policemen, Captain...).So, if you want the real stuff, go watch the original and you will see why most reviewers here have the same bad opinion about this remake.As somethimes after some bad remakes (AVP garbage), rises good sequel or prequel or new plot based on concept (like it was for me Predators for example), who knows, maybe someone will make intelligent sequel or prequel, I don't know, whatever, but this one is total failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my eyes the original is a classic. The tense action begins from the very moment it starts, and there aren't any annoying characters. It's a wonderful example of a horror film. So then, can anyone tell me what is the point of remaking a classic if you're just going to copy everything from it but no where near as effective and your going to add bits in which just add to the boredom?! CAN YOU TELL ME THAT! Sorry, I need to calm down :) Rob Zombie's "Halloween" and the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" are two examples of how to do a good remake. They take the idea of the original but completely change what happens in the film to make it there own. "The Hitcher" is inadequate. The director turns a classic into a dopey teen movie. It's unengaging, unsurprising and laughable. Sean Bean is miscast as the hitcher. I'm sorry Sean Bean fans (Caroline :) but he just isn't menacing enough. I mean Mr. Bean can't act anyway ( well THE Mr Bean can, Rowan Atkinson does a fine job as that character) so that casting is all wrong! I must say that I did enjoy the final 10 minutes, I thought that was quite tense, but its still a damn copy. Its a replica and isn't as good. It's not exactly shot for shot but you know what's going to happen. Please, if you have any sense go and watch the original. Skip this one, its full of stupid characters, clichéd moments and Michael Bay produced it.Dear Michael Bay, please be original. Is that too much to ask?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Hitcher" ? A Ride into Familiar Territory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another horror remake? No real surprise there. However what did catch me off guard was this one was actually halfway decent. While it didn't offer anything new, as it basically was a hash between the original and the straight to video sequel, the movie as a whole was good especially when compared to the garbage remakes we've been bombarded with these past few years. But considering the original wasn't all that great of a film technically speaking, then it'd be impossible to really consider this in that caliber either. It is safe to say though that "The Hitcher" accomplished what it set out for.The plot is utterly unbelievable but if you can let that go it's enjoyable. The acting is appropriate and Sean Bean was great. While I did wind up preferring Rutger Hauer, it was mainly due to the dark sense of humor he added to his character. Another difference between the two was Sean came across as detached and suicidal, while Rutger was the more cunning and evil nemesis?almost like an alter ego of the protagonist. Nevertheless, Sean was thoroughly able to creep the hell out of me with great success and achieved it with more subtlety. Sophia Bush was really good and to call her a sight for sore eyes in this would be an understatement. Neal McDonough as always played his typical supporting role with ease, despite being slighted with very little screen time. This was the first time I've watched Zachary Knighton on the big screen and he came through perfectly as an everyday real-looking college guy. For what this flick was, there surprisingly wasn't any really bad acting as usual. In fact even the 1986 version had many moments of straight cheese. So praise is in order for the cast without a doubt. That is if the characters themselves were written in better, as enough depth wasn't provided for them that made the audience actually want to care about anyone in particular.One odd thing I noticed that while there were many scenes which were exactly the same as its predecessors, about three of the more important ones from the first installment weren't incorporated, and did add a strike against it. As for the gore factor, it was certainly bumped up a notch?even to a horror level at some points and did show an incredible amount of violence. Another factor that made the original work slightly better was its cooler back-story. The role reversal in this one actually worked against it in the end, as it didn't make as much sense and took away from the overall storyline.As far as thrills go it was sufficient in this regard and had a lot of parts that made the viewer jump ? however nothing too shocking. My personal favorite scene was the car chase since it utilized the perfect blend of cinematography, music, and action. Other factors that this movie had going for it was there wasn't much downtime. Even the slower parts didn't get boring. This was mainly due to the overall short length of the film in general but can also be attributed to excellent pacing. The blend of genres alternating between thriller, horror, and action was also carried out very effectively. That and the ending does provide the desired level of gratification. But that's about where the praise stops.If you want to be swept away or completely engulfed into extravagant cinema then this isn't what you're looking for. If you're looking for an okay experience as far as remakes go then you probably won't go wrong with this. True fans of the original will doubtfully be enthralled by this rendition though and I'd advise them to steer clear as nothing worthwhile is added in any sense. Ultimately Sophia Bush learns to never slow down again for any hitchhikers, but this is one time that in the end, it was worthwhile for me to stop for?just this once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is god awful. The original was a fun piece of b-movie celluloid. Michael Bay's track record of remaking films started promising with 'Texas' and with this, I must say that I'm losing faith in his vision.Directing aside, well, Dave's a music video director and he did the best he could with the material. The blame of this film goes to the writer. He's horrible and couldn't write his way out of a paper bag. (i.e. see 'When a Stranger Calls'). Sorry to say this, but the industry is going to wear the genre thin by hiring shitty writers for potentially bankable films.The dialogue was beyond bad. One could imagine how the script read; Insert Cliché here. Cliché Cliché Cliché. I implore this writer to sit in a coffee shop and listen to how people speak. Maybe he should enroll in a writing course at LACC.But then again, this is Hollywood. I'm sure he's going to ruin another horror film in the not so distant future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, emotional, and enthralling until it all comes crashing down in a typical crummy ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a person who typically dislikes all horror/slasher films because of bad writing and over use of shock value. I have to say this movie was starting out well. It was intense from the moment you first see the hitcher and kept you on the edge of your seat just trying to figure out where he would pop up next. The atmosphere was perfect and the musical score greatly helped. But then the film slowly began to creep into action movie territory and we're expected to suspend all belief. It can be accepted when a single man is able to slaughter an entire sheriff's station and get out before back up arrives. But it gets a little unbelievable when said man is able to shoot a helicopter pilot out of the sky and wreck three police cruisers(carrying men who had assault weapons) without a slight bit of trouble. But this was still acceptable(aside from causing some unbelieving vocalization). It quickly went back into horror atmosphere. It gracefully recaptures the dark and foreboding atmosphere I was missing then promptly ruins it with a typical slasher ending where the cops are inept(One of them looked Jim right in the face when he was tied up between two semis and made no attempt to alert the others or assess the situation), one of the important characters is killed off in an over the top fashion to "shock" you, and the only cop that wants to help them is killed for helping them. Extremely let down, don't waste your time. They try to make you care about these characters but slap you in the face if you do. Not even Sean Bean's skill could save this heap of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unnecessary and boring remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Hitcher" remake was a big disappointment IMAO. The whole set up was twisted into a beginning full of clichés, with Jim picking up his girlfriend Grace to go to Lake Havasu in his Oldsmobile 442. The main difference between the movies of course is the addition of a girlfriend for the trip. In that role, Sophia Bush actually does a pretty decent job. She's probably the best thing about this remake. Not surprisingly she won a Teen Choice Award for her performance, and deservedly so.The rest of the cast is just so-so. Zachary Knighton as Jim Halsey doesn't even come close to Howell's performance in the original, and it doesn't have enough intensity. Even Sean Bean, who I liked in other movies like "Troy", is a caricature here and trying to act like Rutger Hauer. He's not a scary killer. There are a few okay surprise moments, but the story in this one always feels dumb and unbelievable. The original was unbelievable too in a lot of ways but it just worked better because it was better made and acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another remake strike-out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked forward to the Hitcher remake since the original didn't quite get it right. It had moments and great ideas that I liked, sure. But overall, transparent gimmicks won out over exploring a wonderful premise. Maybe the remake would fix things? Iron out the details? Do things right? Yeah, these hopes came crashing down when I realized it would only compound the problem with even more gimmicks starting with an additional character, Grace.Now, Grace by herself? No problem. Grace with Jim against the titular Hitcher? Problem. Big problem. Two main characters means dialogue, which for the typical formula screenwriter means opening up Pandora's box. The thriller's plot slows to a crawl so they can chatter, and really, who the hell wants to listen to two characters hysterically informing each other of things we, the audience, can see ourselves? For example, the couple comes across a car on the side of the road. They know the Hitcher has struck. Jim approaches the car, telling Grace over and over (and over) again to, "Stay there! You don't want to see this!" To which she questions, "What is it? What's there?" "Stay there Grace! You don't want to see this! Oh it's horrible!" For all the time spent discovering the car, the bodies inside, and listening to these two, there's surprisingly little there except for the traditional jump scare.And if you're going to include another character to run around with Jim, write the scenes to play out for two characters instead of mindlessly regurgitating the original (written quite specifically for one character.) The whole "Say: I want to die" sequence, one of the few things I liked about the original loses all of its potency because the knife is on the wrong damn character. Granted it could theoretically play out that way, but as it stands in the film it wants to mimic the original with half-assed sloppy changes so it can make the shallow claim, "Look! I did something on my own." If you're going to change something, have the balls to follow through.One beef I have with remakes in general (like, The Fog for example) is the tendency for filmmakers to show more under the false pretense that this brings something worthwhile and original to the remake table. A key to any art form (whether it generates art or not) is the idea of restraint ? knowing when to show something, knowing when to keep it in shadows, and knowing when to not even bother. The 2007 Hitcher wants to show you everything that happened off screen in the 1986 (the dead family, the equivalent to Nash's death, and how John Ryder escapes from custody) and it forgot to ask, "why did the original choose not to show these things?" and, more importantly, "would it be a better movie if it did?" Another gripe (also in the Fog remake) ? the "bigger, badder" phenomena where the remake feels obligated to one-up the original. More explosions! Bigger explosions! More blood! More guns! More cars! Faster! Badder! Yay! Funny thing about the ridiculous, like for example Rutger Hauer taking down a helicopter with a revolver ? outdoing it looks just plain stupid. I mean, someone got paid for this script? Why bother when any idiot could take a bottle of white out and some sticky notes to the original and get the same thing? And at the risk of turning this review into a list of complaints, lastly Grace, herself. Certainly the Hitcher had done enough killing, stalking, and taunting throughout the film to take a normal person to the brink of violence, certainly she had motivation for extracting revenge, strangely enough I did not buy that she'd actually arrived at that point to heartlessly pull the trigger despite everything else in play.Like many remakes, the Hitcher feels like an imitation. The 2007 version may have its hands on the wheel, but the 1986 original is the one really driving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>College couple picks up a mysterious stranger while traveling and soon find themselves in a terrifying situation.The Hitcher 2007 is a needless remake of the 1986 road horror film that adds nothing nor improves upon anything from the original film. This is one of those remakes that just turns the story of a unique original into a generic, uninspired horror flick. This remake simply ignores the eerie psychological elements of the original, not to mention the road action isn't nearly as exciting or impressive as that of the original. It just pales in comparison on every level. The fact that the hero of the film is changed to a girl is hardly a surprise either. It's just more clichés for a mainstream audience there.The cast is OK, Zachary Knighton being the only real standout among them. Sean Bean tries for a menacing villain, but isn't nearly as threatening as he could have been. He's a far cry from the convincing madman that Rutgar Hauer with in the original film.Folks, The Hitcher 2007 is nothing new. Anyone that's seen the original film will find no surprises here, well not any pleasant ones. Though there's some gruesome violence, a fast pace, and a so-so cast it still fails to rise to the greatness of its superior source material. Do yourself a favor and rent the 1986 film instead. You'll get a far better pay off.* 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie had me on the edge...of a bean bag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: There are 249 other reviews so I don't know if this is original, but these are my thoughts. The trailer for this particular film gave me a feeling of suspense, and fostered a feeling that this would be a good horror movie. But I feel that it really doesn't live up to it's expectations. First: The film starts like a great deal of teen-slasher films, with a guy and a girl, usually in college. It also contains the usual bad soundtrack of tacked in rock songs that have no real relevance to what's happening on-screen. A short trip, and a reference to a bladder control problem later and they are off. The couple shares the usual 'I love you' looks that have nothing to do with anything. Suddenly it's night-time and they almost hit Sean Bean. They leave him, of course, because he looks weird. He finds them at a gas station, and pseudo-suspense ensues. He gets in their car and tries to kill them, but they thwart him and throw them out of the car. Hilarity ensues as one implausible plot twist after another threatens to tear this film apart. There are a lot of problems in this film, but I won't go off on all of them as I don't have enough room to do it. Suffice to say that this film doesn't live up to it's promises of suspense or movie. On to actors. Sean Bean gives us his usual self: creepy guy who will kill you if you cross him, or almost run him over. His talent at accents in this role is definitely lacking. I think, that for this role, Edward James Olmos would have been a better choice. Zachary Knighton gives a passable performance. However, his character can't seem to decide who he is. Is he a jock, or an awkward guy? Who knows. Sophia Bush gives her best at a role that doesn't really seem to suit her. Grace (her character) seems to have a purpose more attuned to being knife fodder, or something for Zach's character to worry about. She then makes several transformations as such. Carefree college student: Shocked college student: Naked college student: Heartless murdering bad-ass college student. That's pretty much what her character is. Have fun watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had absolutely no logic! To think that one man could take down a whole sheriff department and half the state patrol with a hand gun is ridiculous, and the two main characters were just down right stupid. I know it's a movie, but come on it was so obvious. there were about three separate occasions during this abomination were it should have just put me out of my misery and ended. But some how it just kept going, because the hitcher must be some kind of super villain, or maybe the cops were just idiots. I think they got the police involved too early into the film. The way I see it when there are like fifty cops on a situation, especially if there is just one bad guy, that situation is going to be resolved fairly quickly. (I actually was laughing through most of the ending.) That's why I liked horrors like "Rest Stop" and "Vacancy". They don't get the cops involved till the end, and if they do get them involved it's only like one cop, not a whole department. It's 90 min I won't get back. the only thing that kept me watching was Sophia Bush, she looked real good.</fullReview>

The giraffe wrote the script and left into it these vast plot canyons, so that it is impossible to believe most of the things that are happening in this movie. We should all remember that you cannot make a horror movie if it doesn't have any intensity, and real reactions and plausible situations create the intensity in a horror movie. So if there is an axemurderer and all of a sudden you see dwarfs dancing ballet with elves..well..are you scared ? I give you two options that describe this movie very well. If you are chased by Michael Myers and you can a) go hide in a closet or b) join the posse of 20 cops in broad daylight, which one of these options do you think this movie picks for it's actors ? This is utter garbage, a symphony for wasting money in s*it.And I'll give it one star because with that kind of money and that kind of original story it is a blasphemy to direct stuff like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One question; Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has obviously had a mixed reaction as the 5.5 rating suggests. It stars Sean Bean (why?) Sophia Bush (What?) and Zachary knighton (Who?).Now the problem with this cast is obvious. Sean Bean is not Rutger Haur and if he thought he was, then he is mistaken. Sean Bean has always been a boring actor and will continue to be boring until he gets an expression. Sophia Bush is a pretty face and a shining light in mediocre acting. She must have cringed when she saw who her boyfriend was. Zachary Knighton has the charisma of a cardboard box. He plays Jim Halsey and lets face it... This guy isn't fit to cut C.Thomas Howell's bags into a change room.What is bad about this movie is that it lacks any originality from the original. The movie tries to improve on the original and fails in every aspect. They have the luxury of advanced technology and don't use it. The car chase scene is bad ass, but it's mainly because off the music. I just didn't understand why they even remade this film. The addition of Neal Mcdonough (seriously?) is pointless. He does nothing and his character is bland while in the original, he was doing something.I have give this movie a four because it is entertaining for what it is - A crap movie. It isn't boring and for that you can at least watch it and not wanna go to sleep, but it isn't a class, it isn't the dirt on the original's boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher ('07) 7-9-08I will keep this brief as I did not even finish viewing this film. Can you write a review of a film you didn't finish....well you probably shouldn't. My point is this, after having viewed twenty long minutes of this tripe I concluded that it could and would not get any "better". One thing above all else a film should compel one to view it to completion. Suffice to say this film did not. The problem with bad movies these days is that they're just bad...thats it. Gone is the camp and fun of a good Corman b-movie. What we have instead are big budget hollycrap directed by some top of his film school class of '99 music video director and the cast of this years hot teen drama trying to make there big screen debut. Though if watching bad things happen to beautiful people who just want to have a fun spring break is your idea of hi-jinx then go right ahead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Speaking as a fan of both the original "Hitcher" and Sean Bean's previous work, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the standard horror remake. The two victims, played by Bush and Knighton, never even came close to matching C. Thomas Howell's performance in the original. Granted, the actors did not have nearly as much to work with this time, but they could have mastered, at the very least, a passable performance. Furthermore, much, if not all, of the symbolism and purpose of the original was lost in this new rendering of the movie. This thus reduced it to the level of the standard modern horror movie. I guess this is what happens when you put a music video director in charge of a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than die-hard fans of the actors or the genre. Go see the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too violent remake full of action and grisly killings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This high-budget(produced by great producer-director Michael Bay) new version about the classic horror film deals about a young couple(a gorgeous Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton) driving on a rural highway along barren landscapes. They pick up a hitchhiker(with decent acting by Sean Bean in the role of Rutger Hauer)with diabolic plans, and he results out to be a psycho.The sadistic serial killer terrorizes them while killing several people and framing them for his murders. The hitcher sets up machinations and the cops(Neal McDonough)won't believe them.In this big budgeted version is showed on screen overwhelming car crashes, breathtaking pursuits, kinetic action scenes, unflinching terror and extreme violence .The film is told with nimble edition and fast pace .There are some noisy scenes with gunfire and blowing up and also the pleasantly visual look is quite nice. Moving and thrilling musical score by Steve Jablonsky. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by cameraman James Hawkinson. The tale is professionally directed by Dave Meyers, though with no originality. Not without interest, however is obvious needless thriller is justly a spectacular remake inferior to predecessor.The film transpires frenetic action, and sadism that will leave you emotionally and psychically affected.The previous films were the original, the superior ¨Hitcher¨(1986)directed by Roger Harmon with C. Thomas Howell,Jeffrey DeMoon and Rutger Hauer, ¨The hitcher II: I've been waiting¨(2003)with Thomas Howell, Jake Busey and Kari Wuher( in similar role to Sophie Bush).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So it's no masterpiece. I wasn't expecting one. As a good ol' blood-and-guts horror/thriller, it delivers. I will say is that it's not for the faint of heart, though. This is definitely a gruesome flick, even for today's standards. I was pretty close to the edge of my seat throughout 80 % of the film--so I'd say the film did its job. And watching Sophia Bush (from "John Tucker Must Die") run around in short skirts and tops made the film even more fun to watch. I do have a few mild criticisms. There are some clichéd scenes, like the main characters getting arrested and being taken to one of those precincts that only exist in movies. Only about three people are on staff, making it convenient for the killer to stroll inside, murder the officers in cold blood, and track his prey. Sean Bean plays the villain/title character. Sean's a significantly talented character actor, who most people probably recognize by face, rather than by name. This could've been a much more juicy role for him, but he's not given much to do. His performance consists of sneering and delivering sadistic one-liners in a monotone. I blame this more on his character being underwritten, rather than the actor himself. He has proved in movies like "Goldeneye" that he's capable of playing villains with much more depth. On the other hand, character actor Neal McDonough is given a pretty juicy role as the somewhat sympathetic sheriff. "The Hitcher" is not a film that will go down in history, but if you want to kill an hour and 30 minutes with a kick-a** popcorn flick, it's definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another unneeded remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was curious at first to see how Sean Bean would compare to Rutger Hauer's original John Ryder, and how the movies themselves would compare with a twenty-year storytelling update. Bean is an accomplished actor, yes, but didn't really get 'up' for this role - he sleepwalked his way through everybody, killing them because they were in his way. I have no idea why the genders of the survivors was reversed. It's not like they created any kind of sexual tension between Bean and the girl; and the pure menace of the original big scene between the tractor and the trailer climaxed with the idea that the damsel *couldn't* be rescued (even with the cops already on-scene)! The increase in special-effects budget also stole, IMHO, from the mind's ability to simply *imagine* what has happened.Judgement? See the original and be horrified. Avoid this one if you can - it's not even worth the popcorn popped at home!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realise that to propagate the plot of a mindless so-called "horror" film you have to accept that unrealistic situations might arise, but this transcends plausibility to an extent I could barely grasp. It's just indescribable. The plot would have collapsed within the first few minutes, but happily the actors manage to drag it out by making the most absurd and inexplicable decisions since that time my brother moon-walked off the back of the sofa and head-butted the fireplace. As the psychotic John Ryder holds the heroes captive in the basement of a police station, the cops arrive to save the day. Yay! Saved! Unless, of course, you choose to run from the police. Which makes sense... under no circumstances. Being consistent, however, is the central characters' only redeeming quality. In fact, having fled the police once for no apparent reason, they then take a cop hostage. Even the bit in Bride of Re-Animator where a man's head gets transplanted onto a bat makes more sense than that. I've skipped over quite a lot of the outrageous plot idiocies, though I would like to mention our rescued heroine somehow ending up in a convoy with the deranged madman. But it's OK, never fear for her safety because, happily, the guard in the back of the prison van has a gun. I'd say there is absolutely no chance the bad guy will get his hands on that. Overall, a pretty terrible film. Not even so bad it's good. Just awful. Nice scenery though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen the first movie, so I have nothing to compare it to. But, this movie LAME, The flaws and lame twists in this movie are so absurd that you don't just have to suspend disbelief to appreciate this movie, you have to repeatedly stab your brain with a sharp pointed object not to see this 'film as pure garbage. To begin with, it would be nice to have a couple you could have some sympathy for. These two characters are the types you hope get whacked quickly so the real victims can appear -- no such luck, they are the real victims. The acting just flat out sucks --- except for the Sheriff and the killer. It's one thing for 'dead body number 5' who is on the screen for six seconds to be an awful actor, it's another thing to sit and watch two of the main characters vie for a razzie award. The movie lost me fairly early when the killer turned up in the fundie family car that just happen to be passing the car driven by the main characters who had kicked the killer out of their car the night before -- LAME! I was curious as to how the killer kept finding all of these vehicles to drive around in. The movie starts with his car that breaks down, then he has the 4x4, then the sports car...come on! They're in a desert for Christ's sake, not next to the car rental counter at LAX. Next...The killers overtaking of ALL the police cars and shooting the police helicopter was laughable. Then his escape out of the police van, by killing the guard and then shooting the drivers, the van flipping over and over God knows how many times and the killer is totally unhurt just leaps into 'idiocy.' This super villain serial killer motif takes a director of immense talent, an exceedingly competent script and solid acting to pull off. Sadly this movie has none of that.</fullReview>

When they managed to escape from the hitchhiker the first time (after he nearly murdered them)? why oh why did they not think to go to a telephone box and report the whole incident to the police?? Instead they stop on the roadside and have a nice long snooze. All the more strange since they had told the baddie their destination? Thus giving him a chance to track them down 12 hours later!! And he obliged! In 12 hours I would have been on the other side of the world being molly cuddled by my mum for having been through such an ordeal.It got more and more stupid. The café scene where the girlfriend was supposed to call the ambulance. Why did she tell the waitress to do it?? The waitress didn't know what was going on. Another stupid stupid scene.

		<fullReview>I just don't care anymore. I don't even know why I'm writing this review.After you've seen every slasher ever made, seen them remade, seen modern slashers, seen slashers that claimed they weren't slashers, seen countless modern "bring back the old days of horror!" slashers . . . who really cares anymore? It's one thing to complain about the lack of originality in cinema, but it's a completely different thing to complain about the ridicules overabundance of movies that are EXACTLY the same in every way. And what's worse is that every one of these movies seem to think they're some sort of original idea. Listen to audio commentaries: directors have a mentality that because THEY made the movie, it's magically superior to the others exactly like it. They also know that if they can churn out another 80s homage or remake, they'll be rich, because it's an unwritten falsehood that every single horror fan must love, watch, and appreciate every piece-of-crap slasher ever made, or they're not "A True Horror Fan". But if a director is "A True Horror Fan", wouldn't he want to further the genre with original ideas instead of basking in the nostalgia of crappy slashers gone past? My point is, there is no need for The Hitcher. Or the thousands of other movies just like it. If you want a truly good slasher, check out the original Black Christmas.The Hitcher is directed like a Hollister commercial. Primary colors are everywhere, with hollow, flat, fresh-faced prep kids running around for most of the runtime. There is a generic killer with generic motives. The acting isn't good and it isn't bad?how hard is it to ask collage kids to play politically correct collage kids? The cinematography is fun and colorful and gives everything a plastic sheen, as with all Michael Bay-produced slasher remakes. The pacing is average. I don't think I would call this boring as much as I would call it just downright uninteresting. You know in the end the kids and the killer will either live or die, and we've seen both endings done so many times, who really cares to see it again? And in between the opening and the ending, the cookie-cutter plot is even less interesting. Not to mention filled with laughable plot holes. (Paper towels, anyone?) Calling this scary, gory, or anything else a horror movie is supposed to be is a laugh-out-loud joke.There is nothing good I can say about The Hitcher, and there is nothing else I can say that people haven't complained about before. The fact I'm even writing this page-long review is giving The Hitcher too much credit. You'll have forgotten you even watched it within a week, maybe less.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many things wrong with this movie!!Here's a few examples(too many to list them all):The characters in this movie are beyond stupid. They get nearly killed by a psycho and yet they decide to continue to go to their destination (whatever lake they wanted to go to party) EVEN after they told the killer exactly what location they were headed to. They decide to leave a scene where pretty much the whole police station gets slaughtered and run away from the police, thus becoming outlaws rather than going back and proving your innocence.The whole police task force is chasing behind you. You a) realize it's now fruitless to keep running away at all, and since it is a big police force you'd realize you'd have more chance of them protecting you than going at it yourself. or b) think you can outrun the cops (who even have a copter on your tail) and be safer on your own. Guess what? they chose B.Girl falls asleep when the boy says he'll be back in 15 minutes to make a call. LOL. You'd think with everything going on/happening to them, she'd be more worried than wanting to fall asleep. She must of thought he was chatting with his friends via 3-way on the phone and didn't want to bother him for taking so long and so decided she would take a nap.Oh yeah and right when the car with the killer being escorted crashes, there just happened to be another car coming in the opposite direction just so that the lieutenant can get his leg stuck. Perfectly coincidental? No. Just a really bad unrealistic script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie focused less on John Ryder and more on the little relationship spat between lead male hero character and lead female heroine character. The main problems of this movie is the lack of proper dialogue and horrible acting and that since this is a remake, it relied too heavily on the original, and added unnecessary people to the story ( Sophia Bush ). The only thing I would recommend for anyone that watches this film is that the only real actor in it is SEAN BEAN, and his character is under shadowed by the increasingly unintelligent heroes of this story. It doesn't matter, if you are sympathetic to the tragedy in this film. A lot of the action sequences aren't filmed properly and the horrible use of a good nine inch nails song is a grave injustice to all movie fans. I cannot stress enough that if you want to see a good movie, rent the original. Not only is the acting better, but the character of John Ryder has more of a menacing and evil demeanor than the way Sean Bean tried to play. Thanks for your time. THis is just my opinion, obviously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this must prove that what Michael Bay knows about good film-making could safely fit up a gnat's backside. 'Pearl Harbour' and 'Armageddon' were stinkers but this goes much further. Not only is it unimaginative, poorly acted, predictable and generally repugnant, it's also made by people who had not even the slightest idea of how to mount a suspenseful thriller. It's, in fact, mounted with mind-boggling incompetence.I loved the original 'Hitcher'. It might not have been a classic, but it was a tidy, original and well paced thriller that delivered a number of really shocking moments. Not only that, it boasted Rutger Hauer's career best performance. He out-did every on-screen baddie that had gone before with his portrayal of John Ryder. He was the perfect embodiment of menace and one of the most truly terrifying madmen ever to hit the screen.For all his talents as an actor, Sean Bean did not deliver. Look at 'Essex Boys' or 'Fools Gold' to see that he can do over-the-top evil very well, but subtle, manipulative and coldly calculating is not really his forte. Mind you, compared to everyone else involved in this rubbish, he was positively outstanding.The main character's boyfriend was an irritating, whiny and woodenly played dimwit and the girl simply a 2 dimensional plot device and not someone you could truly root for.Where this film raises its repellent stink however is in the totally over-the-top nastiness. The first scene, where a rabbit is splattered by a passing car is simply unnecessary and sets the tone for the rest of the film. It has nothing new or interesting to add to the original film so it simply piles on buckets of blood and goes all out to disgust the audience.What shows up the total clueless incompetence of those involved though is the way the film is constructed. They missed the atmosphere of the original and simply hung together a number of scenes, some directly lifted from the 1986 version and just 'splattered up' without thinking about logic or plotting. Shocks are telegraphed with appalling predictability and everything can be seen coming a mile away. It's almost as if the director and writer went ahead with only the loosest knowledge of how to make a movie because the result is proof that they didn't have the foggiest idea of what they were doing.That Michael Bay was the producer of this witless farrago comes as no surprise. He's never shown much subtlety in his 'productions' and very little idea or story or character but even he must be truly embarrassed by this. Hollywood re-makes generally stink (with the exception of Guy Ritchie's remake of 'Mean Machine') but this one plumbs new depths and must be one of the worst. The only consolation I can take from the 90 minutes I wasted with this tripe is that I saw it as an in-flight movie and was therefore free. Had I paid money to watch this, I'd be really angry now. I've seen plenty of crap films in my time but rarely have I taken against one as badly as I have with this.A perfect example of talentless, soulless, clueless imitation from people with nothing to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole movie just does not make any sense.Nothing is explained about the Killer. Not his purposed, not his background, nothing. He's somehow omniscient and close to omnipotent. Yet, he looks like any random guy. It's hard to swallow without an explanation. That kind of stuff was OK in the 80s, but not anymore in my book.The worst part is the reaction of the other characters. The cops are beyond stupid and useless. The 2 main characters are clueless idiots, running from the police instead of seeking protection. They even keep on running after the Killer found several of their hiding places.The movie doesn't last long, but the end still feel stretched out. The cops obviously have to underestimate a guy who had already killed 20 of them armed with only a knife and incredible luck.The whole story and all the characters are beyond stupid. It's like they didn't even try to make sense. And you can see every plot surprises or twists coming from a mile away.It's a shame, because it could have been a decent movie. Everything else is pretty good. The directing is generic but OK. The actors are decent and - for those it might interest - Sophia Bush is hot. With a bit less sex-appeal, Sean Bean, Neal McDonough and even Z. Knighton are convincing enough.In summary, it looks good, it flows well, but the stupid and illogical scenario make is painful to watch to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the cult thriller from 1986.A young couple going cross country for spring break run into a psychotic hitch-hiker who makes their vacation turn into a violent hell. Soon the police are after them as well as the clever killer of the title frames them for several murders.From the very first scene in which a cute little bunny gets pancaked by a speeding vehicle to the outrageously violent finale this is just pure mindless blood-soaked sensationalism. The original was about tension, atmosphere, and a cunning killer that was cleverly characterized as being neither fully real nor totally supernatural. The original was consistent in its story with the whole film taking place in the ominous desert. Here you have a run-of-the-mill gore-lusting psycho killing people in increasingly stomach churning ways. Evading the police in increasingly unbelievable ways. And, in the end, being just a cheap deliverer of shock rather than a disturbing and mysterious persona.Also the teen romance story line was just plain old tired. It was inevitably done to connect with a wider audience, but it detracts from the suspense. The title character here was also shown as being more human than Rutger Hauer's original portrayal - when is thrown out of a car in one scene he just lays there and recovers in this version. While the original had a great and ominous shot of him getting up and smiling. The helicopter/car chase also has a critical difference in this version and that completely eliminates the point and power of that scene as it was in the original. This sort of deviation from the first is pretty much pervasive in this movie. Everyhting is dumbed down with the accent being put on loud explosions, car crashes, and sickening gore. Instead of tension and eeriness in connecting scenes that climaxes with the action scenes.Then you could argue, if the movie was just like the first it would be pointless to remake. Well, that's right, this is a pointless remake of a cult classic that I now like even more. --- 3/10Rated R for strong violence/gore and profanity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Hitcher" has a good underlying story that was done before in 1986 and done well. This version is worse because the script is worse. The hitcher character is not drawn as well, and his unnatural power and relationship with his victim is not as well drawn either.The photography is good. The sparse landscape functions well to complement the feeling of being trapped while in open and hostile spaces, ironically. There are several car crashes that are extremely well done. These positives compensate to some extent for the weakness written into the script of the two protagonists, who fail to react well to their predicaments. Also compensating is a menacing Sean Bean.I classify this kind of film not as a thriller or action film, but as a type of horror film. There is a sub-genre of horror films in which human beings substitute for monsters or witches or demons. These human beings seem at times to have extraordinary powers, as the hitcher does. He is constantly one or more steps ahead of his victims and the police, and he is able to locate them wherever they go, as well as acquire the weapons he uses.In some horror films of this sort, the intended victims fight back by keeping their heads, understanding their foe, planning and using the available resources. In others, like this one, the victims keep on asking the same silly questions, like "What do you want?", and they seem to lose all sense. The plot then looks like it has many holes. It is almost impossible to identify with such victims, even when one of them finally does what it takes to nullify the human monster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that I'm biased when it comes to the original movie of The Hitcher. i love Rutger Hauer, I've driven more miles than I care to count down endless, empty American highways, and there's no doubt that after a while the loneliness gets to you. Out there, in the middle of nowhere, anything can happen. It's a scary place, and that movie distils those fears into the character of one mysterious, deadly man. Even if you don't agree that the original is a masterpiece, though, it's far better than this pointless remake. The theme of loneliness on the empty roads is immediately jettisoned, since we now have two people in the car; the original's spooky beginning is replaced with a scene at a sunny college, set to a pumping, generic rock soundtrack. C Thomas Howell's lonely drifter is replaced by a couple of cute college kids. The rough edges have been sanded off, everything that was interesting has gone, and we're left with the Wal-Mart own-brand version of The Hitcher, complete with Sean Bean, the Wal-Mart own-brand version of Rutger Hauer.Someone saw the spooky, disturbing, weird original movie, and decided it needed to be more mainstream, and the protagonists needed to be more 'relatable' - or more ordinary, in other words. What The Hitcher really needed was a coy shower scene, where the heroine holds her hands over her breasts, set to generic plinky-plonk piano music. It needed more jump scares. It needed a baddie who shoots down a helicopter with a pistol, from a moving car 200 feet away. I remember watching the original and thinking that was just what it needed to make it perfect.Sean Bean, god bless him, is actually really good in this, nearly as good as Hauer in the original. But the movie doesn't deserve him. I know what the director deserves, though, and it involves two great big trucks...</fullReview>

It becomes completely unrealistic and alienates the viewer. Without spoiling anything, the killers actions and many minor details are to blame. The killer became like the Terminator and i was half expecting him to tear open his arm and start flexing his metal tubes.I blame the over-extravagance of the directors/writers for turning this into a joke rather than a deep look into the mind of a killer who puts the fear of death into all of us through REALISTIC acts of insanity. Instead we're left thinking the movie is a joke, and it wasn't scary at all for that reason.Sean Bean did his job really well but the other two leads were terrible and couldn't act. If you ever watched Jeepers Creepers, and like me, wanted the two leads to die slow and painful deaths in payment for their pure stupidity, then don't watch this movie. The characters weren't quite as dumb as in Jeepers Creepers but they were getting there at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie is horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original, but this movie sucks. At the end of the movie, many questions were posed in my mind. What was the motive? Are people really that stupid? Are the cops in New Mexico that stupid? Is that how people act on instinct? Is the average IQ really 100...or perhaps much lower? Do people really make the same mistake that many times? Are guns for show and tell? This is like a jeepers creepers movie...no point at all. Nothing twisty, nothing exceptional. People die in this movie...only two gruesome deaths are shown..the rest are pre-staged and never shown.Acting was decent.I didn't like it. It didn't leave me wondering nor did it leave me satisfied. I learned one thing in this movie. The people from New Mexico are stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, mainly because I watched it five minutes ago and I already don't remember half of it. It's a mediocre attempt at a horror movie, with a few high points that I should mention. Sean Bean has a good face for a villain, but a pretty face does not a villain make. His sadistic attitude falls short after the first encounter with our two pitiful main characters (yet another horror movie where the girl's going to pop out of her top, sigh...). I found that the music was something you don't expect in a horror movie, and although it seemed out of place, I liked it. There's not much else to say about this movie, except for maybe the fact that the police were idiotic, and I have no idea what these guys were thinking when they made this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see this just out of curiosity, I haven't really seen any American horror movies since the terrible remake of The Grudge, if all the American horror movies I've missed were anything like this then I'm truly glad I missed them. This movie was very poor indeed. It started good with a lot of promise then it just turned poor. They started to open up for what could've been multiple story lines but they didn't go any further. When the character of "Grace" said John Ryder was framing them I felt some promise, I thought the storyline would then proceed to a type of chase story, where the killer is chasing them but at the same time they're chasing him to stop themselves from being arrested for the murders. Unfortunately the first time you hear of "John" framing them is also the last time you hear of it. After "Jim" is killed "Grace" is being asked question by the Lieutenant, he states that "The Hitcher" is not actually "John Ryder", the real John Ryder went missing a few days before. The Lieutenant then begins asking "Grace" questions about The Hitcher, did he say where he came from etc... The Lieutenant then questions "The Hitcher" and he gets no answer, I thought this whole thing was opening up the storyline to find out who he really was, where he came from why he was committing all of these horrific murdersThere above are two perfect examples of opens in the movie which went nowhere, all we really find out about "The Hitcher" character is he wants to die, and he obviously must like the feeling of killing people as he states to "Grace" at the end of the movie, "feels good doesn't it?!" This movie had no real direction, it had a few moments where it made the viewer jump but not a great deal, for the suspense, well....I should really say the "so-called suspense". The suspense was non existent. I think a huge problem was the fact I wasn't convinced by the characters, I couldn't feel their terror or fear. Both "Jim" and "Grace" didn't seem believable, after "The Hitcher" held a knife to them and they merely escaped death they stopped the car and slept, when they woke "Jim" made a joke about the fact they had a knife held to them. I'm afraid if a man held a knife to mine and my girlfriend's throat I certainly wouldn't be joking about it only hours later.I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this movie. I personally feel Dave Meyers should stick to making music videos and leave the horror directing to someone who knows what they're doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Was This Even Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that "The Hitcher" from 1986 was a very well-made film, remaking the movie would have been unnecessary. And although there are remakes which could potentially be good movies, this is definitely not one of them. Not by a long shot. Now getting into the movie itself, I thought that this movie was boring and didn't contain a single scene which was remotely as emotional or as suspenseful as the original. C. Thomas Howell gave in a brilliant performance as the lead in the original, while Rutger Hauer played an excellent villain. In this movie, none of the actors did a good job with their roles. While Sean Bean is good in other movies, he was definitely a forgettable villain as The Hitcher in this movie. And as for the other two main leads; absolutely forgettable characters as well, whom you didn't care for because they were so horribly miscast and badly-written that you didn't connect with them on an emotional level at all. Horrible, horrible casting. Another problem with this film, besides the casting, is the mere fact that it's almost a carbon-copy of the original (except for a couple of changes). Almost every scene from this movie seems to have been plucked out of the original, which defeats the whole purpose of suspense, not to mention that almost every scene which was copied is absolutely inferior to the original. All in all, I have no idea what the director Dave Meyers was thinking when he decided to make this film. As others have said, you might as well just show 1986's "The Hitcher" in cinemas again and it won't make a difference. Why Sean Bean and Neal McDonough decided to even bother starring in this film is beyond me. My advice is to stay away from this film and just watch the original instead. 1/10. Absolutely dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, Bad ending - *Spoiler Alert*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without giving the storyline away, I came to the end of this film and exclaimed, "What a perfectly horrible movie." The acting was good. Sean Bean plays an extremely disturbed individual very well, and I'm not sure if I'll get over it for quite some time.The computer effects were overdone - weird skies, artificial animals, etc.But what really made me dislike it was the ending. When the girl's boyfriend died, I thought that was too much. Then all the good cops die, again too much. Yeah, Sean Bean's character dies in the end, but only after everyone else is dead and the girl has snapped.I generally like action films and blood and gore don't usually bother me, but this film was too over the top for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre remake which is too far away from the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being truly awful this remake of THE HITCHER is not good either, so probably it would have been better if they had just it let undone! I mean there're a few scenes that this one is a little better than the original (the truck scene for example) but if we exclude those little scenes this movie is a big letdown to the original, especially because it all seems too "forced", as many scenes just don't make any sense! As they wanted to improve, mixing "new stuff" with the most emblematic scenes of the original movie, the final result was this mess! The sadomasochistic psychological game I did refer in my review to the original movie is reinterpreted here with a new and different character. What really changed this "game" and made it less interesting in my perspective? Besides, the acting was not as good as the original, not even close! From the JOHN RYDER character (played by Sean Bean), which never convinces as the psycho guy (unlike Rutger Hauer, which did an excellent job in the original), to JIM HALSEY (played by Zachary Knighton), or even to the new character GRACE (played by Sophia Bush), all the actors did a mediocre job (By the way putting a beautiful girl in a miniskirt helps to keep your attention, but doesn't improve the acting!). The unnecessary contextualization in the beginning was also quite pathetic. Even so, I will rate this movie 5/10 because in spite of being too far away from the original, it's good enough to keep you "occupied" for almost one hour and half. If we forget that it's a "THE HITCHER" wanna be, I think we can consider it as an average horror flick! Just entertaining so?</fullReview>

Its not the best horror film but its not the worst either, the story for the film is a good one and you do end up feeling sorry for the two characters involved. By the end i was wishing one of them hadnt died and more often then not im glad that the characters get killed because of their lack of talent or common sense. There is a high body count, which is always good in horror films and i have to say i wasn't bored watching it and the plot keeps you gripped till the end. And speaking of the end it was a good one. Good horror film to watch if your at a loose end on a Saturday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confuses Suffering with Terror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the realm of remakes, this one has to be rather confusing. You see, the original "The Hitcher" with Rutger Hauer and C. Thomas Howell was actually a pretty weak horror film from the mid 80's to begin with. Its premise was a young man being stalked by a would-be hitchhiker into a explosive conclusion.So here we find the remake- and on the spectrum of horror vs torture porn, this one finds itself right on the border. To summarize: a young couple going on a Spring Break bender come into contact with a malevolent hitchhiker who means them harm. And, as with most of the remakes when compared to the original, the "yuck" factor is greatly intensified.In this one, Sean Bean (who is normally a quality actor) plays "John Rider" (how original!), the hitcher who, in the course of his stalking, dispatches a family, a police station, an armored car meant to transfer him to a prison...and so on.This film really clarifies what I feel is wrong about these remakes, and the spirit with which they're being re-made. You see, horror films work best when suspense is their defining characteristic- however in these remakes, and even some of the recent films made, there is a penchant for cruelty and gore that makes watching them less about enduring the suspense, and more about being able to hold down what you've eaten.In one scene in this film, the young man is chained between two tractors, and is subsequently torn in half. What did this do for the film, besides add a mean spirited gore factor that was wholly unnecessary? Of course, when you remake a film that wasn't actually all that good to begin with, I suppose you have to resort to extraordinary means to try and sell it. Its too bad because if someone had tried to make a film worth watching, and managed to inject it with suspense over gore, I'm sure they'd make a film worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad film but..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.....it feels completely pointless. I actually reckon this along with last years The Omen redo is one of the better of a recent spate of horror remakes but unfortunately whilst The Hitcher redo is competently made and performed it just can't better the original in any way or form. The story bar a few little plot tweaks is 100% identical to that of the original, a group of teens played by Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton pick up a stranger (Sean Bean) who turns out to be a cunning nutter, interested only in slashing their throats. After luckily disposing of him, The Hitcher continues to haunt them down the highway setting them up for crimes they didn't commit and leaving a tonne of gored up bodies in his wake. The performances here are actually decent enough, Zach Knighton is a bit weak in the role of Jim, but Sophia Bush is a bit more interesting and engaging as his girlfriend. Those who have watched the 1986 classic will know that only Jim was on the road in that movie, something which really helped escalate the tension. In this picture the scares are largely blood based and depend at times on boo moments, leaving the battle of wits element from the 1st film behind. Sean Bean is easily the best thing about the film, he is a good selection to fill Rutger Hauer's boots even if grimace for grimace he can't match the man for sheer menace. Bean manages to bring a little extra depth to a movie, which seems largely happy to be brainless entertainment. Director Dave Meyers is a newbie behind the camera and his first feature isn't particularly ambitious, a nice visual flair is the only thing that separates his direction from that of a DTV slasher. He peppers the screen with jump moments and a couple do get you, but unlike The 80's version precious few of his scares are memorable. The picture looks nice and works OK for a Friday night DVD indeed those unfamiliar with the original may take quite a liking to this one. However those who have encountered The Hitcher before are unlikely to remember this roadtrip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless with few surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a sense of anticipation about this film. Having not seen the original I had no expectations but I knew Sean Bean would be able to do such a legendary character justice.Unfortunately, I was badly let down. Sean Bean was obviously here for the money only as he looks bored and doesn't make any effort at all. Given the pointless, dreary script he was given though, I am not surprised. The filmmakers have obviously been sleepwalking too as everything here has been done before... far better. There are a few surprises and i even jumped once but the inane, unbelievable plot left me wanting it to be over.For some reason the killer, who psychotically murders everyone he encounters, decides (for reasons unknown) not to murder the 2 'heroes' of the film. Instead, he tries to have them framed for the murders he commits. 'What a brilliant, different twist' i thought.Turns out there is no reasoning behind this AT ALL and halfway through, when ol' Sean gives himself away as the killer you realise how truly pointless this film is as he kills everybody in sight. (Except the 2 heroes which it now turns out he wasn't trying to frame at all, but simply kept wasting opportunities to kill off. This makes it even more unbelievable). By the end you wonder why; but no explanation is forthcoming which turns this potential twisted thriller flick into an unbelievably generic slasher/action film. I would not sit through this movie again but I will go check out the original which I bet will be far superior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was It All Worth It?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film, with Rutger Hauer and C. Thomas Howell starring, was very good. It had everything you needed in such a thrilling story ? suspense, plot line, terror, horror and even some love story. The very idea to make a remake of that good film seemed quite weird. Well, after all, the film makers invited excellent actor Sean Bean, known for his deep, psychological approach to his characters. Here, he is very decent as John Ryder, a mysterious and ruthless mass killer. And, let us be fair, Sean is the only real asset of this half-baked work. What went wrong? Well, the young stars of the film seem to lose the clue altogether. They may play in an American Pie ? type of comedy, or a bloody road thriller with the same lack of gusto or sense. Yes, they do try hard. But, the mere presence of Mr. Bean makes their efforts more fruitless. And then, this version is so meaninglessly bloody and violent that all the possible limits of good taste are crossed very soon into the film. Seems like the film crew thought that to be not enough, and the DVD bonus featured a 20-minutes film dedicated only to the very scene where the ties body of the main hero is torn apart by 2 trucks. Well, I wonder why they did not show also somebody's brains blown away for some 30 minutes or so. All that in mind, plus a lot of foul language, plus too much blood, makes the film a very heavy lump to swallow at once. This brings us to the idea that not all of the remakes or sequels work well. Often, they flop miserably. Sometimes, like this film, The Hitcher, they produce a blank look and a lingering question: Was it really worth doing it? My idea, no. Leave this version and give the classic variant another try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Hitcher is hailed as being a cult classic. Though i would ever call it a horror film. Its a thriller and it all ways will be. This remake is great and is one of the best horror remakes around.Events follow in much the same way as the first. Now that this is a big budget film the special effects and stunts are much better. When Grace and Jim are being chased down the high way by the police it ends very well. Sean Bean kills the cops and the cars crash.Sean Bean plays very well as the fake John Rider and is a true classic cold bloodied killer. As much as i like this remake it should of had more action and it should have been a lot longer. It ends very similar to the original but this time its grace who blows Riders head off. Poor Jim never got a slice of the action seeing as he was pulled apart by two trucks. I loved riding with Sean but more fool me for leaving Rutger in the rain. Its a great remake but the original will never be beaten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unnecessary, pointless remake doesn't improve on the original, and for except a few minor changes follows the first film relatively closely.Sean Bean(a good actor who deserves to be in better films that this)who exudes the same kind of quiet menace as a Rutger Hauer does in the original, is a psycho hitch-hiker tormenting college sweethearts Grace(the sexy Sophia Bush) and Jim(Zachary Knighton)on their way to a spring break shindig. He follows them everywhere making their life a living hell, eventually framing them for the murder of an entire Christian family, which certainly can leave a sour taste in one's mouth. But, as in the original(except instead of just C Thomas Howell in the first film, it's both Bush and Knighton this time around skipping the Jennifer Jason Leigh waitress aspect), he has other mysterious plans for them as the hitcher butchers an entire police station crew. He lets them go free and so not only do the running couple face the blames for a family, but policemen also. There's a similar police chase where Grace and Jim take the squad car of a policeman the hitcher shoots in the head(a bit different than the original where Hauer kills the deputies of a car Howell takes command of)being pursued by officers with happy trigger fingers. There is a notorious "diesel pull" where the hitcher presses the clutch ripping a poor soul in half because the one with a decision to make wouldn't kill him. It seems the hitcher, like Hauer's murderer in the original film, wishes to die and needs either Jim or Grace to do so..he has this insane death wish and admittedly just can not stop killing innocents. Perhaps that's the motive..he wants to die so the killing urge will be silenced. But, the original film has already touched that aspect of the story.And, that's the problem with the whole remake. It really doesn't lead in a fresh, innovative direction. Some scenes seem accurately lifted right from the original product except with different characters. Some minor aspects are left out, like the aforementioned decision to not have a waitress in this version instead letting a couple going through the torment caused by the hitcher. The psycho hitcher's actions are basically the same as Hauer's from the original film. The one major difference is that this remake elaborates more..we see the carnage left by the killer towards the innocent Christian family and the victim who gets pulled apart when the hitcher applies the clutch to the diesel is shown in a quick graphic display. Neal McDonough has a flashy role as Lieutenant Esteridge of a New Mexico police station. The film is well made, quite polished, and one can see a LOT of money was poured into it. Still, the final 30 minutes is complete unrealistic rubbish. There's no way Bean's psycho could do what he does without showing a glimmer of agony..and Sophia Bush with a shotgun in her hand like a female Rambo is hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers are in the review below.I had high hopes for this film. The original is one of my favorite guilty pleasures from the 80's. Not the world's greatest film, but still thoroughly entertaining. This film started off alright, but then went downhill from there.I'm OK with the fact that the film wasn't a shot by shot remake. I didn't have any issues with the changes in the setup and where the story was going. This is what I did have a problem with:- Acting. Sophia Bush is nice to look at, but beyond that there wasn't anything there. - Sean Bean. He's one of my favorite actors. Loved him in 'GoldenEye' and 'The Lord of the Rings'. In this film, though, he just wasn't menacing enough. Rutger Hauer could scare the hell out of you just by looking at you. Bean couldn't match Hauer's menace. - Profanity. I'm OK with profanity in movies. I realize it's going to be there. The issue here is that the original film was pretty limited in its use. This film had it peppered throughout. Adding profanity does not make a better film. Which leads me to... - Violence and gore. One of the beauties of the original film was that the most violent and gory sequences (and I'm thinking of Jennifer Jason Leigh's death) were implied, not shown. It gave the film more of an impact. Watching Jim Halsey get torn in half didn't add anything to this film. I think it cheapened it. - The ending. I thought it was overblown and silly. The ending of the original wasn't perfect, either, but at least it wasn't so overblown. Pyrotechnics don't add to the suspense.It's difficult to watch a remake without comparing it to the original, especially when you've recently watched the original. Taking it by itself and disregarding what has come before, this was OK. Comparing it to its predecessor, it can't stand on its own two legs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Bean makes this bearable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another pointless horror remake of a 1986 film. Grace (Sophia Bush) and boyfriend Jim (Zachary Knighton) are driving through the New Mexico desert on Spring Break from college. They meet hitchhiker John Ryder (Sean Bean) who inexplicably is killing people and making it seem as they're responsible. Soon they're on the run from the police and trying to figure out why Ryder is doing all this.The 1986 original didn't need to be remade. It was well-done and scary--but that never stopped Hollywood. The original had just Jim alone--this time they add a pointless love interest. They pretty much follow the plot of the original with some minor changes and much more graphic gore (I could have lived without seeing someone drawn and quartered). Hell, some scenes from the original are directly copied in the remake! To make matters worse the acting in here is mostly pretty bad. Bush comes across as whiny and obnoxious. Knighton barely registers at all and looks like a slob (I kept wondering why Bush was dating him). The only good acting is by Neal McDonough (in a small part as a sheriff) and Bean. Bean gets very little screen time but he's genuinely creepy. He manages to cover his British accent and have a low, deep, scary voice. Like the original this ending is ambiguous but in this case I was so bored and hated the two main characters that I didn't care. Only Bean makes this watchable. You're better off sticking with the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I've seen a fair few terrible films in my time, but this one really took the biscuit.My girlfriend suggested this to me, as she is a massive hack-n-slash horror fan, and after seeing 'outlaw' I thought I might like it, as I was rather impressed with that film.Straight from the offset I was annoyed with this film. Massive plot holes, an unrealistic threat and stereotypical directing made this film a definite 'no no' from me.Please only watch this film if you really have nothing to do for 84 minutes. I mean SERIOUSLY nothing to do. Watching paint dry would be more fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>surprise surprise, a waste of time remake (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It worries me that this film was ever considered to be a good idea to be honest. While the remake of The Hills Had Eyes had some merit (in that the only thing they kept was the basic premise and totally rewrote the story from that), the only point in this remake seemed to be to get a version of the original that has modern cars, music and clothes.I knew what to expect as soon as I saw that Michael Bay was listed as a producer, so I wasn't shocked to see the usual glossy production, pumping music, overblown stunts and complete lack of character or tension that his name will always be associated with....I sometimes suspect that he's secretly trying to deconstruct Hollywood from the inside by making everything so self-referential that the industry eventually eats itself.What was the point of replacing the original protagonist with a tedious OC style couple? It seemed to be so that we never had to have more than 30 seconds of film without some dialogue. In the original C Thomas Howell spent a lot of the beginning of the movie on his own, and so we had to watch him, you know, act and stuff. In the remake everything is narrated in the tedious back and forth between the two vapid leads...it's a constant stream of burbling like "we'd better stop!", "let's help him!", "let's get the cops!", "have you ever wanted kids?", "oh sh*t!", and "oh sh*t!" again for good measure.And for god's sake, why in modern films are we never allowed to slow down at all? The point of thrillers is that moments of tension and excitement only work when they punctuate slower, more relaxed scenes. If the characters are constantly running and shouting then after a while the viewer just switches off. Can they not credit us with some patience? As for the increased gore, it just bored me rigid. The original scene where the girl was pulled apart by the truck was infamously scary even though you never saw anything (I watched it in my teens and still now wonder in my head what it would have looked like). In the remake you get to see Jim being pulled in two and my reaction was just "oh right, that's it?".Even the choice of music was awful - nothing atmospheric in any way, and I almost laughed out loud when that Nine Inch Nails song came on, probably the laziest piece of film-making I've ever seen.I'm shocked that Sean Bean signed up for this. While I respect the fact that he's an actor with a work ethic and not snobby, I hope he realised how rubbish this was going to be and felt suitably ashamed. The rest of the cast just coasted through without making any kind of impression.I'd advise anyone who hasn't seen this yet to start with the original, at least then it won't be spoiled before they see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A roundly poor re-make with pretty much nothing going for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Jim (Zachary Knighton) is travelling down a highway at night with his girlfriend Grace (Sophia Bush) when he nearly hits a man standing in the road. When they stop at a petrol station, the man comes in, apologizes for being so foolish, names himself as John Ryder (Sean Bean) and asks Jim for a lift. However during the journey, he shows his sinister true colours and so begins a nightmarish and deadly highway chase with the two teenagers that promises to be a battle to the death.A cult favourite for over twenty years now, The Hitcher has enjoyed one DVD sequel and now this belated re-make, that got a frosty reception in theatres earlier this year. It saw more light than it's sequel counter-part may have, but it actually comes off as the worse film out the two.Bean just isn't The Hitcher. He may have impressively got rid of his rough Yorkshire accent for his role, but he can't hope to compare with Rutger Hauer's masterly iciness and his performance just comes across as laughable. Likewise, Knighton is no C. Thomas Howell and is impossible to tell apart from any of the other dumb American teenagers you see in most horror films nowadays. Bush serves only as the eye candy on display, screaming hysterically, getting flashes of PMT and doing nothing you wouldn't expect her to do.There's no suspense in the film, it's as predictable as hell and even at just 80 minutes by the end it's gotten really boring.Just another lazy Hollywood re-make of a golden horror classic, this is one Hitcher you really should just refuse a ride from your rental store. *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is an insult of human intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If life is about making choices, this movie will give u an idea how easily you would get messed up with bad choices, totally. What this movie tells you they have no logic, what you keep asking the same questions when viewing is "what the hell you think you're doing?" Lots of thing they don't make sense at all. For instance (**spoilers**):After viewing some files and the crime scene, Cowboy sheriff jumps to a conclusion that the fugitives "didn't do it", simply because they are "21 years old college kids". Obviously he doesn't know anything about any of college shoot outs from the TV-news before. Not even counting the possibility that the suspects could be accessory of the crimes.The hitcher has no hesitation of killing the family and cops, it seems he is unstoppable. But he doesn't kill the college kids when several chances has presented to themselves.The officer, who is supposed to sit face to face and keep watching the detained suspect the whole time during the trauma transport, doesn't know the cuffed one is trying to uncuff. Somehow he is not seeing what he is looking at, that is pretty strange.Hunted by a lunatic killer, the smart college boy chooses to turn away from cops that's one thing, but trying to call his folks for help is one other thing. In upclose danger, I can't see how his folks in distance could be any helpful while the local cops ain't.Perhaps the only thing that makes sense is the college kids try hard to run away from those useless cops. They somehow know this hitcher is capable of killing any cops who get in his way. Yes, cops we can find in the scenes they all end up dead.et cetera Sophia Bush is good looking. But she is losing voice, it's like she was suffering from sore throat or some sort. That's pretty annoying to ears when hearing her speaking. I wouldn't suggest her to act in any horror films in future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know you are looking for reasons to see this movie ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you really have to watch the whole movie before reviewing it? What if it's so bad that it became painful to watch it any longer? And you felt obligated to warn other people not to waste their time either. This is how I felt about this movie. I quit right after the guy wrecked his car, which is about 30 minutes into the movie. It became apparent that this movie is going no where.The good: Sean Bean is perfectly charming and creepy as usual.The bad: Just about everything else.What exactly about this movie that turned me off? In the short 30 minutes of my total viewing, it managed to cram in all the Hollywood horror clichés that's known to man. And the characters are so annoyingly stupid, you just give up on them very soon. What other reason left for me to keep watching this movie if 1. it became predictable with all the clichés and 2. I don't care about the characters anymore and sort of expect them to be killed anyway? The movie opens by killing an innocent rabbit right in front of your eyes. So I got the message that the director's not afraid of being gross and irrelevant. Few minutes later, he killed a giant dragon fly on the windshield. Just so he can show you how the meathead boyfriend try to wash the dead bug off the windshield using a bottled water, while driving on the freeway! He ended up with dirty water splashed all over his face. Surprise! It's not particularly funny either. It's just annoying and stupid. It's no wonder that he eventually managed to drove the car off the road and drove his windshield right through a tree. At least the stupidity is very coherent and persistent.I turned the movie off right there, because I already knew what atrocities follows. (The usual cat - mouse chase with a few cheap scares and more stupidity wearing on your nerves).It's kind of annoying to see a good classical horror theme got man handled into such predictable wreckage. It's also sad to see Sean Bean in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Police cars flipping and tumbling and disintegrating in slow-motion... it's easy to tell that Michael Bay had a hand in this!I went into this remake (of a film that only came out in the same year as Aliens and Top Gun - what's next, remakes of those too?) without high expectations, or even moderate ones, but was actually slightly surprised by what turned out to be an efficient - if unremarkable - little horror thriller.What the remake lacks compared to the original is a compelling villain. Sean Bean doesn't have Rutger Hauer's creepy intensity, coming across instead as just another grungy movie madman. Oddly, the actor playing the cop in charge of the investigation - with his blond hair and piercing stare - seems far more like Hauer's Ryder. Maybe the roles should have been reversed.The trailer gave away another role-reversal (this time of gender) regarding the eventual fate of one character to anyone who'd seen the original, making it clear that Sophia Bush's Grace would turn out to be the one to confront Ryder at the climax. I wasn't previously familiar with the actress, but she delivered a decent performance as her character transforms over the course of the film in the Ripley/Laurie Strode/Sarah Connor tradition... while wearing a far shorter skirt than any of them. Again, it's easy to tell that Michael Bay was involved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitcher remake is a mess.....literally and figuratively</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest craze of remakes is to be expected. With an audience that is becoming more and more fickle and the ever expanding emphasis on the opening weekend box office being the end all, Hollywood is trying to create a quick cash in with these remakes. Some are good, some are bad. Unfortunately this is one of the bad ones, though with some redeeming qualities.The film establishes a nice enough sense of suspense. Albeit this comes off as a rehash of the Spielberg classic "Duel". Sean Bean was a great choice of actor to play the mysterious and murderous "Hitcher". But in the end, the film relies way too much on over the top gore. Bean is menacing enough and the two college kids are likable enough as well. But everything just seems to be paint by the numbers. You basically can figure out who will make it and who will not. We are given two good looking kids, just trying to go and have some fun. The boyfriend ends up trying to do the "right" thing, but it turns out to be the wrong thing. Duh, like we didn't know that was going to be the case. Everything in the film seems to be rushed. There is a point when the local sheriff takes all of 5mins to figure out the kids are not responsible for the crimes they are being framed for. What would have been great is to have more time spent on the kids trying to redeem themselves in the eyes of the law all the while running from the hitcher. This would have brought a new level of intensity to the film. We get a little of that, but it is abandoned instead to give us a gory death scene and a rushed push to get us to the final show down that we know is coming and know the outcome of. This is one of those cases where a direct to video should have been the route taken. It would have been less expensive for the film makers and easier on our pocket books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, the only reason this movie managed to get a 4 is because it did manage to be hilariously bad. Never before have a seen a movie where the main villain has (admittedly) no motivation. In addition, somehow the villain has the uncanny ability to locate his victims repeatedly throughout the movie no matter where they are. The hitcher can kill an entire police force without making a sound and then make cars fall from the sky randomly. Honestly, this movie does not make even the slightest bit of sense. The acting is some of the worst that I have ever seen accompanied by ridiculous dialog like, " I know that look, you have to pee don't you?". All the characters are inconsistent and no one in this movie seems to have any real purpose. If you've already seen this movie than you too know the pain I've felt. If you haven't seen this movie, than don't unless your looking to watch something that can only be described as "stupid-funny".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be blunt because I just couldn't believe how bad this was. First off, yes OK, I do love the original to death. But I can promise you, I didn't watch this film to satisfy my despise for any remakes out there at all. This film was just absolute crap.Sean Bean's creation of John Ryder was a mess. No dread or mystery compared to what we saw with Rutger back in the 80's. No suffering of our heroes at all. You can even tell through Bean's performance that this brilliant actor was fed up with it. This has become a tragic Direction problem and so it was in many ways. Rock n Roll popcorn movies really are going down the pits lately. The "interesting" twists that everyone has been on about in the Hitcher 2007 are nothing more than just twists on the original film itself. If this was a tactic to impress and excite fans of the original, then in my opinion it has failed.(SPOILER HERE) The use of NIN "closer" during the shockingly directed action scenes on the highway was just outrageously stupid. It made no sense at all in any way.Just another fodder remake from the fodder masters of Hollywood. Don't bother, trust me. If you haven't seen the original, then do yourself a true favour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Low in 'Horror'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should have checked in with IMDb before adding 'The Hitcher' to my Netflix queue. I'd have seen that the director, Dave Myers, has only ever directed music videos and that the writers, Wall and Bernt, were responsible for the appalling remake of 'When A Stranger Calls' and such straight-to-video gems as 'Batchelor Party Vegas'. Maybe seeing that Michael Bay was a producer should have warned me that a beautifully shot sunrise would replace dialogue and explosions would take the place of logic. Alas, I did not, and the punishment for my oversight was sitting through 84 minutes of bland characters behaving stupidly within a truly senseless story lacking in all tension and suspense. 'The Hitcher' represents a new low for the already pretty low genre of 'cheap remakes of eighties slasher films'.</fullReview>

There are soooooo many dumb parts in this movie. throughout the movie you will question why did this happen or how is this possible, well the answers are: there is no reason and yes it is impossible. i like how the Christian family drives away after the main characters car crashes off a cliff, because thats really likely. also i enjoy how the killer manages to destroy 3 cop cars and kill some1 in a helicopter armed with a handgun..again very realistic. then he proceeds to drive away and the guy and girl run off into the mountains. they then goto a hotel and are magically found by the killer. WOW he must have some amazing GPS tracker to always in the movie know where the couple are. then in the end when the cops are driving him in the van wouldn't there be more backup, maybe more cops for such a huge serial killer???? also the cop in the back with him wouldn't have a gun and i love how he breaks his finger and yanks his hand outta the cuffs without being seen. this is without question one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. basically if you wanna see a movie that is impossibly unrealistic and stupid pick this one up!!!!!!!</fullReview>

Man, that rabbit looks so fake! its clearly a CGI all the time...that is an awful way to begin a movie that wants to afraid the viewers. All the movie looks "too fashion", its "too pretty" everything (the leads, the photography, everything), thats not good in this kind of movies, there is nothing creepy here. The lead actress performance is horrible, and there is a shower scene were she is alone but she cover her tits! Why they made that scene...no one covers his/her parts when they are alone.

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen.It tries to be a thriller but seeing Sean Bean's face all the time ruins any sort of thrill or mystery (like when he's chasing the cop cars and killing them all and there's some gay pop record playing). Bean's character was kinda an attempt at John Doe but lacked everything that made John Doe sinister (partially because of the plot and directing).The plot had more holes than swiss cheese. Those kids deserved to be tortured for being so dumb. And Sean Bean seemed to be superhuman - having the ability to wield all sorts of weapons from his jacket, push a car silently off a cliff, and preternatural sense of where the two kids were at all times. Such ridiculous crap spoiled any sort of suspense or thrill.Some movies try to make up for bad plots with loads of gore. But this movie wasn't even that gory. A few stabbings/shootings and that was it really. If you want to see a movie to laugh at how bad it is - I'd recommend this.One final question. Why does Michael Bay keep making movies?</fullReview>

Unfortunately anything positive I had to say about this train wreck of a screenplay was quickly shoved out of my brain by the next scene, line, painfully bad bit of acting, or as is the case in 99% of this movie, a sickly combination of all three. I literally fought back the urge to shout out at the movie numerous times. Sophia Bush should never be allowed to call herself an actor ever again. She came across as no more than a pretty, illiterate girl (she obviously didn't read the script before signing on). The helpless female she tries to portray in the first 95% of the movie is such an extreme example of the stereotype that even the most rabid sexist couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to buy it. And when she "redeems" herself in the last 2 minutes by showing that girl power that we hadn't even gotten a whiff of previously, it is so forced and out of place (not to mention cheesy enough for a triple bypass) that I honest to god, threw up in my mouth. don't go see this movie.

And will the help of Lt. Esteridge (Neal McDonough) be enough? (A big fat NO, both for the actual help and for the help in making this movie good; too bad, Neil, you did your best, but Hack Wade Wall managed to wreck ANOTHER movie).I have to ask someone if Jake Wade Wall is capable of writing an ORIGINAL screenplay, or a GOOD one; so far, he has showed no talent in either direction (the fact that Eric Red, despite having had nothing to do with this drivel, STILL has primary scriptwriter credit speaks for itself, and so do the 'cosmetic' (for the worse, actually, especially the ludicrous scene where cops get killed to the tune of Nine Inch Nails' 'Closer' - and I felt each second closer to barf - and the anatomically incorrect tractor pull scene) changes, like the classic 'heroine' (who actually comes off as a brain dead and unlikable person) set-up (The World would END if a white man was the hero of a thriller/horror, it seems. Well, at least according to Platinum Dunes, who has already showed the tendency to dumb down classic with terrible remakes (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003, anyone?) and putting bimboes and bimbettes fighting (and winning over) unstoppable killers in the most ridiculous ways possible (Sophia Bush as Terminatrix?

		<shortDescription>A remake that passes the time pretty well, although the original's still better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this film when I set out to watch it. I'd already heard all of the negative press, and two further things stood against it in my opinion: the first was the involvement of producer Michael Bay, whose work I'm not a great fan of (that bloated mess TRANSFORMERS, anyone?), and the second was that I saw no reason for a remake to begin with. The original THE HITCHER, made in 1986 and starring Rutger Hauer, is a perfectly good little thriller with plenty of scares, shocks, and suspenseful moments. So why remake it just twenty-one years later? The reason is obvious: money. And this version of THE HITCHER is little more than a cynical ploy to make more of it, without putting much thought or effort into the movie to begin with. However, despite all these flaws, negatives, and problems, I was left feeling genuinely surprised, because I thought this film wasn't too bad. Sure, it's no classic, and it's not one I'll ever really want to watch again, but it passes the time. It doesn't muster up much suspense but as a film reliant on 'jump' scares, it works a treat, with sudden characters bursting onto the screen, or bursts of sound or music, making me start from my seat time after time. It may not be art, but if it's what you're looking for...I'll admit right now that I have a soft spot for Sean Bean, one of my favourite actors. Maybe it's his working class origins or his rugged look, but I always enjoy seeing this guy up on screen. Having watched him act the hell out of the other cast members in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, it was no surprise seeing him give a great performance here. He's subtle, scary, and very much deranged, an absolute psychopath with no emotion or care for his own safety or the lives of others. Bean doesn't fascinate like Hauer did, but he's perfectly good in the role.The other cast members are okay. Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton aren't given much to work with other than react to the various menaces, but they convince as the young college couple. Character actor Neal McDonough is on hand playing the lawman investigating the crimes but he's criminally wasted here, especially after he gave such a good performance in BAND OF BROTHERS ? he could well have played the Hitcher himself with those staring eyes.As far as remaking the original movie goes, some bits are the same while others are different. One action set-piece in the middle of the film really got my goat, because of the decision to play some stupid, intrusive piece of pop music right in the middle of it. I know they did it for effect, but it really doesn't work ? I'm a traditionalist when it comes to soundtracks, give me an orchestra any day. Elsewhere, it's predictable fun, with characters hunting around in dark basements or being confronted with bloodied corpses. The gore and violence is amped up, crucially in a moment near the climax where a character is tied between the cabin and trailer of a lorry, and it provides a welcome distraction from the plot holes and lack of logic you see elsewhere.Despite a rushed ending, I still enjoyed this movie. It keeps you watching and Bean, although he doesn't exactly set the screen alight, is an able menace; the escape from the prison van is well handled and disturbing. THE HITCHER is the kind of film I can take or leave, but I've seen worse ? a lot worse...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't look back: Immoral remake to immoral trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>January 20, 2007I never ever began to think that "The Hitcher" would ever be remade. Actually, hoped is a better word. The original film came out in 1986 and should have never seen the light of day. It was a reprehensible piece of violent and cruel trash that showcased brutality and violence with no purpose. A lot of films are being remade lately and I must be led to believe that the producers of this remake have to be really desperate if they are willing to look back on a picture that was truly one of the worst films of the 1980's.It's about a young man, Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) and his girlfriend, Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) who are driving across the countryside for spring break. While driving, they see a man hitchhiking in the pouring rain and they speed off. Later at a gas station, Jim reluctantly agrees to give, John Ryder (Sean Bean) a lift. when the Hitcher becomes violent, they shove him out the door. Ryder begins tormenting the two kids and forces them to play a cat and mouse game of murder. when Jim and Grace are suspected of the murders Ryder is leaving behind, they make a run for it with the police chasing close behind while trying to figure out what Ryder wants from them.Remakes are starting to become the object of desire and I can see a lot of horror/thriller films getting a reboot, not that that is always a good thing and this film was one we did not need. The original film was about a young man who is chased all through the western countryside by a psychopathic serial killer with no motive, purpose or identity and that made the film sick in its portrayal of violence. The film's sadomasochistic theme between C. Thomas Howell and Rutger Hauer was disturbing enough but now Sean Bean steps into the role of Ryder and plays the same killer who is hell bent on murdering people for no reason. You would think a motive would finally be revealed but no, it's safer for the filmmakers to stick to the original film and on that note, this film is about as disgusting and meaningless as the original.Everything remains the same but they retool a few scenes, one of which I will get to after. If you have seen the original, you know which scene I'm talking about. After the opening credits pass, Jim and Grace are driving through the dark when they see Ryder in the middle of the road near a broken car. After giving a ride, he pulls a knife and becomes violent, sound familiar? After Ryder is pushed out, they continue driving when they see a station wagon with the Hitcher in the back. Again, sound familiar? They changed nothing with the picture. The only difference is that Sean Bean steps into the menacing shoes of John Ryder and he is more of a pain in the ass than Rutger Hauer was attempting to be terrifying. He remains largely unchanged and we are, once again, given a killer whose sole purpose is to murder innocent people for no reason. No motive, nothing. We were not even told where Ryder came from in the original and we are not told with this story either.As you expect, the rest of the story plays out like the original with non-stop mayhem with Ryder framing them and the cops being too stupid to figure out what's going on. I will say, it's less believable with Jim and Grace than it was with Jim and Nash, yet, the cops are hell bent on catching them. Now comes the sequence that truly shocked the hell out me in the original and left me feeling sick. In the original, Jennifer Jason Leigh is tied between two trucks and split into two parts and this time, it's Jim who is tied between the two trucks and Grace being terrified. I had to laugh for a second because when the cops show up, they still think Grace and Jim are the two killers, yet, he's tied between two trucks while Ryder sits in the cab looking like a bat out of hell. You can image what happens next and, yes, he is split in half. This time, they show the two pieces of his body dangling just to further the disgust factor.I was left really angry when Jennifer Jason Leigh was ripped in half in the original and I felt bad for the actress because she is very talented and she was subjected to meaningless torture. Sofia Bush is a talented actress but her role is limited here and I wonder why they didn't cut her in half? Mind you, this is Michael Bay who is producing here and maybe he thought the idea of cutting a woman in half was a bad idea? Who cares? In the end, this remake is an immortal piece of trash much like the original. It does the same thing over again to a lesser degree in terms of content but still stands out as a desperate attempt to revive a film that died a long time ago and that's a sad commentary when entertainment resorts to rebooting a film like "The Hitcher" for a young audience that isn't even old enough to see it and should never see either the original film or this remake.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting first half, but then devolves into predictable stupidity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of me typing this, I have not seen the original movie from 1986. There, I figure I'd get that out of the way before anything else. So because I don't have the original to compare it to, I'm able to approach this movie from a blind perspective. I won't be comparing characters, plot points, endings, or anything like that to the original. So, lets dive right into the pros and cons shall we? I'll give the film a couple of positives, Sean Bean and the uniqueness of the story. There are so many slasher movies out there, but I haven't heard of one where a couple is chased along a highway by a maniac before. If you've seen movies with this concept though, it probably won't be as unique to you as it was for me. Sean Bean on the other hand, is pretty damn menacing in this. I've always loved Sean because he can play a great bad guy, but also a sympathetic character. See his performances in "Goldeneye" and "LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring" respectively for those. Sean's able to stay one step ahead of Grace and Jim, making the first half of the movie a suspenseful game of "Cat and Mouse". There are even some moments of pretty good suspense, like the first time Sean's in the car with the couple, and when he murders the religious family (including the little kid). The religious family scene is probably the highlight of the film. It managed to not be insanely gory, and instead let you use your imagination to piece together how he killed them. Sure there's a jump-scare during it, but the build up of suspense was good, so it makes the jump-scare work.The second half of the film, is where it starts to fall apart. If you want to know where exactly that starts, it's when the cop gets held up by Grace in the trailer park. I know there's a lunatic after you, but holding a cop at gunpoint and then trying to convince him you didn't kill anyone, is beyond a reasonable response to a stressful situation. Then there's the car chase with the cops where Sean is basically the T-1000 and takes out three cop cars, and a helicopter with a pistol (with of course ridiculous car flips that are totally not possible). And for some reason, when Grace and Jim see him during the chase, they don't stop. If they'd just pulled over, and he had started shooting at them, that would have stopped his little killing spree with six cops and a helicopter overhead now wouldn't it? The motel scene is pretty good, until Jim gets chained to the trucks and Grace starts doing what Sean wants. Um, excuse me, you have a gun pointed at his head, shoot him! I know he said if he gets shot his foot'll go off the clutch and Jim'll die, but couldn't you shoot him in the head and then reach in and depress the clutch with you're hand or something? The climax of this just goes way overboard, and is the final nail in the coffin. Sean manages to kill three more cops, escape handcuffs, survive a roll-over car crash, and trap Grace in what's left of the cop van. Grace then survives the van blowing up (because Michael Bay), and kills Sean after he's killed Esteridge (Neal McDonough). Also, McDonough and Bean were the only positives left at this point.In conclusion, the movie starts out promising, with some pretty good suspense and tension, but starts to collapse by the half way point and becomes predictable. "How predictable was the final scene," you ask? I got the ending right, before the van pulled out of the station. In better hands, this probably could have worked, but at least it was short, it kinda softens the blow a little bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two twenty-somethings decide to leave college for spring break; of all things it involves driving a muscle car. How exactly are these 'children' capable of getting a car which is nearly forty years prior and nearly a collector car? Regardless, they are well onto their way when they run across a man standing in the middle of the road; they nearly hit him and then decide to go about their business without offering assistance. They pull into a gas station and then the man from before appears ? he managed to get a lift from a passing trucker. He asks for a ride from the kids and then all goes downhill from there ? turns out he is a psychopath.The rest of the film is spent with the two protagonists narrowly avoiding runins with the psychopath. Eventually trying to help out more of the psycho's victims turns into a runin with the cops and they end up in jail; the psychopath promptly turns around and kills all of the cops. Now the state patrol is after them.The movie does not let up as a suspenseful thriller; nor does it stop with the near clashes between the protagonists, antagonist and police as they all get thrown together on a roller-coaster. The question is ? who wins in the end?The movie is just plain sadistic, and at points like a horror movie. This really is a thriller at its finest and I do recommend it to others.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/? p=10228).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Not so HAppy Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had just finished watching the movie. The ending is not so satisfying for me. Why do most of the story writers don't make happy endings? Jim should be alive too. Since, Johnny Ryder is such an evil man, the couple should have shot him with a gun whenever an opportunity comes in! What's the use of their gun? The police and the villagers were also too narrow-minded to think that Jim and Grace were the suspects! Another annoying scene is the part where the police were chasing the couple, have their own interconnected radios and updating Lt. Estiridge (if I'm not mistaken)about the chase. There's a helicopter / air support following, right? The police manning the helicopter had witnessed everything Mr. Ryder had done with his co-policemen, but still he did not inform immediately the lieutenant until he is shot by Mr. Ryder easily! Nevertheless, the movie is full of suspense and thrill. The actors are very good in portraying emotions like love, fear and pity. But, for me the most effective actor of all is Sean Bean. I'm pretty sure, everybody of us was frightened and mad on his role us the Hitcher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bean shines even in this bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-3/10The Hitcher, a horror slasher movie that is a remake of the 1986 version, but this movie is one that doesn't do anything to make you feel this is done well. Starring Sean Bean in a role he actually takes on well, this movie still fails to ignite genuine thrills and the plot starts to become a little absurd and kind of as if no one actually thought of what was next. Nevertheless this movie is not terrible, but it is a bad one and that contains many reasons.Now if your going to go ahead and make a horror movie and then remake an old one of that, don't do it like this does. The Hitcher becomes a film that's plot is just insane, I mean it doesn't lack it's thrills but still that is what the people behind this seem to want, only big stunts and thrills, no actual real or raw emotion and no thought out story. The movie falls apart mid way through and although still manages to grip you slightly, you do end up watching it in a kind of "I know this is dumb but I'll finish watching" way.Now I said Sean Bean is good and I mean that, in fact the acting grade goes up a slight bit because of him, I mean he is genuinely evil and really gives it his all, he is the star of this and he knows what he is doing. The only real shame is the rest of the main cast who are thrown into a pit of fairly poor acting, Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton are the two main characters here on a road trip, and they really don't add much to this film, both are poor and at times it can seem as if Bean is carrying them a long himself.Now with a movie that is produced by big action crazed Michael Bay, you must expect the most crazy stunts, you know the kind where most would die but not in this. Now the stunts are done well no doubt and some of the settings are really nice, the movie though does nothing to help this and when the stunts come in, it usually becomes a really stupid scene where very little realistic happens.So I guess one of the big questions here is, who would like a movie like this?, well fortunately I can see many will. This is the kind of film where I feel most will know this isn't good but may still enjoy it, I was engaged throughout and even though you can plainly see the holes in it, you can still enjoy what this is(in a sense). I wouldn't recommend this to all though, the movie is a horror but it doesn't have so many scream moments, real jumpy parts, it has some but not enough so this isn't the most traditional of slasher movies.In the end I felt this was worth a watch before I saw, but not after finishing it, the kind of movie that seems kind of an OK watch beforehand but afterwards makes you feel disappointed, but not hateful. Dave Meyers directs this is a way only he can, and only in a way Michael Bay can produce, it's big, loud and scary, but with just a little too much emphasise on the big part. A decent running time(84 minutes) for those who want a quick film maybe on a dark night, it won't keep you up at night and although Sean Bean could haunt your nightmares, he'll probably end up assisted with another terrible cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Bean not quite Rutger Hauer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) is driving college girlfriend Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) to meet her friends. On a rainy night while driving in desolate New Mexico, they almost run over John Ryder (Sean Bean). The couple leaves him behind and there is no phone signal. Ryder catches up to the couple at a gas station and guilts Jim into hitching a ride. Ryder turns out to be a psycho and Jim manages to kick him out. Ryder catches another ride with a young family but Jim crashes the car before they could be warned. As Jim and Grace walk along the road, they run into the family again but they are all stabbed. They try to drive them to the hospital but the family all die. They are arrested by the cops. Ryder comes and kills everybody at the station. Jim and Grace run away. State police Lt. Esteridge (Neal McDonough) comes in to take over the case.The main difference from the original is the girlfriend along for the ride. Sophia Bush is a good addition. Zachary Knighton is not compelling enough. He's just another grungy pretty boy. They need to write a few good jokes for him and give the guy a personality. Sean Bean is a good actor and he has the gruff demeanor. However, he doesn't have the superhuman presence of Rutger Hauer's Ryder. Bean is playing a straight forward psychopath. This movie has fixed a couple of problems from the original but it doesn't have that hyper shock that the original represented. Critics loved to hate the original. The final act makes a switch. It's a good idea because Bush is a better actor and probably a better crier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't tamper with classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically this is a unnecessary rehash of an 86' classic who's plot chooses to stay with the original, only with a couple of neat changes, peppered with uglier gore. The original in it's time was considered overly violent. Gees, how times have changed. Although it's well acted, but not by Zach whoever starring as Jim Halsey, who blatantly brought a amateur performance to the role (he wasn't strong enough) it just goes down that same road. One thing that wholly impressed was the chase sequence. It was wonderfully executed. It's a shame as the surrounding screen time of the movie was all old territory. There are some shocks I loved, one in Halsey's dreams when retiring for a night in a rest stop. If a fan of the original, there's one thing you won't see coming. A nice change/twist. Like the original, this is wonderfully and impressively shot, especially the night shots near the start, where Bean, getting sopping wet, is standing in the middle of the road thumbing it. Of course it doesn't match tour de force photography done by Australia's John Seale in the original, where the location shots were hen pecked. The racey pumped up tune at the start, is something I'd loved to have on a c.d. when driving over to the Yorke. Bean is solid, defines evil on a strong scale, only with Hauer, it was very naturalistic, where as Bean, who is a good actor, shows a lot of try, if as trying to match Rutger's performance, a role he'll never live down. Hottie, Bush as Halsey's girlfriend, Grace is very good and believable, where Mcdonnough as Captain Esteridge shows strong support, although Jeffrey De Munn was better in the role in the original. If a fan of the 86 classic, watch it, but if have never seeing both films, see the original first, PLEASE, before videoing this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scruffy college student Zachary Knighton (as Jim Halsey) and beautiful girlfriend Sophia Bush (as Grace Andrews) are driving off for spring break when they almost hit hitch-hiking Sean Bean (as John Ryder) during a rainstorm. They decide to give the unscratched psycho a ride, with tragic results. This re-make of "The Hitcher" (1986) is a good, fast-moving gore ride. But the original has much more going on beneath the surface, both real and imagined. This is much more standard stuff, though supporting lieutenant Neal McDonough (as Esteridge) is quirky enough. Some important re-created scenes show less is more; one is most obvious. You really should take a ride with the original "Hitcher" before getting in the car with this one.***** The Hitcher (1/19/07) Dave Meyers ~ Sophia Bush, Zachary Knighton, Sean Bean, Neal McDonough</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they change it a lot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching "The Hitcher" 2007 and I truly think that it was not a very good job. Comparing to the original "The Hitcher", this one has a lot of different things. What's with them horrible songs? What's with the girlfriend? The original didn't even have a woman! They should have stayed truly to the original. Jim would find a girl at the diner, not bring with him. And what Lt. Esteridge is that? And the hitcher? We can't compare Sean Bean to Rutger Hauer. The movie isn't bad, it just should not be called a remake. It should be called "The Hitcher 3". That's my opinion. It sucked as a remake, but it wasn't that bad as a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could have been a lot better if there weren't so many what in the hell moments. I understand that it's a movie and I need to suspend my disbelief but some of it was just to much. Seriously the cops in this must have been the dumbest on the planet. Also our main characters make some very stupid decisions. I mean I guess if they made good decisions they wouldn't have picked up a hitchhiker in the first place, but running away from the cops even though the evidence will show you didn't kill the people. The soundtrack also didn't fit in a couple spots either. One thing that deserves credit is the acting was actually pretty good. Usually horror movies are not packed with actors that make you go wow, but this one was actually very respectable. Overall the movie isn't anything great but it a lot better then some. http://moviegrabbag.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as the title says, this was a good horror movie overall, because of the gore and how it made me jump a lot. The actors were very good, very real, and you can kind of sense how they felt in the movie. It also makes you jump a lot, I call it "Jumpy Scary." Had no story, what I believe this movie to be is Sean Bean, or "The Hitcher" hitching rides and killing people on the way. That's the whole plot, just him doing that. One couple happens to get in the way of him and escapes his grasp a couple of times. I usually comment on movies or games with very well done story lines, but this movie doesn't fulfill that goal, which made it an average movie, but definitely not one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mistook this movie for a cheap low/mid budget remake of a classic, but was horribly wrong. Bean suspends what makes him such a great villain in this film. The sequence of plot was firm and unrelenting, the pace of thrill is astounding, and the emotion of the characters is realistic.Despite the character background definition this is a film you can watch without guessing the next outcome. Thus, it's lack of predictability will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen in the continuing scene.From beginning to end, this is what many would expect from a suspense/horror film.

The teenagers in this are pretty crappy actors IMHO, its rare to see these days, actors portray real terror and fear. The last movie I saw that had that was wolf creek, I thought the guys in Hostel were pretty good too. These guys don't look very scared, surely they can act better than that! Anyway, I was hoping for a lot more from this movie, I wish they let it rest in piece in its original form, I will have to search for it now and watch Rutger at his finest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitching a ride on the back of a cult classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few remakes of old and beloved horror films succeed in winning over the old guard. They sometimes gain some fans from the younger sphere where those not familiar with the old version dwell, but with one or two odd exceptions, they rarely make a hit with the horror faithful even if they make money at the box office. The Hitcher, a remake of the 1986 Rutger Hauer starring film, is another in a sad line of poor horror remakes. Which is a shame because the casting of Sean Bean in the psychopathic hitcher role looked a decent one and we were promised a new take on the story. Sadly the makers have stripped away exactly what made the original film work so well.Gone is the loneliness of a single driver and the rising of terror and confusion that he faced, in place is a sexy courting couple (Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton) taking on the un-charismatic-by-the-numbers hitcher of the title. It rarely feels like the suspense laden movie it should have been, it's more a picture dominated by yawn inducing passages of knowing what will happen next. Logic and momentum are in short supply, as is the ambiguity so strong in the original, while the final confrontation between good and evil is far too short. Without doubt some of the action and deaths are well executed by director Dave Meyers and his team, there's enough visually to keep this from total damnation in stinkerville. While Bush's heroine shows some resourceful spunk when the unoriginal screenplay allows her to. But really all this film achieves is in making us rue remakes even more. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never heard of anyone who can shoot down a helicopter with one bullet. That being said, most of the crazy stuff John Ryder does is also physically impossible. He has that serial killer teleporting ability down as well. The entire plot is kind of silly. Two teenagers pick up a psychopath on the side the road. He tries to kill them, (surprise!) and they some how manage to escape. The psycho goes on to kill just about every person these two come in contact with, including the police. The amount of special effects in this movie is staggering, as they probably spent over half their budget on fake explosions. Then, you have those characters. The male teenager is pretty much there to die, and the girl is just there to look helpless while screaming and running away. Your typical horror movie set up. At first, I sort of admired John Ryder and his "Chuck Norris"-like way of killing everyone around him using very little weaponry and effort. However, the movie's climax was a great disappointment to his character development. He practically orders the teenage girl to kill him. Why he didn't just off her like the rest is still a mystery. Overall, I wouldn't waste my time seeing this movie. Although, I have never seen the original, anything would be better than this pile of garbage.</fullReview>

Many times the main characters make serious blunders that normal humans would not make and makes the entire film a farce.The only upside is that the plucky girl Sophia is quite attractive.The gore isn't too strong until one moment in the film, where something quite horrific happens.

		<shortDescription>Utterly preposterous, but you can still squeeze some fun out of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty ridiculous and riddled with mistakes. John Ryder, the hitcher, manages to get into places and do stuff that no normal person would ever be able to do, and the movie never explains how (it wouldn't have wasted time to give a brief explanation, either; at 84 minutes this movie isn't exactly pushing the clock to its limits). Also the two main characters are pretty dumb (who actually lets a guy into their car??) and a bit unlikeable. But I blame bad acting on that last complaint.Speaking of acting, this is a great time to lodge a serious question. First off, one of the hardest things for an actor to do is to whimper and cry and pull it off without making everyone laugh at it. So why is it that horror movies, which represent probably the lowest-budget genre of film-making, require the most whimpering and crying out of what is probably cinema's lowest crust of actors and actresses? From this question, you can obviously tell that Grace (Sophia Bush) and Jim (Zachary Knighton) looked really pathetic in each scene they were meant to cry.The directing was lackluster; everyone seemed on board for the money, not the film itself. Only Sean Bean seemed to be having any real fun. This is where the entertainment comes in. While it is true that Bean has an unfair advantage over the other actors, mostly because his role as a cool and smarmy bad guy is a simple one to play, he really shows off the greatest talent in the entire production. The only scenes that are truly intriguing are the ones with him in them. He really convinces us that John Ryder is crazy, even though the screenplay doesn't do much to make his job any easier.I watched this movie at a party with lots of friends. This was probably the best place to watch it. If horror movies are scary, watch them alone. But if horror movies are preposterous and unscary, like this one, watch them with a big group of people and laugh at all the ridiculous parts. That's what we did. We also enjoyed the gore, and we managed to have fun watching the movie, despite its many shortcomings.Bottomline: don't go out of your way to watch this movie. But if it ever comes to you, and if you can't think of a better way to spend your time, hustle up a few buddies and watch this film. Who knows? You may be mildly entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Hollywood decides to remake another horror/cult movie from the 80's. This time it's The Hitcher. The original wasn't a classic, but a lean stripped down action thriller. It did what it wanted well, the action was good, and the performances of C. Thomas Howell, and especially Rutger Hauer as the hitcher were spot-on.This remake stars Sean Bean in the title role, but frankly he looks bored all the way through. HOWEVER, he's by far the best thing about this movie. First off in the original the Jim character is on his own, and picks up the hitcher as much for the company as anything else. Here, they've decided to make it a couple who pick him up. Why? The only reasons for this as far as I can make out, are so they can have a scene where the girl blames the boyfriend for all the trouble they are in. The second reason as far as I can tell, speaks volumes for the attitude of film-makers in Hollywood. They've obviously decided that a male character can't fight evil or bad guys in movies like this on their own. They need a female character instead. Why? The original got on fine without a lead female character. Males must have been tougher in the 80's than now...Speaking of which, the 2 other actors Sophia Bush and Zachory Knighton try their best but sadly are let down by the script for one, but their own performances aren't great. Bush looks like she's having a bad make-up day as opposed to being chased by a killer. Knighton isn't much better. As for the rest of the cast, frankly they're wasted.To be fair, the action scenes for the most part aren't bad, though a killer shooting cops in a police station? You would think you'd hear gunshots wouldn't you??What annoys me most was the point I was making at the start. There is absolutely nothing here that wasn't done better in the original. so what we're left with is another pointless remake to go along side : The Omen, The Fog (rubbish), When A Stranger Calls (don't get me started), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (terrible), The Amityville Horror (ok), Black Christmas (which at least was enjoyable), Dawn Of The Dead (again enjoyable), The Hills Have Eyes, The Haunting (worse than When A Stranger Calls!).. and of course there were the awful remakes of Ringu, The Wicker Man and The Grudge. Still to come this year, Halloween (why?). I've heard one of my favorite horrors, Argento's Suspiria is also up for a remake.THIS HAS GOT TO STOP! Surely there is enough talent in the current horror genre for producers to come up with something original, than simply remaking horrors from the past. I'd rather watch something disappointing, that at least tried to be original than have to suffer yet more remakes. What next: The Exorcist? The Shining? Evil Dead? It can bring sleepless nights.......If all Hollywood has to offer is remaking old movies like this, then it shows a shocking lack of imagination in the production companies and studios. If Britain can make movies like 28 Weeks Later and Korea movies like The Host, or Spain with Pan's Labyrinth surely someone in Hollywood can come up with something different. Sadly though, we're more likely to get these movies remade in English.. well apart from 28 Weeks Later obviously.Sorry, rant over.As far as this remake goes. If you've seen the original, there is nothing new here. If you've not, then find it. It's better than stopping for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is on a Highway to Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood is starting to seem pretty damn desperate with its horror movies, it seems to do one of two things, make an extremely nasty torture movie designed to sicken, but not scare, or to re-make a classic horror movie and add lots more gore, more skimpy clothing, and just wreck the entire memory of that classic movie. While the gorier option of torture movies might not be the best movies ever at least they are original stories that are entertaining. The Saw series and Hostel are good movies, flawed, and certainly not scary, but pretty good movies. However re-makes of horror movies are generally shoddy in comparison. This has been proved with the likes of The Amtylville Horror, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and last years pitiful attempt at remaking The Wicker Man. The Hitcher is another movie that can be safely added to that list. While The Hitcher has its brief moments, and a great lead in the driving seat, the movie itself is just too full of un-scary clichés and a certain lack of anything memorable. I have never seen the original Hitcher, I understand its a movie some people adore, and others can't see the huge fuss over. However, I'm pretty sure the movie cannot be as bad as this movie. The movie just isn't scary, it has its share of jump sequences, but a jump sequence without anything to fall back on is a scene designed to give a brief jolt, not to truly unsettle them. The story itself is predictable, the lead characters (with the exception of the protagonist) lame and annoying, and the whole scenario so ludicrous by the end that you no longer care. It also has an amazing feat of still feeling oddly long and tiresome at a brief length of 80 minutes! So let me first go on about the cast. Firstly I'll talk about the one good cast member of this movie, Sean Bean. Quite why Bean read the script and accepted it is beyond me, he's clearly the most talented actor in the movie, and he's clearly out of place. He's simply too good for this movie. Thankfully though he does make the character interesting, he doesn't have a lot of screen time really, yet in his brief screen time he makes an effective bad guy. Later scenes, where we see the layers of his insanity begin to peel makes you honestly think about the character. Bean does a good job here, he shouldn't be in this movie, he should be in the better written Hitcher remake with a cast that comes off as passable, unfortunately he appears to have walked onto the wrong set. And so it leads me to the other cast members, well he lead cast members. Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton. So were they any good? No, not even remotely. Knighton appears to be making an effort, despite the fact he's not talented in the least bit. But he seems to try and make some scenes tolerable when the pair are alone, he also gets to be in the movies one memorable scene towards the end of the film. But Sophia Bush is just horrible, her character development is unbelievably cheesy and poorly done, her dialogue is even worse, and her delivery is just abysmal. She clearly isn't making an effort and the writers obviously didn't with her either. She's essentially eye candy, and my thoughts were proved correct by the time she got to have a brief scene in skimpy underwear only to pull on a ridiculously small mini-skirt. No other cast members are even worth considering, the rest might as well have all been extras, their performances aren't even remotely memorable.So what of the actual scares of the movie? As I mentioned there isn't any really, its a horror movie without any real horror. It seems to think its gory yet it really isn't, not one scene really makes you wince at all, and quite why it got the 18 rating originally amazes me, either the scenes they cut were really horrible, or the people who rated it were drunk. The movie does have a fair share of jump scares, yet most occur only through raised music or someone randomly grabbing another persons in some place. The most pitiful involves a car and a cliff, its so random and so ludicrous its unreal. Matters aren't helped by the fact its never explained and the film simply forgets about it, leaving me to believe it was a jump scene for the sake of a jump scene. The movie just isn't a horror movie, its basically an action movie devoid of exciting action for the majority of the movie. Only one sequence in the final third of the movie gets the pulse rating, the rest is just a poor mans attempt at making a horror/action.Overall The Hitcher is a movie with a good idea at the centre of it all, and a good chief villain. But no one else seemed to bother with the movie and its clearly been made just to make as much money as possible. Cheap shocks aplenty for those who want them, but for people who have seen better horror movies this will seem an insult. Its not the worst movie ever made, its just a pretty poor one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original 1986 Hitcher back when I was 10 years old. I was shocked, stunned, thrilled, and left speechless. That film ended up on my Top 10 horror films, and I would recommend it to anyone who even bothers to watch old films.Now, comes the hard part.The sad thing is, I don't usually write bad movie reviews. But here it is. DISAPPOINTING. VERY DISAPPOINTING. It turns out producer Michael Bay is better at directing action movies than producing these stereotypic horror remakes. These type of people took something old and unforgettable and then throws CGI at it just to fit in with today's viewers. Then again, it does have its moments.The acting is okay, the action scenes quite over the top and the gore can make you cringe, but it's the writing that I'm complaining about. It seems that original Hitcher writer Eric Red wasn't noticing that his co-writer Jake Wade Wall (from another mediocre thriller remake "When A Stranger Calls (2006)") was butchering his own script. The teen love story in between parts took away the suspense that was in the original film. And they made the killer a bit more human, instead of merciless like what was in the original. Still, I think the villain's casting was the only good thing about this movie - Sean Bean (probably best know for playing James Bond's nemesis in the 1995 film "GoldenEye") was actually good at playing Ryder, but it seems that this kind of roles are getting much too stereotypic for him. I would very much prefer the original's Rutger Hauer to come back as John Ryder. The writers also have a knack for switching the protagonists' roles near the end. At first, I thought Halsey was the protagonist again like in the first. Instead, he gets killed off near the end, and the protagonist role goes to his annoying but hot girlfriend Grace (played by "One Tree Hill" and "John Tucker Must Die"'s Sophia Bush) who does nothing but scream the first half, scream some more, and finally, becomes the ultimate female warrior at the end.Once again, like most Hollywood films nowadays, if you want brainless fun and entertainment, or if you like a mix of horror and action, you should take a look at this. For the people who even bother to see the original, my advice is: try to avoid this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of potential left by the side of the road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There is one minor spoiler in this review)Nothing can or will prepare you for the inanity of the choices made by the script writers with regards to this movie.With the exception of a the girl gets dressed in car cliché in the first five minutes; the first half of this movie is a well constructed piece of entertainment that delivers on every level. The two protagonists carry the narrative in a highly believable execution, whilst Dave Meyers demonstrates his pedigree as one of music promos most prolific visualists.At this point the film takes a wrong turn...*spolier*After the two teens are in police custody...*spolier end*...the movie drives towards the ridiculous. Instead of delivering on the common sense of the audience and building tension from there; the two protagonists are joined in making some stupendously dumb decisions as we are taken on a hellish ride in 'suspension of disbelief' by the backseat drivers know as... the writers. Instead of pulling us further into the drama, the writers force the two protagonists through a series of events which only serve to pull you further from the narrative that until now has been deeply engaging.This blitzkrieg of errors in writing, results in movie goers leaving the theatre wondering if it was worth the drive to the cinema, whilst possibly contemplating how much fun it might be to have Sean Bean kill them in their cars as they return home, as not to endure the memories of such a poor movie going experience.Writing aside, Sean Bean is perfect casting. The direction is aptly handled within the confines of a blundered script. The visuals are as endearing as any top spec music promo and there are a few good set-pieces to take note of despite the mouth watering suggestion of a possibly gory cut.The original was no Dodge Charger but comparatively... leaves this one as road kill.PS. Mr Meyers, if i were a man of money i would give you the cash to fix the latter half of the film, as i think this was a diamond lost in the rough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequential Suspenseful Actions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Dave Meyers introduced this thriller cum action movie with great suspension from its trailer alone that grips you at your own seat. Nah, not really! The trailer wasn't that appealing to me prior to watching the REAL thing. In fact, I'd thought it would probably end up something like Highwaymen in which there was a leak somewhere, I suppose in the plot of that movie.Introducing Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton alongside Sean Bean (Boromir in LOTR for most of you), the movie is nothing like what the trailer would realistically imply on you. Don't live and leave with the trailer, go watch the real thing! It's definitely way better a horror/thriller, IMHO, compared to any other highway movies that I can think of.Taglined never pick up strangers Grace and Jim (both collegiates on spring break) planned for a vacation in ermm... I can't remember the name of the island, but from the sound of it, it sounds like fun, and furthermore, it's near a lake or was it a beach? Not much of an emphasis placed on their destination, while along the way there, they met with a near-death encounter on the interstate highway. The sceneries blend in well to create an atmosphere of fear with heavy pouring rain, a car that seemingly might get flooded from the look at its age, slippery road condition, and darkness (yeap, bad things seem to happen every time @ night). Oh well, but anywayz, a guy (Sean Bean) who later introduced himself as John Ryder was trying to hitch-hike after his car broke down in the middle of nowhere and with the above condition blending in. Creepy, girls are useful mind readers at this particular time, and this movie alone proves all of that. She senses that this Ryder guy was eccentric even from the first place, wheares the guy, whom as kind as he want to be, was more than ever willing to help this guy by picking him up. The first time, he listened to his girlfriend and drove off (with difficulty - hence suspension came in; go watch the movie and you will know what it is). The second time however (somehow when a serial killer targets you, they never leave you alone, they will always be there tagging you everywhere you go, knowing your every move and sensing your every single time), Jim who was alone was persuaded (more like instinctual) to pick him up from the gas station (Ryder found a Biggy to get him there from where his car had stopped) and they met up at the station again.The storyline then continued from there, with Sean Bean (Ryder) being the, well of course, the serial killer who kills for the sake of killing and feeling high. There's probably something cynical about him anywayz in the first place, as he mentioned - Never mind, I wouldn't pick me up anywayz to Jim when he apologized in the gas station for stepping the pedal after stopping. There's plenty more of killings and shootings (but not as professional as compared to the Shooter movie), done in such a gory manner with blood splashing everywhere, from the throat, from the mouth, from the head and well just everywhere, depending on where the site of incision is in the first place =P. Okay... but the gore and the sudden appearance of the killer, his hands, his legs or whatever; is just enough to scare the guts out of you. In fact, I had quite a number of 'jump-from-the-seat' events during this movie, probably because I was too relaxed, maybe that's why (yeah, trying to create an excuse for being scared, hehe...).Though the plot is meager for highly esteemed critics, it has enough to prove its thriller objective. It's good enough to thrill, I mean... there's nothing more one can expect, other than this guy who would never stop tagging his targets until they're dead. Somehow with many purposefully slip occasions by the killer on his victims, it kinda reminds me of a movie in which the killer prefers their victims to come hot on the plate... struggling, running, crying, begging, filling with fear and some sorts, it kinda buffs off some of the viewers - in fact, a middle aged couple sitting next to me kept talking throughout the movie on why the heck the girl didn't shoot the chain, when the killer will come out, what will happen next; all of which never seemed to happen, and yes! They bugged me!! Ahahaha... but I was a good boy, I just kept quiet and watched my movie =P This movie got me glued to the screens for as long as it lasted as you just can't wait to get to the ending.Not spoiling the storyline further, I suggest you go for this movie - which you would never be short of jumping out of your seats (watch it alone), or short of running those pulse (when you aren't exercising).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the cinema expecting some crap horror movie. After I watched the movie I kind of like it. Although the horror part need some improvement. It's not really scary. More like an adventure/action flick. The jump scenes are predictable but there are plenty of it. If you seen enough horror movies, you'll most likely to know what happen next.OK here is how the story goes, two teens pick up a stranger and then bad things happen. They later finds out he is a psycho who kills. So the teens run from him and the police (You'll know why if you watch the movie).A simple movie. Simple story. Simple script. Sean Bean plays the Hitcher. He really looks like a killer! Cool camera movement. Love the songs. The way they put the scenes and the song together is really good. I love the way they use the song Closer by Nine Inch Nails in one of the chase scenes.If you enjoyed the Texas Chainsaw Remake, you'll love this. If you want to have fun and/or kill some time this is a good one. I haven't seen the original one but I think checking it out will be good. As they always say, Original are the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original, nor do I intend to, so I can't comment on how sacrilegious it was to remake such a "classic" nor how wonderfully fresh and invigorating the new take on the story might be. I suspect it's neither. I saw it because I like Sean Bean. And I still like him, although I'd rather he didn't appear in a movie like this again.Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't bad. It's entertaining, fast paced, and about the right length (short). The action gets your attention and the effects are good enough. Yes, some parts are predictable, but I thought the story itself believable (well, in a horror film sort of way). Some reviewers have pointed out the dimwittedness of the protagonists. I didn't think so. What do you do when you think the cops not only don't believe you, but can't protect you from the real killer? Some reviewers thought Ryder should have finished Grace off when he had her in the motel. Obviously he didn't want to; it wasn't part of his game. Others thought the ending was unsatisfying. I thought it was sad. Here Ryder had invested something of himself in trying to get Grace to understand him, at the very end he even gives her his life, and still fails. Grace loses her boyfriend in a traumatic event that will probably ruin the rest of her life. The rest of the cast is dead, even the bunny. Everyone loses. Perhaps it's not so much a horror flick as a tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Htcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes you wonder what's the point. The Hitcher is a remake of sorts of a 1986 movie of the same name, where you have a deranged hitchhiker trolling around a highway, taking on innocent, good Samaritans who offer him a lift, and sending them to the light at the end of the tunnel. Perhaps for newbie director Dave Meyers, whose filmography contains only music video productions, it seemed like a safe enough choice to make his first narrative film, a remake, and one riding on the coattails of the recent popular horror-thriller genre.Sean Bean takes over from Rutger Hauer (from the original) as the psychotic John Ryder, an anonymous man hell bent on stalking teenage couple Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) and Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush), after a near miss incident and their refusal to assist him, probably pushed some wrong buttons. It's a Jeepers Creepers and Wolf Creek combined type of movie, with the relentless pursuit along the highways of New Mexico on vehicles, as well as on foot.The morale of the story is to never pick up strangers, even if they look harmless, as you'll never know when something inside them will snap, and they go all ballistic. The Hitcher turns out to be rather mixed, flipping between wanting to build genuine tension, to forgoing it all for the more direct in your face methods. Filled with enough stunts, explosions and gun fights to satisfy its target demographics, these do tire out after a while, especially when the story seemed to plod on with its recycled plot elements.It's pretty gory and bloody, but none that veterans of the Saw franchise or of other movies in the same genre never saw before. In fact you might find it quite tame, if not for some crucial scenes near the end. If anything, this movie celebrates the return of the strong feminine action character type, with Grace totally calling the shots with her street smarts, guts and decisiveness, as compared to her whiny boyfriend.Sean Bean looks the part, but could have been more menacing. And this movie, could have not been made in the first place. Watch this only if you have time to fill in between movies, or rent it at most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the remake argument again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole argument of the remake will never end. Constantly splitting people, sticking to their guns on which one rises above the other. The remake has always troubled ground to cross. Reshoot the original frame by frame ala Gus Van Sant's Psycho, and labelled uncreative. Film maker plays around to much and ruin what made the original so special to its devotees. The remake does have its place, a film maker re-envisioning/ modernising to a contemporary time; Jonathan Demme's The Manchurian Candidate, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, or to less extent, the at odds with itself The Stepford Wivies. The remake may even successfully bridge the cultural gap; The Departed. The 1986 version of The Hitcher, has risen as a go-to film for psychological highway miss-adventure; not the greatest film on celluloid but holds a certain panache with a memorable performance by Rutger Hauer. The Hitcher doesn't stray far from the original source, creative licence kept minimal, as Jim Halsey and his girlfriend Grace Andrews are terrorised but miscreant hitcher John Ryder and his disturbing vices. Point by point analysis of whats changed, what remained is best left muted to take this on its own merits. Yet remake or not, The Hitcher aims for a suspenseful time, though the cross-hairs are not on the bulls eye. The opening scene easily wraps the entire film in a nut shell. A psychological edge resides in The Hitcher, an over leaning towards shock tactics and unabashed violence, stop what could have reached psychological terror rests more on highway shenanigans. Times arise when suspenseful moments are about to grab for the jugular, yet an over reliance on loud sound effects dip the intensity.Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton aren't the most commanding leads; more of two damsels in distress than a terrorised couple, though give it their all, more so on the big center piece. Sean Bean as the crazed Ryder holds a commanding presence, relying just to much on his gruffing voice for chills. An ill picked soundtrack works against the mood; Nine Inch Nails would seem like an appropriate pick but sounds misplaced, and the ending note on a Gomez song wraps things up wrong; director Dave Meyers work in music videos seeping through.There are elements to admire in The Hitcher, and it's made with gusto, the level of terror The Hitcher is aiming for is just out of its reach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competent remake fails to add anything to the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but provides a reasonably entertaining waste of an hour and a half. I just caught this one second run, after reading the initial lukewarm response of IMDb mavens. I don't think it merits quite as poorly as it currently does (hovering around a 5), but given the choice, I'd watch the original again over this one. As I said, it's competent enough, with capable helmsmanship by Dave "I'm a heck of a music video director" Meyers, some very nice cinematography by James "I do music videos, too!" Hawkinson, and a decent score by Steve "TCM2003" Jablonsky, along with more than adequate editing, production design, art direction, special effects, and so on and so forth. Unfortunately, newbie screenwriter Jake Wade "When a Stranger Calls" Wall isn't up to amplifying or even preserving the spookiness of Eric Red's source material, and Sean "Lord of the Rings" Bean, though scary enough, can't quite match Rutger Hauer's classic unsettling performance. The two young leads, Sophia "One Tree Hill" Bush and Zachary "Life on a Stick" Knighton, are able and willing, but simply not as memorable as C. Thomas Howell and Jennifer Jason Leigh in the original. And, damn it, I missed the french finger scene! Worth a video rental, certainly, especially if you've never seen the original, because then you'll have the pleasure of seeing the original with eyes that understand why some remakes aren't worth the bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs More Sean Bean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher has an interesting premise, kids pick up hitcher, hitcher goes crazy and stalks kids framing them for one murder after another, but it falls very short of being a film, or even of being a decent movie. Sean Bean as the hitcher is great and terrifying but his character lacks. Sophia Bush and Zack Knighton as the kids are okay, but they probably two of the dumbest screen characters ever thought up. They have countless chances to blow the hitcher's head off but they don't even fire out a shot. At one point Bush's character has the hitcher trying to break through a door and with a gun in her hand she says, "I have a gun." Why not shoot him? That is the problem with this movie, it doesn't realize it's stupidity in some parts. Also there is way too much music attached to scenes rather than just a heart-pounding score from the film's composer Steve Jablonsky. It's hard to get scared in a horror movie when artists like All-American Rejects and Nine Inch Nails are playing. I say wait till the DVD to rent it, but Sean Bean is still good and he highlights the freeway chase and the grand finale, which are probably the most satisfying points of the film. 1.5/4</fullReview>

It's not even terrible but after a promising beginning the plot doesn't prove solid enough, in spite of a good cast(including Neal McDonough as a state trooper) and despite a decent script.

		<shortDescription>Inferior remake of a classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher was surely one of the most outstanding thrillers of the eighties, and so it's unsurprising that the unimaginative "powers that be" took it upon themselves to give the film an inferior remake. I'm not really sure why they decided to remake this film, however, as they could just have easily made a road thriller with a different name and only similar goings on, and not called it a remake. The original Hitcher certainly wasn't the first film about a demented hitchhiker, and this remake certainly won't be the last; and had this film not been a remake, it would most probably have garnered more respect from horror fans. The plot here is the same basic idea as the superior 1986 film, except this time, instead of having a young man travel on his own, we have a young couple - Jim Halsey and Grace Andrews. They bump into the sinister John Ryder on the way to their destination and end up having to give him a lift. It's not long before the couple realise their mistake and after luckily getting rid of him; they find themselves being pursued by the demented hitchhiker...Music video director Dave Meyers seems keen to get to the point as quickly as possible and what we end up with is basically a 'lite' version of the original, as most of the key sequences are intact but there's not much linkage between them, and this ensures that the film ends up feeling disjointed and rushed. Sean Bean takes the role of the disgruntled hitchhiker and he's certainly no Rutger Hauer, although I did like him in this more than I've liked him in previous films. TV stars Zachary Knighton and Sophia Bush are the unlucky young couple, and neither impresses with their acting skills. The film does just about manage to stay interesting for most of the duration; although it only runs at seventy five minutes so it would be difficult for it not to. There's a couple of good action sequences; the best being one that sees Sean Bean take out a bunch of police cars and a helicopter - though it is spoiled by the inclusion of Nine Inch Nails' "Closer" which, while undoubtedly a good song, doesn't fit this scene at all and makes me wonder what the director was thinking. Overall, this is entertaining enough, but you'll be severely disappointed if you go in expecting anything other than a hollow thriller.</fullReview>

OK, sure, its not perfect. it has flaws like any other remake has. and hard-headed people who are faithful to the originals basically walk into theaters of remakes with expectations waaay too high and a negative attitude about them from the start.I personally wanted to see the remake of this film first rather than the original for that such reason. I find this movie to be quite entertaining and actually worth the $7.50 i spent at the theater. I personally love sean bean and he plays the part of the john ryder with flying colors. his presence on the screen just gives you goosebumps. or maybe it was just cold in the theater.the action isn't bad either. great car chases, a few suspenseful moments, and an ass-kicking sophia bush. her presence on screen is captivating, both because of her acting and beauty. watching her relationship with the character Jim makes you sort of feel like you are with them in the horror and pain they are going through, instead of the excitement and love of a teen couple just trying to make it home over spring break.all in all, the film is what it says.. thrilling and full of action. people unfamiliar to the original, like myself, i'm sure will find it pretty entertaining. all you old farts who HAVE seen the original, give it a chance. or maybe not. you'll just get angry.</fullReview>

But then they had to face all the bad luck that could have fallen down upon them. It was just horrifying to see what they had to go through. If you look back at the part where the boy was ripped apart, it's just a scene that scared me out. I really started to hate the psycho killer who calls himself John Ryder, and I'm glad Grace killed him with a shotgun :) Go watch this movie, if you are getting interested by this comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie producers must not give Eric Red, Jake Wade Wall and Eric Bernt another screenplay writing assignment after coming out with a very senseless story like THE HITCHER. This is one of the the most stupid and dumbest movie in Hollywood.Why did the producers consent in making this movie?How about the director? Where are his senses while making this movie?Didn't Dave Meyers, director made some post-reviewing on this before it was released for public viewing? They will just be branded creators of garbage movies.Please confine them to watch shows on the reality TV so they may acquire a grasp on how not to make a bunch of the most stupid and dumbest characters in a story.The only wise defense Sophia Bush can make is say "I'M JUST AN ACTRESS. JUST DID WHAT I HAVE TO DO AFTER ACCEPTING THE MOVIE OFFER." The only good thing in this movie is the sound department.In conclusion, moviegoers must be given rebates for exposing them in a trash like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised with the low rating here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My cable net provider had this movie on server since last six months but i did not download it because of the low rating by the users. I am shocked after watching this film that how can you do in justice to such a decent movie. Not amazing in terms of suspense but still very good movie. acting was good enough. Sean Bean was good as ever. You may pick up the hidden scenes forthcoming but this film is much better than other suspense movies like grim reaper. It would be better if they could show some background of John Ryder because he suddenly appears in the film with no special background covering. I like the way they tried to make the stuff real. It doesn't look far from reality in most of the scenes which makes it a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will I Make It To The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write this as I am actually watching this movie and wonder if I'll make it through this travesty till the end.To those who say it's unfair to compare this appalling remake to the original I'd say that a movie made on the back of a classic deserves to be compared particularly when the directing, acting, cinematography and music score has been pretty much scanned from the original.Yet it is still a poor copy.The original had a dreamlike atmosphere about it from the beginning to the end which was added to by the haunting character portrayed by Rutger Hauer and the original Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) who equally played someone expecting to wake up from a nightmare.This movie had no soul, no character development and most importantly because the Hitcher was now dealing with a couple there was no longer a one-on-one relationship between the Hitcher and his victim which was so vital to the original successful formula. Not to mention the 'girl power' element to the movie which was an epic fail in this epic fail of a movie.As much as I admire Sean Bean, the character of John Ryder is simply owned by Rutger Hauer giving Sean two choices; either play John Ryder, or play Rutger Hauer's interpretation of John Ryder. Either way Sean was on a hiding to nothing. As the credits roll the only thing I can say in conclusion is that despite having watched the original 1986 Hitcher countless times, the chances of me watching it again are 100% whereas despite having watched the 2007 Hitcher for the first time, the chances of me watching it again are 0.And yes, I did make it through to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Hitcher film was a nice little understated horror flick. There is nothing understated about this brain dead remake, Sean Bean (usually a very capable actor) has his talents wasted as John Ryder (a role that Rutger Hauer made his own in the original). The two protagonists are so borderline mentally retarded that it's very hard to root for either of them to escape the absurd perils that the hitcher puts them in, and the plot is utterly awful. Racking my brain to find something ANYthing at all to say positive about this waste of money, I can only tell you that it's still better then the Jake Busey-helmed crap-fest that was "Hitcher 2" My grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was entertained to some degree, until a certain scene in the movie annoyed me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline was almost identical to the Rutger Hauer classic. It was this that kept me going to the end. Ah the end, how it annoyed me with it's politically correct nonsense. Why say that you might ask?. Well I say it because of the two trucks pulling the guy apart death scene towards the end of the movie. Now it was a woman in the original that got tied to the trucks, if my mind serves me correct.The reason why it wasn't the woman was because they were too scared to mistreat the female characters in the same way the men get treated (watch the movie to see what sex gets it worse). This is why we see a guy being pulled apart instead, as it would be oh so wrong for it to happen to a woman wouldn't it!.No wonder I am loosing faith in the horror scene of late. It is too PC for it's own good!. If a character is in a horror movie, regardless of what sex they are, they should all be subjected to the fate the others in the movie have if the story so requires it. Not re-write it to suit the feminist minded crowd. In the original Hitcher, the writers didn't care who got killed, as they set out to make a horror/thriller. And this is why it will always be the better choice of the two. How I long for those days again where we can watch a movie and take a wild stab (wild guess) at who's going to survive and who's not and actually be wrong, for once!.Another remake that disappoints. Maybe one day I will see a remake worthy of the title it is trying to cash in on!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miles better than the original in my opinion....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Hitcher' was, and lets be honest here, pretty corny and annoying. C Thomas Howells performance was irritating and left you feeling like he deserved everything he got. Rutger Hauer was passable but a bit too hammy.This new version cuts all that out. From the opening 'roadkill' scene to the final shot, the movie does not let up in terms of tension and action. The chase scenes are superbly choreographed and each one is more thrilling than the last (though why they choose to put Nine Inch Nails 'closer' as the music during the big chase is beyond me. Have you heard the lyrics?). Sean Bean is understated in his portrayal of the manic hitcher. He has been doing quite a few horror movie/bad guy parts of late (Silent Hill, The Island) but this is easily one of his better performances. Sophia Bush plays essentially the same character from One Tree Hill, but then thats exactly what shes meant to play. Her 'final girl' transformation at the end is very satisfying considering what her character goes through. And as for the infamous truck scene....well, its there. You know its coming and though its not overly graphic, it does make you want to look away. In fact that whole scene had me biting my nails in, for want of a better word, anticipation. Very well directed.All in all, a very pleasing and surprising movie. I went in expecting very little but was rewarded with 80+ minutes of tension and excitement. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good one! Please take note that this review has been written by one that hasn't seen the original, so mine may not even count, but whatever.What a thrilling ride that was... From the very start, you felt out of place, in suspense, and likely had hairs standing up your arms and neck, and it never let up. There were TONS of scenes that made you want to just look next to you and scream at the top of your lungs. There was even a little emotional moment of sadness and sorrow in there. (Those of you that have seen it, I'm talking about that three/four-member family that the Hitcher gets hold of.) So, if you want something scary, but with more thrills and chills, rather than blunt horror, blood, or gore, this is the choice for you. An excellent movie. I won't be forgetting this one any time soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thumbs down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer Michael Bay continues to cash in on classic horror films by enlisting music video director Dave Meyers to helm this unnecessary and retarded retread of The Hitcher. The original movie, which starred Rutger Hauer as a hitch-hiking psycho who murdered those kind enough to offer him a lift, was an understated, yet very effective shocker that succeeded thanks to a great script, excellent cinematography and subtle performances. Meyers version, however, is aimed squarely at a teen demographic, and, as such, does away with all that made the first film such a great experience.From the opening scene, in which a poorly rendered CGI rabbit is crushed under the wheels of a truck, it becomes blatantly obvious that this is going to be another Michael Bay 'by-the-numbers' production, with little in the way of originality or style. Instead, we get flashy visuals, jump scares, gore, an easy-on-the-eye cast, and the occasional pop/rock song to accompany the action?perfect fodder for today's undemanding kids.In the original film, the killer, John Ryder, thumbs a lift with loner Jim Halsey, and, after threatening to kill him, tells the terrified driver that what he wants is for Jim to try and stop him. The result is a tense game of cat-and-mouse in which there can only be one survivor. Ryder's perverse relationship with poor Jim is the driving force of the film, and, even though Jim gets assistance from a friendly waitress, in the end it all boils down to a stand off between the two men?exactly what sicko Ryder wants.In an unwise move (in an attempt broaden the movie's appeal), the creators of this updated version have seen fit to give Jim (Zachary Knighton) a girlfriend, Grace (the rather tasty Sophia Bush). And although Ryder once again asks Jim to try and stop him, it is ultimately down to Grace to defeat the killer. Gone is the intense psychological interaction between the two adversaries. Gone is the almost mythical 'David and Goliath'-style battle. What viewers get is a formulaic contemporary Hollywood horror ending, in which the gutsy babe dispenses justice to the nasty bad guy.Also weakening the whole shebang is the casting of Sean Bean as Ryder (whose bland performance isn't a patch on Hauer's creepy turn), and the need show every death in all of its gory detail. I love gruesome films, but part of the original's power was that the viewer was left to use one's imagination to picture the end results of Ryder's more sickening murderous acts. Sometimes, less is more, but Bay and Co. are obviously strangers to subtlety.To be fair, if this film wasn't just another in a long line of MTV-style updatings of old classics, I would probably be a lot less scathing about it?it is no worse than a lot of recent major-studio horror movies. But with Hollywood currently churning out remake after remake, with very few of the films coming even close to matching the quality of the originals, I'll be damned if I'm going to encourage the trend. For being totally unnecessary and uninspired, I award The Hitcher '07 an unimpressive 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very similar to the original, but better. The acting is superior and the special effects are much better. The plot remains pretty much intact, so there are no surprises there. First of all, Sean Bean is a better John Ryder than Rutger Hauer was. Hauer was comical at times and never truly scary. Sean Bean is a first-rate actor and really makes John Ryder believable and scary. The two college kids are decent actors too - nothing spectacular, but far better than, say, Sarah Michelle Gellar.The special effects are phenomenal, much better than the original, but, since the movies have almost the exact same plot, this doesn't detract from the storyline. I'm sorry, I know a lot of people like cult classics from the 1970s and 1980s, but the cheesy effects often ruin those movies. I enjoy realism, which is what this movie delivered.If you like Splat Pack films (The Hills Have Eyes (remake), The Descent, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (remake), etc.) you'll love this. If you refuse to admit that older horror movies just aren't that scary and could really use a face-lift, steer clear.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the preview for this movie and for once was actually enticed by a horror movie. It looked like it had a very solid psychological edge factor going for it and could be one heck of a ride with Sean Bean at the helm. And... no such luck.The story of this movie is actually a good one. I liked the idea of a guy who preys on the highway travelers in New Mexico. However, this movie has two major downfalls. One, it was so predictable I could just cry. I haven't even seen the original. Two, The two protagonists are absolute morons! They were absolutely unbelievably stupid people. Everything they did just incriminated them more and more. These two are so stupid, you half hope they'd get killed in the movie.The acting in this movie was not very good at all. Sean Bean wasn't even that good. He had his moments where he was utterly creepy but aside from that he just didn't really do much in convincing us how psycho he was. I don't know. The two college students were absolutely god awful actors. The only good actor I thought was the guy who played the police chief.The writing... my god. Whoever wrote this movie should be exiled and placed on an island where he can never write another movie again. The only good writing in this movie was 4 words. "I want to die." And you know what? The dialogue in this movie made me want to utter those four words. It was bland trash.Something about the cinematography and soundtrack really bugged me, too. It seemed really trashy and undefined. It may just be personal taste, but I'm really not into the whole "dark camera" thing. It doesn't really accentuate tone at all. Leave that to shadows and lighting. Texas Chainsaw bugged me in this manner too. The soundtrack was... blah. The only real thing I noticed wrong was Move Along by AAR. I actually like the song, but it was just... gratuitous in this manner. It didn't fit at all.3 good things about this movie. 1. There was about 5 minutes where it didn't suck. 2. There was actually one thing that completely caught me by surprise. 3. Sophia Bush in the shower. 3 bad things about this movie. 1. The protagonists were idiots. 2. Sean Bean disappointed me completely. 3. You want to beat your head against a wall watching it. Overall, this movie had so much potential and completely squashed it. Sean Bean didn't save this movie, nor did its story. It was a nice try, though. And that's about the only reason this earns a 3/10 and not a 1."I want you to say four little words: I... Want... To... Die."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a boring movie which is very bloody. That mostly attracted you to watch this or you want to see how good a remake can be. I rated 5 of 10, there are a lot of reasons why I did that.First, this has no plot or story-line to follow, the main characters just run everywhere to escape from a crazy killer which for no reason is bent on killing the two of them. They run to whatever places they see and end up running away to another place. No sense, they are stupid and the killer is clever, he knows where to find them. So why don't the two go somewhere that is better, like more people in it and why must they go and take a tour in desert, which nobody would want to be in. I can't see any reason for that.Second, as this is a no plot movie, the only thing the director can put is the violence. This movie is bloody, you get to see a lot of blood squirting out. This may be a good sight to those who like gory movies but those who don't like it, there is no way you would want to watch this, maybe you would want to watch for the pretty girl but other than that, no story. Just the big-bang action and bloody violence. And you will notice Michael Bay is producing this, no wonder, there is big action. Michael Bay is always good at exploding things.Third, the couple are stupid, I can't stand watching them. They run and run but...the killer always can find them. And they cry fearing their deaths will be near. But they are good-looking.This is a non-stop bloody violence movie, definitely not for those who fear blood. You want to get shock, buy the DVD and make the volume as loud as you can. Watching in cinema is not a very good idea unless you have a lot of money to spend. Otherwise, don't catch this. Violence and blood-squirting, these two types you can expect for western gory movies. That is pain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the usual remake failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please tab on box office and business to see (also) what a complete failure this utter moronic drivel is even at the box office. What is it with American film makers and their keen desire to show disgusting cruelty as entertainment? No other country on the planet makes films on a scale volume and level like this. ... or the other vicious remakes. These vile films only exist to show distressing ways to show people being mutilated. Australia's most reviled film WOLF CREEK sadly adds to this 'kill the tourist' genre and it is not a film of which we are in any way pleased. Visual vandalism like this and HOSTEL and other rabid destructive evil imagery is proof the film business has creatively bankrupted itself. THE HITCHER exists simply to show inhuman fools sad imagery of cruelty. It was made for that purpose and the planet and those who cherish life and respect the film industry are poorer for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, those kids gave me a headache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was kinda interested in seeing The Hitcher, despite not seeing the original, I figured to give the remake a look. I always love a good slasher flick here or there, so I rented the movie, watched it tonite, and I have to say, oh, those kids were so stupid, I just wanted to jump in the movie and smack them! The killer played by Sean Bean, he was good, John Ryder was very creepy and did everything right, as a villain should. Those college kids? Oh, no, don't give them any credit considering how stupid they are, and their perfectly time make out sessions? Not so much.Grace and Jim are two college kids who are heading to see her friends for spring break, when they almost hit a man who's car is broken down on the road, they leave him there. Later at a gas station they encounter him again, he asks for a lift to a motel and Jim agrees, but the trip turns deadly when "John Ryder" pulls a knife on the couple, but they outsmart him and push him out of the car. But somehow along the line, he just keeps bumping into them and easily tries to frame them for murder, putting them on the run from the hitcher who wants them also dead.So basically throughout most of the movie I was saying the line that the killer wanted Jim to say when he pulled the knife on him, "I want to die!". I mean, the girl, Grace, the acting abilities didn't apparently make into the film and the story was just lame. Really, please, don't waste your time, the only thing that was worth watching was John Ryder, many points to Sean Bean, hopefully he'll get blessed with a cast that will actually work with him next time, so he doesn't have to carry the movie.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Attempting to go to spring break together, a couple's trip ends in terror when they accidentally pick up a deranged hitchhiker and are soon caught up in his deadly game while trying to avoid the authorities convinced they are behind the spate of violence.While this one doesn't really hold up to the original, this is still a pretty enjoyable and fun effort. The biggest factor here for this one is the fact that there's a lot more action and general chasing going on throughout here. this one here manages to get a lot more into here than initially expected with the tormenting done here from the start with the initial car-ride that causes them to force him out of the car, a thrilling chase down the highway that pits their crumbling car against his monster truck in a thrilling means of escape before the diversion away and finally the rest-stop diner encounter that's pretty enjoyable as well. That gives the final half of the film near non-stop action here with the capture at the diner, the police station massacre that sets off the final charge and the great car-chase with the police in hot pursuit and the rather enjoyable conclusion there that makes for quite a fun time here. As well, the replication of the signature scene from the original of the friend tied in between the two trucks at the rest-stop and trying to keep him from ripping the body in half is a fine continuation of the events as the lead-in here makes for a thrilling time with the search throughout the compound and pulling the previous events together as they've lead to this if only slightly too reminiscent of that scene from the original without a whole lot of the power and brutality of that one, which is the main thing that's holding this one down. That this one seems to come off more as a straight remake of events here is the biggest stumbling block, as rather than play things out in a new or creative manner, there's a whole series of scenes here taken from the original but given more of an action-based bent that causes this to come off as repetitive without being original or daring. About the only thing it really changes up here is the fates of several of the characters, but even that's not really enough here to do anything new or creative with what's happening here as this one just tends to continue on all throughout in that manner. As well, this one really tends to wallow in contrivance rather than any kind of actual investigative work throughout to follow through its actions, as there's little need to evade the police here but rather stay with them while he's out there on his rampage and the framing is completely invalidated by being with them while the actions occurred, and it really feels more like circumstance that causes them to go on the run here rather than being wrongly framed for the whole ordeal. Beyond this, there's not a whole lot else really wrong with this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and strong implied violence against children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senseless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to IMDb, Red was credited as a screenplay writer for this movie, but had no part in writing it (aside from writing the 1986 film). I haven't seen the 1986 version, but if it was any good, I don't blame him for wanting to distance himself from this version.This flick starts strong and features competent performances by good actors (except for Bush's second-half performance, which gets out of her range, in my opinion; she just hasn't mastered the thousand-yard stare). However, it's a lot of build-up for nothing. The effects and action are often hokey, it feels as if some major events were skipped (and not in a good, it's-better-to-leave-it-to-the-imagination way), and the payoff to the big question throughout the movie is never realized. If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be "senseless." Also according to IMDb, "Rutger Hauer, who played the character of John Ryder in the original was offered a cameo, but declined for artistic reasons. Hauer has since said in the press that he has yet to watch the remake, and according to some of his friends he shouldn't bother."

A college couple become part of a killer's deadly game after giving him a ride. Two college students, Grace Andrews (Bush) and her boyfriend, Jim Halsey (Knighton) are driving to Mexico for spring break. On the way, they pick up a hitchhiker, John Ryder (Bean) and discover he's a crazed killer. They kick him out of their car and soon, they become part of his deadly game when they're framed for murder and running from police. They try to prove their innocence and become pursued by Lt. Esteridge (McDonough) who eventually realizes John is behind the charade. They learn that John is not his real identity and is a twisted man with no conscience. Though, the original is better, this isn't bad and Sean is a great villain as usual. I still recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the original 1986 version of The Hitcher and this remake in one day, I can only say that the latter is a complete failure, and a totally ridiculous movie from the beginning to the end. In fact, it looked more like a spoof than a remake.Sean Bean completely failed to deliver in his portrayal of John Ryder. The original character, portrayed by Rutger Hauer, was a really menacing villain whose inexplicably psychotic behavior and the persistence in torturing the protagonists made the 1986 version of The Hitcher a truly brilliant and shocking thriller that never got tiresome to watch. The remake, on the other hand, is barely watchable and its John Ryder is totally foolish.It was totally annoying how Bean tried to impersonate Hauer in the scene where he pulls out a knife at Jim Halsey and tries to persuade him into saying "I want to die.", as well as in the tied-up-between-a-truck-and-a-trailer scene. In the original version, the latter scene was definitely one of the most shocking parts of the movie. In this remake, it was totally ridiculous, and the same can be said for basically every other scene that was re-created from the original version.In the opening few minutes, the movie did not even look like a thriller, but rather a cheesy teen movie, and so sounded most of the dialogue between Jim Halsey and his girlfriend Grace, a new character in comparison with the original version. The corny gas station clerk who persuaded them into giving Ryder a ride blended perfectly with such a ridiculous storytelling. A couple of songs playing throughout the movie were also some incredibly cheesy pop stuff that, of course, would more suit a teen movie than a thriller. Not to mention the fact that Ryder wasn't even a hitcher, but merely a fool who stood in the middle of the road on a rainy night.The gory scene where Ryder kills a family was totally nonsensical, as well. The two protagonists' actions become increasingly stupid, and the police seem to be equally unwise. After the father turns out to be still alive, Jim and Grace decide to drive around in the family's blood-soaked station wagon to get help. Of course, Ryder is not far behind as he soon appears behind the wheel of a pick-up truck and tries to push them off the road, before mysteriously disappearing. When they arrive at a nearby restaurant, Grace asks the staff to call 911, and also ridiculously decides to get some paper towels in an attempt to save the man's life. The police arrest Jim and Grace, and take them to a police station where Ryder soon secretly arrives and kills all the cops.Jim and Grace then moronically go on the run even though it's now obvious that they neither killed the family nor the cops. Even more, they soon find themselves holding a cop at gunpoint. Not far behind again, Ryder kills the cop. The arriving back-up see Grace with a gun, and think that she was the one who fired the shot. The couple jump into the dead cop's cruiser, and a totally idiotic chase scene in which they refuse to give up to the police ensues. Ryder soon catches up to kill all the cops involved in it, including the aerial unit.As opposed to the original version, the male protagonist is the one to get killed after being tied up between a truck and a trailer. Grace jumps into the truck where Ryder is behind the wheel, and holds him at gunpoint. The police arrive shortly thereafter, and foolishly try to persuade Grace into dropping her gun instead of trying to save Jim Halsey's life. The final scene was also totally ridiculous, from the moment Ryder frees himself from the handcuffs to the moment where he is killed by Grace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another rubbish Hollywood remake. That's all you need to know. Anyhow, it's rubbish for three main reasons. One, the couple are just like any other wooden characters chucked on the screen for us to pretendedly support them in their times of pure horror. You've failed as a writer, director or actor when you wish the main protagonists dead. Two, No real plot apart from driving away from the bad man for an hour and a half. The survival for life was directed in the same manner than the other millions of 00s horror films. And three, Sean Bean just wouldn't die and he was just as boring as the couple despite the fact he looked awesome as the hitcher.So yeah. Crappy film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak screenplay, stunning photography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screenplay is rather flawed, with a storyline that's not convincing and rather weird behaviour of the couple Grace and Jim (you don't fall asleep when you've just being attacked, you try to run away as fast as you can, etc.). But the cinematography is impressive, with sometimes rather magical moments - and so is the soundtrack. Sean Bean is very convincing as the maniac killer with an unexplained desire to die. On the DVD you can see 20 minutes of "deletes scenes" which are rather an alternate movie with some more impressive photography and intense moments between Grace and John Ryder. All in all a fine little dirty horror-thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher is one crazy dude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the original film, and it was pretty good. This new version follows some parts of the original closely, while other parts it's completely different. But, the craziness of the Hitcher is the same in both films. In this version two college students agree to take John Ryder to a hotel. Along the way, Ryder pulls a knife and they kick him out the car. From there, the chase is on. The 2 kids keep meeting up with Ryder and his victims. He kills others but toys around with them. Soon, Ryder's got the police thinking the college kids are involved in the murders. Ryder even breaks the kids out of jail. The movie does have some unrealistic car chasing scenes. And the part where Grace busts out of the flaming armored car is pretty ridiculous.FINAL VERDICT: OK, for those who have seen the original, you may be disappointed because this movie just isn't as good. But, it's OK for a cheap thrill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the philosophical sense, something is always out to get us, maybe even relentlessly so. Be it an abusive spouse, memories of an abusive parent, the IRS, old age, death. We can run but ultimately it will get us. This is our great fear, and why The Hitcher attracted me and held my interest to the end. The storyline at times seemed silly and preposterous but I was OK with that. The real story was the relentless pursuit, what I would have done, the unfairness of being blamed for something someone else did, and ultimately how the young couple fairs at the end. The film is highly watchable with excellent production values, good acting, and enjoyable characters, even the creepy ones (i.e. the gas station attendant). But it is most interesting in how it speaks to the individual watching it, the individual psyche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bean was good with a middling film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the excellent 1980's original- this was always going to be a difficult- and for the fans- baffling choice for an effects heavy update. Given the virtual reproduction of key original scenes the first question is why?. Replacing Rutger Haurs mysterious remorseless killer was always going to be a tricky choice and they settled on the more commercially bankable Sean Bean. Sean Bean does a good sideline in villains and here plays Ryder as more sexual- when we first encounter him he makes crude remarks about the girlfriend (Sophia Bush) and later attempts to rape her. In some scenes he comes across as a cold eyed psychotic in other bland and lifeless. The two leads aren't terrible but are given little characterisation and as such i didn't really care whether they lived or died. This film could have been so much better and i would have been interested to see what Sean Bean could have come up with with a better script that left the original behind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i liked the film i thought it was very good Sean Beam and Zach knighton gave a good performance, but if i was playing Grace i would have done more and heres why ...When she was hiding in the toilet at the motel she told Sean that she had a gun why would you be stupid enough to say that i mean i would of shot him then in the head when he was trying to get into the bathroom, but i understand you have to make the film longer but still....My second point i wanted to get across is that i was reading a few comments before i commented myself someone came up with the idea of shooting the chains that her poor boyfriend was tied to but no, she had to do it the hard way and to be honest when she saw his body ripped in two it didn't seem like she cared very much i mean i would be crying my eyes if i had just seen my boyfriends death!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what i would also of done if i were in her shoes and i didn't shoot the chains then i would of put my foot near the peddle or put pressure on what was keeping my boyfriend from being pulled apart, without john Ryder noticing ha. see very sly then i would of shot him in the head because i mean after the boyfriend is dead John Ryder is not alive for long after that so you know you could of kept him alive and done something good by keeping him alive i mean he was her boyfriend after all and they were quite stupid you know they should of just gone home when they had the chance but i suppose there would not of been a film if they went home but still.It was not a very long film they could of made it longer.And the boyfriend should not of died because he was rather good looking i would of done more to save him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love thrillers and horrors and Im also a big fan of Sean Bean so I was looking forward to The Hitcher - And I was not disappointed! I also liked the recent horror/thriller remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, When A Stranger Calls, The Amityville Horror and Black Christmas - And this is another to add to the list. I enjoyed the original The Hitcher and Rutger Hauer but this remake and Sean Bean are just as good. Sean Bean really steals the show and makes such a great bad guy as we have seen in Golden Eye, Don't Say A Word, National Treasure, etc. There is a slight role reversal from the original as the girl is the main character out of the stricken couple. Sophia Bush is gorgeous in the lead and Zachery Knight is decent although he needs a shave. The film is non-stop action and doesn't drag one bit. It gets straight into the action - There is no messing about, we all know that Sean Bean will go psycho so don't hang about - And the film doesn't. From then on there is no let up in the twists and turns. My only gripe was that the ending wasn't quite as thrilling as the rest and Sophia Bush grabbing a shotgun and giving it the clichéd "Im not running anymore!" was a little silly. Overall though - A very good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tense knuckle cracker. Remember your mother telling you not to talk to strangers? What about picking up hitchhikers? A young couple, Grace(Sophia Bush)and Jim(Zachary Knighton), are on their way on spring break with the destination being Grace's parent's house. The couple are in a revered 1970 Olds 442, while on the road Jim almost hits a man stranded in the rain. His decision is to not stop and offer him a ride. That man is John Ryder(Sean Bean), who becomes the young couple's worse nightmare. The psychotic hitchhiker begins stalking the couple across New Mexico and implicates them in a horrific slaying. The highway becomes a battleground with Grace and Jim trying to elude Ryder and also the New Mexico State Police led by Lieutenant Esteridge(Neal McDonough). Intense, maddening car chases and big time violence. This sinister film ends in what else... bloodshed. Keeping things at a fever pitch is a heavy soundtrack featuring Nine Inch Nails, Alan Parsons, Stephen Bishop, David Soul and the All American Rejects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher or How I became stupid and stayed there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hitcher is a remake of a 1986 horror film about a lunatic hitch hiker who terrorizes those who are inane and idiot enough to pick him up. In this film Sophia Bush( who never looks like she is 2 minutes away from a noxema commercial no matter what horrible and horrendous things she goes through here) and her boyfriend (played by a young Tom Cruise lookalike Zachary Knighton ) are on their way to meet up with Sophia's characters friends in New Mexico when they come across Sean Beans lunatic character. What transpires in this road trip is one idiot move after the next one. The problem with this flick is that it all could have been over and done with in the first few minutes if they would just do one smart thing. They don't.. and what you have is a moron movie in which by the middle your routing for the bad guy...not a good thing!!..What bothers me most is they spend the whole movie running from those who can help and into the hands of the lunatic. Dumb Dumb Dumb!!!They only smart thing about the flick was the wink to those of us who read up on our entertainment news during the scene at the motel where Sophia's character Grace is watching "The Birds" on the TV. Michael Bay who produced this film is in the works to remake Hitchcocks, "The Birds", through his Platimun Dunes company. I was disappointed and not much inspired by this remake but did enjoy the, im assuming unintentional, wink to Larry Hagman by Neal Mcdonough who plays Lt. Esteridge. He looks like a young JR Ewing of "Dallas" fame throughout the flick, gallon cowboy hat, million dollar grin, and all!! I think he would be better at playing JR than John Travolta!!..Anyway if you want to spend a mindless hour and a half watching dumb people do dumb things...then pick this doozey up....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will openly admit that I have never seen the original but I saw this one with a friend. I thought this movie was nothing great but it wasn't awful either. This movie was only slightly gross and even the actors weren't that great. Sean Bean was the best in the movie and he was actually kind of scary. The girl and the guy didn't seem like very good actors and it almost seemed like they had to put effort into their emotions to get a desired result. The storyline and plot was OK but nothing great. There might of been two gross scenes in the whole movie and even then, they weren't very interesting. This movie didn't even hold you in suspense or make your heart race at was about to happen. It was just another typical horror movie in todays society and even then, I don't know if you could call it that. My friend told me that he heard it is just like the original, well I don't see the point in remaking the same movie if you aren't going to change it at all. Maybe that's why it suffers so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would think that this being a remake might already spoil the plot for moviegoers but on the contrary this movie has some different twists that should keep you on the edge of your seat even if you saw the first movie with Rutger Hauer. Our evil villain does not as expected seem to make me skeptical that one could be in a major motion picture such as fantasy movie J R Tolkien's 2001 movie "Lord of the Ring's" as to an evil villain in this movie but I notice he does not miss a beat in being convincing in this new role. The plot COULD have been a little more complicated for my taste which is why I don't give it 10 stars. What there is of a plot does not take a rocket scientist to figure out. Other than that you throw in some twists and you actually do have a pretty surprisingly darn good movie. I would say it definitely deserves more than one star which is what they give it as a critique at Time Warner but I think they have thirteen year old little girls rate their movies. All in all I can say I enjoyed watching this movie very much and to my surprise it's not Sean Bean from "The Lord of the Ring's" who's acting carries the movie as I expected, but the two new young up and comers that were the main character's who's acting was surprisingly good. I can not right off tell you their names but I will be sure to go back and take a look after I finish my review because they were that good, enough for me to want to do that. I need to find their names so I can look for them in something more current. Hopefully they will be a little more seasoned which is what I expect to find if I am fortunate enough to find them in something else more recent. This movie is about six years old and I am honestly surprised I have not seen them since. Anyway good movie. Check it out on that night when you and the little lady are on the couch and you want the her holding on to you for dear life and protection as she freaks out during the scary parts which there are plenty to go around. Better than a horror movie in that respect because this is believable unlike most horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of the original Hitcher so I approached this with a lot of caution especially given how so many reviews were slamming it. But I think people are being overly harsh here. This is a terrifically shot &amp; directed little movie. The lead actors all do well and there is great action &amp; suspense throughout. I was very impressed with the cinematography especially in the first half. There were some especially clever &amp; 'beautiful' (tho slightly gory) sequences involving animals and insects. I can see why they made the changes they did and while they take away a lot from the original story by introducing a couple instead of just the lone "hero" it's actually got it's own appeal. On the down side, the music they used was mostly inappropriate unfortunately, more suited to a romantic drama than a thriller and completely ruined the mood. One exception - I thought the NIN track worked beautifully when that came in. Similarly sinister music in the rest of the flick would have been a lot better than the MTV fluff they seemed to run with. Apart from anything else, if you use the latest top 10 songs as your musical score you end up dating the movie very quickly.The ending could have been done better - it seemed a bit unrealistic - perhaps a little less "super-heroic" and more damage to the hero would have been in order. But apart from the above few niggles, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's not quite as good as the original but who cares really? And it's good in it's own right. I also liked that they didn't make the female lead useless and pathetic &amp; that neither of the two acted like morons. Their actions were perfectly logical and believable in the circumstances they found themselves in. Not always the wisest decisions were made but that's realistic &amp; understandable for two traumatised college kids &amp; if the characters didn't take the wrong path occasionally there'd be no story now would there!!Oh and there's nowhere near as much "gore" as people have suggested. There's a bit of blood &amp; guts but nothing too outrageous. Very tame in that respect compared to many other horror flicks I've seen. Altho there was one scene where I was wise enough to look the other way at the crucial point. Unless you're hard core I'd recommend you do the same!! LOL You'll know what I mean when you get there.Don't look at this flick as a remake of a classic and set it up to fail no matter how good it is. Just watch it as a movie in it's own right and I guarantee you WILL enjoy it. It's 100x better than most of the rubbish around lately. My actual vote is somewhere around the 6 mark as I think it's an above average action/horror movie but not brilliant. But I've rated it higher to make up for the mean-spirited and unjust low ratings this is getting from many people. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching the Rutger Hauer original a second time and being pretty impressed, and I saw a trailer for this remake with a good looking choice for the villain, so I had to see it. Basically college students Grace Andrews (John Tucker Must Die's Sophia Bush) and Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) are on their way to Lake Havasu for a Spring Break holiday, driving through the New Mexico Desert during a rainy night. On their way they almost hit a guy in the middle of the road, they drive away before he got the chance to get to their window, but they see him again when they stop at a station for gas. The guy, calling himself John Ryder (Sean Bean), asks Jim if he get a lift to which he agrees, and not long after getting back on the road, the mysterious hitchhiker shows his true colours. He quickly becomes violent threatening Grace with a knife unless Jim follows his instructions, but they manage to chuck out the psychopath on the road. The next morning the couple wake up to continue driving, and they are shocked to see John in another car with a family, and trying to warn them they end up having an accident and having to walk. Grace and Jim manage to catch up to the family car, and of course everyone is dead after being stabbed, with only the driver barely living, so they drive to find help. Covered in blood they stop at a restaurant, but the waitress calls the police on them believing them to be murders, but they do manage to escape and get away. The only one in the police that believes that the murders weren't committed by Grace and Jim is Lt. Esteridge (Star Trek: First Contact's Neal McDonough), it is only after hearing more crimes that his confidence goes down. Now fugitives, Grace and Jim are on the run from the police and desperate to escape both them and of course the murderous rampage of John, who keeps showing up trying to kill them. Eventually after confronting each other in a lorry, John tells Grace to kill him with the gun she has, or suffer Jim being pulled apart by the chains on his ankles, she refuses and Jim is torn apart. Thankfully John is arrested as the real killer, and they transport him across the desert landscape bound for prison, Grace in tow, but of course he breaks free and kills anyone in his way. In the end, after killing all the police and Lt. Esteridge, Grace grabs herself a large shotgun and aims it at John, who has his last word, but of course he gets shot in the head. Also starring Kyle Davis as Buford's Store Clerk, Skip O'Brien as Sheriff Harlan Bremmer Sr., Travis Schuldt as Deputy Harlan Bremmer Jr. and Danny Bolero as Officer Edwards. Bean makes a good effort to be the psycho hitchhiker, he is almost as icy as Hauer and certainly more violent, the problem is changing the format of the lone victim into a squabbling couple, it takes away some tension, but with gory moments and chase sequences, it is alright horror thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher kicked major ass! I enjoyed it more than the original. This movie had a truly twisted madman and featured some of the most death defying stunts and white knuckle thrills. Sean Bean(National Treasure), delivered one of the most terrifying performances that i have ever seen. He plays a truly haunting stranger, who is picked up by a young college couple Sophia Bush(One Tree Hill and Stay Alive) and Zachary Knoghton(Cherry Falls), who are on their way to celebrate their spring break with some friends. Once they discover what this evil man's motives are, they ditch him, but he keeps showing up and trying to pin his gruesome murder spree on them. This movie kicks off with a bloody bang and doesn't let up until the harrowing ending. I definitely recommend this flick for fans of the action horror thriller genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitching a ride with a remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shock! The horror! I didn't mind it. What am I saying? Sure it's unwarranted, and virtually a scene to scene remake (with some little changes) of one of my all-time favourite horror films. But it's just too well made and acted that I just went with it and enjoyed the pot-boiling ride. I won't go to say it reaches the same heights of it influencer (far from it), but it's a better remake than I was actually expecting. I was thinking along the lines that they might water it down, but gladly that kept the same perverse and malevolent tone with that lingering enigma. There's some nasty, cruel and bloody moments, but nothing uncomfortably disturbing like the '86'version. That film rather use implied violence. Sean Bean (in the role Rutger Hauer made his own) has a hard timing beating it, but still invites an interestingly pitch black and calculating characterised performance of John Ryder. Bean is perilously good and a lot of it falls on his shoulders to carry the scenes, but you'll have a hard time forgetting Hauer's hitcher anytime soon. Sophie Bush is acceptable in the lead role (despite that unbelievable change in character for the climax) and Zachary Knighton is fine too as the young couple who's being toyed with. The always riveting Neal McDonough gives a sharp, but too short turn as Lt Esteridge. Director Dave Meyers stylishly competent guidance lets the flashy impulses and breezy nature headlines the show (well other than Bean). It looks good. Photography is well-handled with the vast, desolate and harsh terrain being beautifully painted on screen to generate that tight, breathless atmosphere. Even during those heart-racing thrills, the intensity is kept on target. The understated score never really makes a dent, and feels like background tool. The story has a ragged and boundless format of trying to keep things on the move with little time for any justifications. The original was the same, but had a more surreal and interesting ambiance to the material and the remake doesn't really add anything upon what we already know. Still it effectively entertains and is faithful, so I guess it served its purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher remake was a blast! It follows the original very well too. The movie has non-stop action and is one great thrill ride. This is one of the best remakes I've seen this year. There is not one boring minute in this movie. Sean Bean did a great job at playing John Ryder. I found him to be even crazier than Rutger Hauer in the original Hitcher. You'll see lots of shooting in this movie and some insane car wrecks! John Ryder is one bad mother! He just won't stop the killing. Definitely check out this movie though, if you like horror themed movies with action to top it off. Hitcher won't disappoint you. I can't wait to pick up the HD DVD this May.I give the Hither remake a hitchhiking 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film filled with more holes than swiss cheese.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of the suspense flick seemed interesting enough - how a hitcher terrorized two college kids who happened to give him a ride. Unfortunately, that appears to be one of only two good things about the film (the other good thing being Sophia Bush). The way the story unfolds is ridiculous. I was aghast at how the script writer tried to insult the intelligence of the audience in more than one scene in the movie. For instance, how is it possible that Sean Bean's character can kill so many grown men (including law enforcement officers) and yet not be able to overcome Sophia Bush's character when they were in the motel room? Why didn't Bush's character just shoot the damn chains off her boyfriend when he was tied to the trucks? I was only one of four persons in the cinema watching the show and I was shouting myself hoarse at all the loopholes in the story-telling. If you like suspense thrillers because of the fear they instill in you, this is not the show to get it. This show is strictly for fans of the lead actors only. A pity really...how did the guy who did so well in LOTR end up doing crap like this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I truly believe that Sean Bean plays a GREAT psycho (most of the time), I knew this movie was going to be a flop. The incredible tension and chemistry that Rutger Hauer and C. Thomas Howell shared in the original is completely absent from this version. There's just no heart and soul in this version (perhaps because the heart and soul took the high road and made a run for it). Yeah, okay, they throw Sophia Bush in for flavor (which I think was the first mistake with this flick), but this movie is BAD. The acting is appalling (Sean Bean did his best, but I think his struggle to keep up the American accent hurt him), like that head honcho cop dude...could he be any stiffer? Sheesh, he was a corpse before he was actually a corpse. I saw him as SCI-FI's Tin Man too, and he was just as lame in that.Sad though it is to admit, being a Sean Bean fan, I could NOT watch this turkey in one sitting. I yawned my way through the first half the first time, and a few days later yawned my way through the 2nd half...ONLY because I wanted to be qualified to comment on this clunker on IMDb.I give it a three because the special effects during the pivotal scene with the helicopter are pretty cool, and Sean Bean made an effort. The truck nearly crushing them was unexpected, but it also didn't make sense. Other than that, don't waste your time. See the original instead. It's so simple and uncluttered, and terrifying. It's a movie that will ACTUALLY have you on the edge of your seat.Thank you for reading my rant. Now I'm going to go watch the Fellowship of the Ring to redeem my faith in Sean Bean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i rated it a 1 because the annoying boyfriend died pretty gruesomely. the only thing that i didn't / don't get is how these serial/psychotic killers do things. Michael myers, Jason vorhees, the hitcher...they've all been around gorgeous girls at one time or another. if they are going to brutally kill people, why wouldn't they rape the hot girls? if you look at the serial killers, like Ted Bundy, they took advantage of situations. of course, these killers in these movies have other purposes other than raping girls. i just want a director to make a horror movie that's very realistic. rob zombie kind of did with his Halloween version. the DVD version has two psych guards trying to rape a patient and then Michael comes in and kills them both. most men like gorgeous girls, so if they're crazy enough to kill, why not rape? the reason why i'm asking this question is because the hitcher asks if the boyfriend is f***ing his girl. if the hitcher was wondering this answer to the question, why then didn't he get some chloroform and knock her out and then tie her up? forget rape, how did this girl survive in general? this happened in red eye. the killers in these movies are so smart and strong and they have so many resources, how do the dumb, retarded female dogs always survive? it's just unrealistic. kudos to whoever came up with the idea of the annoying and stupid boyfriend to die. if the original was so good, why couldn't the director make it a lil' more interesting. directors, if you can adjust the screenplay, then do it. please, can somebody make a realistic horror film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never pick up strangers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sadistic killer, with an instinct to kill and a desire to die, loves to randomly pick his victims by hitchhiking on the roads of New Mexico. Grace Andrews and Jim Halsey are two college students going on spring break, when they unfortunately pick up this hitchhiker, John Ryder. Grace and Jim learn real fast that it was a bad mistake to give a hitchhiker a ride. What was going to be a fun time now turns into a nightmare.What makes this film different from other horror films I like is that this one is bad. This film is really bad. No, no. It's not mediocre. It's bad. What do you get when you have too many implausible and improbable scenes mixed with too many coincidences? You get a suspense-free movie starring the great Sean Bean.There's nothing new here (what a surprise). The pop up scenes are there. The clichés are there. People have IQ's below 50 and people die just the fact they're that dumb. And this is probably the film that makes me hate policemen in horror movies the most. Usually, they're stupid. In here, they are very stupid. Stupid out of their minds! Stupid that they're trying to get themselves killed!Another huge complaint is what I call a "super villain". This pretty much says it all. Sean Bean, playing as the killer, can do anything. He can catch up when the protagonists are running without really running himself. He can shoot perfectly and he can pretty much do what action heroes do.Is this film really that bad? Yes! But there is one exception (there is always one in many bad movies) that actually redeems the movie a little: It's the ending. I like to applaud it actually tries to do something non-clichéd as most movies are these days.If you want a suspenseful scary movie, don't slow down by this movie; don't even pick it up. If you want a scary, suspenseful film, watch "Vacancy", a more superior film that actually has suspense. Other than that, STAY AWAY from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie with the super performance of Sophia Bush. She should win an Oscar Award for her performance in this film. Although, I have never seen the original version, I know that she definitely plays the part better then Jennifer Jason Leigh.While driving on an isolated highway Grace Andrews and her boyfriend John Ryder are suddenly startled by a guy standing in the middle of the road. They manage to speed away in time, but later he catches up with them at a gas station. He requests a ride and Grace does not want to do it but John says yes. When he starts to act psychotic they throw him out of the car. But that's not the end of it.He continues his killing spree wiping out a family, cops, and others. He tries to frame Grace and John for it, but in the end the truth is revealed. Unfortuneatly though, John does not make it. But the killer gets a taste of medicine in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend and I picked up this movie for less than ten dollars, mostly because of the casting of Sophia Bush. We hardly expected to enjoy anything about the movie but her- however, I found it to be a pretty good film overall. It was long enough to establish the characters and short enough to keep pace and wrap up before getting boring. The characters were pretty enjoyable, and I was very impressed that Grace (Bush) was written to be intelligent and likable, instead of just pretty and scared. The acting was fine for what they were given to work with, and though I couldn't stand Jim as a character, I was impressed by his fate. Sean Bean was pretty good as the psychologically disturbed Ryder, and the movie was above average in comparison to the junk Hollywood is passing off as thrillers these days.Overall, the film far surpassed my expectations, and though it's not exactly a piece of art, "The Hitcher" does what it sets out to accomplish and makes for an entertaining 85 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original version of this film, however I know people who have and say that this 2007 version compares very well to the older version.I really enjoyed this film! It delivers excellent scenes of tension and fast paced chases. It also makes you cringe in a lot of places and makes you thank god that you are not in the position of the poor couple the hitcher preys on.This film is basically about a young couple off on the road to see some friends for spring break. Obviously this starts out to be fairly innocent, until they swerve and miss a guy stood in the middle of the road hitching a lift. Womens instinct tells her boyfriend to keep driving because she doesn't like the idea of picking up a stranger...who wouldn't agree? Well, it all goes downhill from here...the hitch hiker (sean bean) soon finds where there are, picks out their weaknesses and really gives them the fright of their life! They are left running for their lives, hoping he doesn't find them, hoping he doesn't hurt them, or even worse...kill them.It's advisable you watch this film, it's very good! I haven't seen the original, and i don't think you need to have seen it.Always remember to NEVER pick up strangers! ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher captures the unnecessarily sinister and sadistic nature of its titular character, a man on the ultimate quest of robbing someone of their innocence by getting them to experience the same high from killing as he does. There is this rather interesting storyline, and then a generic teen horror Spring Break storyline operating seamlessly throughout the film. Regrettably, the latter almost always takes the front seat in screen time as Sean Bean is presented to us rather sparsely while the dumb college couple inhabit nearly every scene with their fumbling presence.Of course, as far as casting is concerned, bubbly Sophia Bush in all of her Abercrombie mini-skirt cuteness is prime meat for Hollywood. Sean Bean is something of a rentable bad guy in mainstream film but he typically plays calculating villains or traitors rather than full on psychos as opposed to Rutger Hauer from the original Hitcher who offered onslaughts of getting his freak on. For this reason, Bean is a bit of an unconventional choice for the role of John Ryder. Nevertheless, and in spite of struggling with an American accent, he mostly delivers.The Hitcher (2007) is a film that greatly prefers climaxes to continuity, and repeatedly sets itself up in impossibly clichéd horror situations to milk every premise its worth of chills and thrills. In under barely 83 minutes, it is far too short to fully explore all that it attempts, be it foreshadowing, Ryder's psychotic torture or the college couple's fear. It feels very rushed as director Dave Meyers frantically seems to tick off each teen slasher cliché off the formula, and in the end we have a poor man's buffet of horror goodies, the kind you'd find in gas stations.It gets flat-out ridiculous when John Ryder is trying to frame Grace and Jim for his killings and of course they do the wrongest of things to deal with it: start blaming each other, split up in dark alleys, steal guns and just about everything to prompt suspicion from the local police (who, too, do everything wrong to deal with Ryder). The Hitcher never gains momentum (probably because it's too short) and its flat, linear narrative and generic approach to every component of film-making ultimately pave the way for its downfall. 5 out of 10</fullReview>

What else is left to say?If you are familiar with the original (yes, I know you're tired of reading reviews praising the original but it's just a bone chilling psycho-thriller masterpiece, so shut the **** up), then you'd find this college-teen movie pretty damn laughable.No suspense, no tension, cheap acting, action-style one liners, crippled and twisted script... There's a lot of cheap stuff going on in this utterly retarded flick.I believe that adding a college chick as a main character in the plot and making a cheap *TRY* to "develop" her throughout the film until she becomes a strong and ready to kill bitch is the most ridiculous thing happening in the movie. And the main character boy with his Emo-gay-teen hairstyle is not helping fix things at all.This movie is a piece of trash. Not that anybody expected the opposite, of course. If you like teen movies, if you are into stupid college teen "I know what you did las summer" cheap plots, then you may enjoy the thing.Frankly, get the original and don't bother watching this "remake". Or rather "craptake".This film gets 1 out of 10 points. Yes, it *IS* that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it was good that they tried to update this film by doing a remake using modern day College students. The initial effect is promising as the young couple depart on a weekend away from school...and then the whole thing deteriorates rapidly into one error after another as the students reveal themselves to have next to nothing in terms of survival instincts. Is that some kind of comment on todays young adults being unable to identify a safe situation from a dangerous one? Maybe. I got a sense that the creators of this film were just out to make a quick buck with an easy ticket...yet there seems to be more here... maybe it is the film makers reaction to seeing the lack of original thinking that frequently seems to permeate the affluent sons and daughters of this ever expanding technological world. I know that affluent folk like other affluent folk and that tends to create rigid inflexible systems where educational advancement and post College hiring is concerned, so in a way maybe the film is a form of social commentary. They are just boobs advanced by boobs to feed a world of boobs. I could see the action going a very different way with other young adults, who maybe did not come from an affluent background. C'est la vie. A weak ending with no power also. In a way very frustrating but still better than a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've not seen the original of this so i don't have the ability to compare this with that and to be honest didn't know what to expect from this.I felt the film was pretty good to be honest. It wasn't groundbreaking but definitely great fun , believable and better than a lot of horror films getting made at the moment.What can you expect from a horror film today?! The story is very straight forward it's basically about a psychotic hitcher who hitches rides in order to find new victims. He's a psycho who simply loves to kill!. That's the bets bit there's no silly plot lines it's fun to him so he does it often.Cool eh?.One of the best bits of the film is definitely Sean Bean. He's very believable as "The Hitcher" and makes the film what it is to be honest although performances elsewhere are good enough for this.The film keeps you on the edge as mentioned in the summary. It keeps you guessing and you do actually wonder were can they take this film?. Plus some surprising twists and very jumpy moments it's all good!.And surprisingly there's some really well done car sequences/chases so there's a fair bit of action thrown in plus some decent blood n' guts for the hardcore horror fans!.All in all a decent horror film worth checking out.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing all the negative reviews on the Hitcher, I watched it at first without any big expectations. Not that I regret it because I was really well pleased. After convincing my friend who hates horror movies to watch this film with me, we both watched it expecting to have a couple of jump scenes but thankfully for him, only one or two occurred. Sean Bean was so excellent in his role, and so was Sophia Bush. She proved a lot of young pretty actresses that you CAN be pretty and be able to act at the same time. Zacharie Knighton, however, left me indifferent, but for the one and only reason that I didn't eye him as much as super sexy Sophia Bush. However, now that I mentioned the good things, the movie has cons too.For those who aren't familiar with either the original or the remake, the story revolves around a young couple (Bush &amp; Kinghton) who decide to go on a trip during Spring Break, where they meet a man who asks for a lift. They accept, but this is a wrong choice because that man is a murderer.The cons are mostly some scenes who seem awfully long for an 84 minutes movie. Besides that, all the violence, gore, and blood are worth your time.</fullReview>

In terms of whatever you wanna look at it, this was a bad film.A lot of the characteristics of the characters split into other tangents. This is especially evident with he female character.Apparently the people in the whole town are the most trigger happy and stupid people ever. The logic the police employ is terrible and they apparently violated almost all forms of due process.It's obvious that the reason Sophia Bush was cast in this film was for the purposes of tna.The action scene that featured Closer by Nine Inch Nails was not fitting whatsoever to the film.This film also employs many forms of 'scares' that are so tired and terribly written.This was a bad film.Calling people haters for seeing that this is a bad movie, well that's just stupid. The argument will come up that this movie isn't trying to become the next Seven Samurai is absurd. I didn't expect this film to be that at all. This movie takes itself serious and that is what makes it *beep* Even if you want a popcorn flick, this doesn't cut it. It employs too many gimmicks that are pulled off terribly and the it there many other films that you could watch for entertainment only.The acting... well, there was one quality that made this film not receive a 1. That was Sean Bean himself. Ms. Bush acts the typical wet and chased woman in horror films.The movie is violent and I would of reconsidered the R rating this got. It's a shame movies like Y Tu Mama Tambien have to go unrated because of sex, but this film does not get an NC-17.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I hear that a remake has been made for any film classic I get instantly skeptic. And there's plenty of good reasons for that. Remakes never ever seem to live up to the original, and this is no exception.In fact, this is probably one of the worst remakes ever. Together with that horrendous Psycho-remake with Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn, for example.Let me tell you in brief why this is so bad: first of all, the original was absolutely awesome. In this remake we see: - instead of the cold-blooded bada§§ Rutger Hauer as John Ryder there's some wimp acting all silly. John Ryder doesen't get that rough character at all that Hauer was able to give him. This was a big disappointment.- the youngsters are terrible actors, both of them. Sophia Bush only gets on my nerves, Jennifer Jason Leigh was so much better. That guy playing Jim Halsey is also worthless.- they've tried to copy some scenes almost completely from the original, and all of the attempts fail to be anywhere near as good as in the real Hitcher.- the directing is a lot worse than Robert Harmon.- the mood never gets settled in the film. Nothing is truly believable.I had to force myself through the end. It was a real pain, but I had to.Don't see this. See the brilliant, and much more terrifying, 1986 original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing with the tendency of making remakes of films which do not need to be remade,we now have the remake of The Hitcher.This remake is very mediocre and the changes which were made are negative.The original version had some interesting psychological connotations but,here,that thing has disappeared and we have a simple violent story with generic characters and an uninteresting villain.Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton only say their lines but they do not show any conviction.Sean Bean makes a good performance as the villain but he's very far away from Rutger Hauer,the villain in the original version.Bean has to say ridiculous dialogs but he's talented enough to make them sound credible.But,the worst element from this movie is how stupid it is.The main couple make completely idiot things for adjusting to the villain's plans.On a lot of occasions,a simple action or an explanation would have solved their problems but they keep making mistake by mistake for finally landing on ridiculous levels.The Hitcher(2007) is a very mediocre film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad For A Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best movie remakes take creative liberties with the original source material. "Ben-Hur," "The Magnificent Seven," "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," "The Thing," "Scarface," and "Planet of the Apes" are remakes that recaptured the essence of the originals. The latest remake that pays tribute to its memorable predecessor is freshman director Dave Meyers' R-rated version of "The Hitcher," a minor cult classic from 1986 starring Danish actor Rutger Hauer as a homicidal hitchhiker menacing a na?ve twenty-something guy (C. Thomas Howell of "Red Dawn") from Chicago on his way to San Diego to deliver a car to its owner. The new "Hitcher" (*** out of ****) raises the life and death stakes, intensifies the thrills and chills, and alters the gender roles of hero and heroine. Unlike director Robert Harmon's white-knuckled but strait-laced 1986 "Hitcher," the high octane Meyers remake promotes female empowerment. British actor Sean Bean, who kept Pierce Brosnan's James Bond jumping through hoops in the 007 epic "GoldenEye," steps into Rutger Hauer's homicidal shoes and dominates this road-kill melodrama with his sinister, tight-lipped presence. Best of all, former music video helmer Dave Meyers has pared down the paranoia-laden 98-minute pistol-packing pyrotechnics of the original to a lean, mean 84 minutes with nary a moment wasted.The new "Hitcher" differs in two important respects from the original. First, the cute young heroine shows up from the get-go instead of appearing late in the story. Second, the hero and heroine are both college students on spring break rather than a green kid delivering a car to its new owner and a waitress at a roadside diner. Unkempt Jim Halsey (Zackary Knighton of "The Prince &amp; Me") and gorgeous Grace Andrews (Sophie Bush of TV's "One Tree Hill") are cruising through New Mexico late one stormy night when they nearly collide with a guy in a trench coat in the middle of the highway. Jim and Grace pull into a convenience store for gas, and the trench coat guy, John Ryder (Sean Bean), arrives not long afterward, dripping wet and looking for a ride to the nearest town. Earlier, Grace had warned Jim not to give the guy a lift. Imagine her surprise when she comes out of the restroom and learns that Ryder will be joining them. Not long after Jim wheels out of the gas station, Ryder springs a switchblade on them. He threatens to gouge Grace's eyes out. Jim and Grace catch Ryder off guard and boot him out of the car into the middle of nowhere. When our protagonists resume their trip the next day, they think that they have seen the last of the hitcher, but they are dead wrong.Credibility is the last thing that should complicate a hair-raising homicidal maniac movie. For example, the indestructible hitcher survives repeated attempts on his life that would fell ordinary mortals. Before the authorities manage to capture him, Ryder guns down virtually half of the lawmen in New Mexico without a qualm. He carries an arsenal of hardware that Rutger Hauer did not have at his disposal in 1986. Like the best villains, Sean Bean's John Ryder never quits, even when the cops have him in handcuffs. Zackary Knighton and Sophie Bush qualify as a classic sympathetic couple. Bush's conversion from a babe with a bladder control problem to a tough-minded, shotgun-wielding Valkyrie, however, may disturb audiences accustomed to realism. Kyle Davis excels in a minor role as a slow-witted convenience store clerk with a farmer's tan, and Neal McDonough of "Flags of Our Fathers" registers a strong performance as Lieutenant Esteridge. Esteridge suspects from the start that Ryder is trying to frame Jim and Grace for the crimes that he himself is committing.People that saw the 1986 "Hitcher" will notice that the remake neither has the diner scene where the hero finds a severed finger in his French fries nor the scene where the villain guns down a police helicopter. Nevertheless, the new "Hitcher" doesn't stray far from the original in narrative content. Scenarist Eric Red, who scripted the first "Hitcher," collaborated on the remake with Jake Wade Hall, who penned the remake of "When a Stranger Calls." Red and Hall devise interesting ways for the hitcher to vanish and re-appear with a bang. Whereas Rutger Hauer smirked his way through the original "Hitcher," Sean Bean plays the psychopath with straightforward solemnity. Meanwhile, Meyer never lets this far-fetched fracas bog down in plot details. Make no mistake; the new remake of "The Hitcher" is not family friendly fare. Indeed, the filmmakers foreshadow its cruel intentions during the title credits when a car hits a jackrabbit and smears the critter across the highway. Altogether, "The Hitcher" proves that some remakes are worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Hitcher is worth picking up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Needless/unnecessary remake of the 1986 suspense thriller nonetheless manages to keep you hooked from beginning to end with it's nail biting suspense &amp; sometimes graphic murder scenes. The story much like the original pretty much remains the same, only this remake has a slight twist in it's story in that it's a couple not just a young man all by himself that winds up being terrorized. The couple is singled out for such treatment after they pick up a Hitcher on a dark stormy night &amp; live to regret it when they are relentlessly pursued by the cold blooded killer after they kick him out of their moving vehicle when he threatens to kill them both. The killer is soon thereafter leaving a trail of bodies in his wake all over the Texas landscape while the couple tries to prove their innocence to the local authority who believes they are responsible for the vicious slaughterings. Well acted &amp; directed, this remake arguably goes for more of a graphic approach than what the 1986 film did, offering some pretty nasty kills &amp; lots of tension throughout, all that out of the way, you pretty much have to ask yourself what was the point of remaking the original film when for one, it didn't need to be remade in the first place, the HITCHER (1986) was a perfectly watchable film as it stood &amp; didn't need the remake &amp; fans who saw the first film will know the films tricks &amp; what lies in store for some of the Hitchers victims, basically because the film never bothers to change or do anything different with the murder scenes except show a bit more blood &amp; just doing a different take on the scene where a victim is tied between two trucks &amp; could be split in half if the Hitcher puts his foot on the gas peddle, the twist here is rather than it being a girl, it's the lead hero Jim Halsey who winds up a potential victim. I also felt that the film's story wasn't as strong or as engaging as the original, where it was basically the lead hero all by himself with no one to talk to that found himself in this terrifying predicament &amp; although SEAN BEAN does well as the cold blooded psychopath, his performance pails in comparison to Rutger Hauer's in the original. Still it's worth a look for fans of the original or if you're just looking to kill time &amp; is a cut above most remakes being churned out recently.*** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hicher movie review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie had a cool chase scene but that was it. The whole movie was predictable because we have seen this type of movie over and over again. We have seen this movie over again because the victims run from place to place and have several attempts to kill the villain but don't. If I ever watched this movie again someone would have to pay me. If you have seen the first movie you will be disappointed in this stupid remake. My suggestion is save 7.50 and spend it on a different movie. I wish they could give me back the time I wasted in the theatre. I would have rather sat on a pile of needles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected to see a very complex plot line. Instead I was given gun shots, murder, death and no explanation. The movie contains gratuitous violence with no explanation or background to the story. They should just call it, "Some guy kills a lot of people and you have no idea why by the end of the movie!" The characters are underdeveloped to start out with. There is no clear ending or resolution. There is no closure. There is nothing that explains itself in this movie. It's upsetting, disappointing, a waste of $9 and a disgrace to filmmakers in the horror film industry. They either cut the film too much or they simply didn't develop the plot before they filmed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but Unnecessary Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While driving through the New Mexico Desert during a rainy night, the college students Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) and his girlfriend Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) give a ride to the hitchhiker John Ryder (Sean Bean). While in their car, the stranger proves to be a psychopath threatening the young couple with a knife, but Jim succeeds to throw him out of the car on the road. On the next morning, the young couple sees John in another car with a family, and while trying to advise the driver that the man is dangerous, they have an accident. While walking on the road, they find the whole family stabbed in the car, and John sees that the driver is still alive. He drives to a restaurant seeking for help, but the police blame Jim and Grace to the murder and send them to the police station. However, John kills the policemen and pursues the couple, playing a tragic and violent mouse and cat game with Grace and Jim."The Hitcher" (!986) is one of the best thriller ever made and a classic of the genre. This remake is not a bad movie; actually it is decent but absolutely unnecessary. The story has minor modifications, with the inclusion of Jim's girlfriend instead of the waitress, and Sean Bean is good as a psychopath, but Rutger Hauer was better and better with his cynical and dark John Ryder. There is an exaggerated sequence, when John Ryder alone shoots three police cars with armed officers and a helicopter, but in the end this film entertains. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "A Morte Pede Carona" ("The Death Hitchhikes")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher-2007... yet another slasher movie featuring a couple of pretty kids on a joy ride through hick-ville... why is it that we cannot come up with a remake that doesn't involve screaming eye-candy??? Look I love to look at beautiful girls on screen as much as the next guy but come on! First let's start with the story line... it starts with a cliché cocktail of pop music which screams "I'm MTV Movie award worthy!!!" A young couple driving home for spring break, when they have an encounter with a shady character who tries to make their lives a living hell on wheels. Honestly... this was an hour and forty five minutes of my life that i'll never get back... this movie tried to be a light hearted yet graphic tale of road rage, but had I never seen the original i would think it was teen girl power flick. I recommend, the original before watching the remake, why? because unless you feel like watching an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog on on film... you'll end up feeling like you just got your big toe stepped on be an angry midget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective and creepy re-make.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original years back and again pretty recently and judging by the reviews on here I wasn't expecting much. However this is a far better film than I thought it would be. The cinematography is excellent and the two leads are convincing and likable. There were plenty of jump out the seat moments and Sean Bean an actor who doesn't always convince puts in one of his best performances. If I hadn't seen the original ( which is not much better in my opinion)then this would have been an even better watch. Re-makes are often scorned ( rightfully in many cases) but I think this is a very good example of one that gets it right, bringing an old perceived classic to the attention of a new generation. Well worth a watch if you don't expect too much especially if you haven't seen the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher Might Work Fine in Birth Control !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the lead boy asks the evil Hitcher "why are you doing this?", meaning the absurd mass killing, to have him answering in smile "..you know !" this is an obvious wink to us that the movie is nothing but a crap feast which doesn't need any justifications, serious base, or originality. Instead, it builds itself, shamelessly, on other movies with crazy killers and hopeless victims. Therefore all what it wanted is suspense, blood and gore, as PURE B HORROR. The thing is as that pure B horror; it didn't make much.In the cinematic horror encyclopedia the title character has to be in the "weakest monsters" section. Freddy Krueger, in Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street, did more creative and justified evil, consequently unpredictable and believable in the same time. Differently, in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, the horror came unexpectedly from Mother Nature, so the evilness was total and bizarre to fight. Now John Ryder, of 2007, isn't an angry ghost or a nature's mystery, despite how the movie refers that he could be the second (The Birds' hint at the motel's TV) !To add more fuel it goes beyond. At the chase on the road, with many police cars and helicopter, (Sean Bean) as Mr. Hitcher seemed silly while vaporizing all of that in seconds and by one gun. See, he did it simply and coldly while he's not The Terminator, neither Bond. The viewpoint of the movie's makers is : he did it so we can see him doing it, and that's it !I thought he could have represented the far and away road's evil to those civilized civilian urban creatures, as someone distinguished than them with slickness, experience about that world, and criminal mind. But the movie pushed it to be serial killer without a cause, who survives everything obscurely ! So the boastfulness of how absent the killer's motive is made him like a cartoonish madness on screen, or some character ran from an American cheap horror. Both ways it seemed deficient and lazily made; hence negligible !Away from that, (The Hitcher) as a Horror/Thriller couldn't be one in the first place. In fact I spent most of its time laughing ! The thrill is idiot; I have seen all of that before, yet as freighting. Every dumb event I predicted the script utterly fulfilled; which produced funny sense of inner bore (imagine messy and cheesy complications, and they'll all happen !). That doesn't befit a Horror/Thriller at all !They did many provoking points perfectly : The heroine must be killed. She didn't kill the evil guy while she had the chance to, or while he's begging her to do it as well ! The policeman discovers, in great intelligence, that the 2 leads didn't do all the murders, since there is a face drawn with blood on the police station's glass (??!). And that dude, the lead, is so lenient when it comes to anybody flirts with his girl; somehow I believed that he deserved what happens to him !The 2 leads, Zachary Knighton and Sophia Bush, aren't distinct by any mean. Although Sophia Bush is less worse but her legs made me disgusted ! Sean Bean is always great to watch. I just felt sad that his abilities weren't used in relatively meaningful anything. Clear that the movie near its end wanted some horrific horror to heat itself up. However the scene of severing the lead was extremely awful. Some shots like that portray the nastiness of not cinema but the world. It's highly sick thing to make, for highly sick viewers to enjoy ! It's empty. I deem most of it a solid, real funny, comedy. And the rest is sadistic torture. At any case I won't watch it again. It's one of the most wasted wastes of time I have ever experienced. Still its only amusing point, that gave me the biggest laugh already, is when I thought how the title character can work so fine in birth control plans.. twisted plans. According to this movie; this guy can reduce nations single-handedly and in no time !P.S : Can someone tell me what was the necessity of the heroine needing to urinate at the very start ?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't pick me up.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thjis is the remake of the Rutger Hauer classic, about John Ryder, the titular character, and his unknown rationale for killing road users.This time, the very good Sean Bean plays Ryder, but there is a little twist in the movie as girl power comes along, and Jim Halsey takes a back seat in the action.Michael bay is really on to a good thing with his Platinum Dunes company. he regurgitates classic or cult horror movies, puts good looking people in the victim roles, and happily watches newbies who have never seen the originals, or haters who want to criticise the film, line his wallet with ticket fees.Luckily, i'm one of those rare people who don't mind if these films are re-made. It's not going to affect my life, and i like to see just what has been done to justify a re-make.Bean is excellent as Ryder, though he doesn't have the mysticism of Hauer, he is still menacing and strange enough to own the film.It's certainly more violent than the original, and more flashy and better made, but not as tense. there are some shot for shot scenes in the film, and the script is a lot poorer, but it's dumb fun, and good enough to be one of the better re-makes of recent times.It doesn't go on for too long, and the slim running time benefits the film, as it never really becomes boring, but we never really focus on the two victims long enough to really care.A good Friday night movie, but instantly forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the remake trend is getting tiresome, I was a little excited to see this when it came out. Unfortunately never got the chance to see it, and as the months went on before and after it went to video, the interest level started going down a bit for some reason. Finally decided to pick it up and watch it. A few things that irked me a bit. First of all, the opening with All American Rejects playing. I think they're a decent band, but not horror movie material. Had flashbacks of the Fog remake with Fall Out Boy playing in the beginning. And it also seemed to be the kind of remake that tried to be the original movie with a few minors changes, not try to be its own movie (the kind of remake I'm more of a fan of). But as the movie went along, I found myself enjoying it. First of all, great casting on The Hitcher himself! Sean Bean is no Rutger Hauer, but man did he own the screen whenever he was on it! Gotta admit he struck a little fear into my heart a few times! The action sequences were intense, my personal favorite being the one with NIN playing in the background (I could watch that one over and over!). And while it's not something to totally base how good a movie really is, seeing Sophia Bush in a short skirt didn't really harm the movie too. Only major problem I had is, if you're gonna try to recreate most of the scenes from the original, where the heck is the finger in the fries scene?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>violence at its best, one of the best remakes of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>there seems to be a pattern of movies going around, a pattern that involves the stereotype that directors have failed to make decent remakes. "The hitcher" does not follow that pattern. it's in its own world, it's a very violent, gory and suspenseful film, throughout.The Hitcher is about a young couple (Zachary Knighton and Sophia Bush)who are pursued by a psychotic killer(Sean Bean) who slaughters passengers on interstates. Yes the plot is familiar and yes it might seem a little clichéd, but i don't care about how clichéd the plot is, all i care about is that this film was decent. lots of blood, lots of injuries and violence is what The Hitcher is all about.to be honest when i first saw the trailer for the movie, i wasn't expecting a lot, rather, i underestimated it. i thought "How good is a movie gonna be when it's just about a psychotic hitchhiker" but hey what i found was completely unexpected. IRONY. if you are a fan of horror films and are desperate for a decent horror remake the sweet remedy you need. one of the best movies 2007. and definitely one of the few best remakes.</fullReview>

If you pay attention in the movie, there are many twists and turns along with lots of irony and writer creativity. It is a lot more than just "a guy who hitchhikes, scares people, and kills." In order to appreciate the film, you have to have an open mind. Those of you who reviewed this movie saying that you couldn't sit through it for more 5 minutes because it was "boring" or "plotless" obviously don't pay attention to the movie.

		<fullReview>In the past month I have watched nothing but meaningful movies such as American Beauty, Memento, Eyes Wide Shut, and Shawshank Redemption. Coming into this movie I had seen horror movies before, but this one just did not live up to any of them.First off, it was very short, just under 90 minutes. Not what I'm used to. Secondly, the movie was not suspenseful as much. My friend called every scene back to back because it was so predictable. The other friend who saw the first Hitcher saw some parts coming as well. Thirdly, there were no gory scenes that made the movie stand out except for one scene, but nothing much was shown. Fourthly, there were many obvious mistakes, such as the windshield of the 442 kept going from completely broken to broken to dented to dirty in different scenes. It was very annoying, and that kept my attention more than the movie.Overall I thought the movie was pretty bad. The plot was fine, but they never told us why he was hitching rides to kill people. There's no reasoning behind it. That really kills the movie. Like my friend said, "They could have avoided all this is he just kept his f***ing eyes on the road".</fullReview>

Fantastic deleted scenes, loved the behind the scenes shorts that really gave some insight on how good movies are really made. Sean Bean is excellent, taking over Rutger Hauer's original character perfectly. He really has a way of making you gulp over the smallest, innocent gesture- because you know its not small, its everything with the Hitcher. Sophia Bush is okay, the cute girlfriend that steals the show from her whiney boyfriend. Zachary Knighton is forgettable, though whiney just like C. Thomas Howell from the original made him. Neal McDonough is fantastic as the one cop who wants to believe the kids, and knows there is more than meets the eye to this story- he seems to be the only one. Mr. McDonough was just surprisingly excellent. This is the movie to see before any cross country trip!</fullReview>

On the plus side it was good that not everyone was against them (TCM, Saw, etc.) and the music was alright as well, other than those two things, this movie is hardly even worth a review. 4/10 wait till it hits the tele before you throw down ten bones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitcher is a ride worth taking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the most demented movie monster since Hannibal Lecter, Dave Meyer's Meyer's The Hitcher is the most terrifying slasher pic of the last few years. Buckle up and pray.Collegiate couple Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) and Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) hit the road in a 1970 Oldsmobile 442, en route to spring break, but their pleasure trip soon turns into a waking nightmare after encountering the mysterious hitchhiker John Ryder, a.k.a. The Hitcher (Sean Bean). The initial encounters with Ryder are increasingly off-putting for Grace and Jim, and they bravely fight back when he ambushes them. But they are truly blindsided when he implicates them in a horrific slaying and continues to shadow them. The open road becomes a battleground of blood and metal as, in trying to elude not only Ryder but also New Mexico State Police Lieutenant Esteridge's (Neal McDonough) officers, Grace and Jim must fight for their lives and face their fears head-on.Meyer's, in his feature film debut, draws heavily from his nearly 100 music videos, giving The Hitcher a fast paced, no holds barred energy that can only come from the MTV generation. From the opening scene (reminiscent of Oliver Stones Natural Born Killers), to the shockingly gruesome final moments; Meyer's grabs viewers by the throat and drags them, kicking and screaming, through the 83-minute combination of horror, thriller and action flicks. The short run time helps to insure that the audience is kept on the edge of their seats while still allowing a connection with the characters that is the key to a gripping ride.A remake of Eric Red's 1986 film of the same name, The Hitcher breaks free of the typical remake curse by infusing a memorable soundtrack with enough action and common sense to appeal to viewers of both genders, though the film is decidedly turned toward the male 18-24 demographic. The characters in general are utterly believable, avoiding the stereotypical plot foibles that curse the generic horror flick. The plot line has a few kinks, and there are enough directorial flubs to keep film buffs giggling, but overall the film serves its purpose as an in-your-face slash-fest infused with a healthy does of explosions and car crashes. In traditional horror formula, there is a last girl, and to coin a phrase from SAW?oh yes, there will be blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst hunks of crap to ever plop into a theater. The actors suck all levels of ass and beyond. The skank Sophia Bush is terrible and should'nt be in the movie business in any capacity. The idiot who played the "boyfriend" should be cleaning out toilets in the park for a living because he is nauseating and has zero talent.What's up with the NIN song during the car chase? It was so out of place. As a matter of fact, all the music was out of place. This movie was trying to be a GAP ad and a horror movie all at the same time.This is one of the worst movies of all time. People were walking out of the theater and I would have been one of them had I not had free tickets. Even then I wanted to start a riot and burn the building down after seeing this abomination.That Bush chick is so freaking terrible. DO NOT GO SEE THIS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost didn't go and see this due to my standing semi-boycott of remakes, but I was happily surprised by this film. I really wanted it to be a bloody scary mess, and I knew Sean Bean had it in him to be a great bad guy, and I thought Sophia Bush could make a great protagonist. I was glad I was right on all counts, Sean was great, he pulled of the nice stranger /psycho switch really well, and without any cheesy theatrics, and he played really well off of Sophia Bush, who was really easy to empathize with given the great job Sean was doing of being scary as hell. Over all, a fun movie experience, I'll recommend it to friends and probably pick up the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most intense movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I haven't seen the original, so I can't comment on whether it's better or not than the original.The 'Hitcher' played by Sean Bean brings all the intense, riveting and yes, insane action to this movie. Another of my favorites, Patriot Games (1992), features Mr. Bean in a similar role as an Irish terrorist. If you've seen that think of Bean's character amped up about 4 times.A movies I would compare this to would be the remake (yes...another remake) of Cape Fear starring Robert DeNiro as the crazed, homicidal character. Both of these movies feature a real baddie who just keeps coming back more frightening than his previous appearance in the films. The best part of both of these performances is that the intensity and fear generating action is done without any props or artificial changes to the character...it's all pure acting.This movie seems to come up on the slasher category which I really don't understand. Many of the war type films have as much blood and gore, but aren't considered slashers.Finally this movie fits in another genre of film that involves the changing of an average person into a character capable of doing anything. The movie Straw Dogs featuring Dustin Hoffman is a good example of another one of these films.Hope this helps...</fullReview>

Sean Bean was wonderful, the female lead was stupid, and so was her boyfriend, but what can you expect out of a horror movie? MARVELOUS ACTING for the script, and a marvelous portrayal of the original movie.I feel like those who disliked it were simply those who do not believe in remakes of "classic movies". Sure, we missed out on a finger in the fries, but aside from that? Great spin with the female living instead of the male. Granted, the alternate ending was a little shabby but all in all? This movie couldn't have been better. NIN during the cop killing scene? Amazing! Sean Bean being sexier than life? Amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A complete waste of time; Rutgr Haur, C. Thomas Howell, Mark Isham's ambient score (the synergistic energy and charisma of the first film ) are gone in this one. Hitcher remake utters a sigh of life albeit briefly when the wonderfully acted police captain comes on the scene. I think a lot of younger people like the remake because they are impatient with the original . . . imagination and an ability to tap into atmosphere is missing from people "too young" to see The Hitcher in 1986. Grand Theft Auto, the original PC game is a lot more fun than this movie: The Hitcher remake left me very empty inside . . . all the lines from the first film are redelivered in this version and all the scenes are re shot in this version yet this version is devoid of the charisma and adroit kinkiness of Rutger Haur's almost love-interest toward C. Thomas Howell in the first one. It seems like the slavish filmmakers of this remake forgot to include that in the script. John Ryder, unlike in the first one, seems to wants to "do business" more with the Grace character in this one, yet he delivers all the lines from the first one to Jim Halsey and it makes little sense . . .Ryder was jealous of Grace in the first one as though he was spurned by Jim Halsey. and the the people are meaner in this version and the filmmakers rip-off the scene e mass of their own Texas chainsaw massacre movie . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really know how to go about describing this movie. I didn't see the original so I can't compare. However, I know that Rutger Hauer could be downright terrifying while doing somethin mundane like brushing his teeth and Sean Bean really has to try to be frightening. I'm not saying Bean didn't give a good performance, because it was actually pretty decent. The kids however, are a different story. It's not that their acting was bad necessarily, but I have to say I hated the girl. She was supposed to be this tough Ripley style character and she just didn't fit the bill at all. She was actually pretty annoying and too plain looking to be a sexy horror lead. For a rated R movie I felt the level of violence was pretty low. Sans a couple nice effects at the end, this could have easily been a PG-13 movie. I'm not gonna say it sucked, but I hesitate to say it was okay. So if you really want to see a horror movie in theatres this weekend, you might as well check it out. But if you really want to see a good movie in theatres this weekend, I would pass up the Hitcher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre with a gem or two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie in itself is in my opinion, mediocre. See . . .from what I recall this is a remake of an 80's version of the movie. Having not seen that I can't make comparisons but looking at the cast list there was no Grace character.Anyways . . .what did I like about it? Really what I enjoyed was Sean Bean as "John Ryder". He did well in portraying the unknown maniac with no past with the desire to die. I found him most interesting to watch if I had to pick anyone to be interested in at all. Of course at the time myself and my friend who I watched it with kept teasing the poor guy and we kept joking about how he should have been shot with an arrow like he was in Lord of the Rings.Unfortunately that was what little I liked. Here's the problems I have with the movie: First off, it's an o.k. pace up until the end. As you can read by the summary I wrote, she shot him and then movie was over. There was no aftermath or revelations or wrap up. You're left hanging with an anti-climatic conclusion and it irritated me slightly. You need a good momentum with movies. You start out calm, rise to the climax, ride through the climax then come down at a reasonable pace, and in that you should be left satisfied. Here, you're taken up to the climax and left with little climax, and then you're left to crash to the ground with no support.The next problem is with the main antagonist himself: he referred to as John Ryder. He is as they put, a ghost. You know nothing about him from the start and after everything is said and done you only know that he wanted to die. But why did he want to die? And where did he acquire the skills he used to take down so many officers so proficiently? None of these questions are answered and with his death, they never will be. Unless they explain this in a director's cut, you're always going to be left wondering. This also irked me.Even the main cast members aren't fleshed out. Grace and Jim, you don't know HOW they got together, how long they've been going out, etc.. The only thing you know about them is they're visiting her parents and friends in New Mexico. It's hard to feel for these two as a result as they go through all this turmoil. Even when Jim died, I didn't feel bad for him. I honestly found him to be annoying and was half glad to see him ripped apart. Bad driver and bad sense of judgment. Of course the latter needed to be there for the movie to exist but still. I think what I think. You'll feel more for Grace than anyone . . .but heck I felt more for the slain Christian family and they're there for what? 5 minutes? Makes you wonder . . .There were a couple of good jumps but when a movie really leans on using those you're enjoyment is less and less when you look at the other flaws. This movie did not scare me except one time; when they were hiding in the trailer there was a cobweb with a giant spider. I cringed and looked away when the spider was there. That was the ONLY time I was scared and I'm sure that was not the intention of the scene or the movie.It's really nothing new to the genre. Aside from the death of Jim this movie would have been okay for a younger crowd and not given the R rating. It's more PG-13/14+ than anything, and only through that particular death do I believe that it was given an R.Overall? I have to give this movie . . .let's say 6/10. If the characters had been fleshed out a little better, some explanation on John's abilities, a little scarier and of course, if the ended had been more climatic and more easy to come down from instead of simply crashing, we would have a better rating. But that's where it stands. I would have given it a 4.5 but really . . .I have to give some points to Sean Bean. He did do well portraying the maniac hitcher, and it wasn't his fault that the movie otherwise suffered due to the flaws I pointed out.If you insist on seeing this I recommend you rent the DVD when it comes out. Save the 10 bucks on the movie ticket and whatever you spend on popcorn and drinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a few hours to kill, I stopped in to see this movie fully expecting it to be another typical Hollywood horror remake - in other words, garbage. I did have a problem with the setup, the way the Hitcher was introduced and the implausibility of the couple to then be willing to give him a ride, and if the movie let on why the Hitcher was going on this maniacal murder spree, I missed it. On top of that, the tractor-trailer killing - how it could have been pulled off - was illogical. No, it is certainly not a great movie and not even a very good movie, but I would watch it again at some point ... which is good enough for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(My Synopsis) A sadistic killer, with an instinct to kill and a desire to die, loves to randomly pick his victims by hitchhiking on the roads of New Mexico. Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) and Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) are two college students going on spring break, when they unfortunately pick up this hitchhiker, John Ryder (Sean Bean). Grace and Jim learn real fast that it was a bad mistake to give a hitchhiker a ride. What was going to be a fun time now turns into a nightmare.(My Comment) This is one bad movie. The only thing I liked about it was that it was short. Even though it was short, I still looked at my watch twice. I believe this movie will probably be on DVD by next week. For a horror movie that was supposed to scare you, it didn't hit the mark, because I wasn't scared at all. The only good outcome of this movie is the fact that it will reinforce to the young generation the reason why you don't pick up hitchhikers. If you go to this movie, I must tell you that there are a lot of scenes with blood and violence, and it is not a movie for children. (Rogue Pictures, Run time 1:23, Rated R)(2/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An young couple (Zachary Knighton and Sophia Bush) are on their way on vacation for spring break. Along the way, they pick up an mysterious stranger by the name of John Ryder (Sean Bean). This stranger starts harassing them on the road. Once they kick John out from the moving car. John starts stalking the couple on the road and leaving John's dead victims in the highway. Making the couple look guilty from the cops. The couple find themselves repeated tormented by this deranged killer.Directed by Dave Meyers made an technically well made horror thriller, based on the superior 1986 underrated film of the same name. Which the original was much more vivid, funnier and sadomasochistic horror movie. But the best thing of this extremely flawed film is Sean Bean's lead performance, which is certainly well cast after Rutger Hauer lead role in the original. But the remake biggest mistake is making the couple lead characters, since in the original was a lonely motorist on his way to California was more effective. Although making a couple in the story line, it isn't bad after seeing it a few times.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreem (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending and Amusing Behind the Scenes featurettes. This remake is certainly inferior to the die hard fans of the excellent original. But those, who haven't seen the 1986 picture will probably enjoy this more. Written by Jake Wade Wall (When a Stranger Calls "2006") and Eric Bernt (Romeo Must Die, Surviving the Game, Virtuosity). Screenwriter:Eric Red (Who wrote the original), who still credited for the remake had nothing to do with this new version. Filmmaker:Michael Bay, who produced more successful remakes like "The Amityville Horror" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". He's one of the producers of this watchable but uninspired new take. Super 35. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great horrors are a rare kind these past few years and great re-makes are even more rare.This movie was already on a high horse when they casted brilliant Sean Bean for the role of "Jon Ritter or whoever he is". The story just kept getting better with a amazing, talented Sophia Bush signing up for the role of Grace Andrews. Zachary Knighton was solid but not even close to performances Bean and Bush delivered. The script had to be re-made almost completely and the solutions they came up with work well but still are pretty far from real. Another thing that is fairly surprising for this movie is a really good soundtrack. First scene even begins with All-American Rejects- Move Along which really pumps up the atmosphere of the beginning and enhances few comic reliefs in the first scenes.One of the biggest let downs of the movie is length. Whole movie is about 85 minutes which pass very quickly.One thing that is irreplaceable is the feeling at the ending, pretty similar to one you get when you finish watching Brad Pitt movie "Se7en". So intense feeling in your stomach and a big emotions that overwhelm your brain.Watch this movie if not for the stunts, for 2 actors that gave their best performance that will surely establish The Hitcher as a movie of the new coming generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS*** Absolutely mind-blowing and shocking. It was very brutal and bloody and intense, and that's really all this movie is meant to be.Sean Bean (Flightplan, National Treasure, Silent Hill) is absolutely horrifying. He plays the part so well it actually made me believe he was an actual hitcher/murderer. Surprisingly, the other unknown actors were pretty good. Most of them weren't in many big films.So, the whole plot line: A college couple Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) and Jim Hasley (Zachary Knighton) encounter a hitcher named John Ryder (Sean Bean), and little do Grace and Jim know, that he is very, very dangerous. They pick him up in their 1970 Oldsmobile 442, and Grace's and Jim's waking nightmare begins. Their initial encounters with John Ryder are increasingly uncomfortable and off-putting for Grace and Jim, and they bravely fight back when Ryder ambushes them. But, they are horrifically blindsided when he involves them in a terrifying slaying and continues to shadow them. And soon, the open highway road becomes a dangerous place and becomes a battleground of blood, metal, and guns, and trying not to avoid Ryder but also the New Mexico State Police Lieutenant Esteridge's (Neal McDonough) officers, Grace and Jim must bravely and terrifyingly fight for their lives and face their most nightmarish fears head-on.There are also many gory parts in the movie. NOTE: THIS MAY EXTREMELY SPOIL THE MOVIE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THE GORY PARTS UNTIL THEY SEE THE MOVIE.--A man is tied between two trucks, and is then torn apart. --A man's throat is slashed, and blood spurts and sprays. It's very graphic. Yay.I can't think of any more gory parts at the moment, but I think those will give you a pretty clear idea on how gory the movie is.It's a brutal adventure and it's an awesome movie.

		<shortDescription>Stylish, visceral, and reverent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the enduring fascinations of Robert Harmon's 1986 film The Hitcher is its defiance of easy categorization. Critical response was notably unkind to this unusual blend of horror fable (the hitchhiker who turns out to be a psychopath), action flick, and the Hitchcockian trope of a wrongfully-accused innocent trying to clear his name. To this day, there hasn't been anything quite like it (and indeed, no cinema villain quite like Rutger Hauer's violence-defined John Ryder).With its sense of highway-bound horror and Grand Guignol automotive setpieces, The Hitcher, in theory, seems most suited to the recent string of Michael Bay-produced remakes, all of which have hammered on the accelerator (with predictably dismal results). The surprise of Hitcher 07 is that it's, well?good. Surprisingly respectful of its source (original screenwriter Eric Red gets a credit here, as well), this Hitcher contains enough faithful reproductions of scenes (amplified in terms of noise, grue, and gore, but well-executed nonetheless), plus enough new stuff to attract horror fans and die-hard fans of the original. Instead of being just a passable remake of a great film, Hitcher 07 comes very close to being a great film in its own right.So close.The plot is as before: Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) picks up college sweetheart Grace (Sophia Bush) for a spring-break road trip back to Grace's place; as daylight fades and a rainy night settles in, Jim nearly hits a shadowy hitchhiker standing in the middle of the road. At a gas station a few miles down the road, John Ryder (Sean Bean), the hitchhiker, catches up with the couple; Jim, regretting the previous run-in, offers the stranger a ride?and the less said about the rest of the film, the better (if the opening shot of a cute bunny getting splattered by a speeding car doesn't clue you in, a police dog snacking on its dead owner certainly will).Performance-wise, the film fluctuates: not surprisingly, this is yet another Bay production cast mostly on bland looks over acting ability. Bush and Knighton are blandly passable, their shortcomings (mostly) covered up by fast edits, loud noises, and splattering gore (the dialog, thankfully, is not Shakespeare). Though considered a casualty of 1980s teen flicks, C. Thomas Howell gave a good, highly underrated performance in the original. Sean Bean, picking up Rutger Hauer's trench coat and blank-stare psychosis, is the driving force (pardon the pun) behind this Hitcher--as a big fan of Hauer's performance, I can say that Bean is every bit as good, and just as diabolically passive to committing murder; there are moments when his shifty glances, parted lips, and passive delivery (the "I want to die" chant is effectively reproduced) blows the rest of the cast out of the water.Hitcher 07, like most recent remakes, is a blood-spattered affair (whereas the original implied more than it shown), but exercises a certain restraint in its violence compared to, say, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre prequel. The film presents bloody death as the stuff of spine-tightening, mortality-reminding dread instead of a recipe for desensitization; there were several moments that left me particularly shaken (including a jaw-dropping "quartering" merely implied in the original). Again, this is helped by Bean's totally convincing portrayal of the soulless, cunning, and smart psychopath.***SPOILER*** While Hitcher 07 is quite faithful to its 1986 parent, its worth as a companion is heavily influenced by its third-act twist, where Grace?not Jim?takes on Ryder in a spectacular climactic showdown. While the setup is well-done, Bush's lack of acting skill seriously impairs the 'change' she seems to suddenly undergo at the end. The politics of the scene?pitting a woman against the killer in a genre where the gender is presented as weak (save for the "Final Girl" theory), and extraneous to the plot unless naked or dead?are not daring, but the alteration of the original film's narrative is?and, save for Bush's total lack of 'tough chick' pathos, the reversal works, even though Bean's Ryder gallantly carries much of the scene's weight.As with nearly every remake, The Hitcher isn't entirely necessary, but it is effective. Most updates of old films merely encourage viewers to revisit their much-better source (and to those who haven't seen the '86 Hitcher, do so before seeing the new one), but this makes for a nice companion piece?familiar enough to engage fans, and tweaked enough to stand as its own entity.I just wish some of its "aesthetic touches" had been jettisoned during pre-production.</fullReview>

That's more than I can say for the remake of 'Black Christmas' which was a pathetic attempt at recreating one of the scariest and best original horror flicks of all time. At least I didn't fall asleep during 'Hitcher' like I did 'Christmas'. And another thing...who the heck ever said the original 'Hitcher' was all that great anyway? C. Thomas Howell couldn't act his way out of a paper sack...I mean, did he even DO anything else after that film? Methinks not. So quit making the original 'Hitcher' and C. Thomas Howell sound so much better than they actually were while bashing the new 'Hitcher'. As far as I'm concerned this was a very good remake in comparison to worthless trash like the new 'Black Christmas'. 'nuff said!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than recent horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era where horror movies rely too much on gore and have weak plots like Hostel and Turistas, the Hitcher was able to mix in a little bit of everything that makes for a solid horror film: a diabolical killer, suspense, some gore, and attractive women. The movie focuses on a couple Grace and Jim (played by Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton respectively) traveling by car to party with Grace's friends. On their way they narrowly miss hitting a hitchhiker but instead of picking him up they speed away because he seems creepy. Later, while the couple is refueling, the same hitchhiker appears at the gas station thanks to a lift from a truck driver. Jim decides to give the hitchhiker, who reveals himself as John Ryder (Sean Bean), a lift to a nearby motel despite the concern of his girlfriend Grace. Soon after they pull away from the gas station, it becomes apparent that Ryder is a lunatic. He pulls a knife on Grace and is about to kill her before Jim slams on the brakes and, with the help of Grace, is able to force Ryder from the car. Unfortunately, Grace's cell phone fell out of the car with Ryder so the two have no way of contacting the authorities. The rest of the movie involves Ryder hunting down the couple in what turns out to be a trail of mayhem. On a negative note, parts of the plot were slightly contrived but this did little to take away from the overall mood of the film. For those who like "Wolf Creek" type suspense movies and are tired of overly gory horror films then the Hitcher is definitely a good bet. Also, Sean Bean gives quite a chilling performance as the fiendish John Ryder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original Hitcher when it came out and it was really scary psychologically. A lot of it's ability to hold tension is dependent on the Hitcher himself. Rutger Hauger was really freaking scary. He had a unpredictability element that this new guys doesn't have. That being said, this new guys is great. A great actor and very scary. There just something missing. Maybe the script or direction, not sure. The two kids aren't as good as C. Thomas Howel. He had some kind of quality that made him seem excruciatingly vulnerable without being just plain stupid. I also remember feeling sorry for him...like he'd had a rough time in life, now this! I think that really adds to the tension when you care so much about the kid. Those little intangible elements were missing from the leads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the original Hitcher but that doesn't matter. This version is full of suspense and horror unlike any other movie I've seen. There was something about John Ryder (Bean) that made me both horrified and intrigued. For the whole movie you are stuck wondering why this man is killing anyone and everyone and even at the end you're still puzzled when it comes to his motives. This movie is about a young college couple (Bush and Knighton) who are on their way home for spring break and while driving down the highway at night in the pouring rain they nearly hit a man whose car is on the side of the road and seems to have broke down. After nearly hitting him Jim decides to see if he is alright but his girlfriend, Grace, refuses to stop for this stranger. After driving off they stop at the gas station only to find that this mysterious man has stopped there as well and feeling guilty about the incident, Jim decides to give him a ride. ... big mistake... Even if people hate the movie and complain about how unrealistic it is or how it's a dumb remake (load of bull) a lot of people said that the chase seen made up for it all, even though a short scene, it gets the adrenaline going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was not expecting this remake to even remotely match the brilliance of the 1986 original. And it does not, but it is a great movie anyway.Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) and Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) are driving through New Mexico headed for their Spring Break destination. Unfortunately, they meet and pick up John Ryder (Sean Bean), a hitchhiker, and all hell breaks loose.Most of the music in this film is great, and while it lacks a good deal of the mystic contained in the 1986 version, it does have some genuine shocks and does not stray too far from the original work. Some of the chase scenes are to die for, pardon the pun.See The Hitcher (1986) first, and then see this and decide for yourself which one is the best. This one is worth viewing, but it is certainly not for those easily upset by violence, as it is everywhere here. So many remakes lately have been awful, but I am happily impressed with this one--director Dave Meyers pulled this off competently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of the most enjoyable movies of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From start to finish Dave Meyer's "The Hitcher" does not disappoint. Given the fact that it is only 83 minutes long, it really is a great roller-coaster of jumps, blood, awesome acting, car turmoil and has some great choices of music to go with it. What I liked most about "The Hitcher" was Sophia Bush's role as Grace. She acted splendidly as I had expected and I can't wait to see more work from her, she really is one of the best upcoming actresses of this generation. Ironically, the movie is based on Sean Bean yet he has very few scenes but with the scenes he was given, he made them his own. Zachary Knighton who is fairly new to the movie industry gave an almighty performance and was the backbone for the story. As soon as "Move Along" by The All-American Rejects began to play as Grace and Jim's road trip to spring break began within the first 5 minutes of the movie, I knew that I was not going to be disappointed. Bearing in mind that one of the genre's "The Hitcher" comes under is horror, I'd be more inclined to say that this is more of a thriller than a horror movie. If you are looking for a movie that has tonnes of blood, this isn't your thing but if you can take a bit of blood along with some great jumps and car chases, then this is for you. I'm not going to bore you with the plot/storyline but this movie is just about two people who accidentally run into John Ryder (Sean Bean) on their way to Spring break. After hesitantly agreeing to offer him a ride to the next hotel, John Ryder takes a turn for the worse and threatens the couple. From then on, everything is far from rosy for the pair who get into big trouble with the police, have many more encounter's with John Ryder, risk their lives and go through some of the best car chases I have seen. I recommend "The Hitcher" to everyone who enjoys a great thrill ride. Go and see the movie now, it really is worth it!My only fault with the movie is that it should have been longer and was quite fast-paced which was a bit of a disappointment.Grade: A+ Rating: 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step above the recent failure in the thriller movie genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, cast aside the idea that this is a remake. Many people have not seen originals and remakes simply get great ideas out to a newer audience! This movie is a breath of fresh air compared with the crap that Hollywood has been feeding the horror/thriller buffs. While the movie DOES have gore it is not a senseless bloodbath. There is more horror in what you don't see (such as a young family slaughtered in their car off-screen) than the obvious gore. The movie never slows down, which is great for an audience that wants an intense thrill ride. Sophia Bush does a fine job of acting and Sean Bean is convincing as the psychopath, John Ryder. Do not going into this movie with a desire to have deep thoughts...it's simply a fine job of entertainment and mindless fun. Other than a few plots holes, the movie was fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Hitcher is possibly the best merging of action and pure, bloody horror that the world has ever seen. It's fast paced, scary, gory, and exploitative. It's also a very high set bar to match, let alone beat, if one wants to copy it, and the remake doesn't really reach that bar. The difference between the original and the remake is that the remake lacks the cruel and dark sense of morality that the original has (very similar to the original and remake of Dawn of the Dead, but I digress). The original also is serious all the way through; it starts on a dark tone, and one never sees a nice, comforting light of salvation throughout. Does that mean the remake is an utter failure? Absolutely not, because it's still left as a dirty, gory, and exploitative film that wallops the hell out of the entertainment factor. And what is morality, anyway? Cannibal Holocaust has morality and social commentary, and it's perhaps the most immoral film of all-time. The Hitcher eliminates the middle-man and just delivers pure, scary, and bloody carnage that I'll be damned to say isn't one hell of a fun ride.The remake stays fairly loyal to the original plot, though there are a few minor elements that are different. Perhaps the worst change is the sunny beginning, which starts at the beginning of Jim Halsey's trip, which he starts with his girlfriend, Grace. Maybe it's supposed to symbolize a dive into gloom, but again, that's why the original was such a gut punch: it never feels sunny, from beginning to end. When the two reach John Ryder, once again alone in a rainstorm, the dark and depressing mood falls over, and then it never turns light again. And again, the stranger embarks to ruin the couple's life. He continues his sick "fun" in murdering everyone he comes across, and the two college kids fall into a cruel game of circumstance and are framed for his crimes. They're arrested, but while getting no where with the police, John Ryder is nice enough to free them both and slaughter the entire station. From this point, it's Grace and Jim on the run from the cops and Ryder, both are intent on bringing them down. The two make their way to an old truck stop motel, thinking that they've left both the police and the hitcher in the dust. Well, they're dead wrong.One thing that was immediately apparent to me was that the film makers were out for blood in this one. It is an intensely brutal film, even more than the original. There is nothing left to the imagination here; even the infamous drawn and quartered scene is shown in full-detail. Hollywood has become more talented in achieving such effects, and that scene contains the potentially outrageous qualities that could be used to draw an audience. But there's more than just exploitative slasher elements involved. It still has a psychological side to it. In the original, the psychological aspect was the sadomasochistic relationship between friend and foe. In the remake, however, the psychology is simply mind-games and terror meant to disturb, and it achieves this in two ways. The first way is just pure agony and despair. For instance, the family that is next to pick up John Ryder is a religious family, and after their butchery, we see a children's book called, "Will I Go to Heaven?" dropped on the road and covered in blood. That may have shook me deeper than any of the simple gore that was on display. The second side is just the absolutely incredible performance by Sean Bean, who plays John Ryder with such attitude and woe that it gets into your head. Whever he was on screen, you really think he could do anything to you and the characters. I think it's the sexual aspect of him that made him so scary; Rutger Hauer was out to kill and ruin, but Sean Bean was out to rape and defile, then kill and ruin. That coupled with Sophia Bush's truly terror-stricken face chills one to the bone.In what it succeeds so well in terrorizing, it also achieves less in sticking it out from beginning to end. There's a bitter aftertaste that feels like it doesn't completely finish the job, and I think it's because of the decision to switch the roles of Jim and Nash (Grace in this film). Throughout the film, the two both seemed to be the hitcher's target. On that aspect, it works. While he treats Jim with just threats of violence, he treats Grace with sexual dominance, and that's scary! It's scary because the woman is inherently the weaker of the two (no intention to offend any female readers here), and there's always the want for protection of that character. In the original, to see her killed in such a brutal manner is horrifying. The wanting for her to live is shattered, and that's what makes it depressing and unforgettable. So when the roles are switched, and it's Jim tied between the tractor-trailer, it has less of an effect. Also, while most of the ending sequence is outstanding, there was the bitter decision to give Grace the super-hero, over-the-top survival that was plainly unnecessary and cliché (though the final exchange between the two was beautiful and chilling). Oh, and one last thing: if you want to build a dark atmosphere from the beginning, don't include a CGI rabbit getting hit by a car.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Bean ruled this movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the POTC trilogy I decided something less heavy was due instead of watching another heavy movie and I thought a formulaic basic slasher movie was what I needed. I am also a member of the 'Boycott Hollywood from remaking classics'club but having said that I have never seen the original Hitcher so I thought lets give it shot even though generally did not like it. After watching it last night the only thing I can say it is NOT THAT BAD although it is still a go by the book teen slasher film, Sean Bean was just excellent as a rampaging lunatic and I felt that it was that what kept watching this film as a unstoppable maniac that wants to compete with the likes of Jason Vorhess and Micheal Myers! Sophia Bush was also surprisingly good and I would like to see her stretch her acting wings out a little further, the film moved along at a quick pace and wasted no time so it was over and done with quite quickly with enough blood and action to keep me amused. To conclude The Hitcher is not one worth checking out in the cinema wait for it to hit your local rental store and only check it out if your just in the mood for a quick time pass. Do not expect an adrenaline thrill ride with lots of scares!THE HITCHER - 8.1 OUT OF 10NEVER PICK UP STRANGERS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why most people go to see a horror movie, but for me personally, it is more about the excitement and the creativity, than an award winning script or intricate technology. I thought The Hitcher had an interesting premise and i was intrigued mostly because this was an every man story. Anyone could be these two young people. I also agreed with the casting choices, relatively unknown actors with the exception of Sean Bean as the hitcher. I thought they all did a wonderful job with what they had and Sean Bean was truly terrifying.On the other hand, I thought many of the scenerios were a bit unbelievable. (if you see the movie you will understand what I mean) The important thing is that the people involved in making the film believe in what they are doing and usually the audience will follow. This is where the hitcher lost steam. It seems like they were not sure which direction they wanted to travel in so they dabbed into a little bit of everything.Something I also noticed, was how there was really no set up for suspense! The movie just dove right into the guts and blood. What makes "Jaws", "The Blair Witch Project" and even more recently "The Descent" work is the suspense that slowly builds.The movie was fine, but it could have been a lot better, had they thought through a couple things like plot structure and use of suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the 1986 original and was extremely excited to see this movie. I was not disappointed! A lot of horror genre fans generally bash any remake. Personally, I thought this version was fantastic! Yes, it wasn't exactly on par with the original. But if I wanted to see the original, I simply would have rented it. Twenty-one years have passed since the original, anyone who thought this remake was bad should stay home and continue to watch VHS tapes and listen to their record player. I enjoyed and appreciated the modifications that were added. I thought the acting was absolutely believable, particularly from Sean Bean and Sophia Bush. My sister and I jumped at least 5 times, we were definitely scared. This movie had me captivated and stressed out (in a good way!) from beginning to end. I would recommend 'The Hitcher' to anyone interested in a good, clean scare!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now that's what I call entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, to understand why this film got a 10, it's because while the film has moments that make you wonder what the characters are thinking, it adds to the experience. The Hitcher is a great blend of horror and action thriller that is very short, so it will keep your attention throughout. For a remake, it is phenomenal.Like the original, the plot centers around a young couple (Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton), this time they are headed to see Bush's family over spring break. As they are driving, they encounter a hitch hiker (Sean Bean) who soon proves that he is not the most trustworthy man in the world.The best part about this film is the performances of Sean Bean and Sophia Bush, and the direction of David Meyers. Meyers, one of the most prolific directors in the music video industry, makes his feature film debut here, and is nothing short of brilliant. He has an aptitude for shooting the horror aspects of the film, as there are several moments that will make you jump, and there are also some moments that will make you want to yell in excitement. I loved the mood of the film. Meyers stays true to his roots, as there is music playing throughout most of the film. The script is not that great, but it's not important. There are some predictable moments, especially if you've seen the original. Also, none of the characters in the film seem to have any common sense, but once again, it adds to the entertainment because you get a laugh out of it. It's not an overwhelming horror experience, as most of the movie is an action thriller, centering around a game of cat and mouse. Sean Bean is positively chilling and very scary as the title character, his best villainous performance in a career built on these performances. He easily conveys the multiple and conflicted emotions of the character, who never makes his true desire known until the finale of the movie, which is one of the best finales I've ever seen, just out of sheer entertainment. Sophia Bush is the one responsible for the best 8 final minutes of a film I've ever seen. Throughout the film, she is serious eye candy, but during the ending, she is absolutely perfect. I know the guys in the room will go crazy during the end. That's all I'm saying. Neal McDonough gives a good performance in very limited screen time as a lieutenant of the police. He doesn't really have enough dialog to create a real character, but what he does have, he makes the most of it. While I've avoided talking about him throughout the entire review, Zachary Knighton's performance is not bad by any means. Like McDonough, he takes what he's given and does a good job with it. The only difference is that he's given a lot more. The character is not really well written (none of them are), but he does manage to make a character we do feel some sympathy for. All in all, The film is well casted, well directed, and just flat out entertaining. It's a great movie going experience that should be seen in the theaters with an audience. If you get a good crowd that feeds of the movie, it makes it even better.Due to some graphic content, very intense action, and limited language, I recommend The Hitcher to everyone ages 15 and up, but it's the guys that will have the most fun with it.10/10 --spy</fullReview>

The problem with this movie is that you don't end up caring about the characters in the end. The hitcher himself also has no character development which could have mad his character more frightening. The ending was also a little disappointing. It could have been better if the hitcher lived at the end and could have set the plot up for continuation in a sequel. Overall, highly entertaining, but certainly not an award winner for plot or acting.</fullReview>

He's talented, but it's hard to get anywhere with just talent in Hollywood, so it's nice to see the powers that be allow some unknowns hit the screen from time to time. Indie and horror films are the way to go if you want to see what the rest of the world is missing!

		<fullReview>Having not seen the original, I went into this with no prior knowledge of what to expect. What I got was an entertaining, 90 minute thrill-ride, with action, suspense and drama.Grace and Jim are a twenty-one year old couple on their way to visit Grace's friends for spring break. When they nearly strike a man with their vehicle while driving through the Mexican desert (during a rain storm, no less!) they think nothing of it. Until they run in to him minutes later at a gas station. John Ryder is his name, and he wants a ride to the next town over. Grace, having been against giving him a lift from the beginning, goes along with it. Not soon after getting in the car, the young couple find themselves fending off against John, who's seemingly nice persona goes right out the window, the moment he pulls a knife on Grace. Now, Grace and Jim are in a fight for their lives, as John continues his murder spree, continuing to frame Jim and Grace for the murders.The film itself is fast-paced, and it doesn't let up. Ever. We get standout performances from Sean Bean, Sophia Bush, and Zachary Knighton. I have to give props to Zachary Knighton, having never seen him in anything before, he did an amazing job in this film. He not only made me care for his character, but I actually believed him throughout the film. Sean Bean was fairly terrifying as John Ryder, I feel he could have broadend the role a bit more, but what he gave was very good. And of course, Sophia Bush, having only seen her in things like "Stay Alive" "John Tucker Must Die" and "One Tree Hill" I knew she'd be able to handle drama well, but I didn't think she'd be this good.The gore factor was definitely up there, not on par with films such as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning" but in a more realistic sense, with a lot of blood shed, a stab wound, wrists torn open, and a rather graphic death involving a Mac Truck.I believe if you haven't seen the original, or didn't like the original, you may end up enjoying this. I've heard they're very similar (I mean, Eric Red DID get top writing credit in this film, because the screenplay's are so alike!) but I believe this one is probably more fast-paced. The character dynamic between Grace and Jim definitely makes you feel for them. I say check this film out, only if you're not a die-hard fan of the original, as it probably won't ever live up to it. But if you're like me, and have yet to see the original, give this one a shot. It's definitely entertaining!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good and satisfying execution of the genre motions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher reviewed by Sam OsbornThe title sequence for The Hitcher involves a jackrabbit. Not a real jackrabbit, naturally, but one rendered entirely from CGI wizardry. The creature hops twice, wiggles his nose, ruffles unconvincingly with the live-action weeds around him, and ventures out onto the nearby highway to be smeared across the pavement by a snarling motorist trailing the title slide behind him. This, the opening sequence means to say, is The Hitcher: a smudge of road kill wiped messily across the asphalt. And in the realm of promising opening sequences, this ranks near the worst. Equally cringe-inducing is the succeeding cut, where the open road is swapped for the sunny college campus, with a grinning bulk of meticulously unshaven man waving to his toned and thinned brunette prancing towards him on their way to a riotous spring break. What, we may ask, have we gotten ourselves into?Actually, we've snuggled into a delightfully sordid affair. Despite its two misguided introductions, what follows is an intensely satisfying creep through the shady-eyed terror felt by all when stopping on the highway for a crooked thumb hitching a ride. The aforementioned waving hunk of man is Zachary Knighton playing Jim Halsey, an everyday California college boy with a perky girlfriend, this time played by "One Tree Hill" veteran Sophia Bush. The two are more intelligent than other Slasher-film fodder, but still fall victim to a script rigged to pose manipulative lapses in judgment. Why, if those that are trying to protect you wish to put you into custody, would you run from them and wiggle into a shadowy trailer park hiding place with a psychopathic gunman close on your trail? These are questions one must obviously suspend when viewing a Slasher film, I suppose; and compared to the boys and girls of the Scream franchise and I Know What You Did Last Summer, Jim and Grace are regular valedictorians. Anyway, the two are burning the midnight oil down a New Mexico highway, joking mirthfully at a comfortably rainy sixty mph when a black figure with a pointing thumb suddenly looms in the middle of the road. Skidding through a full rotation, Jim and Grace decide not to meddle with fate and drive off, leaving the uninjured man to find another ride. At the next gas station, however, the hitcher (Sean Bean) appears again, having picked up a ride soon after Jim and Grace departed. Posing as a wet, harmless housecat, the hitcher asks for a ride and Jim breaks down, offering to take him to the next hotel fifteen miles away. Midway through the ride, though, the hitcher?who calls himself John Ryder?holds a knife to Grace's eye and demands that Jim chant the words "I Want to Die." Jim manages his first feat of collegiate-sport heroics in response and promptly ejects John from the speeding vehicle. John is no pesky fly on the wall, however, and no man built for defeat. The hunt has only just begun, apparently, and Mr. Ryder torments the young couple and all who stand in his way for the ensuing seventy minutes. Reminding us sometimes of the aptly titled French horror picture, High Tension, Director Dave Meyers succeeds in holding the tension extremely taut by doing very little. What's more frustrating than a scene of tight-shouldered suspense without the requisite release? It leaves us holding our breath and with no cathartic jump scare for the tension to exhale into. The screenplay does well to mount situations, however murky the logic behind them is, that work to create horrific triangles of suspense. Granted, most of the screams come from blind lunges from dark corners, the undeserving jump scare is sometimes a welcome relief to the dead silence of suspense. Meyers also steers clear (mostly) of the bloodbath antics of the Hostel and Saw franchises, only resorting to excessive gore when necessary (maybe this is a byproduct of a noticeably shabby make-up department though). His scares might not be completely genuine or entirely affective, but they work well enough to forward the story yarn towards the two momentous climaxes. Here, in a sort of symphonic car chase double sequence, Meyers' music video background gleams through. Following up on an extraordinarily appropriate line-up of songs, an iconic, industrial techno diddy pulsates through the soundscape. Cars launch and catapult in an oblivion worthy of Michael Bay destruction, with precisely chosen perspectives and split-second filmic reactions that only an old hand of the music video industry could intuit. The scene is a kind of operatic smackdown of vehicular menace, and one that leaves us in awe of our lunatic baddie.With a limited number of lines given to John Ryder and the limited IQ dished out to the couple, The Hitcher obviously isn't attempting an innovation to the Slasher genre. But with Sean Bean doing his best lurking criminal pose as Mr. Ryder, and Sophia Bush proving that her acting is more substantial than her scarily small weight, The Hitcher is a good and satisfying execution of the genre motions.

		<shortDescription>"Another one bites the dust"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, as a rabid fan of Sean Bean, this was an excellent movie until roughly 90 seconds before the end. As a horror villain, he is definitely well-cast and I was happy to see him recover from his casting as a Disney villain. Suicidal, psychopathic, and with actual intelligence behind his I'm-going-to-kill-you smirk, he was the highlight of the film for me. The rest of the cast was convincing if not inspired, with Sophia Bush doing a 180 attitude turn from the beginning to the end. As a horror movie, "The Hitcher" ranks somewhere in the 75th percentile. The plot stands well on its own and actually ends, with little or no chance of a follow-up, be it prequel or sequel. I have never seen the original and so cannot compare, but this is a great remake. Dialogue was surprisingly original for this genre of film. Tear-filled pleading and long threatening speeches were kept to a minimum (I actually didn't spot any of the latter). Watch out for a visual pun on "redneck" about two-thirds of the way through. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but would like to say that it is about time a Sean Bean villain movie was made where he actually makes it to the credits alive and un-incarcerated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back a bit ago from seeing The Hitcher. All I can say is wow. Sean Bean did a fantastic job of playing this role. Remember, it is acting, just a role, and he must have seen something good in it. Thought that some of his other evil roles were just that, but this one tops 'em all. Just when you think you can relax, an OMG moment happens and makes ya jump and gasp. Was better then Silent Hill. If you don't like Bean, don't see his movies. This has got to be one of the best films of his I have seen in a long time, besides the last Sharpe film. The blood and gore was great and loved the ending. The beginning was a bit cheesy but once it hit close to the middle, was thinking "how much more can those kids take?" Well, the end told us. Great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done Thriller, but Nothing New...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of the classic 1986 movie, The Hitcher. Although this new version is very good, it doesn't really add anything new to the original. It has me wondering why they remade it at all? I expected some new twists and turns but it is basically the exact same movie. I guess they figured the name alone would get people into the theaters.The casting was great with Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton as the protagonists battling the villain. And Sean Bean does a fantastic job playing the creepy psychotic killer. Neal McDonough plays well as the cocky police officer who is tracking the carnage. But just like the B-Movie original, none of the characters are ever really developed. The actors just weren't given enough to work with here. So it is just another action movie where we never get to know the players well. I give casting an A+ but character development a D-. And just like the first movie, we are never told why the bad guy is so evil. It never explains why he is killing everyone or why he wants someone to kill him. So, no plot development either. If your looking for a well-made brainless action thriller with a little gore than this is the movie to see. You will probably like it more if you haven't seen the first version because it is so similar as to not be worth watching both.I still give this movie an 8/10 because it makes a pretty good action thriller, even if it is a little mindless. I was expecting more though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher Is Really Quite Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Hitcher because i love it when slasher films are serious instead of intentionally cheesy.This film will probably receive a low rating on here simply because a bunch of 40 year old virgins are pi$$ed off that another horror movie is being re-made.This movie was a very intense thrillride with a few jump scares but most of the horror part of this movie came from the amazing performance by Sean Bean.Sean Bean is a perfect psychopath in this film and even to look at him (especially when he's smiling)sends a chill down your spine he is very effective in this role.Psychologically this film is terrifying because it is about a hitch hiker and a hitch hiker could be anyone so this could be any of us in this situation.The acting other than Sean Bean is still great Sophia Bush is gorgeous as usual but you really believe her character and you really buy into her performance as a victim.Sean Bean basically tortures people both physically and mentally in this film as he is one crazy character always showing up when you least expect it it creates a feeling that you're being stalked.As a remake it's great because I hate when remakes try to do the exact same things in the exact same order as the original hence why i love The Amittyville Horror,Dawn Of The Dead, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre re-makes.The story pretty much shows what the consequences to picking up a random stranger can be and the repetitive consequences that follow.Overall a good horror movie and a good re-make but as i said before a bunch of 40 year old virgins will disagree.</fullReview>

You think you do, but something completely different occurs. Sean Bean does an amazing performance as well. You wouldn't think he was the hitcher by just looking at him. But you never know who your going to pick up right? Go see this movie! So if your looking for a good scare of just a good movie. Go see this one! Great movie! I recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that they did a good job with the movie. It is quite faithful to the original only changing 2 or 3 things. I loved the original and thought that this one held up to the quality of it. People will enjoy this movie more then some of the other horror movies out there right now. It is a popcorn movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I thought that the acting was decent and they keep the overall tone of the original. While not as graphic as the other horror remakes by Platinum Dunes, I thought it was just as good. The movie does take a little bit to get going though. I also thought that there could have been a little more character development in the movie. I have to admit that I like Sophia Bush and Sean Bean though as actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start of with the fact that I haven't seen the original movie from 1986. So I won't be comparing them and my comments are based solely on my experience. This movie is overall very gritty and has things you expect...with twists. Try not to think of this movie as something in real life because some of the things simply won't happen that way in real life. It does however work for a movie. With the exception of one or two scenes that look kind of dumb, this movie has an overall good pacing and surprising factor. This is magnified with superb acting skills by the cast who can portray the emotions quite well. The plot of the story is good except for one hole in it. I'll leave the audience to figure that out, and if you can't then message me and i'll reply. I would recommend this movie to everyone to watch in order to get their own opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and intense by-the-numbers thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this film after seeing the trailer. I saw it opening weekend for a $4 matinée fee, and loved every minute of it. Of course, it's nothing new. If you've seen BREAKDOWN with Kurt Russell, JOYRIDE with Leelee Sobieski, or Stephen Spielberg's DUEL, you've seen this movie (although this one is more violent and shocking). It's fairly mindless action, and yet the characters and their situation are engaging and I found myself genuinely rooting against the bad guy and for the good guys. I was angry at Sean Bean and exasperated by the meddlesome, incompetent police (minus the cowboy-hat wearing sheriff that tries to save the lead female actress). The actors were convincing. The cinematography is at times beautiful and almost always stylish. I even jumped a few times at the parts where you're supposed to jump.There are obvious plot holes that usually accompany tight little thrillers such as these and PANIC ROOM, WAIT UNTIL DARK, and MISERY, but the pacing is quick and doesn't give you much time to worry about them. What's important in these "survival thrillers" (not to be confused with survival horror such as DAWN OF THE DEAD and ALIEN) is that the story is thrilling and the characters are real enough for you to suspend disbelief and put yourself in their plight. There's a sense of justice and morality throughout as our heroes desperately try to help others in danger of the sadistic, crazed hitchhiker. There are themes of self-sacrifice as well. The attitude taken towards the killer is the right one - they are sick and wrong, no matter how they may try to justify it. Unfortunately, impressionable young fans may misunderstand and find Sean Bean's character to be "badass". There are underlying themes - this could be described as a cautionary morality tale, and speculation can be drawn into Sean Bean's character as well - but for the most part it's a simple, exciting adventure that is an escape for the majority of viewers that don't find themselves in explosive high-speed pursuits on a daily basis.The detractors will hate it because it's a remake starring attractive teens, has predictable scares and a predictable script, and is directed by a music video director, made obviously just to cash in on the remake trend and appeal to "the MTV generation of teeny boppers that are too uncultured to understand true cinema" and need scenes of flashy violence and editing. However, I couldn't disagree more. Directors have to start somewhere, and the experience in music videos is certainly an advantage to the visual style of this film (and others such as THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake, another under-appreciated and too often bashed horror film, mainly by fans of the original. These critiques are ignorant and lump audiences into simple categories, that are not factual. I don't know about you, but I love all sorts of movies, not just the "classics." For what it is, it's done well, as long as you leave your biases and expectations for another MEMENTO or SCHINDLER'S LIST at the door. There's nothing wrong with indulging in a professionally-made, action-packed thriller once in a while.For the price I paid and the entertainment I got, it was well worth the hour and a half ride. I gave it a 6/10. Rated R for some shocking scenes of violence and brutality, and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying and chilling horror travel. Well Done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that most remakes of late are letdowns, but this was not the case with this. "The Hitcher" rocks it's a suspense horror film with plenty of chills, thrills, blood, and skin plus it even has a nice plot to it with twist. It all begins when two college students and lovers Grace and Jim(which is played wonderful by Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton)leave their college dorm in Texas and begin a journey home to New Mexico. Along the way of this trip on a rainy night trouble lurks in the darkness, and the couple will learn their lesson next time never never pick up hitchhikers! The terror begins along the highway of fear, you have it all car chases and car crashes, blood and murder and even unlawful detainment! "The Hitcher" is filled with fun, suspense, and terror from start to finish watching this you just grow to hate the evil John Ryder, and it worries you so much that you don't want to travel the highways again! Sophia Bush turns out to be the heroine you just love and cheer for her, I hope Sophia gets more roles she was very sexy in this film her looks can help take away from the frightful and chilling times that movies like this bring. So I suggest you watch "The Hitcher" for a thrill ride and to see the sexy Sophia Bush.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ***Okay, I figured this movie was on my mind so I would write what I thought about it. This is also coming from someone who hasn't seen the original so I had no bias going into the theater. This is strictly based on this movie, not how it compared to the original.This movie was really, really good in my opinion. I enjoyed watching it, it drew me in. It was exciting and very appropriate with the gore and violence.I hear a lot of bad things about how they never gave Ryder a motive and stuff like that but in my opinion I thought that was a really cool concept. Ryder is supposed to be this mysterious, nameless serial killer. He didn't need a motive and I think that was lost on a lot of people. Anyways about the car chase scene, I thought that was a really awesome scene. Usually in movies when there is a chase scene the directors put this orchestra score to it. This movie had Closer // NIN behind it which I think added a really cool vibe to the whole chase sequence. I think Sean Bean did a really good job as Ryder. He was creepy but in a "man I could pass anytime and not know he was completely insane" way. So to sum up, I gave this movie a ten. Not because I think it's the next Oscar contender for Best Picture or anything but it was well done, the acting was good, the plot was pretty realistic I'd say. It was good fun to watch and yes I'll admit, the night car part when he breaks the glass made me jump and I would love to go see it again. That is my opinion on it anyways. It's definitely worth seeing in the theater if a good thriller is what you're looking for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Remake of a Mediocre 80's Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that they were remaking The Hitcher I was a little hesitant. The Original 1986 film was barely entertaining and did not hold my interest well. However this version proves to fix most of the dull moments of the original.The Plot is simple, two college students (Grace &amp; Jim) offer a hitchhiker (John Ryder) a ride and he turns out to be a maniac. The film starts off with a fast pace, introducing Ryder within about 10 minutes, and keeps your attention until the film moments. The characters aren't given a lot of back story before they have a run in with Ryder, so the audience learns bits about them as we go through the entire movie. In my opinion the movies does a great job of not slamming you with 30 minutes of dialogue before anything interesting happens. Once they pick up Ryder the hits keep coming. The movie should also be categorized as an action thriller, not necessarily a full on horror film. Although it does have its jumps and scares, the car chases and shootouts turn it into full on action. The film also has great music, especially during one of the key car chases. The gore should be the right amount, not too much for the average viewer and slightly enough for the bloody fans. The only slightly negative comment about the plot would be the opening sequence with a rabbit and a bug flying into their windshield which comes off a little cheesy.The acting is actually really good for a horror film, Sophia Bush and Sean Bean give exceptional performances for what they have to work with. Bush especially is gorgeous throughout, and acts very believable in her role. Bean also gives a merciless performance as the hitcher, leaving him no sympathy from the audience. The weakest link of the cast would be Zack Knighton, although his performance is up to par with normal slasher flicks, Bush's ability over powers and makes his seem mediocre. All in all a very well acted movie.I definitely recommend the Hitcher to anyone, whether you are a fan of the original or not. This action thriller will keep your attention to the final seconds, which kick ass.Overall Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original so I can't really compare it but I think the remake is definitely scary. The only reason I actually wanted to see this was because Sophia Bush is my favorite actress and I wanted to see if she could pull of this part-which she did. Sean Benn did really good and creeped me out while Zachary Knighton did also very well. I had never seen him in anything and he really pulled this off.The movie as far as I think was pretty gory, and definitely scared me. Even the beginning which was sort of lame with the rabbit scared me but then again I do get scared pretty easy. The movie was packed with intensity and my friends and I were jumping at the suspense. The car chase scene was shot very good and overall it was great. The part though that I thought was sad was when Zack's character was killed and boy did I feel sorry for him. I didn't think he would die and that sort of threw me off..but having Sophia be the hero was very good as she pulled this part off and I was scared just like she was. Overall the movie was scary, intense, acted very good, and definitely a great horror film for myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher is an obvious 2007 remake to the 1986 original with the same title. The story is a little different from the original, this time it's a couple is driving cross country. They foolishly pick up a hitch hiker who happens to be psychotic. The movie is spent around the couple running and hiding from the hitcher. There are some very good action packed and suspenseful scenes in it as well. I actually felt bad for the two main characters played by Sophia Bush and Zachary Knighton. I was rooting for them to make it.I liked this one a lot and found it strange that so many people hated it. I guess it's because this is a remake, and those almost never surpass the original. I thought that this one was just as good as the 1986 version. The acting was great from both the lead characters, very believable. And Sean Bean did a good job at playing the deranged hitcher.The Hitcher remake was just as good as the original and MUCH better than The Hitcher II made in 2003.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really surprised me. I didn't think that it would be as good as it was. Let me tell you, Sean Bean was awesome as John Ryder. I loved that character, even though he was quite sadistic. The whole movie was fast-paced and I was never bored.There were many scenes that stood out to me. The first one being the part in which John held Grace at knife point. At first I thought the scene would be kind of cheesy. However, once Ryder pulled out that knife I knew it would great. Man, that scene was kind of creepy thanks to big Sean. The scene shortly after, that involved the murder of a religious family was rather disturbing. It takes a lot to disturb me in a horror/thriller film. This scene shows you what evil is in its purest form. My favorite scene, however, had to be the chase sequence. That was awesome! The fact that Sean blew away 7 redneck cops to the NIN classic, Closer, was just wicked. I want give anything else away, but I will say the ending was surprisingly good as well.Sophia Bush was terrific in her role, also. She proves that she is more than just eye candy, and how. All in all, The Hitcher was very good and worth seeing again. I hope that they will show the deleted scenes on the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Remake that Slightly Tops the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One perfect remake after another? what else is new? Keeping with the overflow of quality remakes that have been hitting the theater lately, The Hitcher manages to top the original in mood, style, gore, characters, and realism. The Hitcher does not disappoint in any sense of the word.The Hitcher is about a young couple?Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) and Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton?taking a road trip for spring break. Their vacation soon turns into a nightmare after they offer a ride to the hitcher, John Ryder (Sean Bean). Ryder follows the couple at every turn, painting a path of destruction across the countryside, and it all leads to a chilling final encounter.The Hitcher, in many ways, is a lot like the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: stylish, flashy, gory, and surprisingly faithful to the original material. This new horror picture is all about 'style', and it works extremely well. The movie is very creepy, gritty, and atmospheric as well, although Sean Bean really isn't all that scary-looking.In the way of acting, everyone did their parts very well. Sophia Bush was pretty convincing as Grace in a nice little stand-out role. In reverse of the original, Grace becomes the main character rather than Jim, although the both of them are central throughout the film save the last fifteen minutes. Zachary Knighton was great as Jim, and brought a definite sense of realism to the character. He was also incredibly convincing. Sean Bean was creepy and a very good choice for the hitcher, but I just didn't find myself scared by his presence. However, that's not to say that there were no scares. There were plenty of scares littered subtly throughout the film, and the pacing was just perfect. The movie strays just far enough from the plot of the original to keep things interesting, but I would have preferred it if there was just a touch more of original content.In all, The Hitcher is one of the best remakes to hit the big screen recently. With stellar performances from attractive young actors and actresses, great directing, and an eerie atmosphere, The Hitcher was flawless. In all honesty, the movie deserved to make more money at the box office than it did, but I suppose it can't be helped.</fullReview>

It starts getting intense after about the first five minutes of the movie and when the intensity starts it doesn't stop!!! This is the first Horror/ Thriller remake that could have been full of gore and torture but wasn't. There were parts but it was more intense than gory. I love this film!!!!!!!!! I definitely give this film a 10 out of 10. The only thing I did not like was when it showed a close up of a rabbit being run over by a car. Other than that it was a 100% work of art.Kris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see "The Hitcher" this past Saturday with an awkward feeling in my stomach. I was never a big fan of the 'old' one, directed by Robert Harmon, and staring Rutger Auer as our 'Hitcher-Psycho'.The 2007 movie was directed by Dave Meyers {Foolish}, and starred Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings) as John Ryder, Sophia Bush (Stay Alive, John Tucker Must Die) as Grace, and Zachary Kninghton (The Mudge Boy, The Prince &amp; Me) as Jim.But as I was saying, I was never a big fan of the '86 thriller. I thought it was too... should I say "slow"? And not horrifying enough for me? Remakes have a bad reputation of screwing with the original movie's plot, but since I never really liked the old one, I was up for this one. I knew it would be more violent and bloody. And boy let me tell you, it was.The movie tells a story of a couple who get tormented by a mysterious hitchhiker named John Ryder. He sure does make their lives a living hell.The movie had a lot of scenes "pratically-the-same" from the old movie. And although I am sad to inform you, Sean Bean (he did a great job!), but he is just not Rutger Hauer.The film was rated R for strong bloody violence, terror and language. Go watch this movie if you enjoy a movie that makes you jump once or twice during its whole 80+ minutes, and scenes that you might say to yourself "Omfg, it's so gross, but I can't look away!" such as one of the main characters getting torn apart while he was tied between two trucks, and a very graphic throat-splitting.Unfortunately (hmm?), I will give this movie 8 starts out of 10, even though I sure enjoyed it (it is worth buying the unrated DVD when it comes out), but it's just I wanted to see more violence (haha!), like most remakes tend to have.Definitely worth the tickets. =]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher tells the story of a young couple who are on their way to see some friends over spring break. As they are driving, they nearly hit a hitchhiker. They keep driving, only to see him again at a gas station later. He politely asks for a ride to a motel, and the couple accept. Almost immediately after they get on the road, the hitcher admits that he's dangerous. The couple manage to shove him out of the car, and they think they're okay. However, the hitcher begins to stalk them and commit murders around them, which lead the police to mistakenly implicate the couple as the murderers. On the run from the cops, the couple now must figure out a way to both stop the hitcher and prove their innocence. The Hitcher is a pretty good remake of an 80s cult classic, and though it has its flaws, it's pretty enjoyable.I'm usually indifferent towards horror movie remakes because it doesn't really matter to me, but after seeing the brutally bad Black Christmas remake, I thought I'd never like a remake again. Fortunately I went to see this movie, which is actually a decently made remake that follows the original however is different just enough to be a new experience. The movie could have been longer, but it didn't really feel that short because there was a lot of action. One thing that bothered me about the original was that it switched genres from horror to thriller to action. This one firmly establishes that it's an action/thriller, and it stays that way throughout. I thought that the way they ended up giving the hitcher a ride was more realistic in this day and age than simply picking him up. The action scenes were pretty fun to watch, especially a scene where the hitcher pulls up and blows a bunch of cops right off the road as they're chasing the young couple. Another thing I liked was that it's left up to us to discover what his motives are for torturing this young couple. I'm finding more and more that the less you know of the killer's origins and motives, the creepier it is. If the victims don't know his motives and you do, it helps you to understand the killer which makes him less creepy. If you are just as in the dark as his victims, you relate to them, and the killer becomes scarier. The only real problem I had with the movie was the use of music in some scenes seemed kind of strange. I don't really like when directors insert rock or pop songs into the soundtrack for no reason, when they could have a creepy instrumental score playing. Also, during some moments it seemed like your average 21st century slasher movie, but there's only a few of these moments.The acting wasn't bad for the most part. Sean Bean was the best of the bunch playing the hitcher, but he still didn't capture the raw creepiness that Rutger Hauer had in the original. I believe that Zachary Knighton, given some really good material, could become a really fine actor some day. Sofia Bush wasn't that amazing at all. She seems better suited for TV shows.Overall, The Hitcher is a good thriller, and a good remake, and if you like action, the original movie, or Sean Bean, you should check this movie out.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher is one of the best remakes made I can say. It packed up with great action and suspense that just wants you to continue watching the rest of the movie. Let me add the great performance of Sean Bean and sexy Sophia Bush, who make the film more realistic and freaky. Some scenes from the trailer are missing but let's hope they will make it to an Unrated DVD...As a whole, if you want an entertaining day with lots of action, suspense and thriller, then The Hitcher is the best movie to start with.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this one. This was one of the better Sean Bean movies that I have seen in a while. Sophia Bush was great and so was the dude who played Jim, sorry I don't know his name. It was such a shame that he and to die though. But oh well. Whats done is done. One of my fave parts of the movie was when they were first on the road and the almost hit Sean's character. It was wickedly awesome and throughout the movie, I was jumping out of my seat. (LOL) I like all that blood and gore and stuff like that. Not to mention, the movie had a killer soundtrack!! I might just have to go bye it when it comes out in stores. So this in all, was the best movie I have seen. When all the other ones come out, I will Definitely go to see them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was Sean Bean at his best. He scared the heck out of me in this thriller.If you like being scared to death then this the movie for you. I thought it was a great remake of the original thriller. The girl who played Grace was excellent. The guy that played Jimmy did a great job as well. Of course it wouldn't have been as good if Sean Bean wasn't in it! I hope to see Sean in lots more movies. I think his is a great actor. There are so many people that don't know he is! He deserves so much more attention for his acting abilities. He is a very versatile actor. He really knows how to play his character convincingly. Super actor! Super HOT! S. Ford</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a screener for this and its amazing. I say this because i am a big proponent of "the gorier the better". The old one is dated, it has a decidedly 80's feel to it..which isn't bad, but still. I think Sean Bean nailed it and Sophia Bush was a nice touch. Shes girl next door pretty and not likely to run up the stairs at the wrong times. Plus, why discard a movie just because its a reworking of an older movie? Ragging on "remakes" is old and tired and shows a lack of open-mindedness. Why be ironic just to be ironic? I would send any and all of my closest friends ( all horror fans ) to see this movie this weekend. And why not?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey Guys, What's up? I'm Laura. I thought the Hitcher was great! the effects we're fantastic, as well as the casting. I love Sophia Bush!! I'm glad she was cast in this movie. I watch her every Wenesday Night on One Tree Hill, and this role was totally opposite her One Tree Hill Character, "Brooke Davis". All in all I think it was a great movie. Most of that being because Sophia Bush was in it. I also really enjoy remakes and I must say this Remake has been better then Most. I also enjoyed Sean Bean, and Zack's Performances. Sean Bean freaked me out! thats how I know he totally owned the character he was trying to portray. All in all i give this movie 3 out of 4 stars. But on This thing it definitely gets a 10 for excellent! -Laura M. Petracco, 17 Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie for action-packed horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like horror/suspense movies with a lot of action, gore, and mayhem..this movie is for you. There's not much storyline to it, but it is the most intense movie I've seen this year and I loved it. It's by no means something that's going to win any awards, and if you don't like movies without a lot of story, you may be disappointed.In any case, the acting is superb. Sean Bean plays crazed killer John Ryder and does a wonderful job. I hope to see more good movies with him in them! The other two main characters are played by decent actors, but they weren't too spectacular. Although, the girl was kinda cute. She'll probably have a future in acting.</fullReview>

Its perfectly chilling, very good acting and gory. the overall quality of the remake is MUCH better than the original....Its some kind of hype these days to "hate" remakes and hate bush.....If you like the original...you will love this remake! Don't listen to these "so called" movie buffs around the web who "hate everything thats not original" A horror movie is just silly entertainment....See the movie if you like these kind of movies...Otherwise...Go see Titanic again.

		<fullReview>Now, I hadn't actually seen the original the first time I saw it as I didn't realize it was a remake. However, as I thoroughly enjoyed this version I went back to watch the original. I did not like it. This remake doesn't feel like a remake. It was excellent! Sean Bean was always going to be a good villain and Zachary Knight and Sophia Bush played their roles perfectly. Sophia Bush truly carried the movie. Really good acting. I really enjoyed this film as it is very different to most similar movies. I think it is totally worth a watch. I watched it with a group of my friends and it was the PERFECT movie for a sleepover. Really, really good!! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this before the original. So, I watched the original to compare them. Both were good, but this one is so much better. This is an R-rated slasher movie with a lot of blood, violence, and disturbing scenes. This is not at all for kids! Although the original was a little scarier, I prefer this one. Slasher and horror do not always have to coincide in the same movie, such as the "Saw" movies. There are times when I prefer a "plain" slasher to a horror slasher and this one was my perfect choice.In this, a dating couple (Zachary Knighton and Sophia Bush) are traveling and almost run down a strange hitch-hiker. The hitcher, John Ryder (Sean Bean), later accepts a ride to a hotel with them. He threatens them and they throw him from the car. After that, he begins killing innocent people and making it seem as if the couple are committing these awful murders. He stalks them and refuses to leave them alone, leaving the couple wondering why he chose them.The three lead actors did a great job. The story kept me glued to the screen and I refused to move without pausing it. I have seen it many times and it still is not getting tiresome. As usual, Sean Bean gives a great performance as a villain who doesn't seem to care about anyone or anything at all. I think Sean did a better job than Rutger Hauer. Zachary Knighton's first starring role proved excellent and I hope to see him in more lead roles very soon. He is a better actor than Howell. Sophia Bush was somewhat good, but a little too whiney sometimes. Nonetheless, I think she did an OK job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rutger Hauer he ain't, but Sean Bean still succeeds in depicting a relentless and at times genuinely menacing John Ryder in this extremely needless but nonetheless competently made remake of the 1986 cult classic. Why the hell anyone would want to remake a film that is only 20 years old and hasn't dated the least bit is a giant mystery, of course, but the new version is here and we can only be grateful it isn't as worse as we expected. "The Hitcher" is still a pleasingly fast-paced thriller, with brutal and excessively violent images of murder and a handful of admirable attempts to re-create the claustrophobic atmosphere of the original. The plot-events are nearly identical to the ones in the original, only the action moved from Texas to New Mexico and Jim Halsey doesn't travel alone this time. Jim and his yummy girlfriend Grace, driving their awesome Oldsmobile 442, pick up Ryder in a remote gas station, after nearly having run over him on the highway a couple of moments earlier. Almost immediately, the young couple forms the subject of the sardonic creep's blood-soaked road games. They manage to get rid of him but Ryder seemingly follows them around, committing gruesome crimes for which Jim and Grace get blamed. I'm very pleased to notice Eric Red's original screenplay hasn't been 'softened' at all. It's still very cruel (the first road kill victim is a cute bunny rabbit), inhuman (characters extendedly tell about their daughter's birthday before getting shot clean in the head) and the most infamous shocks of the original movie remain (truck-stretch!!). The violence in "The Hitcher" is very graphic and slightly on the verge of gratuitous, but I still very much prefer that over expanding the movie with sentimentality and pointless character background drawings like so many other remakes attempt to do. A lot of people complain about the lack of logic and the large amount of plot holes, but those exact same shortcomings didn't seem to bother anyone in the original. Sophia Bush's performance isn't great but I've seen screaming co-eds that are far worse (check out the "Black Christmas" remake) and Neal McDonough does a good job replacing Jeffrey DeMunn as the likable cop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher starts as Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton) picks his girlfriend Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) up outside her home, having just broke up for spring break they plan to head across New Mexico to stay with friends. En-route they decide not to pick up hitchhiker John Ryder (Sean Bean), later on that night they meet Ryder again at a gas station when he gets dropped off by someone who did give him a lift. Ryder ask's Jim if he can hitch a ride with him &amp; Grace, feeling a bit guilty &amp; awkward Jim reluctantly agrees. While driving along Ryder pulls a knife on Jim &amp; Grace, in a struggle they manage to throw him out of the car &amp; drive off into the distance thinking they had a lucky escape. However it's just the beginning of Jim &amp; Grace's nightmare as the psycho hitchhiker from hell follows them leaving a trail of dead bodies behind him as he terrorises them &amp; anyone else he comes across...Directed by Dave Meyers I will openly admit right here &amp; now that I throughly, totally &amp; utterly enjoyed every minute of The Hitcher. A remake of the original The Hitcher (1986) this is one of a recent spate of classic horror film remakes to come out of Hollywood including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), The Fog (2005), The Hills Have Eyes (2006), Black Christmas (2006) &amp; Halloween (2007) &amp; I have to say I've enjoyed most of them, certainly more than most of their bad reputations would suggest. Here the fast moving &amp; incident filled script by Jake Wade Wall, Eric Bernt &amp; Eric Red who also wrote the original '86 version is a fairly faithful retelling of the original &amp; follows more or less the same story &amp; same events which lead up to virtually the same climax. The biggest difference here is that this Hollywood remake features two young American teens in the lead roles whereas in the original C. Thomas Howell was travelling solo &amp; picked up Jennifer Jason Leigh in a roadside diner, other than though the two films are very similar &amp; if you have seen the original then nothing in this remake will come as much of a surprise. Whether you agree with the principal of remaking films &amp; while this isn't as close as Gus Van Sant's Phycho (1998) remake was to Hitchcock's '60 original if you take The Hitcher '07 as a nice mix of action, thriller &amp; horror then it's a great flick, I apologise to no-one for saying this &amp; I'm aware of the 'this is the worst film ever' comments which every film on the IMDb suffers from but from a personal point of view I thought The Hitcher was great &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that.Director Meyers does a great job, there are lots of wide shots of the vast desert locations which gives a real feel of perspective, scale &amp; isolation. Surprisingly there are a few really neat &amp; effective 'jump out of your seat' scare moments. He uses the 2:35:1 frame very well &amp; if you do watch this make sure it's the widescreen version. There are many scenes &amp; nods to the original '86 version, the bit where the dog licks the blood from the dead cop, the shots of helicopters suddenly appearing from behind the horizon, the car chase, the scene with someone tied between two trucks, the rainy night &amp; Ryder pushing the tip of his knife against someones eye to various lines of dialogue which those who have seen the original will find very familiar. This '07 remake is more flashy &amp; Hollywood in style with some impressive aerial shots, slick &amp; elaborate camera set-ups &amp; a more polished look. This is maybe one area where the original '86 version has the edge since it's more gritty looking &amp; even though I enjoyed watching this '07 version you can't but help remember that your watching a film. Some of the car chases &amp; stunt work is impressive with cars flipping, spinning &amp; being wrecked in various spectacular ways. There's not much CGI computer effects work in this until the end when it does tend to become noticeable &amp; a bit distracting. There's some good gore here, a rabbit gets squished under a car, there's lots of gory blood splattering gun-shot wounds, someone is ripped in half &amp; there's a terrific slashed throat.Technically the film has high production values &amp; is slickly made &amp; put together. Shot on location in Texas &amp; New Mexico. The acting varies, I liked Sean Bean because he's a good actor, I liked Sophia Bush because she was a babe although I thought Zachary Knighton was pretty poor &amp; the main weak link here.The Hitcher is a great film, at only 80 minutes it moves along like a rocket, there's good action &amp; gore scenes &amp; Sophia Bush is a joy to look at thanks to her natural assets. What more can I say? I thought it was great, period. If you don't agree with me or have a problem with that sue me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitcher, The (2007) ** (out of 4) Remake of the cult classic 1986 film, which I just watched for the first time last month. As in the original, this film features a college couple (Zachary Knighton, Sophia Bush) on their way to spring break when they make the mistake of picking up a hitchhiker (Sean Bean). I hated the original film so I was curious to see if this remake could fix up any of the problems and it did in a way but even with the changes this is still a run of the mill remake that doesn't really offer anything new if you've already seen the original. The man who wrote the first film also co-wrote this one yet for some reason he still left in some pretty stupid moments including the incredibly lame ending but to his credit this ending wasn't as bad as the alternate ending included on the DVD. Both Knighton and Bush are the main problems because neither can act worth a damn plus it doesn't help that both of their characters are pretty annoying. Bean comes off fairly good in the role of the psycho but the screenplay doesn't give him as much personality as in the original. Even with all that said, the film manages to be somewhat better due mainly to the fact that it runs nearly twenty-minutes shorter, which thankfully is used to erase several dumb moments in the original. Technically the film is pretty good but perhaps they'll get it right on the third try.</fullReview>
