		<fullReview>The Hitcher is a marvelous thriller and Rutger Hauer is truly scary as hell. He is undoubtedly one of the best villains in cinematic history. The game that Hauer and C. Thomas Howell play out makes for a great way to spend an hour and a half of your life. You can't help but feel sorry for Howell as he can never escape the madman. Hauer has zero motive and that makes him all the more evil. And how he always finds Howell is something that is unnerving and unexplainable. It's like their paths were meant to cross somewhere out in in the desert. Eric Red's script leaves nothing to be desired. The scene where Howell is eating french fries is one of the most unforgettable in horror history. And so is the event that leads to the capture of Hauer. The end is fantastic and it's something that you want to do through the entire movie. It will definitely make you think twice before picking up hitchhikers. If you enjoyed The Hitcher, Check out Hitch-Hike (with David Hess) and Duel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic in my view!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring everybody's favourite Dutchman, Rutger Hauer, this superb road movie thriller is tense, thrilling and superbly atmospheric.The first scene between the Hitcher and Jim Holsey was superb, Rutger puts in a chilling performance. Mr Hauer has a reputation for pulling off some memorable bad guy performances, namely this, Blade runner and Nighthawks, but this is my favourite of his performances. The lines he has were brilliant. The pacing of the film was very good and apart from Rutger stealing the show the other actors were good. Jennifer Jason Leigh was good in her small role and of course C Thomas Howell in the lead does a good job. Overall this gets a 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible achievement in the art department, but not for everybody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher (1986) was a directing debut for Robert Harmon, who had previously worked as a cameraman. The film is written by Eric Red whose other credits as a writer include brilliant Near Dark by Kathryn Bigelow. The Hitcher tells the story of an ordinary young man, who is taking his friend's car to other state/destination through the empty and deserted roads of America. He is very tired and almost collides with a huge truck. It rains hard. Soon he notices a figure standing by the side of the road raising his thumb..Our youngster unwisely stops and says the legendary line: "My mom always told not to do this." And then, the incredible and surrealistic nightmare begins...This film is unbelievably beautifully shot and it is easy to see that Harmon was cinematographer before this directing debut. Camera flows and moves so smoothly and gently that the atmosphere is guaranteed to last throughout the film. The music by Mark Isham is also extremely important element and with the exceptional camerawork, these are the greatest elements in this piece of difficult art. The scenes are very similar in mood to Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark which has the unforgettable music by Tangerine Dream, and both films are scripted by Eric Red, as mentioned earlier. The Hitcher is one of the most beautiful terror films I've ever witnessed.The Hitcher is not a realistic film and the hitcher character played by Rutger Hauer is not a realistic human being as he can follow the young protagonist (C.J Howell) anywhere and always knows where he is. He will kill the youngster no matter what and no one can tell why. Even the hitcher himself doesn't give a clear answer when he is asked why he kills and does these horrific things. My opinion is that the hitcher is a double side of Howell's personality (everyman's personality) and he is the bad and evil side of human beings' nature. The hitcher is pure evil and no one can change his thoughts and mind, because evil cannot be changed or turned into "good." It is about which side, evil or good, is one's primary personality. There are always both sides, but the both cannot influence at the same time..Howell has to destroy the hitcher/his bad and evil side in order to continue his life and recognize and accept his and others' "dual personality" in the future. There are no good persons in the world, there are only persons who can control their bad/evil side and keep it "un-active", and so they can be considered "good." Couple of scenes are totally outstanding in their virtuosity such as the scene where two police cars are destroyed by a shotgun blast and they fly and crash in a slow motion. That kind of thing would never happen in real world, but those unrealistic scenes make this film even more nightmarish and effective. Also, the end scene between these two protagonists, Hauer and Howell, is memorable and gorgeously shot. I will definitely not spoil how this one ends, but at the end, the main character is much more wiser and knows that human beings and thus himself are not as simple as one might think..There is no point in describing the greatest scenes in the film because the whole film is so great. It is unmatchable nightmare that has no equal in history of cinema. It handles the theme of wickedness in a form of road movie and horror movie and the result is perfect piece of art. When I said earlier "difficult art" I meant that due to the film's violence (there is not plenty, but that what is on screen is brutal and disturbing) this may be too hard to take and understand for most of the viewers. So this cannot be recommended for everybody like some mainstream movie, but people with open minds and hunger for intelligent and symbolic cinema should love this film, even though it is pretty difficult to "love" ! I have seen this three times now and it unfolds more and more with each viewing time. 10 out of 10 masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping throughout, yet...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder Spree Road Flick. Contains many fairly stupid moments ("plot holes") and yet remains gripping throughout its length. Graphic, stunning violence; be warned. Howell is slightly vapid yet pretty and his relations with Rutger Hauer verge on the homo-erotic. Hauer is a near-perfect villain, demonstrating the steely resolve and psychological impenetrability that have made him a favorite "bad guy" in other films. A great movie for the paranoid who wish to feed their fantasies. Owes something to Spielberg's "Duel" but remains its own film. Relatively spare visual style well-suited to the theme. Recommended, but not for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A definitive Road Movie which features some impressive stunt work, chases and crashes, as well as a storming performance from Rutger Hauer and some shocking moments and twists. One of the best underrated films of the eighties, and apparently set to be remade. Sigh.C.Thomas Howell plays a Jim, young man with the job of driving a car for his company through the desert to California. One ominous, rainy night he sees a hitchhiker at the side of the road, and decides to pick him up. 'My mother told me never to do this' he says jokingly, but it soon becomes clear that the hiker, John Ryder is a little strange. He doesn't talk much and soon becomes violent and sadistic. Jim grows increasingly worried and gets rid of the Hitcher when he gets the chance. This gets his heart pumping, and he drives on. However, later he finds that the Hitcher is following him, and that he is a murderer, getting picked up, killing those in the car, and moving on. He is a serial killer of anyone who picks him up. When Jim sees him in the back of car with a family he tries to warn them but they don't realise. Later he finds their car, empty at the side of the road. Jim reports the deaths, but Ryder makes it look as if Jim is the killer, continually framing him. Jim meets a truck stop waitress, Nash who believes he is innocent and joins him on the road, but Ryder, and the cops are on his tail. Just when Jim thinks he is safe, that the cops believe him, Ryder appears and destroys everything again with an uncanny ability to kill and survive. Eventually he catches up with Jim and Nash, and kidnaps her. The cops come too late, and see that Jim was telling the truth all along. He has Nash in a slightly dangerous position and wants Jim to come with him to save her life. Soon the pair are on the road together in one final fight and chase where Jim becomes more and more violent and unhinged.The ambiguous ending is a source of much discussion, as are many of the unanswered questions of the film. But we're smart kids, we can figure it out. We do not need to know any motive for murder- does it matter when someone is stalking you relentlessly? This adds to the tension of the chase, and the madness to Ryder's character. The reasons do not matter, it is the fact that we will spend time trying to work it out rather than facing the fact that someone is after us and trying to deal with it. You can search for reasons afterwards, if you must. Reasons are given for comfort, so that we have something concrete to hold on to, but we are not meant to feel any comfort here. It is a nightmare which seems to get worse as it continues, and there seems to be no escape, Hitchcockian in the way the falsely accused man is sought and tries to prove his innocence. In the end this does not matter either- all that matters from the start is what happens between Jim and John. Nash is a tragic figure, showing what can happen to the innocent when they get involved with something evil. A killer of Ryder's nature does not care who gets in his way, by the point where he catches Nash, all he cares about is changing and hurting Jim. Does Jim become like Ryder by the end? Is he redeemed or cursed by getting revenge? This is up to us.Some of the crashes here rank with The Road Warrior as some of the best ever filmed. They are filmed in such a way to heighten the sense of Ryder's madness and seeming immortality, and to show the growing fear and detachment of Jim. The score is also very subtle, and the dialogue, especially between Jim and John is meant to be ambiguous and give rise to questions-Ryder is looking for a reaction and thought from Jim, as the director is from us. Hauer steals the film, giving arguably his best performance, and it remains one of the best performances in a horror movie. Howell has caused annoyance amongst critics and viewers for his performance, but he portrays the fear, naivety and excitement of a teen going out on his own for the first time. His portrayal of being wrongly accused, trying to escape the cops and Ryder, trying to save others, and eventually becoming solely interested in revenge, is perfect and could not be bettered by any other actor. Leigh as Nash is also strong and we feel sympathy for her as she is drawn deeper into the game, and she offers a softer emotional content than the two increasingly frantic men give. Say what you will of her treatment, but this was the only way Ryder could get what he wanted from Jim. A cult classic which deserves much credit and respect.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best thrillers ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A normal ordinary guy picks up a stranger in the middle of nowhere so that he could drive awake. Little does he know that he's going into a road trip from hell...Rutger Hauer give what I think is his best performance. Sure, there was that menacing Replicant in Blade Runner, but this one overshoots it by a long shot. He delivers a performance so good, that you'll find it difficult to question whether his character is believable or unbelievable.C. Thomas Howell, one one of the kids in Steven Spielberg's ET, plays the protagonist. Here, he faces every driver's worst nightmare imaginable, and he delivers it with realism. Howell also demonstrates how an ordinary teenager can change into a helpless being who is caught between a psychopathic game of cat-and-mouse set by a brutal man hell-bent on killing him.The nice New Mexico cinematography of which the film was filmed and set gives tranquility to the picture and makes the film looks good while delivering the thrills. Strongly supporting this topic is composer Mark Isham's gritty yet beautiful score. It;s just perfect for this kind of movie.The action sequences are handled very nicely here. We got a petrol station blowing up, an intense police car chase, and one of the greatest endings in cinematic history. Period.The Hitcher (1986) is one of the first films I have ever watched, and I still cherish it to this day. The 2007 remake, or rather, reDO, is a shallow and uninspiring music-videoish piece of crud that will only be liked by the MTV generation, but never the fans of the original. Why was it remade, we will never know.Overall, it is an excellent movie and one of the best thrillers ever made. Pick this one up, guys, it's worth it.8/10Delton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good And Bad Of The Hitcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie it just about terrified me....and few films have ever done that to me as an adult. Rutger Hauer was haunting as the demented killer.The film moves very fast in this story of a maniac stalking a young motorist (C. Thomas Howell). Two subsequent viewings have quieted the fear but it's still a very chilling film and should keep most people riveted to the screen. It's an hour- and-a-half that will fly by with action and suspense.On the negative side, not once but twice we have to watch Howell vomit. Neither he nor female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh are likable "good guys." (Of course, when has Leigh ever been a "good person" on screen?) The police, as usual in films, are pictured as sadistic, short-tempered idiots. Finally, credibility gets stretched a bit, particularly in the last 30 minutes.So....expect a lot of good and a fair share of bad in this film. But, overall, it will be a film that will get your attention, beginning with Mr. Hauer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling blood-fest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent film tells the viewer one very simple but demanding message: Don't pick up a hitchhiker! A young C. Thomas Howell is Jim Halsey, driving along a deserted stretch of mountainous desert road. After nearly falling asleep at the wheel he stops and picks up what turns out be The Hitcher, John Ryder (brilliantly played by a thoroughly convincing Rutger Hauer). When Ryder threatens to kill Jim, the young man pushes him out of the fast moving car, and thinks the nightmare is over. In fact it's only just begun...Cue a terrifying series of events where The Hitcher seems indestructible, killing innocent people and not giving a care in the world about them or himself.The Hitcher as a film flows beautifully (despite its short 93min length), with wonderfully ominous music, and a watchable performance from Jennifer Jason Leigh as Nash, Jim's only friend in the entire film! This was certainly a brave effort from all concerned, and will certainly be far superior to the 2007 remake, as well as the extremely poor sequel in 2003. The Hitcher will go down as one of the most thrilling, scary and psychological films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an intense, nihilistic take on the 'predator/prey' theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cat spends the day chasing a mouse. When he finally corners the mouse, he takes sadistic delight in batting it around, playing with it before it goes in for the kill. The cat wishes to savor the look of fear on its prey, instead of merely indulging the reward it's worked so hard to catch. This is the predator/prey relationship evidenced in "The Hitcher," one of the most relentlessly intense and mean-spirited horror films ever made.Since the setting is the desert, I suppose it would make more sense to call John Ryder (played by Rutger Hauer) a vicious coyote, who is picked up one rainy night by a stray lamb named Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell). Ryder, who's apparently been murdering people all over the desert, is looking to do the same with Halsey, who cheats death only to be tormented for the rest of the film by this savage predator. The coyote craves a challenge--in fact, he seems to live for it.Nothing else needs to be said. "The Hitcher" relies so heavily on a plot that weaves in and out of 'the expected' that any further description would spoil the fun. The two leads are excellent--Rutger Hauer has created one of the great villains of modern cinema, and C. Thomas Howell is a sympathetic and believable victim driven to madness. While the film isn't necessarily deep, the high-energy cast, moody desert settings and twisty script fuel this effort for 98 intense minutes. 3.5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they even remake this, no one can do what Hauer did.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this movie would be remade years later with Sean Bean cast as the hitchhiker that likes to play some rather brutal games and one has to wonder why. Rutger Hauer was perfectly cast here as the psycho and his performance could not have been topped. Maybe they felt the need for a female lead rather than the male one because you know how females never get the chance to be the main character who survives in a horror movie (heavy sarcasm here). This is basically a story of a young man driving in the middle of nowhere who looks to have been very bored and in the need of some company. He finds some in the form of a hitchhiker and suffice to say he should have listened to all the warnings he got of hitchhikers, but on the plus side his travels in the middle of nowhere are about to be a lot less dull. You get a great scene as the two opponents as it were square off for the first time with the young man seemingly getting the better of the hitcher in round one. Unfortunately, everyone in this desert seems to be to kind for their own good as the guy sees the psycho in a car with a family. So other face-offs with this hitcher are coming up and some will be very violent indeed. A rather good thriller/horror type movie with my main complaint coming towards the end as how was he not handled better than that? Other than that you get a very good and chilling game of cat and mouse and you get a performance by Hauer that could not have possibly been beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some kind of insane and intensely tense thriller that rarely comes around anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher is guided to being such an awesome feat because it features a character and a performance that lift reality into hyper-reality, and it's frightening and fascinating to see how the character John Ryder becomes like a presence as alarming as just a state of mind than as an actual threat. It may be a super anti-kindness to an extent (one could say that Jim Halsey is asking for it simply by picking up the man in coat and thumb out in the dead of night in the rainy desert), but once it takes off from its point of departure it doesn't stop. In that sense Robert Harman's film could make some comparison to Spielberg's Duel, only this case in place of a truck is, well, Rutger Hauer. It's a purely relentless cat-and-mouse game, as ambiguous about what lies behind the dark forces of life and death as No Country for Old Men (if not quite as timeless as that film).It should be said, plain and simple, Hauer's performance here and in Blade Runner are his definitive work as an actor. He's does so much with so little that even when he's not totally on screen or isn't in frame he gives the chills incredibly by his face, those eyes peering out. Him and Kinski have that affectation, though with Hauer there's something about him that could, under other circumstances, look very kind and heartfelt. But between scenes like his "talk" with Jim at the diner to his mere (more than usual) startling re-appearance in the motel room lying next to Jennifer Jason Leigh, one can't help but feel his character and performance to a degree straddles the line of reality and the supernatural, as if it's all allegory while at the same time directed and acted with such a straight face. Considering the whole concept is based off of the Doors song "Riders on the Storm" I hope that comes as sincere a compliment at possible.But Hauer isn't alone in delivering an uncommonly good performance in a thriller. Years before he became just another hack-actor looking for whatever work he could (such as last year's War of the Worlds 2 and Day the Earth Stopped), C. Thomas Howell was delivering the goods and this shows him in his own right as a fine counterpart to Hauer. At his older counterpart's level? Probably not, but it's hard not to feel for him and see him go deeper into the insanity of the story as it unfolds. What will finally lead him to killing this psychopath on his trail? Will he have to take a cop or two with him? The dilemma is further compounded by the immediate task to stay alive.In a more conventional neo-noir it might be simply that Ryder would set up Jim with these crimes or whatever on the road and that Jim would have to do heavy jail time without any witnesses or evidence of the existence of this "Mr Ryder". But the writer of the script, Eric Red, is far more interested in the minute-to-minute danger present with Ryder's vendetta with Jim. What is it about death or murder that keeps this young guy from going for it? I have to wonder if Christopher Nolan watched this film, and particularly studied the climax, for the Dark Knight (one can see the ambiguity with his Joker and obsession against the Batman as a comparison to Jim and Ryder), since at the least the Hitcher delivers so strongly on counts of storytelling, acting, cinematography, even the somewhat dated 80s music sticks tough. And in case it needed it, the action is cool too (maybe *too* cool in that way that sadly inspired Michael Bay to produce a remake).Not for the squeamish, and certainly not for budding Rutger Hauer fans to miss, the film is something of a minor mid-80s classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Hitcher" for dummies (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from the pen of Eric Red ("Near Dark", "Blue Steel" and "Cohen &amp; Tate"), "The Hitcher" tells the story of a young man driving across America who picks up John Ryder, a hitch-hiker who then, over the span of 48 hours, turns his life into a living hell.The thing that makes this film stand-out from the rest of the "from Hell" sub-genre of thrillers ("Single White Female", "Pacific Heights", "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle", "Unlawful Entry"...) is the enigma that is the hitcher himself (Hauer).Lots of reviewers here have either said that the movie's problem is that sometimes the Hitcher is trying to kill Halsey (in the opening and at the gas station) and sometimes he saves him (at the police station and in the helicopter chase). Others have said that the ending is weak, with the final confrontation being a let-down.Well, here's what the film is about (in my humble opinion). Don't read if you don't want to spoil the end of the film for yourselves.Ryder WANTS TO DIE. He has a deathwish. The problem is he doesn't want to check out by his own hand - or at the hands of some flunky or cop. He wants to be killed by someone worthy of the job. And that's where Halsey comes in.The clues are signposted throughout the film. Ryder says "I want you to stop me" in the car in the opening and watch Ryder's face during the opening scenes with the knife. When he gets Halsey to repeat "I want to die", it's him that's saying it with conviction in his voice.When Halsey finally fights back and pushes Ryder through the ajar door, watch Ryder's face as he rises from the road - he's ecstatic! He's found his nemesis at last (I guess the driver of the VW didn't have it in him).The ultimate clue is in the coffee house when Ryder licks the coins and places them over Halsey's eyes. He's paying the ferryman to send him over the river Styx to death.The rest of the film follows Ryder as he brutalises Halsey into becoming the killer whose potential Ryder saw at the beginning of the movie.Halsey is smart, but he doesn't "figure it out" until the last reel. Then he tracks Ryder down and does what they he wants to do. But it's a hollow victory, as it's also what Ryder wants.Why does Ryder want to die? He's violent, but he's also a cool, capable, intelligent man.Maybe by turning a young innocent boy like Halsey into his own likeness he's proving something to himself before he leaves this life.Maybe he's ex-military? He's a crack-shot and he takes out an entire police station single-handed and quietly enough not to wake someone in the cells. Maybe he's wracked with pain over somethine he's done or seen in service.Maybe, deep inside, it's his remorse over some other crime that drives him towards death.Who knows? "The Hitcher" is clever enough to leave this ambiguity for you to guess at...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Jim Halsey (C Thomas Howell) is a young man driving his car down a freeway one night who suddenly decides to stop for a man who is hitching a ride. That man is John Ryder (Rutger Hauer.) From the off-set, he doesn't make himself out to be a nice guy and he doesn't let up from there- threatening to kill Jim for no reason and making him sweat for his life. Jim manages to get rid of his twisted assailant- only to be thrown headlong into a maze of murderous mayhem as 'The Hitcher' goes on a killing spree (involving a lot of cops) with Jim getting taken as the scape-goat.The film opens with a masterful bolt of suspense- in a thunderous rain-shower, The Hitcher holds out his thumb as a crack of thunder erupts over-head, setting the scene for the suspenseful, scary ride that's about to follow.Hauer lives and breathes the role. In a career that sadly (because I really like the guy) declined into an endless sludge of direct to video hell shortly afterwards, this is quite possibly the role he'll best be remembered for (after all, he was only the co-star in Blade Runner.) Ryder is a cold, mean psycho whose only motivation seems to be to cause as much terror as he can. In his opening scene, he masterfully transforms very quickly from a bit of an arsehole into a threatening madman, as he explains to his charge why the last guy who gave him a ride won't get out to call for help. No clear explanation is ever discovered as to why he does what he does, the closest we get to this being a chat across a table in a diner, in which he offers "you're a smart boy...figure it out." In the main supporting role Howell also shines (though nowhere near as much as Hauer), as the beleaguered, petrified young man whose endurance and sanity is pushed to breaking point. In an early role, Jennifer Jason Leigh makes a bit of an impression as the cafe owner's daughter love interest.Spielberg's Duel first dealt with a man being hounded on an American highway for no reason...you are only left to guess 'The Hitcher' is meant to be the mad truck driver's brother. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric suspense thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eric Red wrote some fascinating genre scripts in the 80's, including this and "Near Dark" (which he co-scripted with Kathryn Bigelow), and what distinguishes both of them is nihilism. Robert Harmon's "The Hitcher" is an atmospheric suspense thriller probably inspired by the Ida Lupino flick, "The Hitch Hiker", or one of the best "Twilight Zone" episodes that explored similar terrain. In "The Hitcher", Rutger Hauer is a psychopath whose idea of fun is terrorizing C. Thomas Howell and his companion Jennifer Jason Leigh. He has unexplained supernatural abilities to travel faster than your average maniac, and his motives are deliberately vague. This approach works for the most part, but once the film hits the sixty minute mark, its very spare structure fails to support the narrative. There are some amazing car stunts, high-powered violence, and stunning images courtesy of Aussie lenser John Seale. Leigh, who is a superb actress, has the leastrole here, and, not surprisingly, ends up bring ripped into two bloody halves because there's nothiong else to do with her. Hauer is exceptional in the lead role, and was never this good or this frightening again. The fact that he has so little dialog is what keeps him interesting. Too much dialog for a villain is always death. C. Thomas Howell, a limited actor, is adequate as Hauer's innocent victim. Director Harmon returned to similar terrain recently in the lacklustre "Highwaymen". Score by Mark Isham is a plus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher is a film with an exceedingly simple premise. A cleancut, All-American boy cruises down the highway when, against his better judgement, stops to pick up a hitchhiker. This hitcher is anything but sane, and holds a knife to the boy's throat. But he gets the upper hand and tosses the psycho out into the road. But that's not the end. Its just the beginning. No matter where this lad goes, the hitcher keeps finding him. Torturing him. Tormenting him.As long as you're prepared to ignore Rutger Hauer's near-magical ability to appear anywhere in the story, you will enjoy The Hitcher considerably. It all operates on the level of a relentless continuing nightmare. One that refuses to stop. Say what you will about the film's lapses in logic and enormous plot holes, The Hitcher is one of the finest sustained psycho-thrillers of the 1980s.Directed by Robert Harmon (another excellent filmmaker who just seemed to vanish), he does a superb job plonking us right into the middle of this urban nightmare. Using the desert highways as a backdrop, The Hitcher becomes one long, extended game of cat and mouse. And Harmon's direction is so fluidic it practically glides.It all begins with a thin sense of normalcy. Then suddenly and without warning the psycho plot takes us right along with it. Harmon doesn't even allow us the time to catch up. He ensures the plot moves inexorably forwards, with no chance at all of things going back. And there's a wonderful strain of black humour that underscores the film.The french fry scene is a genuine shocker. And so effective for the way Harmon sets it up. Consider this, C. Thomas Howell is sitting in a restaurant thoroughly exhausted after his encounters with Hauer. The camera lingers on Howell eating french fries while he sits there lost in thought. His hand picks up a human finger that he unknowingly puts to his mouth. Its a scene where the audience is way ahead of its hero, and can only sit there and squirm while Howell is about to eat the thing. Gives a whole new meaning to finger food!An equally squeamish scene comes earlier in the film that is almost Hitchcockian in its audacity. After Howell has booted Hauer out the car, a few minutes later, Howell is driving and sees Hauer in the back seat of another car with a family. Again a scene where the audience (and in this case the hero) is ahead of the characters, this innocent family having unknowingly picked up a psycho, while Howell is frantically trying to warn them. There's an especially skin-crawling moment when Hauer kisses the little girl sharing the back with him, while her parents are distracted by this nutter trying to pull them over.The scene is capped marvellously a few minutes later when after the other car has headed down the highway, Howell discovers it on the side of the road, with the whole family murdered and Hauer nowhere to be found. Harmon constantly keeps you on a seat-edge of unease. Even when Hauer isn't around, his presence hovers and lingers over Howell every step of the way.Eric Red, who would pen the equally brilliant backroads epic Near Dark the following year, almost deliberately creates an utterly contrived scenario. Hauer is almost one step ahead of Howell, even when it seems inhumanly possible. The people he turns to for help only think he's a lunatic, even blaming him for the crimes Hauer has committed. In fact Hauer is given such scant motivation, it all seems like deliberate malice on his part. Howell even flat out asks him at one point, "why me?" To which Hauer responds, "You're a smart kid. You figure it out!"C Thomas Howell is unremarkable to begin with, but maybe that's the whole point. Much like Dennis Weaver's Everyman in the like-minded Steven Spielberg classic Duel, Howell is just this ordinary, average Joe dragged kicking and screaming into this nightmarish tale. Towards the end, his acting shows some impressive modulating. He goes from a slack-ass kid who couldn't stay awake at the wheel to a determined, sure of himself road warrior. Just listen to the assured click when he cocks a gun at a cop.But really the film belongs to Rutger Hauer. He has seldom had so much fun in a part. He looks like he's having the time of his life. Its a performance filled with snide sneers and wide-eyed dementia, but Hauer plays it to the hilt. He's given no chance to redeem himself. He's a psycho as much at the end of the picture as he is at the beginning. Something he knows all too well.In a minor but effective role is the underrated Jennifer Jason Leigh as Nash, a waitress who becomes the only one who believes in Howell. She adds an additional human face to the nightmare world Harmon has surrounded Howell with. In a really unbearable (and genuinely distressing) scene, Hauer kidnaps Nash, and ties her between a truck and trailer. Hauer is in the cab of the truck, and if his foot slips off the clutch, she'll be torn in half. Its a gruelling and very well sustained scene that ratchets up the tension superbly. And when Hauer finally carries out his threat, its gut-wrenching and very saddening. It will leave you depressed for hours after the film has ended.The Hitcher is a really quite excellent thriller. Everything about the film works in some way or another. The action scenes are breathless and kinetic. In particular the exploding petrol station and slow-mo police car pileups. And best of all, Harmon never allows things to slow down for too long. I have yet to see the remake, but something tells me Sean Bean can't play the part of an eye-rolling psycho the way Rutger Hauer can. A minor classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic and unique horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never get tired of this movie. Rutger Hauer is somehow gorgeous, creepy, sexy, and even at times sympathetic - he's one of very few actors who can portray a villain with so many layers. Howell was great as Jim, the young, innocent "victim" of sorts. \ I interpret this movie differently than other reviewers. To me, John Ryder is a human, a serial killer whose whole life is killing, who is compelled to keep killing, but who at the same time is tired of killing and wants to die. As with most serial killers, he does not kill himself, and he does not turn himself in. He hunts for someone who will do it for me, as he says explicitly when he first meets Jim. "What do you want?" Jim asks. "I want you to stop me," Ryder replies. Later in the movie he says that he's tired. These are revealing statements. This is not a supernatural bogeyman, which is one of the best things about this movie - he's no boring, relentless, emotionless, one-dimensional robot like Jason, or Mike Myers. I think Ryder chooses Jim because Jim shows a spark in their first encounter - he doesn't allow Ryder to kill him; instead he shoves him out of the car, yelling "I don't want to die!" Rutger senses that Jim has hidden strength, and pushes him and practically TRAINS him until finally Jim reaches the point where he can do what is necessary and kill Ryder. Ryder is almost like Lancelot, tired of always winning, and searching for the worthy adversary who can beat him in a fight to the death.I don't believe Jim kills Ryder out of revenge; he kills him because he knows by the end that he's the only one who can do it, partially because Ryder WANTS him to do it. After Jim shoved Ryder out of the car, Ryder had opportunity after opportunity to kill Jim, but he doesn't (although he kills pretty much everyone else). Even at the end he shoots at the car, moving slowly enough so that Jim can start the car and run him over. He needs Jim alive for another purpose, and in the end Jim achieves that purpose. I haven't encountered this theme in any other movie, and in that way it's unique, and fascinating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher (John Ryder) is an agent of change. Like any good villain, he has some good qualities; in this case, he is absolutely, completely alive and awake to possibilities, in contrast with most of the people he encounters. He's insane, of course, and at every turn defies rules and expectations and ethics of all kinds. But he has a clear purpose; he wants to share his state of being awake with someone else; the only way he knows is by violence. (He knows that nobody listens to words; they have to be shown, not told, IMDb reviews notwithstanding.) He isn't kidding when he says he wants Jim to stop him. This is the key to his motivation; he doesn't just want to kill or torture Jim. He could have killed him many times over, had that been the goal. He wants Jim to deal with him on his level, and give him a real fight for once.Everything the Hitcher says in the entire movie is true. He may be psychotic, but he is not a liar.To receive the Hitcher's lesson - and stop him - requires a person that is open to change. Every other person the Hitcher encounters in the movie except Jim is unable to do this for various reasons. They're too afraid, or too unimaginative, or too caught up in their way of life or their role in society (cop, helpful driver, waitress) to understand that any person can so completely violate their expectations.Jim, however, is young and desperate enough to have potential to change. He struggles at first but gradually discovers that he cannot stop the Hitcher while playing by society's rules and by doing what is "right" or expected of him. Like the Hitcher himself, he must throw out the rulebook at every turn, relying on the illegal, counterintuitive, and unexpected, and paying close attention to everything in his surroundings while controlling his own emotions.The Hitcher recognizes this potential in Jim after their first encounter and that's why he focuses on him to such an extent. Jim is the only chance the Hitcher has to pass along his ecstatic full engagement with life. He must have been pleased in his final moments realizing he finally found someone that could learn his lesson.The Hitcher is essentially a Zen story in the form of an American horror/suspense film. Many Zen stories involve shocking violence, toward the goal of demonstrating subjectivity and how many assumptions people normally operate under.While the Hitchers means are outrageously and meaninglessly violent in and of themselves, the awareness and change that he wants to create in Jim are profound tools that Jim can benefit from for the rest of his days. Jim will never be the same after these events and will never take anything for granted.The viewer of the movie is in the position to learn a similar lesson from this tale without experiencing any real violence or stress. That kind of relevance makes this movie much more than entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trench coated drifter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rutger Hauer is psychotic perfection as John Ryder, a trench coated drifter picked up by young Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) on a dark desert highway. Jim's just a bit worried about Ryder's cryptic way of talking.. and then they pass a parked car that seems to have someone in it. Ryder says that was the person who picked him up before Jim, comments that he couldn't have walked very far. and then looks at him waiting for him to ask why. When he does, Ryder replies, "Because I cut off his legs, and his arms, and his head. And I'm gonna do the same to you." The terrified Jim manages to push Ryder from his car, but it's just the beginning of his nightmare; from then on, Ryder keeps finding him, wherever he goes to escape or get help. Director Robert Harmon creates a nightmare logic to the film, forestalling questions of plausibility and making for a truly scary cinematic experience. The spare desert locations he uses add an air of desolation and doom to the proceedings, and he going gets actionful, Harmon makes the car chases and vehicular carnage intense and exciting. There are times when film borders on the sadistic -especially the fate of Jennifer Jason Leigh, as a girl Jim befriends- but the movie never loses its mood of quiet horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boyishly handsome C. Thomas Howell (as Jim Halsey) is driving from Chicago, Illinois to San Diego, California. Though lighting up a number of cigarettes, and sucking up a thermos full of coffee, Mr. Howell is unable to refrain from nodding off? SO, after narrowly escaping a head-on collision due to fatigue and bad weather, Howell sleepily decides to pick up a sopping wet hitchhiker..."My mother told me never to do this," but, "I wanted to help him, and I was tired. I thought he might help me stay awake," Howell explains. Unfortunately, "The Hitcher" turns out to be maniacal serial killer Rutger Hauer (as John Ryder), in the middle of a bloody rampage. Mr. Hauer confesses he is dismembering drivers who pick him up. Hauer terrorizes Howell for the remainder of the film? "I want you to stop me." Outstandingly paced suspense and blood-splattering gore, from director Robert Harmon, photographer John Seale, and writer Eric Red. The Harmon/Seale/Red team make this "road trip" a classic exploitation. Casting Howell in the lead exceeds any expectations. Jennifer Jason Leigh (as Nash) makes a perfect semi-trashy western waitress (she serves as a "wishbone" for the men). Mark Isham's score is great. And, Hauer's villainous "Best Supporting Actor"-worthy performance would define gay subtext, IF he were more subtle.********* The Hitcher (2/21/86) Robert Harmon ~ C.

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining and deeply disturbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher is easily one of the most underrated movies of all time. A masterpiece of a psychological thriller that is both highly entertaining and deeply disturbing.There are three key pieces that make this movie work. The first is that the action, while often unrealistic in its depiction of events, serves to move the story and character development forward. In an era that witnessed the true beginning of action for the sake of action, this movie was a revelation that a director can use action for something other than just distracting the audience.The second critical success factor is the subtext of what the characters represent. Jim Halsey represents logic and good, John Ryder represents mayhem and evil and Nash represents innocence. Without spoiling the plot, this dichotomy, and its ultimate resolution, is the real underlying story and Eric Red's telling of it is mesmerizing.The final component of what makes this one of my favorite films of the 1980's is Rutger Hauer's brilliant and truly frightening performance. It's frightening not because he plays his role as some despicable delinquent personality, but because he is strangely likable and familiar. Regardless of how much you might not want to, it is easy to relate to him and it is that property that makes Hauer's performance such a harrowing manifestation of evil. If Norman Bates was the everyman killer lurking next door, then John Ryder is the everyman killer lurking inside you.Wrap this all up in hauntingly beautiful cinematography, shot against the stunning but desolate backdrop of west Texas, with a nuanced score and you have a great movie. If you love thrillers that leave an impression and make you think, then don't miss this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant,Thrilling And Suspenseful Classic That Mixes Action-Thriller,Horror and Road Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher is a brilliant and suspenseful classic that mixes Action-Thriller,Horror and Road movie as well as great atmospheric direction,amazing performances,a fantastic screenplay,intense Action and a creepy and memorable score making The Hitcher one of the all-time great genre classics.The Hitcher tells the story of Jim Halsey(C. Thomas Howell)a young man that's delivering a car from Chicago to San Diego. While driving Jim stops the car to pick hitch-hiker John Ryder(Rutger Hauer). While driving,John Ryder tells Jim that he's going to kill him so Jim kicks John out of the car. But unfortunately for Jim,John Ryder is following and stalking Jim everywhere Jim goes as well as killing people putting Jim through a violent Cat and Mouse game. Now,Jim has to stand up and stop Ryder at all costs and put an end to the madness.Released in 1986,The Hitcher is a brilliant and unforgettable genre classic that failed at the Box Office and was hated by film critics at the time of it's release. But thanks to home video and many Television showings The Hitcher found an audience and has become a Cult Classic and it is well-deserved. The Hitcher is an amazing film from beginning to end that mixes Action-Thriller,Horror and Road Movie that right from the opening pulls the viewer into a dark nightmare that you as the viewer will never forget. The opening of the film sets the tone for the rest of the film and you are scared before anything starts to happen and The Hitcher is a movie that offers viewers no salvation or safe haven and there is a major sense of dread and fear and you feel that there is no way out. One of the many things I love about The Hitcher is the tone and atmosphere that the film creates because the atmosphere and tone is mean spirited and grim and rooted in Film Noir with the heavy rain storm in the beginning giving you the feeling that something isn't right. The road and desert is beautiful to look at but at the same time you will feel alone and isolated like the main characters because of the dust,dirt and quiet all around and I think that the atmosphere of the road adds to the terror. Some viewers and critics would easily label The Hitcher as a Slasher Film and while The Hitcher has some elements of a Slasher film(unstoppable killer,the killer stalking the character and being all over the place)The Hitcher is not a Slasher film in the traditional sense because The Hitcher is smarter than most of the Slasher films that came out during the time The Hitcher was released. The character John Ryder is such a great villain because we don't anything about him or where he's from or why he does the horrible things in the film or why he is after Jim Halsey and I think the fact that there's no details about Ryder or who he is adds to the creepiness of the character. John Ryder is pure evil and the character is so strong and effective that his presence is felt all over the film because John Ryder is an unstoppable force of nature that be anywhere and can do anything. The hero Jim Halsey pretty much represents the viewer and the audience because Jim wants to get out of the dark,deadly and horrific situation against John Ryder whether Jim tries to hide or go to the cops but it does no good because John Ryder is one step ahead of Jim and you will feel Jim's fear,desperation and pain. The screenplay by Eric Red is amazing and well-written with Red giving the characters memorable dialog and when there is no dialog Red fills the screenplay with great suspense,tension and terror. The Action scenes in the film are great and intense and done with a fast pace and style with the car chase being the highlight of the Action scenes. Also,the violence can be vicious and bloody when shown but can be disturbing when the violence at times is not seen and suggested in the aftermath. The ending of The Hitcher is brilliant and ambiguous because it leaves viewers with a lot of questions and no easy answers about the main characters John Ryder and Jim Halsey and the ending makes you think. The ending is powerful and one of the reasons The Hitcher is a classic.The whole cast is amazing. Rutger Hauer is excellent,scary and frightening as John Ryder,one of the best villains in movie history. Hauer is creepy,unforgettable and believable in his performance. C. Thomas Howell is brilliant as Jim Halsey,with Howell bringing sympathy and depth to the role and having great scenes with Hauer. Jennifer Jason Leigh is great as Nash,a local girl that helps Jim. Jeffrey DeMunn is wonderful as Captain Esteridge,a local cop. John Jackson does a fantastic job as Sergant Starr,a police officer.The direction by Robert Harmon is excellent and stylish,with Harmon always moving the camera keeping the pace tight and fast and giving the film a wonderful visual style and intense atmosphere. Great direction,Harmon.The score by Mark Isham is brilliant,eerie,intense and dark and truly matches the grim and frightening atmosphere of the film. Fantastic score,Isham.In final word,if you love Action-Thrillers,Horror Films,Road Movies,Road Thrillers or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see The Hitcher,a brilliant,unforgettable genre classic that will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It affected me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really make justice to this movie with my comments. I can say it affected me in a way I still can't describe."The Hitcher" is atmospheric, unsettling, dark, and although it takes place in an open setting, it feels very claustrophobic.We get a cold hearted villain who represents perfectly the evil obsession of causing pain. This hitcher generates an obsessive hunt (with strange and dark homosexual tones) with a calmed down, noble young man whose only mistake was trying to help him. The hitcher is menacing, delivers spooky dialogs, looks tormented and evil.Now, this is a villain everybody would be afraid of. He kills people, goes against the law, destroys places, cars, etc. just in order to teach the boy a lesson that we don't get to understand even after the ending. Who was the hitcher? what were his motives? Those unanswered questions are truly creepy. Every possible explanation hides in the dark.In my opinion, the moment where we should be really afraid of the hitcher is in the "trailer" moment with the indefense, sexy Jennifer Jason Leigh. That's when we understand he's beyond evil.The direction is awesome. It's a big budget film that gets spectacular with car chasing, a gunned down helicopter (that's where the movie lost credibility in my opinion), and a massacre started by the villain.After the ending I could only say to myself "it doesn't matter he is dead, the severe damage is done".Watch this movie objectively and it will affect you. This is one of the best serial killer movies out there. It's very spectacular because of the setting, thus not that raw and violent but believe me, you will never consider giving a ride to a stranger.Why did it affect me? Well I consider myself to be a calmed down guy, with nice temper, who always tries to help people. Then, I can imagine myself getting in a trouble with a maniac obsessive killer. I don't know how would I handle it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The agony of killing and loss of innocence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher is much more than just a story about one guy putting a young man through hell on the highway. It's a story about what it will take to drive someone to kill another human being.Living and dying are two things people do well enough. But some have to live with the fact that they are killers. They've either been in positions where they've had to kill or they wanted to kill. For those who did it out of personal satisfaction, I don't know what to say. I'd like to call that insanity, but our court system does not see it that way, not that I think it should be otherwise. For soldiers or hit men or anyone who kills because they are ordered to or do so in fear for their life, they know, and perhaps regret, the darkest and worst capability of humans: to destroy another human being. Extinguish the fire that is their life.In this movie, Ryder(Hauer) drives a young man to the brink of destruction. He frames him. Kills people in front of him. And of course, he almost kills him.In the diner scene toward the end of the movie, Hauer gives C. Thomas Howell the bullets for the gun. When Howell asks why he's making his life a living hell, Hauer embraces him by holding the sides of his head and stroking his hair, telling him "You're a smart kid. You'll figure it out." This shows Hauer has a different motive from just wanting to kill Howell. He wants to drag him through fear and frustration until he finally kills him. He wants to drive him to the point where many humans could never bring themselves: to kill. To lose all innocence. Hauer knew what it was like to be a killer. He wanted Howell's character to know the same.This almost makes Hauer's character angelic. He's like a fallen angel that decided to teach this young man how to commit the ultimate sin. The movie is a comment on what all humans are capable of if fear and passionate hate are in their hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hypnotic, Shocking, Atmospheric, Brilliantly-Made Deranged Killer In The Desert Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Halsey is a young man driving from Chicago to San Diego who picks up a hitchhiker in the deserts of Texas. Big mistake - the guy is a psycho, who first tries to kill Jim, then follows him, killing those he comes into contact with. Can Jim escape from this lunatic and prove his innocence ?One of the most gripping thrillers of the eighties, with an intriguing storyline, cartloads of suspense, near-flawless direction and a must-see enigmatic performance by Hauer, this is a twisted treat from start to finish. I think one reason I like it so much is the old Aristotle theory of classical unity; keep it simple, keep it focused and keep it short. Way too may movies (especially costume dramas and war films) have far too much plotting, too many characters, too much complexity, too much everything. This is a perfect example of how by paring everything down to the absolute minimum - there's really only one location (the desert), three characters and no subplots - the drama, the tension and the atmosphere get cranked up to the max, with nerve-shreddingly juicy results. Eric Red's story is in the classic pulp style of Richard Matheson or John D. MacDonald - the premise is both real and fantastic at the same time; the Hitcher seems like a superhuman phantom but also has a used-up, earthy, weariness to him. When Jim asks him why he's doing this, he responds with a sardonic, "You're a smart kid - you figure it out.", teasing us into constructing our own rational interpretations rather than weigh the movie down with stodgy psychobabble. Hauer is unforgettable in the role, something of a cousin to his equally famous psychotic self-destructing android in Blade Runner, but both Howell and Leigh also shine in the more conventional parts. The construction of this film is a lesson in technical skill from a bunch of young filmmakers who went on to great things - composer Mark Isham (Cool World, Mrs Parker And The Vicious Circle) with an unsettling minimalist score, designer Dennis Gassner (Miller's Crossing, The Truman Show) with amazingly evocative use of locations, and cameraman John Seale (Gorillas In The Mist, City Of Angels) whose photography is scary, beautiful and somehow seems to make the desert a character of itself, like a live-action version of the old Wile E. Coyote cartoons (it was shot in Death Valley, appropriately enough). It also has spectacular stuntwork by Eddy Donno, with a hair-raising set-piece chase sequence in the middle. The only downer for me about The Hitcher is that Robert Harmon has not made more films. For a debut feature it is simply stunning, and I can think of few better. His subsequent career has been sporadic, with a few offbeat features and some quality TV work. I suspect he is like Robert Bresson or Terrence Malick; he doesn't want to deal with soulless executives and would rather not make films than make poor compromises. If so, it's his gain and our loss. Followed by a straight-to-video sequel in 2003 and an unnecessary remake in 2007 - avoid these, but don't miss this peerless atmospheric thriller.</fullReview>

The man that Jim picks up on a dark rainy night is the mysterious John Ryder (Rutger Hauer). When Jim starts a conversation with this man. John threatening Jim by killing him. John turns out to be a murdering psychopath, who kills motorists on the highway. When Jim kicks John out of a moving car. Jim finds himself stalked and playing mind games with John. Since John is been framing Jim along the way. Since the police of the state of Texas thinks Jim is the real killer. The only one that believes Jim isn't a killer is a waitress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that he meets in a restaurant/rest stop.Directed by Robert Harmon (Highwaymen, Nowhere to Run, They) made an terrific, mysterious horror/thriller with plenty of humorous black comedy, some invented action sequences and many memorable moments. Hauer is extremely effective in the part of "John Ryder". Howell is also good in one of the best roles as a lonely motorist. This film wasn't well received by the critics, when it was first released and it was an box office disappointment. But it went on to be a major cult classic for over 20 years. This film had an watchable but terrible direct to video with Howell returning only in a supporting role. An updated 2007 remake was technically well made but certainly uninspired new version, despited an well cast Sean Bean as the bad guy.DVD has an fine but sometimes grainy anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only extra is the original theatrical trailer. Too bad, there's no region one Special Edition. Since there's an special edition in the European's DVD. This film has some resemblance to Steven Spielberg's Duel. Although it has similarity to the classic song of The Doors "Riders of the Storm". Which Screenwriter:Eric Red (Bad Moon, Body Parts, Near Dark) was certainly inspired from the song. This one of the most memorable horror movies of the 1980's. Don't miss it. Panavision.

		<fullReview>There are movies inspired by books, by comics, even by video-games but this is the first time I've seen and heard of a movie inspired by a song. More precisely the song is "Riders On The Storm" by "The Doors" . What is even more surprising is that it turned out to be one very suspenseful and entertaining movie."The Hitcher" doesn't depend on delivering a solid and memorable experience based on a strong plot-line. Instead it relies on the simple premise of a character being chased by a relentless and sociopathic killer. This could have easily been mistaken for a John Carpenter film, it feels like a combination of "Halloween" and "Assault On Precinct 13". Not because of the plot or backgrounds, but more so because of it's focus on delivering a high paced thrilling and also terrifying experience based on the director's skill alone. There is a simple idea and the director builds on it, setting the atmosphere and pace. Like watching a game of "cat and mouse" on a roller-coaster ride. When it starts falling down hold tight until the next climb.In order for a film like this to even begin thinking that it could be a good, one objective must be accomplished. Strong written characters that react believable to the given situation. "The Hitcher" has that. With Jim Halsey (played by C. Thomas Howell), a normal guy who's just a little too naive for his own good. As the movie progresses we see him change, we see him adapt to the situation. He questions himself, he questions his beliefs and then he fights back. And what can be said about Rutger Hauer's John Ryder? He is the epitome of evil, of death. Yet he has that look, of a man pushed to the limit and beyond, a man who understands what he has become and wants to stop himself. Hauer's character emanates that same aura Clint Eastwood's character had in "High Plains Drifter", there is just something supernatural to him. We never get an explanation on who he really is. Only a feel, a slight glimpse, that he might be something beyond a simple killer and this might be something beyond a thrill ride. This is one movie that after the credits begin to roll you'll find yourself thinking about. It certainly ends in a open way, and there are some interesting interpretations that go way beyond it's premise.Director Robert Harmon has done a wonderful job in turning this inspired by "The Doors"'s music, script into a memorable and terrifying ride. Both Hauer and Howell are great as their respective characters with tensions rising whenever they're both on screen. And with a running time of 97 minutes there never is a dull moment, "The Hitcher" doesn't drag on nor does it feel cut in any sort of way. What we have in the end is perfectly balanced in terms of pace, movie with a fitting conclusion to it.When released "The Hitcher" received a lot of bashing from critics. They didn't like the fact that Ryder's character remains "unexplained", in fact they hated it for that. If there had been included a simple reason for Ryder's behavior wouldn't this turn the film into a just another simple serial murderer type thriller? Or worse yet it would have destroyed the film's almost supernatural feel, it would have eliminated any reasons for a deeper analysis on the plot and characters. Furthermore it would have killed the strength of the ending.Sometimes you must let all your expectations for a deep and complex movie go, in order to be entertained. And sometimes you must accept the fact that not everything in a movie is easily explained, sometimes you're prompted to think beyond the traditional methods of storytelling. Weirdly enough "The Hitcher" combines both, it can be a deep and intriguing movie for some, but it could also be a pop-corn flick for others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best 80's Horror/thrillers I have ever seen. It's a suspense thrill ride that leaves you wondering what the Hitcher is going to do to Jim. Rutger Hauer does one hell of a job portraying the evil in this movie. C.Thomas Howell does a good job playing a believable part as the teen being stalked by The hitcher.There's not too much blood in the movie for you to cringe and one certain scene doesn't show anything but a reaction shot but the events leading up to it were frightening. That got to me and I found it more scary than actually seeing it happen.With all the gore trenched and blood spilling that's in horror movies now it's good to see that "The Hitcher' stands the test of time being one of the greatest horror movies ever made.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Halsey is taking a car cross country to the west coast. Somewhere in the southwestern desert he picks up a hitch-hiker out of good will. What Jim is about to learn his new passenger is a dangerous psychopath who likes to cut off people's legs. And their arms. And their heads. And he is about to do the same to Jim...Rutger Hauer can do what not many actors can do - radiate pure evil just with his presence. Let alone his stare, actual dialog and acting. As a result John Ryder, the title character, is definitely one of cinema's top deranged psychos. Just like in films like "Alien" "The Thing" and "Predator" the characters don't know why monsters are after them. There is no back-story, no flashbacks, etc... All the sympathetic lead characters know is: F**k, I'm next. That makes a great recipe for for pure suspense and all out terror. The interesting thing about John Ryder is that he is a man when first seen. However by the end of the film he is something else, something much worse, in the semblance of man. Few characters have managed to embody terror so well and those that do often wear masks or have some obvious deformity that lends to their demonic quality. Freddy Krueger has burns, Jason has a mask, the Alien is not even human, etc... John Ryder has no such superficial indicator of his ruthlessness, not even a backstory. That makes him all the more terrifying.The violent and brutal tone of the film is also a plus. The remake was violence for shock and sensation, but here it is worked into fabric of the film. Some may see it as exaggerated, just like the remake, but a viewer should take note of how it is presented. In the beginning John Ryder is thrown from a moving car, but he simply gets up and smiles ominously. A clear indicator that he is capable of things no man could actually do. That at least explains the violence he is able to survive and unleash later. Though, this is not a thriller to watch and look for explanations. Rather, think about them after when your not on the highway through Hell anymore.An inexplicable flop that was bashed by critics, this is a must see for any fan of the thriller genre. --- 9/10Rated R for strong violence.

		<fullReview>My best friend and I both saw this film separately, and we both thought it was a great thriller. We thought the gay sadomasochism that some reviewers saw was strictly in those reviewers' imaginations. We saw nothing of the kind. My friend saw the killer as representing chaos or entropy. I disagreed. I saw Ryder as a man consumed with such rage at the world and himself that he decided to end it all by personally forging the instrument of his destruction. It merely remained to choose the right subject. Since Halsey was able to survive their first encounter, Halsey passed the first test. From there, it was just a matter of cutting off Halsey's escape, removing his options, and ultimately forcing Halsey's hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryder and the storm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The eeriness, surrounded me from the moment, the first scene appeared there is a sense that I could feel, when Jim Halsey (C.Thomas Howell) is driving along on a lonely stretch of highway, that seems as tall as it is wide, ominous. The weather is starting to become a bit stormy. The feeling goes from lonely to strangely empty. Jim is just trying to stay awake, thats his only undoing apparently, as he pulls over, (first mistake) to pick up a lone hitch hiker. Someone to talk to, to try and stay awake. He meets a man named 'John' who is en-route to something or somewhere, but it seems a mystery as, Jim inquires as to where he is traveling, (as any normal driver would do) John fails to tell him and seems to play a game with him as they travel along briefly. Before John starts in with the psyhcological head game. Jim, is just not in a place where he is looking to take on a passenger like that. Normally I don't get into scary movies, because they mostly seem to miss making me truly feel moved in any direction about them, especially 'slasher' types. But this film by Robert Harmon, and writer Eric Red, is sensational! It's as if when John Ryder is in fullest form, he is unstoppable, it goes on and on. Until the end and even the end...is not quite clear, strangeness, a feeling in the back of your neck. As if you are about to be tapped by someone. From the moment that the GreyHound bus pulled into the little caf, and the passengers deboarded, the hollow empty feeling rose to the top, of my emotional forefront. I knew, that Jim, was in for trouble, somehow, someway, and John just, appeared from seemingly out of no where. That's when your heart settles into your throat and you can practically smell a sense of panic setting in...At one point, John, gives Jim Halsey the chance to put a bullet in his head, but that is a real tricky situation as well.The talented Rutger Hauer, was masterful as 'John Ryder'. As I referred to him in prior remembrance, he was 'the killer's, killer.' This film is just spine tingling, with events that in the real world...could happened. That's what makes this one, a golden terror experience. It's gruesome, it is queerly funny, and un-nerving when they finally meet in police custody....See it to experience it, for yourself, in a dark room.(****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A live-wire shocker!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably the most intense road-thriller ever made is this daring, well-spun shocker.Young man driving across the American west is terrorized by a murderous, psychotic hitchhiker.The Hitcher is a thriller that plays out like a relentless, bloody nightmare and finds horrific effectiveness in doing so. Eric Red gives us an enveloping, hard-hitting thriller that has plenty of tight suspense and strong action. It's a truly edgy story from its stormy opening sequence to its blow-out finale! The violence in this film is pretty gruesome. Robert Harmon's direction is slick, while award-winning cinematographer John Seale captures some stunning imagery. Also worthy of note is the unsettling music score by Mark Isham.The cast is a big highlight for this film. C. Thomas Howell does a believable turn as our tormented hero. A young Jennifer Jason Leigh is good as a small-town waitress who gets caught up in the chase. Greatest of all though is Rutger Hauer as the film's villainous title character. Hauer makes for a completely convincing madman and is unnervingly good in his role. During filming actor Howell admitted to actually being afraid of Hauer.As thriller films go, The Hitcher is tops.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea for this movie was a good one and I was expecting it to be a lot better. On the positive side the desert/ghost town atmosphere is very good for a scary movie.The acting is pretty good, Hauer definitely does a good job as the killer. The problem with the movie is one that is just so damn unbelievable. Now I have this problem to a lesser extent with a lot of movies but this one just takes it so far that it totally ruins it for me. The killer manages to be everywhere with little explanation of how he got thee. Not only that, but he seems to be able to move and kill silently without anyone noticing until an opportune moment when he suddenly appears to the protagonist. His seemingly supernatural powers also allow him to take out an entire police station at one point (without waking up the guy sleeping in the jail below it) and those are just a few examples. If this kind of thing doesn't bother you then you may enjoy this movie but it seems to me the movie would've been a lot better if they had made it a bit more realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated masterpiece of moody, haunting horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like Robert Harmon's The Hitcher is a misunderstood, under appreciated film. A lot of folks see it as either a crass piece of exploitation, or a run of the mill slasher film, a by the numbers product of its decade without distinction or class. They couldn't be more wrong. Yes it's a horror film. Yes it is brutal, sadistic and unflinching with its jarring violence. But it's crafted with such an ambient, graceful beauty and paced aesthetic that makes it truly stand out. It preys on our ancestral, archetypal fears of the unknown, the unnameable, and the desolate grey undefined ares in our world where sparse life thrives, the perfect breeding ground for an evil force to stalk people. In this case the evil takes the former of a mysterious, murderous hitchhiker played magnificently by Rutger Hauer. This is one of two towering, biblically epic performances that made his career (the other being Blade Runner), and he is a seething diabolical wonder in the role. He plays him initially as an endearing, quiet gentleman who quickly morphs into a deranged, blue eyed angel of death, stalking a terrified young man (C. Thomas Howell) across the dusty back roads of the southwest. The film walks a perfect line between chaotic blood and metal vehicular violence, tense, intimately frightening conversations and moody, dreamy interludes of eerie Vistas set to a haunting score by Mark Isham. Jennifer Jason Leigh has an a adorable extended cameo as a poor waitress inadvertently caught up in the mayhem. Written by Eric Red (Near Dark) who has a flair for brutal scenes, the film flies wild with a gut punch gritty bunch of kills and shocking stuff, which run parallel to the ponderous and atmospheric ambiance which is counter intuitive to the way most horror films of this type operate, but works just amazingly here, creating a dread soaked, lonely, inexorably doom laden horror masterpiece that stays in your dreams long after you see it, especially popping up in your mind on random road trips to desolate areas;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has to be one of the most entertaining road movies I've ever seen. It follows the story of a young man sent across the country to deliver a car to California from Chicago. He ends up picking up a hitchhiker and chaos ensues.When I first saw this movie, I thought the beginning would be the best part. But I was thoroughly surprised when I found the rest of the movie is just as good. The interaction with the hitchhiker and the man at the diner I found to be one of the most tense scenes in the movie.Even though the film has cheesy moments, those are saved by Rutger Hauer's spot on acting as the hitchhiker. He really puts his all into the part and makes it clear his one goal is to make his escapee suffer slowly before he can die. The climax of the movie puts a nice cap on the movie and leaves you at the edge of your seat. This slasher/thriller movie is sure to please, just make sure you don't pick up any hitchhikers along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a thrilling ride!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My god it's so hard to track down these brilliant ones but when you do it's such a joy. I found this movie via an obscure website that was talking about under-rated thrillers and this was featured in the discussion. I'm so glad I found it. Except that it's raised the bar fairly high for all the other "road trip thrillers" out there. I can't praise this movie enough. Not one inch of celluloid is wasted, it never flags or delves into clich. The twists and turns are completely unpredictable and the poor hapless "victim" behaves well within the bounds of credibility throughout. I kept thinking I knew what was going to happen next and it DIDN'T HAPPEN. Something completely different happened and knocked me off my feet. This is unheard of!! And the villain in this movie is one of the creepiest most delightfully vicious I have ever come across. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie. If you are a horror/thriller/mystery or action flick fan you will love this movie. In fact, just about anyone who loves a good story directed &amp; acted beautifully will love it. It's one of the rare movies I've watched lately that kept my attention throughout it's entirety. I loved the ending and I loved that after it ended I was still sitting there thinking about the villain's motivations, the impact on the young driver of the events I'd just witnessed and wondering where on earth I was going to find another film that lived up to this one. :)</fullReview>

C. Thomas Howell does a great job in this movie. I've seen a lot of Rutger Hauer pictures and to me this is his creepiest role ever,, I don't know why I was so scared of this movie when it first came out, i'm glad that I've gotten over it and have watched it.. it must have been really terrifying to be stalked like that and then being blamed for all of the man's crimes on top of that.. overall not a bad movie,, simple to follow , and lot's of scares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot = A young man named Jim Halsey (C Thomas Howell) is travelling across the peaceful sandy wastelands of the Midwest on his way to California to drop off a car, but unfortunately he makes a dreadful mistake he picks up a hitchhiker named John Ryder (Rutger Hauer) who turns out to be a murderous psychopath and quickly becomes a game of deadly cat and mouse.This movie is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, action packed nerve racking and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The tension is what really shines through in this movie and there is nothing bad that you can say about this movie either. The action in this movie really reaches high levels, okay there may some that are unbelievable like the scene where the madman shoots down a helicopter out of the sky, but that only adds to this movie's charm and the whole movie has that nightmarish theme throughout as the main character is really put through the ringer and the fact that there is no explanation as to why John Ryder does what he does only adds more fear and tension to this movie, as he just kills for seemingly no reason. And okay the ending is a bit dated and done a million times but that's okay.The performance of Rutger Hauer is what makes this movie really work, talk about a perfect casting choice, he really makes me fear him and yet at the same time grab my attention whenever he's on screen. C. Thomas Howell also brings charm to his role as the victim who becomes hero and has great chemistry with Ruter Hauer and Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays Nash also brings likability to role which ends tragic in this movie's most memorable and saddening scenes.All in all a very fast 90 minute that never gets boring apart from the predictable ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While delivering a vehicle from Chicago to California, young Jim Halsey (C Thomas Howell) picks up hitch-hiker John Ryder (Rutger Hauer).Uh-oh.A sadistic psycho on a motiveless murder spree, Ryder challenges Jim to stop him, thereby kick-starting an increasingly violent game of cat and mouse down dusty Texan highways. Jim finds an ally in waitress Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh), but the police are convinced that Jim is the maniac and set off in hot pursuit. As Ryder continues to kill, maim and torture at will, the wholesome teen must leave his innocence burnt and bloodied by the roadside as he tries to clear his name and defeat his seemingly indestructible nemesis.This film is a tremendous thriller with Hauer and Howell in top form. Hauer's ability to appear out of nowhere and seemingly get himself out of any tight spot without detection adds to the tone of the movie. As I watched it I thought for the first hour or so that John Ryder was a flip-side of Jim Halsey's character - i.e. they were the same person.Every time Ryder appeared on screen it seemed that either (a) anyone who saw him died - bar Halsey of course or (b) nobody saw him only Halsey. Yet right at the end of the movie Ryder is captured by the police so he is indeed a real person. A very evil real person.The movie doesn't work a super realistic level. For instance Ryder appears in places where it seems impossible - but I suspect the makers didn't want the film to be a step-by-step real narrative. The joy is letting yourself go with the flow on this one and enjoy the 'relationship' between Ryder and Halsey. Something that was completely missed by the Sean Bean remake.The one question that has to be asked after this film is this : whatever happened to C. Thomas Howell? The man was on top form with The Outsiders, Soul Man and The Hitcher in the early eighties where the likes of Tom Cruise was only in bit parts (check out The Outsiders). He was the top prospect at super-stardom back then but has faded away to b-movies. Come on C - let's get back to the good stuff.A blink-and-you'll-miss-him appearance in this year's The Amazing Spider-Man is a start as well as his role in Southland as Dewey - but there's so much more to come from this guy.Superb film - I totally disagree with Roger Ebert's review of 0... I give this flick 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've started to develop an interest for old horror movies like this one. I've watched Child's Play, The Last House on the Left, the Hills Have Eyes, although I have yet to watch A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. Now, the Hitcher joins the first list, and it is quite an interesting concept.The plot is this: Jim Halsey, played by C.Thomas Howell of "The Outsiders" fame, is having trouble staying awake at the wheel. Therefore, when he sees a hitcher, played by Rutger Hauer, he decides to stop for him, just to help him stay awake. Well, it turns out to be a big mistake, as this guy starts to mess with his life; he is framed for the hitcher's crimes, the hitcher keeps tormenting him, and the only person who he can trust is a girl who works at some sort of store, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh.I like the concept of this film. I don't know why some critics, such as Ebert himself, hated this film. It did get a very mixed response from critics, but overtime, it has developed a cult following. This is both good and bad for the film. The good thing is that it will be remembered for some time. The bad thing is that with every good film comes the redundant remake, and like most remakes, apparently, the one in 2007 was quite bad. So, I have no plans to see that one.This one here, though, has some great acting going on. Jennifer Jason Leigh does a good job here as the one trustworthy person that the hero can count on. With C.Thomas Howell, unfortunately, I still saw Ponyboy from "The Outsiders," but maybe that's because that's all I know him from. Needless to say, he still was great in this movie. But the real star is Hauer as the hitcher, John Ryder, who is a complete psychopath. In a movie, if you are playing the bad guy, but you are the one who steals the show, then you showed some skill, and that's exactly what happens here.All in all, a great little scary movie, that, despite attracting some criticism when first released, has developed a cult following overtime. A 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visitations of atavistic, ancient evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The half hour that opens this suggests a better film than we eventually get. The desert is vast and alluring, no sooner idyllic than it is a reminder of our nothingness in the grand scheme, where in the dust lurks something sinister. Our protagonist encounters the hitcher in the middle of nowhere, as though he was spat out by the desert itself. What kind of ancient evil have we awaken here? And exactly what kind of desert is this? Everywhere in this desert our distraught protagonist wanders, life seems curiously absent at first, structures standing but evacuated. A gas station, a ghost town drowned by sandstorm. The inexplicable, randomly cruel visitations of this atavistic evil on the road that leads nowhere, with the ability to appear and disappear at whim, abet the spooky synchronicity. The feeling that we are watching unfold a cosmic struggle, where more than anything the very souls of these people are at stake.Something is amiss in this world then, perhaps meaningfully so. In ways that No Country for Old Men would better articulate, if not ruefully amalgamate the spiritual hazard in the weariness of the people who need to face it.But the subsequent film does not directly broach the metaphor at the heart of this world, where a malevolent, curiously indestructible presence simply removes the people passing through from existence. It gets caught up too much in this plot idea that the wrong man is accused for crimes he didn't commit. Which is okay when Hitchcock does it, who builds films around appearance and disguise, but this aims higher I feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the right combination of pulp, horror and psychological thriller. "The Hitcher" is one hell of a ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is exactly the kind of movie that makes me thankful for the home video boom of the '80s. Cast aside during its '86 theatrical run, "The Hitcher" pits average white kid C. Thomas Howell against maniac hitchhiker Rutger Hauer. Hauer's insane. Why, we don't know, and even more mystifying is how he's able to show up out of nowhere at every turn and escape a police wagon of armed cops. But the "how"s become less and less important as we witness the layers to Hauer's character. And his screen presence is incredible; it's his charisma that makes this a truly interesting (and scary) character. He's a thrill to watch. All of the elements of a good road movie are present: the requisite car chases, desolate highways and eye-popping vistas. Harmon's assured direction keeps things terrifically tense, and Isham's thrumming synth score makes for an undeniably ominous mood. It's one of those movies whose plot seems tenuous, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts; some twisted supernatural thriller that sticks with you. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though not particularly uplifting in its nature, The original version of The Hitcher is one of not many films I can sit through on a regular basis. The story of the dark stranger hitching a ride and causing the mystery and mayhem that ensues, is spot on and incredibly well paced. The photography is quite breathtaking in places, similar in some ways to an entirely different film, Local Hero. There are also many other very innovative approaches to camera work ; notably when the stranger (Rutger Hauer) has just lifted himself to the vertical from lying in the road over night and the camera follows in at foot level, faces upwards when it reaches his feet and shows the defiant figure staring with a grin at the long road ahead. Mark Ishams' minimalist approach to the music is also hauntingly perfect in every way and reflects the stark and sparse nature of the huge open landscapes, with its glorious pink,orange and red sunsets. A total credit to Robert Harmon and Eric Red and an excellent example of its genre.</fullReview>

This film is quite awesome. in the beginning when Jim Halsey (c.thomas Howell picks up a hitch hiker on the road he had ignored his mom 's advice never give ride to a stranger on the road. later he learned that very stranger he is taking with him has viciously murdered a man in his own car , now he has eyes on Jim himself but by distracting him Jim throws the stranger(Rutger hauer) out of his car. He thought its over but it has began now , events are about to unfold. The hitch hiker is very impressed by the valor of tom Howell and then he starts to stalk him every where he goes and what he leaves for him are mutilated dead bodies, matter gets more worst for Jim as he is now considered prime suspect by the highway patrol officers. in fact the hitcher who' s name was john Ryder deliberately wanted to help Jim just to make ensure that he in the end will gonna put an end to the murderous ordeal by stopping him one way or another, it was a game for him to openly challenging Jim Halsey by committing murders. If see this film u ll definitely understand that this film itself a classic and new one is not compatible with it , only Sean bean in the 2007 motion picture was real substitute for Rutger hauer , other wise the new film was nt that impressive. just in 2003 its sequel was released so it was waste of time by making it again when this already is far more worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE HITCHER is definitely a classic in the horror suspense genre. The plot is too straight to follow but the tension built is pretty good, as the film is suspenseful from the beginning to the end. The main characters, JIM HALSEY (played by C. Thomas Howell) and JOHN RYDER (Rutger Hauer), are very good. The last one is the hitcher, the psycho guy? This character is very complex, but also well built! He's disturbed, mysterious, sarcastic (at parts he's even funny!), but he also has some kind of sadomasochistic personality, as we can confirm at the end! In fact, there's a kind of a deadly psychological game between these two main characters, created by JOHN RYDER, where he seems to demonstrate a strange "affection" to JIM HALSEY, making him suffer, and psychologically torturing him, but then, in the end, he just let himself die, on purpose? It's like his victory was making JIM HALSEY kill him, turning him from an innocent guy into a killer! This sadomasochistic psychological game, together with its suspense, is the feature that makes this movie so unique and a true cult movie. However, it's not all perfect in this movie, there're some letdowns too. One of them is the character played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, NASH. In spite of being a bridge between the two main characters, I think this character is not too realistic. What girl would put herself in trouble like that with no great reason as she did? Besides her acting was not as good as the other two actors, which were excellent, especially Rutger Hauer. This guy really seems a lunatic in this film! Another letdown is some action scenes, which in spite of being very cool are a bit unrealistic as well. Overall I score it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can I Hitch A Ride?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you think a road trip couldn't get anymore goofier than National Lampoon, here comes The Hitcher. Talk about a harmless cross-desert-trip gone psychotically wrong. With a noted performance by Rutger Hauer and C. Thomas Howell and a relationship between a killer and teen to yet another great cat and mouse game in horror history. When I first saw this I thought it would be a humanized version of Duel, and it is, but to the next level.I remember this movie taking a turn for the worse right in the first few minutes of the movie when the hitcher kidnaps this family and tells them that he's going to kill them in this calm voice and you know from then on, its going downhill. I think that best aspect of this movie was the relationship between the hitcher (Hauer) and Jim Halsey (Howell) have throughout the movie. As you watch the movie and as these two mercilessly chase each other across the desert you notice begin to notice that the hitcher has a certain level of respect for Halsey and Halsey as a respect for the hitcher. I think this element makes this movie different from other cat and mouse game movies.Rutger Hauer was so demented and such a lunatic in this movie that he almost seemed human in it. There where points in this movie where the hitcher questions his own actions and his own sanity but never quite gets to the point of realizing what he is doing. Hauer did a great job of bringing this horrible character to life. C. Howell who plays the teenager that gets a run for his money does an excellent job of transforming from a hapless teen to a man.This movie was not "scary" scary as it was a teaser horror movie. There are points where you say "did he really just do that?" or "oh my god I can't believe that just happened!" but this movie does have a memorable drawn-and-quartered scene involving a truck and a trailer tractor. I would compare this movie to Duel, like I said before. In Duel there are more near death escapes and treacherous road games than there are jump-out scares, as with this movie.Despite the poor turnout that this film had on audiences, I like it. It was good for what it was worth and I would watch it again because I love those kinds of chase movies. It had top notch acting, a great on screen chemistry between killer and teen and had the magnitude and thrill of Duel. I loved it but this is a movie for horror buffs with a different palette.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense and interesting thriller that deserves its cult status</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Hitcher" is one of those films that initially flopped during its original theatrical release, but gained a small cult following thanks to both video and subsequent late night television screenings. It certainly deserves the status, because while its not flawless, its an unique spin on the already done hitchhiking serial killer theme (Ida Lupino did the basic concept thirty years prior with "The Hitch-Hiker"). What makes it work so well ultimately is the degree of existential malaise and near supernatural occurrences. Some may complain about how implausible and increasingly far fetched the title villain's actions are, but I feel they completely work in favor of the film. It adds a dreamlike atmosphere that was completely missing from most of the 80s weak horror output. The ambiguous ending is also very interesting and open to debate.The film is pretty well made for the most part. The direction by Robert Harmon (who did nothing worthwhile outside of this, making him a cinematic one hit wonder) keeps everything moving at a quick and tense pace. This is really as much an action film as it is a horror thriller. The acting is rather hit and miss. C. Thomas Howell is, unsurprisingly, pretty lousy but he somewhat improves (or maybe just becomes more bearable) as the film continues. Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't really have much to do with her part, but makes what she can of it. However, as the hitcher himself, Rutger Hauer is terrifying, one of the most relentless and cold villains in all of cinema. Hes always watchable despite the crap hes often stuck in, and this is one of his finest roles. "The Hitcher" is a film that ultimately works despite the occasional odds against it.

		<shortDescription>One of the Classic '80's Horror "Road" Movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take DUEL, that classic terror tale about one man in a car versus an unseen maniac in a tractor trailer, who has but one purpose with no rhyme or reason: to kill the other man at any cost. Now scale it down to two people instead of two vehicles, and you have the basic premise for THE HITCHER.Jim Halsey (THE OUTSIDERS' C. Thomas Howell) is a young guy driving cross-country, taking a car for a driving service to San Diego. Through circumstances along the way, he meets the aptly named John Ryder (Rutger Hauer in one of his most chilling performances ever), a sociopathic serial killer who tries to murder Jim, until Jim gets the upper hand...or so he thought.The next eighty or so minutes are a white-knuckle journey through murder and all kinds of assorted mayhem, as Ryder proceeds to decimate everyone Jim comes into contact with, leaving the hapless young man holding the bag for his seemingly endless atrocities.The script is by Eric Red, who wrote the equally terrifying NEAR DARK and later wrote and directed the uneven-but-creepy cult thriller BODY PARTS. Howell is great as the sympathetic and tormented Halsey, who you think at many points in the film will never survive this ordeal. As for Hauer, I never thought he could top the villains he'd already added to his rogue's gallery of rotters prior to this, but Ryder is definitely the apex of pure evil. There's a great cast of character actors lending support, including Billy Green Bush and Jeffrey DeMunn, but the standout is Jennifer Jason Leigh in a small role as Nash, a waitress sympathetic to Jim's plight. (And if you're a horror fan, I don't have to tell you what THAT means...)Legendary for some outstanding stunt work, and several set-pieces of horror that people are still talking about to this day, including an unforgettable meal that will make you reconsider a yen for french fries, and a scene involving two semis that will give you nightmares for a very long time...The debut of cameraman-turned-director Robert Harmon, it marked him as a definite director to watch. If you have only seen the odious "remake" of this movie, you need to see the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing some advertisements for the 2007 remake of "The Hitcher" prompted me into seeing this movie (I always see the original film before thinking of going in to see a remake), and I'm very glad that I did, because it was a very good movie. The film is about Jim (C. John Reilly), a man who is driving through the Texas desert on his way to California, where he makes the mistake of picking up a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer) late one stormy night. The hitchhiker puts a knife to his throat and threatens to kill him, but Jim manages to escape. Trying to get help as soon as possible, he encounters the cunning hitchhiker numerous times while trying to find help, and he begins to be framed for the series of brutal killings that are lining up down the desert highway. With the police on his tracks, assuming that he is the murderer, Jim teams up with a waitress at a roadside diner, Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and tries to stop the elusive killer and get the police to see the truth before he becomes another victim.A thoroughly exciting cat-and-mouse thriller, "The Hitcher" is likely one of the best thrillers of the late '80s, possibly the best of the decade. It is consistently compelling, without any remotely dull moment and some very pulse-pounding sequences and scares. The story is very well written and clever on many occasions, with some superbly shocking scenes and a neatly-woven premise. The opening of the movie was terrifying, and elaborates on the typical fear of strangers that we all have, and that was something that I really liked about it. Imagining yourself in a situation like that is scary enough, so I can't image what it would be like to actually be experiencing it.The acting was good, a little weak at moments but all in all very good. C. Thomas Howell is the hero of the story, and he plays the part well. He's not the most likable character ever, but I was never against him. Jennifer Jason Leigh was sympathetic and easy to relate to as the waitress who finds herself mixed up in the horrible situation. I've always thought she was an underrated actress. And Rutger Hauer plays the diabolical John Ryder, who is both scary and sly, an excellent movie villain. I also loved the fact that his motives or true identity are never revealed - in my opinion it makes him much more mysterious and much scarier. There were some really memorable scenes from this movie that stuck with me, especially the finale and all of the action leading up to it. And that "french-fry" scene was just classic. There were some excellent action sequences and some tense shoot-outs, that all played out well. On a down note, as the movie progresses, some of it's credibility is stretched (as is Jennifer Jason Leigh, literally!) when things become a little too unbelievable at times, but this wasn't a major problem, and in no way stole from the viewing experience. All in all, "The Hitcher" is an excellent and exciting thriller. I'd recommend it to thriller and horror fans alike, there is plenty of elements to offer for fans of both genres. Thriller fans will love the action sequences and amazing stunts, and horror fans will enjoy the bloody killings and the merciless villain behind it all. Everyone has been told to never pick up hitchhikers at one time or another, and if you weren't afraid to do so before, after seeing this film you definitely will be. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER Hitcher* Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) is a young man driving a car from Chicago to San Diego, and during a rainy early morning decides to pick up a hitcher, despite his mother having warned him against doing it.He'd wish he'd taken his mom's advice, because the hitcher is one John Ryder (Rutger Hauer at his creepiest), which will make Jim's life hell, and end the lives of many people, among whom Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a girl who decides to believe Jim and help him.Captain Esteridge (Jeffrey DeMunn) offers a helping hand, but stopping the killer will be up to Jim himself...This movie is probably one of the most intense thrill rides that have ever been made; eerie at the beginning, scary as hell from when Ryder comes in until the end, it never lets you up to breathe.Of course, as with an awful lot of horror movies these days (Black Christmas, The Fog, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes) it has been remade (in American theaters January 16th) - well, more or less, since it sounds more like a remake of the 'Hitcher' sequel (which blows chunks - don't watch it) what with the gender switch (a female is the main hero - BIG SURPRISE Hollywood! What's next, a female superhero who harasses her human ex-boyfriend and whom we should understand? Oh, wait, you already did that with the uber-crap My Super Ex-Girlfriend) with the truck scene from the original thrown in - with JIM HALSEY tied in, and I am already hearing gorehounds (whom I really despise) saying 'Oooh, we wanna see his limbs torn apart, it's better than the original!' Oh yeah, and taking a bath with your toaster is better than taking a bath alone! But I digress...What I meant is that the remake will never be as good as this one, no matter how hard it tries (from the trailers I expect it to be much WORSE than this) because A - they basically crapped on the original's story by creating Grace whatever and putting her in the car with Jim and B - C. Thomas Howell and Rutger Hauer, The Scariest Dutchman ever (Sean Bean, eat your heart out!), two actors who actually used the script, and made no demands to change it in this movie (Sophia Bush, ring a bell? You really deceived me) and acted their asses off here.Honorable mention to Eric Red's script, Mark Isham's score and Robert Harmon's directing, which really tie the package of one of the scariest movies of the '80s.Hitch-hikers will never be the same again, after watching this...'If you give this man a ride, sweet memory will die, Killer on the road'.The Hitcher (1986): 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superb treatment of 'why evil?'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amidst Hollywood horror films, this stands out on several points. To any parent, as in 'The Hills Have Eyes', the scene of 'The Hitcher' in a station wagon with children is terrifying. The film presages 'Natural Born Killers' on the eternal question of 'why evil?', an issue far older than 'Hamlet'. I feel what elevates this work is not car crashes or stunts---rather the Hitcher's simple reply to the young man, when asked 'Why?' The Hitcher's response---'You're a smart kid, you'll figure it out.' That, to me, is the key to this work's greatness---not your typical 'Terminator' being an indestructible evil thing---rather that ancient philosophical problem. And a truthful answer. As in the 'under-rated' Italian film 'Flash Gordon', Flash poses the same question to Max Von Sydow, as Ming-The-Merciless---Ming's reply? 'Why not.' Sure, it's but a brief bit of script---yet it speaks volumes on the 'human-condition' vs. evil---so i give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective and original horror thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though he keeps showing up in various movies (most recently Sin City and batman Begins), Rutger Hauer will always be remembered by sci-fi and horror fans for two characters he played in the '80s: one is Roy Batty, the sympathetic replicant in Blade Runner, who delivered the unforgettable "I've seen things..." speech; the other one is the title role in Robert Harmon's cult thriller The Hitcher.Hauer stars as John Ryder, a mysterious man who asks young boy Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) for a ride. The unsuspecting youngster accepts, only to regret it a few minutes later: Ryder, we learn, is a cold-blooded psychopath who will kill anyone without flinching. Luckily, Jim manages to throw him out of the car. Unfortunately, that was just the beginning, as the deranged hitchhiker starts slaughtering everyone he meets, regardless of gender or age. On top of that, he makes the police believe Jim's the killer, since the latter is always present on the crime scene, while his adversary disappears to plot the next massacre. How can a being like him be stopped?It's a question Jim needs to answer before it's too late, and the same question keeps popping up in the viewer's head, as we go on being horrified by the nasty, shocking deaths Ryder comes up with during the movie (one scene is so cruel its impact is increased by the fact that most of the horror takes place off-screen). By revealing the protagonist's intentions right from the beginning, Harmon ensures the pace and suspense are consistently even and unsettling: as soon as things seem to go back to normal, something bad happens (the best example is the infamous French fries bit). As for the cast, Howell is a convincing victim, whereas the supporting players (including an early-days Jennifer Jason Leigh) are competent without adding anything extra to the film. But that never really matters: the movie's main strength is Hauer's deadpan, genuinely scary performance. After 97 chilling minutes, it will be perfectly clear for everyone why the Dutch actor became a horror icon and one of the most required thespians when it comes to playing bad guys.In short, those looking for a different take on the "road movie" genre should check out The Hitcher (the original 1986 outing, of course: avoid the pointless sequel).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic psychological chiller....with excellent cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my personal favourite films of all time. My only regret is that i was too young to see it at the cinema when it was released in the UK in 1986. The opening sequence is of a car driving over the mountains in a bad thunderstorm, while Mark Isham's powerful and haunting score plays over the opening credits. We are introduced to Jim Halsey, a young man delivering said car from Chicago to San Diego for a delivery 'driveaway' company. After nearly falling asleep at the wheel and narrowly avoiding a major car smash with a truck, Halsey sees a tall, shadowy figure sticking out his thumb in the distance...and picks him up. In a brilliant and intense scene, we find that John Ryder is The Hitcher of the title, a mysterious and dangerous psychopath who makes his intentions plain by scaring Halsey into tears by holding a knife to his throat and forcing him to say four words 'I want to die.' Halsey, in a moment of total panic and adrenaline pushes Ryder out of the car and screams in relief and triumph at having escaped the clutches of a madman...or so he thinks. What begins is a relentless game of Cat and Mouse between Hitcher and Driver, involving terrible destruction and gruesome murders with some thrilling cop car chases involving a helicopter...excellent moments.C. Thomas Howell is at his best here, playing a decent, likable guy who is drawn into a terrible twisted psychological warfare with a quietly deranged loony who never stops.I'm happy to say that this is Rutger Hauer's signature role for me (as well as Batty in Blade Runner) his John Ryder is a man of enigmatic power and chilling indifference, in his scenes with Howell when he is picked up at the start of the film, his charming smile turns to an icy coldness which i just could not see any other actor doing better. The film is his.Special mention to Robert Harmon for an excellent directorial debut, i feel that he made a film where he was wanting to make a good picture that would both thrill and terrify audiences first, and be a box office success second. Thankfully the Hitcher did well in both categories. So many potential successes are ruined because of silly studio interference, thankfully not on this film. Also The Hitcher like James Cameron's The Terminator was a film which did even better on Home Video than its initial run in cinemas which is proof of the film's enduring qualities.Finally, a mention to Mark Isham for his fantastic haunting score for The Hitcher, both beguiling and beautiful, it is one of my favourite soundtracks to film. An example of this is in the scene where Ryder has just been thrown out of Halsey's car. We hear a low, haunting flute sound playing as Ryder gets to his feet (this tracking close up is fantastic, it makes Hauer look a hundred feet tall) and the music is quietly sounding that this is all far from over.Brilliant. Ten Out Of Ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When to lift a finger...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C. Thomas Howell is a young motorist (Has no real background outside of being just a young kid) who picks up a creepy passenger (played extremely well by Rutger Hauer) and when that happens it's only a matter of time before Hauer is doing rude things with his switchblade and asking Howell if he wants to die. Howell manages to throw him out of the car and keeps on driving but after an amount of time he starts seeing the same hitchhiker and Howell starts doubting his sanity as everyone around him dies. This movie is a genuine classic. Back when I saw this in theaters (Yes, i'm one of the few) I immediately expected something along the lines of a cheesy horror flick with slasher overtones but I got a lot more than what I expected. Rutger Hauer and C. Thomas Howell are excellent in their roles. Howell makes an excellent translation as a jumpy, naive and frightened kid to borderline psychopathic as nearing the close Howell is beyond insane. Hauer is even better since he's a sociopath who manages to always have Howell's number at every turn of event. Howell literally is in prison, with police officers and just alone when all of a sudden Hauer shows up and destroys everything around Howell. Howell can't even commit suicide because Hauer won't let him. Hauer and Howell play well of each other and I always take it as a split personality movie. However as horror movies go, The Hitcher is up there with Hellraiser and Near Dark, clear classics. Like Hellraiser, Roger Ebert was WAY off on this one.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent, A Must See!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have to say I love this film. Great acting, truly scary, great suspense, great scenery and location shooting, and great stunts at the end. The first time I watched this movie was on TV, and they cut out a awful lot of the middle and later scenes. One thing I wondered about first viewing though was... What is the meaning of the finger in the chips scene at the diner? 1) FINGER SCENE When I watched this again on DVD I noticed that Jim's character picks up a chip, then goes to dip it in tomato sauce. The chip briefly goes off screen, and as it comes up again it the finger. I took it to mean: Is the hitcher just part of his imagination? 2) JIM IS VERY SLEEPY WHEN HE FIRST PICKS UP HITCHER Notice in the first scene with him driving the car, he's very sleepy. People imagine things sometimes in that state. There's a few other little things in the movie that bear this out too. 3) STATION WAGON "MAGICALLY" CATCHES UP WITH JIM What about when Jim's character ejects the hitcher, then after some time of driving, the hitcher has caught up in the station wagon with the family, how is that possible?4) JOHN RYDER IS "INDESTRUCTABLE"What about how he can fall out of a moving car and not get hurt? Is the kid psycho, multiple personanlity or is the hitcher real? Other things I noticed that could be taken as clues: 5) The police say the whole force is looking for Jim. What did he do that we see in the film would make them think he did it at that stage? 6) His wallet was stolen by the hitcher, yet we don't see that happen in the movie. 7) Sometimes too the kid looks mean and a little psycho. He has a nasty habit of taking the police hostage. Is this just a sign of desperation, or is it that he is psycho. 8) In the interview room, the hitcher cannot see or hear Jim's character, but he knows hes there. Is he psychic, or is this a sign Jim is nuts? 9) The policeman in the final moments says there is a connection between The hitcher and Jim, what does that mean? Of course it could just the writer having fun and making you wonder what is real, and what is not.</fullReview>

Soon the movie becomes a heart stopping thrill ride that just when you think it ends, it doesn't.It becomes darker and before long, Jim realizes how hard it is to get rid of someone once he gives them a lift. The character of Nash was pretty good as well and Jim and Nash reminded me of a reverse version of Bonnie and Clyde.Stick out your thumb, use it to push play and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on TV and I'm so glad that I saw it! I was born in 1985 so I wasn't old enough to see it when it first came out in 1986, but the movie still feels relevant. It is about a 20-or-so year old kid who is driving from Chicago to San Diego. Somewhere in the desert, he picks up a hitchhiker in hopes that the hitcher will help him stay awake. Almost as soon as he gets in the car, you know that something is not right. The way the hitcher is acting and the conversation that the two have let you know that the hitcher is a very scary character. We find out that he dismembered the last person that gave him a ride and he plans on doing the same to the kid. Luckily, the kid is able to push him out of the car, but he's not free of the hitcher. The hitcher keeps appearing in his life to make his life absolutely miserable and to drive him to the breaking point. This movie is great because there is not a lot of gory scenes, but it is still scary because the gruesome stuff is implied to you. You don't need to see heads chopped off and what-not for it to be scary. Plus, there's all the psychological mind games that the hitcher plays with the kid that keeps you thinking, "Why is he doing it?" If you get the chance to see this movie, you definitely should! It's great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The phrase "ahead of its time" is too often thrown around in attempts to praise something that was mis-understood or never all that popular. In the case of The Hitcher, this phrase could not possibly ring any more true. Critically lambasted (more on that later), and a box office dud, this film has somehow been kept alive by the diminutive number of people who were jolted by it when they first saw it. Now, nearly twenty years after its release, the film still makes for a great evening of nihilistic escapism.Our story concerns the plight of a young man named Jim Halsey (Howell) who is driving a new car across the country to San Diego where he will drop it off to its new owner. In what appears to be west Texas, he makes the mistake of picking up a hitchhiker during a pouring rain storm, and the rest is movie history. After surviving the initial encounter with the "Hitcher" (Hauer), Halsey is pursued by, terrorized by, and sometimes even helped by this mysterious man. The story keeps you guessing, and it can be completely open to interpretation as far as just what the Hitcher wants with Halsey. Personally, I think he gets his wish and then some at the end.The acting is very good. Hauer is unforgettable as "John Ryder", the mysterious demon who kills anything in his path. Howell is better than most people give him credit for. We witness him change from a scared young man to a man potentially more dangerous than Hauer's character. Jennifer Jason-Leigh is terrific, as well. Her demise in this film is something you will never forget.The stunt work is on par with anything George Miller ever accomplished in his early works. Isham's score is haunting, and blends in wonderfully with the barren landscape.Many of the critics who didn't understand this film would probably praise it now that we all know what the word "nihilism" means in our vocabularies. Roger Ebert in particular really missed the boat and give this film zero stars. Perhaps in 1986, people were just not ready for a character describing in such matter-of-fact detail what he has just done to the last guy who picked him up to a terrified young man sitting next to him. Maybe people weren't ready for a severed finger to turn up in a plate of french fries. Or a woman ripped in half by a tractor-trailer for that matter.So why a remake? Is our society more prepared for such carnage a mere two decades later? Somebody must think it will make some $ this time around.9 of 10 stars for The Hitcher. The Hound feels that no remake is necessary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie as a kid, this thriller of an idiotic loner kid who's driving across the country and, deciding at the wrong moment to be generous, picks up a suspicious hitchhiker that turns out to be a killer on the lose. Something like 'Roadgames' and later borrowed upon for 'Joy Ride,' the "Hitcher," a psychopathic villain masterfully played by Rutger Hauer chases the kid all over the lonely deserted highway attempting to kill him. And, as usual, no one believes the kid and usually suspect him to be either a babbling weirdo or the murder suspect that the town has been after. Only one girl, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, is willing to believe him, but is soon about to regret it. There are a lot of good brief moments of flinch scares and the usual story line. Maybe if C Thomas Howell, who takes the lead alongside Rutger Hauer and Jennifer Jason Leigh as one of the three primary characters, hadn't hammed up the role so much by being far too wimpy in a situation requiring at least some intelligence and planning ahead (once he figures out that he's being hounded by a madman), it might've been more tolerable when I saw it years later. The filmmakers might have been looking for a naive young man-type to fill the role, but they might've done better with someone who could at least behave a little more aggressively once he figured out that this deranged stalker isn't going to quit and that he's pretty much on his own to put a stop to him. I think, after watching it with my friends and having them point out how incredibly ridiculous, and most especially, how sometimes dragged out, this movie is, I was swayed to view this movie with a bit more skepticism. But, it being a Rutger Hauer movie, I still watch it when I'm in the mood for the "run or die" variety of thrillers. Still worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets face it Rutger Hauer is the most underrated actor of all time. His role in 'The Hitcher' couldn't have been played any better, with a biting fear and guilt edge humour. I first saw this movie in 1993 and was mesmorised by the pulling apart of the girl sequence. However, I was lucky enough to view the master piece again this year and was in awe at the way the film hit me. It really is a prime example of how to build tension in a film, previously only mastered in my opinion by John Carpenter. Please, please watch this piece of magic on Hauer's behalf, he is superb. 10/10 without a shadow of a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think back to 1986, back to the glory days of Rutger...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About three weeks ago I rented yet another of Rutger Hauer's latest exclusive-to-video titles called "Hostile Waters". It wasn't too bad at all, and because of this viewing my thoughts were cast back to this, my favourite Rutger film, "The Hitcher".I have heard this film described as a senseless slasher film with no brains. This is far from the truth. The brains are there, you just have to have enough brains to find them.Rutger's performance in the role of John Ryder is the crux of the film, chilling the audience to its very bones. And at the same time making us wonder who or, indeed what, exactly is John Ryder? I've heard the character been called supernatural and the like, but I don't think that's it. My opinion, is that the character of John Ryder is a human representation of pure evil. He has no identification, no background, but that's the whole point. He is not supposed to have any."I want you to stop me." he says to a terrified Jim Halsey. That line it what it's all about. Ryder is mentally &amp; emotionally crashing. Sick of life, sick of killing. Jim Halsey is the perfect candidate for Ryder. Perfect candidate to end it all.I sometimes think when watching this film, did John Ryder actually have a life? When he lies next to Nash on the hotel bed he shows affection only for a minute. Did he have a wife? A family? Probably not. The character is empty and complex all at once.I would be very surpised if Rutger reaches this level of suspense ever again in one of his future movies. It's a shame because he does it so well. In an early scene, Ryder is thrown from Halsey's car onto the road. Ryder stands up, stares at the fading tail lights and with the look on his face and in his eyes he knows he has found someone to end his killing. Rutger does this so bluntly, we know he has something special in store for C.Thomas Howell.**** out of four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An edgy and intense 80's "danger on the road" nail-biter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sweet, naive, wet behind the ears young guy Jim Halsey (an unexpectedly strong C. Thomas Howell, whose callow boyishness and soft passivity for once work in his favor) is driving a friend's car from Chicago, Illinois to San Diego, California through a lonely stretch of dusty and desolate Texas backroads. Jim makes the grave mistake of giving a ride to mysterious psychotic hitchhiker John Ryder (an impeccably icy performance by a frightfully remote and intense Rutger Hauer, who's never been more serenely chilling than he is here), a calmly malevolent itinerant serial killer whose attempt at adding Halsey to his ever-growing number of victims gets foiled when Halsey forcefully ejects him from his speeding car. But Ryder hasn't finished with the hapless, cowering lad. Pretty soon poor Jim has been incriminated in a series of gruesome murders that were committed by Ryder, who obviously wants the boy to overcome his wimpiness and work up the necessary guts to take him out for reasons which are hinted at, but never completely explained (subconcious guilt? seething repressed homosexual lust? a desire to call it quits and have someone else assume the role you played in life? The possibilities are endless). Naturally, the cops are useless and only token nice gal waitress Jennifer Jason Leigh tries to help out, but winds up meeting an especially nasty end.Director Robert Harmon milks the harsh, upsetting and nihilistic implications of Eric Red's slyly open-ended and allegorical script for all they're worth, creating a potently tense, brooding, oddly surreal nightmarish atmosphere that's both engrossingly twisted and deliciously oblique, staging several breathtaking car chases with consummate skill (extra props are in order here for John Seale's stunning cinematography and Mark Isham's moody, low-key score), never holding back on the unsparingly gruesome violence (watch out for the infamous severed-fingers-in--the-French-fries scene!), and slowly, but surely erasing the fine line between good and evil, right and wrong, decency and indecency, even purity and wickedness as the film races towards its shatteringly vague conclusion which refuses to firmly state whether Halsey has either been irredeemably corrupted or considerably strengthened by his hair-raising, soul-crushing, will-testing brush with death. An absolute powerhouse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, but it is much better than "The Silence of the Lambs", in my humble opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why? Because...1. Evil does not get explained and humanized but remains mystery all through the movie. There is no background for it.2. The maniacal characters do not talk philosophic trash (like "You must read Marc Avrelius, blah-blah-blah"). Too much talking ruins real things. Here the real thing is real till the very end.3. The action sequences are beautifully shot (the chase scene with the helicopter crash and the final one-on-one are marvellous).4. The movie shows perfectly how every man can be framed, hunted, and possibly even executed for a crime he/she never committed. There is a good proverb in Russian: "Ot tiurmi i ot sumi..." (something like "Don't say you will never get to jail or will never become a bum"). There are no police squads hunting some maniac or an FBI woman struggling with the criminal but there is a simple guy, one of us, who is just trying to get out of the bloody mess and cannot.5. Evil does not live somewhere in a small hut with a fixed PO address and a vast cellar to keep dead bodies and all the stuff, but it travels and hunts to get a man's soul, not to get a stupid skin dressing for itself.6. It never got spoiled by continuation.Some of the old American movies are a real treat. This is one of them. It simply does not have much rivals in its genre because its evil character is a kind of "fallen angel" and cannot be squeezed into a simple "crime library story".After two decades of thinking and re-thinking: 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryder In The Storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Morrison's foreboding lyrics say it best. "If you give this man a ride sweet memory will die, killer on the road." Traveling alone in a car on a desert highway, Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) picks up a man named Ryder (Rutger Hauer), and the terror begins.A hauntingly desolate landscape, a thunderstorm at night, and minimal dialogue make the first few minutes of "The Hitcher" a chilling atmospheric thriller. Unfortunately, although the thrills continue, the thick atmosphere soon goes away, and we're left with a long series of contrived encounters, one after another, between Halsey and Ryder. We never really get to know either man, so it's hard to care about, or understand, them. Whatever their motivations might be, their behavior seems unrealistic at best. Indeed, my biggest complaint with this film is the superhuman powers of Ryder. He's more of a nightmarish bogeyman, a psychological extension of the demon side of Halsey, than a credible film character."The Hitcher" has a great premise with lots of potential. But, as is, the cinematography, not the story, is the film's main strength. The script is unnecessarily weak, owing to a redundant plot, lack of realism in the action, and the lack of a character arc. If the screenwriter had made more of an effort to import a symbolic message, via more realistic action, more cryptic dialogue, and better editing, "The Hitcher" could have conveyed more cinematic force, and be remembered now as a classic, along the lines of "Psycho".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lean, mean road classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This unstoppable psycho on the loose film has strong links to two other classic thrillers which came before it: Rutger Hauer, as the indestructible maniac on the loose, has some of Schwarzenegger's menace as THE TERMINATOR; and the chase through the deserts is a lot like DUEL, except with Hauer replacing the mysterious truck. THE HITCHER has a great pace which just doesn't let up until the very end of the film, and all the time you can feel events building towards a showdown as more and more violence erupts on to the screen.Written by Eric Red (BODY PARTS), the plot is both intelligent and intriguing, so you just sit back and marvel at the way Hauer manages to implicate Howell more and more in the various crimes he commits, the most memorable moment being the shooting of the two policemen (just after Howell says he will give himself up), for which of course Howell gets the blame. The feeling of helplessness against this psycho is done well, and Howell is believable as the boy caught up in all the violence. He's no Bruce Willis hero type, but just an everyday person who screams and sweats a lot and barely manages to survive against Hauer's relentless onslaught of knifings, shootings, massacres, and brutality.It is Hauer's performance which sticks in the mind however, and it is a career-best role. Hauer is perfectly cast as the maniac, a sadistic psychopath who coldly kills with no remorse; his is a superb, text-book example of what a true psychopath is like, with the bulging eyes, maniacally grinning face, and heartless jokes. Hauer does his job so well that you almost begin to wish that he does win out against Howell's snivelling, wimpish hero at the end, as he has a lot of charisma in this film.The pair are joined by an accomplished supporting cast, including a young turn from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who brings a touch of warmth to the story. The sheriff from THE BLOB also turns up as, yes, you guessed it, a sheriff, and Armin Shimerman, best known to sci-fi fans for his role in STAR TREK, has a tiny role as an interrogator. There are lots and lots of cool action scenes to move things along, with cars bouncing, rolling and exploding, lots of shooting, and scenes of carnage where the blood does flow quite thickly (the moment where Howell discovers a dog, licking the blood from a corpse, is truly horrific).There are many moments to savour in the film and which stay in the memory long after viewing. The bit where Hauer nonchalantly shoots a helicopter out of the sky to even the odds; when Howell finds a severed finger in his burger and chips; the abandoned car, with blood dripping out of the door (a sudden moment of subtlety here which is far more gut-churning than more visceral images would have been); the bloody carnage in a police station; and the set-piece at the end. These moments of inspired originality are what help to propel THE HITCHER into classic status. And it'll certainly make you think twice the next time to see someone thumbing a lift along the highway...</fullReview>

This was good as a white knuckle nihilistic thriller. But, if you open the door to it being a psychological one too, it seems rather hollow in the end. All guts, and no gloryhole.

		<shortDescription>A sick and Immoral piece of trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October 31, 2015"The Hitcher" is a violent, disgusting, meaningless shocker that forces us to sit for 97 minutes of blood, guts, and non-stop brutality. This film only exists for the truly sick and corrupted and maybe that says something about the people who made it? This is another take on the indestructible mass murderer genre like "Friday the 13th" only, this time, we have a killer who lives to harm and kill people for fun with no motive and were supposed to sit back and watch the mayhem unfold. This film made me feel sick along with its message that hateful violence is okay to commit.It's about a young man, Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) who is driving a car from Chicago to San Diego when he picks up a man hitchhiking on the side of the road. Jim narrowly escapes from death when the Hitcher, John Ryder (Rutger Hauer) becomes invasive and pulls a knife on him. Jim discovers that Ryder is a serial killer who begins framing him for several murders he commits along the highway. With the cops hot on his trail, Jim ends up going on the run with a waitress, Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and the two hit the road while trying to figure out who Ryder is.I'm willing to bet this film was made to cash in on the recent rise of slasher pictures and I'm willing to bet I'm right. As reprehensible as "Friday the 13th" is, I have to give it some credit for explaining why Jason Voorhees slaughters all the dumb teenagers that dare to crash on Crystal Lake. What's sick about this picture is that we are given a killer who has no identity, no motive, and no reason to do what he is doing and we are never made aware of why he is doing it. He travels the countryside murdering people for no reason and that's just sick. Why would someone write a screenplay that hollow? it's disgusting. Even in the faulty end, he somehow has no identity with the police either.It opens with Jim driving in the rain when he sees Ryder on the side of the road. Jim stops and lets him in the car. As they drive along, Jim notices a car in the ditch and Ryder slams his foot down on the gas as they cruise by. Ryder starts toying with Jim and tells him he murdered the driver and he is going to murder him as well. He strokes Jims face with the knife and tells him to say " I want to die." In an act of desperation, he shoves Ryder out of the ajar car door. Jim continues driving and sees Ryder is in the back of a family's station wagon. He tries to warn the driver but ends up in an accident. When he comes across the car, you guessed it, the family has been viciously slaughtered. Ryder is deliberately presented as a character with no motive and killing children for fun is sick.Ryder begins playing with Jims head as he frames him for several murders and as a result, he ends up with a two-bit police force chasing after him. Jennifer Jason Leigh is dragged into this as a waiter turned fugitive when she realizes Ryder is after Jim and she becomes his second target. When the police discover a bloody knife in Jims pocket, they are jailed. Jim awakens to find the police force slaughtered and a dog chewing on his master's face, how nice. Jennifer Jason Leigh is a sweet actress and the film really outdoes itself when Nash is tied between two trucks going in opposite directions and yes, the truck splits her into two pieces. The film plays out just to see Jennifer Jason Leigh split in half, the only likable character in the movie? This is truly awful and a corrupt film and the screenwriters should be ashamed of themselves for not only subjecting us to this garbage but also for subjecting Jennifer Jason Leigh to a role that simply sets her up to be an innocent victim who is ripped in half. I didn't admire anything this picture has to offer and I sensed there was something going on between Ryder and Jim and the climax confirms that. Ryder is finally arrested and the police have the gull to apologize to Jim for not believing him. We can't go home yet because, of course, Ryder breaks free of the transport police and it becomes a final showdown of who is the real killer and we get the sense that once Ryder is shot dead by Jim, something else is going on as well. The fact that Ryder is considered a ghost killing innocent people for his own cruel enjoyment is sick and this film makes no point in attempting to explain anything other than bloodshed and that murder is okay in any way to which this film is an immoral and reprehensible piece of trash.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those movies where you had no idea how much time had passed when it was over. Howell is convincing enough as your basic 80's mid-western dirty white boy. I could relate. He was the main draw at the time for moviegoers. But Hauer is positively bone-chilling in his role as an aimless drifter who has decided, after Howell initially gets the better of him, to focus all of his deranged energy &amp; attention squarely upon the shoulders of Howell's character by alternately terrorizing him &amp; oddly assisting him - while offering no explanation for either (well, near the end we learn a little). Leigh plays the innocent bystander who becomes caught in the middle. Anyone looking for or suspecting the standard romance angle will not find it in this movie; the only developing relationship that develops here is between the kid &amp; the hitcher.This is probably Rutger Hauer's best known role - and *the* perfect example of how good an actor he is. His magnificent performance adds to the film's strange and surreal atmosphere and creates one of the most chilling movie villains of all time. The movie is not standard, down-to-earth thriller. It creates its own world and you can only understand it when you watch it and have the Flying Dutchman's story in mind. Only then will you see that what some people thought to be mistakes and holes in the script are in fact deliberate and well-thought elements of the plot. Basically, a weird off-beat script with a small but well chosen cast &amp; crew which resulted in this singularly terrifying gem. Even the dogs did their parts well.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Quentin Tarantino,I know it will never happen. But I urge you to remake The Hitcher. It would be amazing. The film has all the elements that you could expand upon. A young man driving across the country. We get the beautiful long shots of the highways. He drinks coffee from a flask. Must be cozy driving early in the morning across a deserted highway and drinking coffee. Of course, then it all falls apart when he meets this serial killing hitcher and has to fight him off. The film turns into a typical genre flick.But things pick up again when he meets a cool and smart waitress (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Their exchanges after she makes him a burger and fries are interesting. I am not surprised you cast Leigh in The Hateful Eight. What a terrific actor she was/is.But the best elements of this film are not expanded upon. The film needed a risk taking gender bending director like you. Don't get me wrong. I loved the action scenes. Rutger Hauer looked menacing. Though the novelty wore off after a while because the character was so silly. It is an entertaining film with many interesting bits.

		<shortDescription>Finally watched this one - anti-spoler review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie... It had a sort of legendary, mystical quality before I watched it. Heard it was pretty good many years ago, always liked Haur a lot, had bits of the trailer imprinted in my memory from 30 years ago, but just never got to see it. So glad I watched it today of all days... it was just one of those days (my normally sweet fat lazy cat bit my 6 year old daughter and drew a tiny bit of blood because she disturbed him by trying to put a blanket on him to keep him warm... Stupid flipping cat... Water spray bottle x 100 revenge/punishment) and now I can sleep better having purged some aggravation from my heart. More from the movie than the water bottle (all he had to do was stay in the kitchen instead of coming near me to beg for a fourth meal after attacking my kid). To the review, I just loved it. Rutger gave his best performance I think. The word menacing doesn't do it justice. I won't spoil it, but do this if you can. Avoid plot summaries, reviews, or spoilers of any kind. When you watch the movie, try to figure it out. Ask yourself what is happening for certain and what parts are a hallucination or the supernatural. I think this movie has several layers to it that come together nicely if you pay close attention to detail. Great performances all around truth be told... A few people launched careers off this movie if I am not mistaken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher (9/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher is a classic road movie that follows a young driver as he travels across remote places of the western United States. C. Thomas Howell and Rutger Hauer's characters were great adversaries, both pulling off believable roles as the hunter and the haunted. The movie never ceased to lose my attention having some sort of car chase, action sequence or intense dialogue taking place. Bits and pieces of the film do take a long period of time to develop and there is some choppiness to the flow of the movie but there are far more positives than negatives to the story. There is one very cool scene in particular that occurs at a restaurant that is unsuspecting to viewers and truly horrifying. The Hitcher is a non-stop thrill ride that is fairly unpredictable, having a few different plot twists throughout. Check out The Hitcher is you're looking to enjoy a well written film that is a bit scarier than your typical road movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about this movie that makes me go back time and time again to relive the thriller that is "The Hitcher." I first saw this movie a few years after its release when I was about 14 yrs old or so and I remember feeling really disturbed and creeped out by the character "John Ryder." This movie is one that left an impression on me and decades later I still warn against picking up hitch-hikers and, when people laugh, I just look at them and say "did you not see The Hitcher?" The performance delivered by Rutger Hauer in this iconic movie is unforgettable and the relationship between he and protagonist, C Thomas Howell, is very convincing. You can feel the utter despair and shock that poor Jim Halsey is going through as he is terrorized along the route by Ryder.Just as Jaws kept me scared of swimming in the ocean, The Hitcher will keep me from ever picking up a hitchhiker. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never pick up a hitchhiker!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an 80s thriller where young Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) who wishes he never gave hitchhiker John Ryder (Rutger Hauer) a ride. He turns out to be a murderous psychopath who stalks and frames Halsey for his crimes after Jim initially kicks him out of his car.The entire film is set in the desert, which gives the notion that there is nowhere for poor Halsey to hide. Therefore, he must dodge Ryder at every time and think of a plan to beat him at his own cat and mouse game. All this mayhem set off an intriguing plot and suspenseful thrills that will keep you at the edge of your seat.The acting is decent enough and the drama is sort of powerful; you could sense Halsey's frustration and anxiety this psychopath has caused him, providing sympathy from the audience. Included in the story is some intense horror and action sequences that all leads to a tense climax ***minor spoiler*** (not a completely satisfying climax, but still serviceable). ***minor spoiler ends*** Not bad overall.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite "John's" omnipotence, The Hitcher was a tight, thrilling horror/suspense that contained one helluva bad guy from Rutger Hauer. Even in 1986, it showed some absolute originality and liberties with the death toll?namely one towards the end. I guess if I can forgive Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees knowing more than they possibly could, I can skip over many of the plot holes, such as the hitcher magically getting dozens of miles ahead of our hero as if he teleported and multiple problems, such as the conveniently placed heroine and the opening takes place at night, then day, then dusk, then day, then night ? all in 3 minutes?and in a storm.Since Rutger was just so awesome and hero C. Thomas was believable as he was losing it, the good outweighed the bad. Not to mention the motives, or lack thereof, of John made it all the creepier and kept the story going. A little more than a decade later, the same theme would be that of Halloween: H20 and another two plus decades we would be introduced to the similar villain, (Heath Ledger's) Joker. This is my first time seeing the original The Hitcher and I might have cried foul on my 2nd favorite Halloween flick and 2nd favorite Batman movie had I seen this first. That said, I still enjoy all three movies and am sorry I hadn't seen this sooner.Completely recommended, as it holds up today?and this coming from someone who saw it for the first time today: June 15, 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping road thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher transcends a lot of genres. It can be easily labeled as a horror film, but it can also be an action movie, a thriller, and a road trip movie. All these genres mix together to bring forth a fast paced, violent, engaging, and entertaining about the danger of picking up strangers.Good: I like that it has a grindhouse feel to it with its unapologetic displays of violence and destruction. It could have very easily belong in the Roger Corman camp of vehicular driven films. The movie is a very basic cat and mouse game between the main character and the Hitchhiker, but it alludes to some hidden meanings to psychosis and possibly the whole "teenagers being looked down as just animals" idea. Although, the core of the movie is a chase thriller and it works at its most basic even if the first half is more thriller than outright action. C. Thomas Howell delivers a good performance as Jim with a great depiction of fear and slowly unraveling throughout the movie. Rutger Hauer is intimidating and awesome as John Ryder with an omnipresence to him. Jennifer Jason Leigh shows up and provides some good moments including the most memorable scene which invokes the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its execution. The action is also much better than what you would expect from a movie like this with big explosion and a great police chase.Bad: I really like the Hitchcockian vibe it was going in the first half that the later half when things got more concrete it lost some of its effectiveness.Overall, while it does settle into full blown action, it is still a massively entertaining action horror thriller with a lot of bite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was disturbed by the film, and I believe that's a good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Hitcher" is more than just a slasher or your typical horror flick, in fact it lends itself a lot more to the thriller genre and it's a tense, entertaining ride that's not perfect but entertaining. I bet you can guess what the plot is just from the title, but I'll spell it out for you anyway. Jim (C. Thomas Howell) is a nice guy just minding his own business when he picks up a hitchhiker, a strange man called Ryder (Rutger Hauer). Turns out the guy is a maniac! Along the way, our hero meets up with a nice young lady named Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and a whole lot of people end up dead.Rutger Hauer, C. Thomas Howell and Jennifer Jason Leigh are all good in their parts; we sympathize with our heroes and we're both puzzled and frightened by our villain. I felt tense throughout and admire the fact that it never chickens out with the violence and body count. Admittedly that does mean that at a certain point it gets pretty ridiculous and exaggerated. I know when it came to my experience watching the film I thought it was ludicrous that a couple with two young children would decide to pick up a hitchhiker. As you can expect, that goes about as well as it usually does in a horror movie, so even this brighter-than-usual picture can't escape some of the trappings of the genre. In a strange twist from what you see in your usual horror movies, sometimes the film feels like the characters are making intelligent decisions but every character isn't intelligently written. Maybe they just get lucky (well, not really considering the plot of the film, but you know what I mean).I have mixed feelings about the picture overall because there are a lot of good things about it. It's supposed to be horrific and it did shock me. I felt disturbed after it ended and I have to give the movie props to "The Hitcher" because I believe that was the intended result. Nevertheless I have to dock it some points because of some missed opportunities I saw, like more of an exploration of the relationship between the reluctant hero and the killer. I thought maybe just a few lines, or one more scene was what this picture needed to really sell me on the ending. It's still worth your time, though some of it maybe too dark, too bleak or nihilistic for certain audiences. (On DVD, October 28, 2012)</fullReview>

Thomas Howell for apparently no reason. That's a different type of scary and anyone who has experience road rage has an idea of what it's like when someone on the road just seems focus on making your day a living hell. This movie takes that to the extreme. It plays out well. really awesome to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher: More Than Meets the Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm putting a possible spoiler alert at the beginning of this, just in case, though I have no intention of doing so as this one needs to be watched and experienced frame for frame. I took a chance on this film having greatly admired Rutger Hauer's work in Blade Runner, Sin City, Batman Begins, and essentially anything I'd seen him in. I'm a fan of Duel and many other desert thriller/horror flicks, so this seemed right up my alley once I'd read some very brief points about the setting and genre. I knew absolutely nothing about the plot, which served me well as I experienced this amazing story scene for scene. Though critically lambasted in its time by over-hyped critics and a less than receptive public, this film simmered for a while attaining cult status and the inevitable crappy sequel and remake, so there had to be something there. This film starts the plot ball rolling very quickly with our young "hero" encountering the superbly played title character less than 30 minutes into the film. The uncomfortable silence, stares, and awkward exchanges between the two men make the scene as tense and uncomfortable to watch as the scene in Deliverance when Ned Beatty and Jon Voight meet the woodsmen. Seeing the rain-soaked Hauer brought back memories of the formidable Roy Batty from Blade Runner (another brilliant Hauer performance). The viewer is kicked over the edge immediately to confront a disturbing turn of events that happened off camera and would foreshadow a chase driven journey into murder and near madness in the never ending American desert. C. Thomas Howell, though not really regarded as the best actor of his generation, gives a decent performance as the young and naive Jim Halsey just driving a "drive-away" car back to a guy in San Diego. Hauer is menacing playing the role with perfect economy making his smile seem much more dangerous than any grimace. Jennifer Jason Leigh effectively plays the only female character in the piece with a sort of jaded small-town girl approach. She apparently sought out the role just to work with Hauer again (they had starred in Flesh &amp; Blood together) There are some great portrayals of Texas police that make one wonder, are these real cops? The whole thing becomes this Duel meets Vanishing Point hybrid with veins of Hitchcock pulsing through it. It's the type of film that deserves discussion regarding its themes and interpretation. The filmmakers morph the desert into a character all its own as they make excellent use of the Mojave's highway and Route 66 stop-over buildings. One of the complaints I read about it was the "gore" aspect of it, which is ridiculous as the film seems genuinely restrained in its portrayal of violence. There are a few scenes where they could have "gone there" with regards to the level of blood and guts, but they didn't. The viewer is left to guess about what has happened and what they have just not seen. It's a more effective tool as we always imagine something more disturbing than what they could have conjured up on film. So, don't approach it as a gross out horror flick from the 80s, it's much headier than that. The plot unravels and evolves into a conceptual cat-and-mouse game that causes the viewer to question what he/she is seeing and the reliability of the character's point of view. Here are some points to think about as you watch: Why is everyone wearing heavy coats in the obviously warm and dry desert? What is the significance of the match (recurring)? What did he see in the station wagon? Is the desert just a desert? Was the pick-up at the beginning destiny, or was Jim just in the wrong place at the wrong time? So, having that to mull, please watch the film; in the dark, at night, and alone. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated , great and intense psycho-thriller from the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of best thrillers ever made. It reminds me of Steven Spielberg's "Duel" and of Coen Brothers "No country for old men". It's interesting that the concept for the story was inspired by the Doors song "Raiders on the storm".The premise is simple and wonderful. It's very easy to put yourself in the position of main hero and that's one of the reasons why "The Hitcher" is so scary. Even when the incredible nightmare begins you believe it could happen to you in real life. "The Hitcher" is atmospheric, unsettling, dark and claustrophobic. The whole atmosphere of the film is disturbing and downbeat.John Ryder isn't a realistic character. He appears and disappears out of nowhere. He is more like a symbol , force of nature. No explanations are given why and how he does all those things , but that's THE WHOLE POINT. The movie has a surreal feel to it and follows dream logic. The unrealistic scenes make this film even more nightmarish and effective. When something bad can happen it happens. You shouldn't watch "The Hitcher" expecting 100% credibility , so people complaining about plot holes are missing the point of Eric Red's slyly , allegorical and open ended script.The screenplay is truly thought-provoking. It asks questions and gives hints , but it's up to the viewer to figure out the answers. The possibilities are pretty much endless. It turns "The Hitcher" into a piece of art where every viewer can have a different interpretation of the movie. Even the ending is one when you can wonder was it a happy ending or bad ending. You can discover new meanings every time you watch the movie. It's a truly affecting story about good and evil. This is one movie that after the credits begin to roll you'll find yourself thinking about. It certainly ends in a open way, and there are some interesting interpretations that go way beyond it's premise.Rutger Hauer (John Ryder) is BRILLIANT. Hauer deserved Oscar and it's sad that he rarely appeared in such good movies. Here he's got a chance to show his impressive acting skills .He will make the hairs on your back stand up. A cold hearted villain who represents perfectly the evil obsession of causing pain. Hauer looks tormented , speaks spooky dialogues and is at times sympathetic. A simply unforgettable performance. C. Thomas Howell (Jim Halsey) is in the shadow of Hauer , which is a shame. He gives a strong performance here too and makes the audience really care for him. We see a shy , decent guy slowly descending into madness trying to stay alive and to stop Ryder. Nice understated performance from Jennifer Jason Leigh (Nash) as a good ordinary girl somehow caught in this nightmare.This is a directing debut for Robert Harmon and he does a really solid job here. The pacing feels good and the action /violence scenes are really intense. Memorable moments ? French fries scene , helicopter scene , cop chase , the ending. Sadly , Harmon never made anything interesting after this movie. John Seale's cinematography is stunning. The atmosphere stays with you long after the movie is finished. Mark Isham provides an moody low-key score. A great , scary , thought provoking and sadly underrated thriller. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and shocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1987 I watched this movie and where surprised how shocking and creepy it was made. It is one of the best performances of actor Rutger Hauer, and one of the best car chases/crashing cinematic experience I ever saw on big screen. Some gruesome scenes all around made this one more as a shocking thriller horror that will even today please fine audience. Unlike its remake (with Sean Bean) which is very weak, the original Hitcher is a movie really worth to watch. The complete atmosphere, score and camera work is outstanding. This is not high budget movie, but great B flick which I believe have cult status.So a guy that earn salary by moving a car from one part of America to another, takes a man who hitchhike during hard rain night. It soon become obvious that a man is a lunatic and a killer who enjoys in killing all of his victims that takes him for the ride. And not just them. He is not just ordinary man. He is very intelligent, very dangerous, very capable and superior manipulative psycho that will drive you crazy and kill you no matter what. You simply can't run from him as he will find you even in a smallest whole somewhere deep in the ground in deep Sahara desert. Not just that, he is so intelligent that he will turn everyone on you as he can manipulate situation so that you will become that gruesome criminal or anything that law enforcement would rather see you on electric chair.But luckily at the end someone believes you, but by then you loose your sanity and emotions (the killer probably wished you become). Hopefully at the very end you get rid of this demon, but even then it is obvious that you will never be the same person as before. The killer and psycho name is John Ryder and he loves to ride.Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch a ride with Hauer and Howell to hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher is the most beautifully shot film I've ever seen. And that's scary, considering it's story. There's nothing beautiful about a madman (played with brilliant menace by Rutger Hauer) who's constantly slaughtering people, including children, their minders making the dreaded mistake of picking him up. If this movie isn't a warning to the dangers of hitchhiking, I don't what it is. Amiable lone driver, Jim Halsey (C Thomas Howell, hey!) makes this mistake and this is one he pays for the rest of his life, as seen in it's stupid and unnecessary sequel. One of the reasons he picked Hauer up, was to keep him awake, after falling asleep at the wheel, where consequently he nearly collides with a rig, prior. The long shot after of the two vehicles separating speedily is just dynamo. There's no other word for it. That whole photographic night shot sequence is a just a beautiful start to the film, and that thanks to Australia's own John Seale. The other reason Jim picked him up, was he felt sorry for him. Idiot. Luckily, Jim manages to heave this nut out the door as it's ajar. But this is only the start of his nightmare reality. Come morning, Jim's driving along, as if what happened before was just a dream. Then this hitchhiking nut, reappears in a passing station wagon. Jim's warning becomes one of absolute futility as a couple of miles down the track, Jim finds what's left of this family. He becomes a player in this killer's game, stalked, set up, nearly blown up in an awesome gas station scene. Jennifer Jason Leigh, a waitress donning a Texas accent, joins forces with Jim, to prove his innocence later on, where a great car chase ensues, involving top floor stunt work that really works for the film, where the two fugitives are pursued by a bevy of cop cars, taking up both lanes of the highway. This, proving, out there on vast Texas lonescape, cops take it very personally, when somebody kills one of their own. This cool chase sequence, is shot with wonderfully staged perfection. There's some pretty gross violence in some scenes, others it's wisely held back, considering what they'd look like if they went to film. The sickest scene of gore, is a dead cop, among three (hitcher's work) a German shepherd knelt over him, licking blood as it jets out of the dead officers neck. The restaurant scene's great, a getting to know you scene with Howell and Leigh, although Howell's not really in a talking mood. That cheeseburger and those golden fries, in CU, YU-MMY Not. Keen observer as I am, those fries are long thin type I can't stand. Jim almost chokes on something mixed in with them that shouldn't be there. As to the acting, all three leads are perfect, but you're not gonna top Rutger. The story's been plotted well, with enough thrills and spills that has the hitcher reappearing in Jim's life. The other cafe/motel scene, (also used in Kalifornia) you'd never expect this. And as to that restaurant scene in The Longhorn Diner, how Rutger got in there and planted that bloodied knife on Jim has always left me analyzing. I don't know, may'be I should just go out and get a life. As for the climax, again, it doesn't disappoint. It's one of a couple scenes I treasure. A true showdown between two enemies that's DY-NO-MITE! Howell looks so cool in close up, in a police cruiser, as he wipes his forid, while coming up right behind Hauer, kept inside a holding bus. You won't believe what happens next. From this last scene, we discover just how crazy this psychopath really is. For thriller action/road movie fans, this cult film of 86 still works. An action masterpiece in it's entirety, that I've viewed a million, trillion billion timers.</fullReview>

But long routines make people careless - plus vicious maniacs look always decent outside; and if they frame you - your are in big trouble.That's what more of less happens to Jim Halsey (well portrayed by C. Thomas Howell) while he is on his way to California from San Diego. Unfortunately, he gets a devious adversary (great performance by a Dutchman Rutger Hauer) and then "dung hits the fan": long chases and bursts, explosions and nervous moments are well captured and directed, the movie is a color one - no need for remake which was for some reason or other made in 2006 (Sean Bean is a great actor, but still...)For single men, it has always been problematic to hitch, but I am sure that viewers of The Hitcher would be further reluctant to have unfamiliar passengers in their cars...</fullReview>

Sure, there was that menacing Replicant in Blade Runner, but this one overshoots it by a long shot. He delivers a performance so good, that you'll find it difficult to question whether his character is believable or unbelievable.C. Thomas Howell, one one of the kids in Steven Spielberg's ET, plays the protagonist. Here, he faces every driver's worst nightmare imaginable, and he delivers it with realism. Howell also demonstrates how an ordinary teenager can change into a helpless being who is caught between a psychopathic game of cat-and-mouse set by a brutal man hell-bent on killing him.The nice New Mexico cinematography of which the film was filmed and set gives tranquility to the picture and makes the film looks good while delivering the thrills. Strongly supporting this topic is composer Mark Isham's gritty yet beautiful score. It;s just perfect for this kind of movie.The action sequences are handled very nicely here. We got a petrol station blowing up, an intense police car chase, and one of the greatest endings in cinematic history.

		<fullReview>"The Hitcher" is one of the best of the "terror along the highway" genre, a consistently grim and interesting thriller that gets a lot of mileage out of the performance of top billed Rutger Hauer. Hauer plays "John Ryder", a smiling psychopathic hitchhiker who attaches himself to young Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell), who's driving a car through Texas to its purchaser in San Diego. Ryder keeps turning up in Halsey's life, and wherever he appears, bad things tend to happen. Perhaps where the film succeeds the best is in creating some ambiguity as to the actual nature of the events unfolding - is Ryder real or just in Jim's head? In any event, we can see Jim coming more and more unglued as this story progresses, leading him to realize that this unrelenting force in his life must be dealt with. Brief spurts of gore add some punch, although much of the violence is shown as an aftermath or suggested - the movie's most memorable sequence, involving appealing Jennifer Jason Leigh as helpful diner employee Nash, and two semis heading in opposite directions, is some very gripping stuff. Working from Eric Red's provocative script, director Robert Harmon keeps this tale moving ahead at a respectable pace, and a lot of good atmosphere is created. At the beginning, the first thing we see is a match being struck in the dark. And for the rest of the movie, there's a lot of darkness, although not all of it in the literal sense. In the best tradition of scary movies, "The Hitcher" creates the sense of one long nightmare that just keeps going on and on. The music by Mark Isham adds just the right touch, and use of locations is perfect. The striking rural scenery is very well photographed in the Panavision aspect ratio. A number of familiar character faces fill out supporting and small roles - Jeffrey DeMunn, John M. Jackson, Billy Green Bush, Jack Thibeau, Armin Shimerman, Gene Davis, Jon Van Ness, and Henry Darrow. But everything boils down to the cat and mouse game between our two main characters. In fact, for the first 20 minutes or so, it's practically a two character drama. And Hauer and Howell prove to be effective foes for this 98 minute long exercise in psychological and more conventional terrors. Its grimness holds right up until the violent, surreal ending. Worth seeking out for genre lovers, this would get a direct-to-DVD sequel in 2002 and a theatrical remake in 2007. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher does it all - suspense, action, drama, and a little bit of horror. This 1986 film is about a psychotic hitch hiker (Rutger Hauer) who kills the people that pick him up. Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) is driving cross country when he picks up the crazy hitcher. The whole movie is an exciting bloody game of cat and mouse with non stop action from start to finish. The movie is all about Jim on the run from the hitcher and the cops. He meets up with a waitress named Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) along the way who helps him avoid the police.Hauer's character of the Hitcher was so convincingly dark and evil. He played the part of the villain very well. I also thought the scenery of the desert really did a lot for the film. Very desolate with no one around to help, similar to the 1971 movie Duel. The ending was also very satisfying.There was a sequel made starring C. Thomas Howell, but it wasn't very good at all. Definitely check this one out though.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Friedrich Nietzsche had ever tried to write a screenplay, he probably would have come up with something close to The Hitcher, a film that helped define the modern horror-thriller genre.Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) is a young man driving a car from Chicago back to its owner in San Diego. Looking for some company and someone to keep him awake behind the wheel, Jim stops to pick up a hitchhiker in the middle of a rain storm along a barren stretch of road in the American Southwest. His new passenger (Rutger Hauer) calls himself John Ryder and says he just cut the arms, legs and head off the last person to give him a ride?and plans to do the same to Jim. Though scared out of his mind, Jim manages to push Ryder out of his vehicle and speeds away. He thinks the threat is over, but Jim is as wrong as any character in his history of movies. Ryder cuts a swathe of death and destruction along the highway, framing Jim for most of it and always showing up just in time to push Jim deeper into a hellish pit of terror and despair. Eventually a young girl named Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and what has to be most of the law enforcement of New Mexico get involved as Ryder's hunting of Jim turns into a battle of equals.Firstly, Rutger Hauer's John Ryder is one of the greatest movie villains of all time. Very few characters have ever been both as evil and as genuinely human and I don't know of any that have combined nihilistic violence with such obvious emotional and spiritual exhaustion. John Ryder plays a game with the lives of other people, but unlike most larger-than-life movie villains he's tired of the game and just wants it to end. The problem is, he's never found another player good enough to beat him.Jim starts out as just another game piece to Ryder, but he comes to hope that he might finally have met the man who can end his game. C. Thomas Howell doesn't have that much to work with as Jim. There aren't really a lot of moments where he gets to build the character and connect with the audience. Jim is largely a sniveling cipher as the film begins, but Howell makes you believe that this kid is being forged by Ryder's torments into man. What kind of man Jim Halsey is becoming, though, is up for discussion. The Hitcher leaves a great many things undefined like Ryder's motivations, the nature of Ryder and Jim's relationship and whether Jim's evolution into the kind of man who can stop Ryder's reign of terror is a good thing or not.As good as it is, The Hitcher has become a bit dated by the passage of time and the changes in American popular culture. Conceived as a psychological thriller punctuated with bursts of extreme violence, it lacks the propulsive intensity of the horror-thrillers that followed it. Events in The Hitcher don't really build upon each other as explode into the stretches of ominous quiet. The level of violence, while quite shocking in 1986, is fairly tame by today's standards. There's also not nearly enough of John Ryder in the story. Back in 1986, it was still expected that the audience would focus on Jim Halsey and Ryder would just be "the bad guy". Modern American culture has a lot less hero worship in it now and is much more openly drawn to the vile and destructive nature Ryder represents. In today's movies, the charismatic bad guy almost gets equal billing as the hero.The Hitcher is a rare good film where you can understand why someone wanted to remake it. You can easily imagine someone thinking "Give people more of the compelling villain, ramp up the violence to modern levels, focus more on the action and less on suspense and throw in the twist by making the girl the real hero of the story". Of course, the 2007 version of The Hitcher proved that a remake being a good idea and a remake being good have nothing to do with each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A magnanimous young man who picks up a strange hitchhiker on a desert highway on a dark, rainy night soon wishes he had just driven on. The deranged hitchhiker turns the innocent fellow's journey into a living nightmare. This a really good movie, this movie filled with some great action scenes with outstanding Explosive scenes that will make you sit on the edge of the seat for the whole movie. The acting from Rutger Hauer was awesome in this movie, perfect person for the part and C. Thomas Howell was also great as was the rest of the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There you are waiting to be charge by the authorities when you're innocent, you awake but it seems that is actually a dream since your cell is open, you are now free but, and is a big but, your name is Jim Halsey and you are living nothing but a real and frightening nightmare so the reason why you are now free is the same reason why you are living a nightmare, probably the worst time in your lifetime so the moment you come out from your cell the moment your nightmare goes on, the dead bodies of the police officers, your least favourite worst nightmare was there, the hitcher was there. I really enjoyed this thriller, this cult classic from the 80s called The Hitcher (the 2007 remake was for me, after seeing for the very first time Robert Harmon's film, a possible next purchase just for the curiosity but the moment I saw the name of Michael Bay the moment?), it's really great most of the time, really entertaining from the very beginning till the very last scene (loved that last still of Jim Halsey). And is C. Thomas Howell who gives a good performance as the main character, as the hero Jim Halsey but pretty much is the Dutch Rutger Hauer the one who gives the memorable performance, who steals the show as the f****** insane bastard whose name may be John Ryder and who is the reason of all the confusion, of all of the fear of Jim. This is a non-stop film in which the danger towards our decent young man Jim is present since the very first minutes till the very last. Jim is a guy from Chicago driving a car to its owner in San Diego, the danger towards him is present in different sort of stages. At first is just because of being tired that Jim's life is in real danger, you know to drive tired is not the smartest thing to do but for Halsey there's a solution and is not only a solution but also a kind of good if not very safety action: to pick up a hitcher who can keep him awake, but for Halsey's misfortune he picks up THE hitcher. There's a moment that is nothing but great for Halsey, probably one of the happiest moments in his lifetime, feeling like he was born again with reason to feel like that since for some minutes his life was near to its end but certainly it's enough to know the stuff that will come if I say that this happy moment for Halsey happens when the runtime of the film marks about 13 minutes. The second sort of stage is like having Halsey really worried not only because of his safety but also because the safety of others who are like he was which is who are oblivious to the truth about John Ryder but still this is a thing of two, sure the police will enter, is like another stage at first with the common stuff of "the hitcher planned all to look like I was Halsey the real killer" but soon enough with plenty of confusion for Halsey and police officers killed. One of the wft moments that can sort of resume the character John Ryder is that when he takes down a helicopter with his pistol only! And I have to mention Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, she plays Nash and for some moments is a sort of typical character, the one who may help Halsey and maybe who will end if things end in a good way with him but actually things can't end completely right when the cat of the story is Ryder, great ending, recommended film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picking up strangers on the road is a risky deal, some seem cools, while others are suspicious. In the movie "The Hitcher", it teaches a lesson about picking up strangers. C. Thomas Howell plays Jim Halsy, a young man who one time takes up a man name Jim(Rutger Hauer), a man with a shady past. After kicking him out of his car for scaring him with his questions, Jim's world was never going to be the same again. John is a total psychopath. He does crimes and frames Jim for them. He and diner owner Nash(Jennifer Jason Leigh) become fair game to the crazed drifter. One point John goes too far where he tied Nash to the truck and trailer and stretched her in half! That's the death sentence in the works. Jim wanted him dead and fast. So he does get his wish! This movie puts the "S" in suspense. It's very good and very creepy, it will keep you on the edge of your seat. So don't pick up hitchhikers, unless it's one of your old friends you haven't seen in years. 3 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rutger Hauer, C. Thomas Howell and Jennifer Jason Leigh give very memorable performances in this classic cat-and-mouse thriller directed by well-known TV movie director Robert Harmon. The story is very simple. Hauer is an utterly psychotic serial killer who is hitch-hiking his way from one victim to another. Howell is a young man trying to deliver a luxury car from Chicago to California. Hauer defines creepiness, and Howell plays his perfect complement, as the unwilling hero.Fortunately, the script remains devoid of clichs and does not over-do dialog. Instead, we are presented with one tense and disturbing action scenario after another as Howell goes to any length to avoid his hitcher-turned-stalker, and Hauer's obsessive game becomes more and more menacing. Jennifer Jason Leigh makes a nice early appearance as the one person seemingly willing to believe Howell and provide some help.The story is similar to Spielburg's classic Duel (1971), but more flashy, slightly more human, and just a little more believable. Believability is problematic for both plots, but both films are so well made that it's easy to ignore their absurdities. The horror in The Hitcher is very strongly implied, but never fully presented. The story relies on psychological terror which both actors create with apparent ease.The cinematography is solid, if not terribly innovative. The editing and directing are excellent - as the film maintains a perfect pace and pitch throughout. Recommended for thriller fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never pick up a Dutchmen in the desert, even if you are falling asleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>80's meat, C. Thomas Howell, is a glorified delivery boy named Jim Halsey. He's transporting the car he's driving, to it's owner in San Diego, California. While in the desert, he picks up a rain-soaked hitchhiker in the darkness, Rutger Hauer. The hitchhiker is initially quite uncommunicative, but quickly turns into dubious comic, with a minuscule switchblade (and asks questions like; "Do you want to know what happens to an eyeball, when it get punctured?"). Things become more complicated when the authorities get involved and believe Jim to be the mass-murdering psychopath. This is yet another movie I saw on Cinemax and the first with the incomparable, Rutger Hauer. It is also one of the only movies in which Jennifer Jason Leigh does not go partial or full nude.The first 12 minutes is a delicate blend of darkness, tension building and serves as the introduction to this cat and mouse thriller. These initial 12 minutes, creates the mood of the movie and sets Rutger Hauer as the deadly, yet compellingly charming psychopath. Much in the same way Jigsaw of Saw, believes in the idea of sacrifice as a growth mechanism, so does the hitcher. This is in direct contradiction to the naivety of Jim. In someway I believe their relationship can be described as master/pupil or the physical expression of how experience overwhelms ideology. What was I thinking?? This is an 80's movie with a whiny, C. Thomas Howell. There isn't that much depth. What there is plenty of is running, car chases and gun fights. Now rinse and repeat. By the third act, the movie loses most of it's steam and the ending (though quite action oriented and enjoyable) never captures the energy level of the first part of the movie. The backdrops consist of the aforementioned desert and also include gas stations, police stations, abandoned gas stations and miles of highway. You definitely get the impression that you are on your own out there. This is one of those films that does not require much energy to enjoy and yet multiple views does not harm. I would rate this movie at a 3 shot minimum. The first should be drunk when Jim nearly falls asleep at the wheel. The second toast belongs to Jim's initial (and short-lived) victory. The third drink should be empty by the infamous "truck-trailer" decoupling scene. In conclusion, always listen to your mother and then ask yourself and others one question; "You gonna tell me where you're going ?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some horror movies are great, but you refuse to watch them repeatedly. Others are still great, but if you feel like watching horror, you'll always find it enjoyable, viewing. The Hitcher is definitely a movie I will watch again, and again, and again.A young man called Jimm is stalked by a deranged psychopath who kills random people by pretending to be a hitch-hiker. The psycho turns out to be much more creative and smart than Jim thought after escaping from him.It ain't easy to name the movie's biggest advantage. Never mind how hard I'll try, I am absolutely sure atmosphere could not be described with words. The Hitcher is a fast paced horror-thriller about survival, madness and something we might call love. It starts with the main character Jim, being happy about his untroubled and well arranged life. After picking up a strange hitch-hiker, he realizes his life is in danger and that only a miracle could save him in a place I'd like to call "in the middle of nowhere". That's right, Jim never finds a good covert that even a clever maniac will have difficulties revealing. Therefore, the movie engenders a feeling of dead end with the main character's disability to escape. While developing sub-plots, The Hitcher becomes darker. A girl gets involved and even though the plot is far from complex, you expect twist that has something to do with the recently appeared female character.John Ryder is a character that could easily stuck in your mind and you don't even have to call the movie scary. It's the particular character that has provoked your feeling of disturbance. Rutger Hauer does an amazing job, bringing to life a fictional character. Acting is never important in such movies, but only a blind man could miss this performance. You never know what Ryder is gonna do next. You are tensed, unsure how evil are Ryder's intentions and how far could he go in order to completely ruin his victims's mentality. In my opinion, one of the most memorable characters, ever brought on the big screen. Too bad, The Hitcher is not a standard slasher flick and you will never see Ryder's name in some "best serial killers" list. But be sure in one thing - once you get lost, trying to decipher his mind, he will become part of your imagination's dark parts.The Hitcher's plot is quite simple. Not to mention that 21 years later, highway horrors are just another clich, people dislike. Maybe, this is the reason why we like it. Instead of being another cheap, gory flick, it becomes an experience you will always respect for some reason. The Hitcher emphasizes on the ability of drawing the viewer into the story and succeeds.One of the best horror movies of the 80s. They don't do them like this anymore. Very true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALWAYS loved this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always thought is one of the most aggressively frightening films I have ever seen. Rutger Hauer is one scary dude and proves it continuously throughout the movie. My heart fell into my stomach when I first saw JJL tied to the tractor-trailer, and it is just one of those scenes I will NEVER forget. You are kept wondering, right to the very end, if he was going to get away or not.I think that this is one of those movies that you just DO NOT remake, and was not happy to see the recent trailer for the remake. I thought remakes were for movies that were very, VERY old, and not being all that old myself and knowing when the original came out, I think they must be having a hard time coming up with new and original screenplays in Hollywoodland to remake something so fairly new. It's not like it's a 40 year old movie that needs to be updated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't travel on a desert road alone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An '80s classic from my point of view, The Hitcher is a film could make you afraid to travel on a desert road alone, and understandably so. Admittedly, I am afraid to be in such an area by myself, and for good reason; an isolated area like that is one where you could go for miles without seeing another person. Therefore, if (God forbid) you ran into serious trouble, there's the likelihood that no one would hear you cry for help.Here, we have a young man named Jim Halsey (played by C. Thomas Howell), who makes the serious mistake of picking up a hitchhiker named John Ryder (Rutger Hauer). It isn't long before Jim realizes that Ryder is a psychopathic killer, so he soon manages to eject Ryder from his car. But just when Jim thought he was rid of Ryder, their paths would soon cross again...and again.It is no secret that Terence Stamp and Sam Elliott were each offered the role of John Ryder, before Rutger Hauer was cast. Although Hauer was good as the menacing John Ryder, it's hard not to wonder what it might have been like if the role had been played by either Stamp or Elliott. With Terence Stamp's history of playing bad guys (especially General Zod in Superman I and II), he would have fit into the role perfectly. And considering the fact that Sam Elliott often plays scruffy characters, I believe he would have been compatible in the role as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably The Best Movie in Rutger Hauer's Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of my favorite movies for the year it came out and it is now one of my favorites ever! It's not just scary, suspenseful and bloody but most importantly it's psychologically disturbing. Hauers character is basically a serial killer that wants to stop killing but can't. Therefore he stalks and recruits C. Thomas Howell's character to stop him. Of course the only way to do that is to kill him, which of course Howell doesn't want to do. This is where the mental torture comes in. Hauer basically tries to force Howell to kill him by relentlessly stalking him and implementing him in a murder. Howell was great for this part because of his age and typecasting at the time of basically the young everyman liberal that wouldn't think of hurting someone else. Plus, Hauer was scary as hell in his role! I'm very interested in seeing the 2007 version when it is released. I just hope they don't screw it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weird movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the weirdest movies I've seen. It starts off seemingly innocently-a man stops to pick up a hitchhiker during a rainy night. What results is a nightmare for the driver. The hitchhiker turns out to be very deranged and shows him a car full of people he has killed. He then puts a knife to the driver's throat and tries to make him say he wants to die. The driver literally kicks him out of the car, only to see him in another car a while later. What transpires next left me emotionally drained, as the hitchhiker went on a killing/crime spree and frames the driver for it all. The driver gets a waitress to believe him when he says he is innocent. Every time it seems like he has gotten help from the police, etc., the hitchhiker shows up and blows them away.This was basically a weird, nowhere-to-turn, violent movie. I sort of liked it. For a while, whether the hitchhiker is real or not (read:a hallucination) is in question. The actors do a good job, and it was well written. However, it was not overall satisfying for me. See it for yourself and see if you agree with me.** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher delivers a complete change to the terror of horror films. Personally I've studied films for a few years and when it comes to horrors I know all the codes and conventions and it's hard finding one that creates the "edge of your seat" feeling. The opening of the film is undoubtedly one of the most terrifying openings in the history of film. It has the "nail biting" " on the edge of your seat" killer suspense throughout.The film opens with young actor C. Thomas Howell as the young innocent sympathetic Jim Halsey who on a journey to California, picks up what will turn out to be his worst nightmare. Hitch-hiker, John Ryder(Rutger Hauer)holds Jim up by knife threatening his life, after escaping the horrific situation that almost cost Jim his life, he encounters many more occurrences involving the hitch-hiker and as the road goes on Jim is framed for the murders taken out by Ryder, but as the crimes deepen so does Jims reputation as the whole county police follow him along with Ryder.The film has a major suspense throughout of not knowing where the story will take us next. There's elements of Horror/thriller/action/adventure, what more could you want from a movie. Certainly worth a look! Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Helluva Road Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still can't work out if this a road movie with a serial in it, or a serial killer flick that is disguised as a road movie. Whatever genre it fits into it's a blinder. C. Thomas Howells plays your average American teenager paid to dive a car to California and on the way he just happens to encounter a certain Rutger Hauer, who is hitching across the country leaving a trail of slaughter is his wake. Cue lots of blood, scares and mindless violence as Hauer attempts to frame our hero for his crimes and Howells tries to survive and make big bad Rutger pay for his crimes.OK your saying, so what, it's good guy vs bad guy flick. But my friend what makes the Hitcher stand proud above other films of this type is the way it bucks trends. For a start, our hero doesn't get the girl, any hint of a sickening romantic sub-plot is snuffed out about half way through the film by Hauer with the aid of a large articulated lorry, and the final confrontation between the hero and villain is raw and brutal; and whilst the good guy wins in the end, we never do find out if he gets off the hook for all the previous murders that he is being framed for. All of which makes for a refreshing change from the standard fayre.The performances, especially from Hauer and Howells are well realised and well rounded and the cinematography and editing nigh on faultless. In short a superb little thriller that stands up to repeated viewing. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher tells the story of a young man who is heading to California. He is bored and in need of company, so he picks up a hitchhiker along the way. Almost immediately after picking him up, the hitcher admits that he is a deranged killer and tells the young man to keep driving. The young man manages to shove the hitcher out of the car, and he thinks he's okay. However, the hitcher begins to stalk him and commit murders around him, which lead the police to mistakenly implicate the young man. On the run from the cops and with a truck stop waitress now at his side, he sets out to stop the murderous hitchhiker once and for all. The Hitcher is a decent movie, although it can't really decide what genre it wants to be.I really enjoyed the screenplay for this movie. The writing isn't bad for a low budget 80s thriller. I really enjoyed how the hitcher's dialogue was kept to a minimum, thus making him more threatening. The movie is pretty well written with some great action/terror scenes, and the beginning of the film completely turns you off wanting to pick up hitchhikers. My main problem with the movie is that it can't decide what genre it wants to be. It starts off as a really creepy horror movie about a murderous hitchhiker, and towards the middle it turns into a Hitchcockian cat and mouse thriller, and at the end it turns into a generic 80s action film.The acting was pretty good. C. Thomas Howell is pretty realistic in the way he reacts to certain situations. Jennifer Jason Leigh does alright as the damsel in distress, but she's not amazing. Obviously, the hitcher is the role that shines. Rutger Hauer plays him to menacing perfection, and his lack of dialogue only adds to his eeriness.Overall, The Hitcher is a good thriller, but I feel like if it was a creepy horror movie the whole way through, it would have been better.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than what I expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rutger Hauer became a known name in America after his brilliant performance as the villain in Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" in 1982. In 1986, he became a cult figure thanks to a modest low-budget movie that became a video rental hit due to the non-stop thrills and the brutal suspense it delivered; its name, "The Hitcher". This movie slowly became a cult classic and not without a good reason, the combination between great cinematography, well handled suspense and Hauer's powerful acting give this movie its reputation as one of the best (and most underrated) thrillers of the 80s.C. Thomas Howell is Jim Halsey, a young teenager who is traveling from Illinoins to California in his first trip out of town. During a storm, he picks up a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer) and so the nightmare begins. The Hitcher is a psycho killer who seems to enjoy fighting with Jim and pushing him to the edge of reason. Soon a cat-and-mouse chase will begin and only one will came up alive.Written by Eric Red (who also penned the brilliant "Near Dark"), the apparently simple story of the innocent young man hunted by a psycho across the highway looks like it is just a mere rip-off of Steven Spielberg's "Duel" (1971), but "The Hitcher" makes the plot its own and gives it a distinct flavor. The story mixes horror with elements of a western and of a road movie, pretty much like Red's other success "Near Dark", but here the approach is less fantastic and has a harsh realism despite its own flaws.The acting of the two lead actors is directly responsible of the success of the movie; Howell is perfect as the naive young man on his first time on the road discovering suddenly that the world is a harsh place where evil can take the form of a normal hitchhiker. Hauer is superb as the Hitcher and his performance is one of the highlights of the film. The cast is completed by a very good Jenifer Jason Leigh as Nash, a young girl who decides to help Jim as she has witnessed the Hitcher's rage.Director Robert Harmon uses a very good cinematography for his story and the cinematography of the western desert enhances the feeling of isolation and fear that follows Jim after meeting the hitcher for the first time. The suspense is perfectly handled and the movie moves at a very fast pace that never takes a minute to rest."The Hitcher" is a terrific movie, but it is not perfect, the story has some plot holes and includes situations that are bit incredible. However, this scenes increase the surrealism of the nightmarish hell that Jim's life has become and while unbelievable, are quite effective in the context of the film.To summarize, "The Hitcher" is an outstanding thriller that never gets boring and delivers thrills and entertainment at a fast rate. Hauer's haunting performance definitely makes the movie worth a rent specially for fans of horror and thrillers. While it may not be a perfect movie, it is definitely one of those overlooked gems of the 80s. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher deserves full marks because it does everything that a thriller is supposed to. There is no time wasting in this film, within minutes the action begins. Rutger Hauer is highly effective as the unhinged nutcase who stops some young chap (Howell) to hitch a ride. After a few moments he has a knife at the poor bloke's throat, but is forced out of the car. Howell thinks the psycho is gone, but he is isn't and for the rest of the film re-emerges to wreak devastation upon his nemesis. By the end countless people are dead or maimed. Hauer himself seems to be tempting death, seeking to draw Howell into killing him. I find it incredible that such a film never graced a cinema screen. Its a highly entertaining and well scripted movie. Not too long, it leaves you with enough thrills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I didn't pay full attention the last time I watched it, as I gave it an average rating, so I'm very glad I watched it again, from director Robert Harmon (They). Basically Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) is minding his own business delivering the car he is driving, when he stops to pick up a hitcher. Not long after picking him up he shows what a big mistake picking this man, John Ryder (Rutger Hauer), was. He manages to throw him out of the car, but as Jim keep going, Ryder keeps showing up, and as a serial killer committing brutal murders anywhere he stops, causing Jim to be accused and now being chased by the police. Jim's only help is from waitress Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and he does almost anything to get away, even involving weapons, until eventually Ryder is caught, and in the end of course killed. It may be a little lapsing with logic and has moments of self-parody, but with some good violent moments, and good performances from Howell and Hauer, it is a surreal and very watchable cult thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher is a simple, low budget thriller that is unexpectedly good. In the middle of rainy night in the deserts of Texas a young man named Jim Halsey (Howell) picks up a hitchhiker. The hitchhiker (Hauer) in turn, appears to be a ruthless killer. This is how the story of this amusing film begins. The story is simple en not particularly realistic, but with that given, director Harmon and his team managed to make a very good film. Somehow the film is very thrilling, in a 'psychological' kind of way. Much credit for that matter must be given to Rutger Hauer, who is very convincing as the ruthless maniac. In this film, he uses the same 'psycho' style of acting as used in the magnificent Blade Runner. As if he is in some kind of ecstasy, in trying to really be the killer. It is just great to see. Therefore, The Hitcher is unexpectedly a very entertaining film. Especially if you no trouble with....well, let's say 'surrealism'.8/10</fullReview>

Hauer tries to kill him but Howell pushes him out of the car. But (somehow) the hitcher follows him, kills people, puts the blame on him and almost tries to kill him...Strange movie. A combination horror/action film. It's never boring and really works on you (especially if u see it on a big screen). The intriguing thing about this is that you're never sure why the hitcher is acting the way he does (a one point Jennifer Jason Leigh's character screams "Why didn't he kill us?"), WHO he is and where he came from. The film has an ending that is open to interpretation and really makes you think. How many horror films do that? Even the acting is good. Howell, usually a terrible actor, is very good in this one. Hauer is just downright terrifying as the Hitcher. Leigh has nothing to do but it's always good to see her in anything. My only complaints are: it's TOO open at the end involving the Hitcher--I wanted more clues and what happens to Leigh was really sick and unnecessary.This was blasted by the critics when it came out (Siskel and Ebert said you had to be "subhuman" to enjoy it!) but has acquired quite a loyal following. Worth seeing but be warned--there's some VERY graphic violence in this. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is very simple, Jim Halsey ( played by the 80's teen star C. Thomas Howell) Is driving across the back roads of Texas to bring a "rent a car" To it's transport. One dark rainy night Jim grows tried and almost runs off the road. In order to stay awake he drives further down the dark road and sees a man waiting for a ride, Jim pulls over and the dark stranger gets in...Halsey smiles and says "My mother told me never to do this." Everything seems to go well and the stranger gives his name "John Ryder" (played by the scary and awesome Rutger Hauer)But things get turned around once Ryder pulls a knife on the scared teenager and tells him the car they just past which was pulled over on the side of the road wasn't his car...but the car of the last man that picked him up, and how he cut off his arms, and legs and his head...and he's gonna do the same to him." But Halsey gets the upper hand and pushes the psycho out of the speeding car and thinks his nightmare is over...but it isn't not by a long shot. Soon people who Ryder is getting rides from are being found massacred on the sides of the desert roads...and the state police blame Halsey. Jim's only hope is a young waitress (Jennifer Jason Leigh...who also played in Grandview USA with Howell three years back) The two run for their lifes through the desert from cops and Ryder himself...but what does Ryder really want?...does he want to toy with the one man that was able to stop him or turn him into a stronger man that could become the evil he all ready is? All I'm saying is it's an awesome film, make sure to rent it. The acting between Rutger Hauer and C. Thomas Howell is outstanding, the plot, score, script and filming is perfect and the showdown at the end of the film leaves you with a very uneasy feeling. And let us not forget the mack truck part...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Halsey is a young guy who, apparently, wants to move on to greener pastures he has taken a Drive away car and is supposed to deliver it to San Diego. On his way somewhere in the southwest I'm assuming (don't know where exactly) he nearly kills himself by falling asleep at the wheel so he decides to pick up a hitcher to stay awake. Soon after The Hitcher (John Ryder) enters the car he confesses that he is a Killer and that he intends to cut all of Jim's limbs off Jim pushes The Hitcher out of the still slightly ajar car door and thus begins the most thrilling and nightmarish cat &amp; mouse games ever committed to film.Watching this movie is like watching a nightmare unfolds before your eyes with out actually being in it. their is a feeling of hopelessness that spreads throughout the film every time The hitcher finds Jim again, every time you see Ryder come out the clear blue nothingness to cause more havoc and push Jim even deeper into his web of s**t you feel like there is nothing that Jim can do that Ryder doesn't want him to doOverall this is a kickass road-horror movie with excellent performances and one of the best villains of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep film. Very real. Highly underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was flipping through channels tonight and I found this. This movie has genuine atmosphere and puts you in another place. If you're not perceptive to that kind of thing, you won't get it.It runs the gamut from dreamlike to visceral. The soundtrack is very gentle and plays during low periods without action, the action is always music-less. It reminds me of water or chimes.The characterization is very real, it shows you the soul of the characters, especially the hitcher. That actor did one hell of a job. You rarely see in a movie, an actor who does everything just as you would think it would be done. The most memorable example is the ending, the way he smiles masochisticly just before he dies. The villain is not a flat character like most. You can tell why he kills. I related to both the killer and the victim.So why is the film poorly rated? I think it's probably you have to be wise to it to understand where its coming from. I don't mean you have to make an effort to like it. If you're like me, you won't have to.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the classic existential thriller from the 1980's, brilliant in every way. Rutger Hauer plays a character personifying pure evil. This is a difficult task, prone to over-the-top theatrics, but not once does Rutger fail. He's one of the greatest movie villains ever. Just listen to his wonderful monologue about cigarettes in the opening minutes, and you will know what I mean. Mark Isham's score is perfect, John Seale's cinematography places you in a hell-on-earth, thanks to screenwriter Eric Red's spectacular vision, and Robert Harmon's beautiful economy-of-direction ratchets up the suspense to an unbearable level. What an extraordinary film this is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thriller made by a man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C. Thomas Howell proved once again he was "The Man" When it came to acting.This film is a horror/action/thriller. I saw it a few years ago after seeing the rather s-hitty sequel. I remember how they kept talking about "What happened to Jim fifteen years ago..." So being the horror buff that I am I went to my local video store and brought it ( Talk about trusting it!) So after turning the lights down low and sitting on my couch and started to watch one of the best films ever made by a man...The film is about a young man named Jim (Howell) Who's driving a rental car across the back highways of Texas, Along his way he picks up a hitchiker (Rutger Hauer) Who end up being a crazed psycho who holds a knife to his throat and tells Jim to say he wants to die...But Jim gets the upperhand and throws him out of the speeding cars ( Whenever Jim's honking and swearing...It always cracks me up.)But little does poor little Jim know...This is only the beginning.The movie was filmed great ( Loved the outside shots) And had a great pace to it...Theirs really not a lot of talking between the people, But whenever they say something it's to the point and hits hard.The story is one thing I wanna bring up, Eric Red is one of the best writers I ever saw, He made his story so un-known, Almost in a dream/nightmare form...Leaving us asking questions of what did the Hitcher really want...and was Jim's job to stop him? I guess I could go on for hours talking about my thoughts on this film.The acting was A+ C. Thomas Howell is my favorite actor and he played the role so well...I hope I get to see more from him, I mean you can tell what kind of actor he is whenever The Mack truck part happenes ( Best part of the movie) Or whenever it's the final showdown between him and the Hitcher...He changes in a way and maybe that's what the Hitcher wanted?Rutger Hauer and Jennifer Jason Leigh play their roles great, Hauer didn't really need to say anything...Just the way he moved and looked was great, Scary guy. and Jennifer played nice as the girl "Stuck" in the middle of all of this ( Watch the movie to get that joke)I loved this film and I hope others will rent it, Great acting, Great story...Trust me once it ends your gonna fell closer to the lead and pop the tape in again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before pretty young teens left their picket fences for ugly death, C. Thomas Howell ploughed his way though the barren landscapes of The Hitcher. He picks up Rutger Hauer some four minutes into the movie, sparing us Dawson's Creek subplots to give us what we want; the action. They don't make 'em like they used to.Director Robert Harmon's first film is a dark, nasty little road/slasher movie gem, combining Eric Red's Pinter-in-Hicksville dialogue with John Seale's elegant yet intimate camerawork (the latter would go on to shoot The English Patient and Cold Mountain.) Hauer is on fine form here as a mysterious hitch-hiking murderer, conveying a doomed romanticism alongside his dark humour that places his character as perhaps a human cousin of Blade Runner's Roy Batty. Howell starts off the movie as a goofy teen, but skillfully eases into haunted and desperate refugee, and Jennifer Jason Leigh lights up the screen in what writer Red admits is a 'thankless but necessary' role.The film is best when haunting us; either close-in with Ed Hopper-style diners or motel rooms, or out in the wilderness, the road stretching out, Mark Isham's sparse score echoing in the distance. It occasionally lapses into helicopter and car chases straight out of the A-Team ('more action'! cried the studio?) but this is still a superior uncle to young-whippersnapper chillers of today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: The Hitcher (1986)Director: Robert HarmonCast: Rutger Hauer, C Thomas Howell, Jennifer Jason LeighTagline: Never Pick Up a StrangerReview:I hadnt seen this movie since I was about 11 years old so I rented it again, to see if it was still as good as I remembered it. In all honesty I had almost no memories of what the movie was about, except the fact the C. Thomas Howell picks up the worst hitcher he could have ever wished for, so my memories of it were vague, but I did remembered one thing about it....that it was good.Story is about a young guy called Jim Halsey, hes driving through the interstate to deliver a car to someone. On the way he decides to pick up a hitcher...in part because he is sleepy as hell and would like to have some company to keep himself from falling asleep. When he realizes that the guy he has just picked up is a total loon...its too late. Literally all hell breaks loose for the poor guy.What can I say? This movie literally blew me away. It took all my expectations of what this movie could have been and threw them out the window. It was the most unpredictable film I have seen in a long time, I literally didnt know what was going to happen next. If you think you know what to expect from this type of film, then your in for a treat with this one!The movie was wonderfully shot, it has some really beautiful camera angles and cinematography. As I watched this movie I kept asking myself why the hell hadnt Robert Harmon done more films! Its quite obvious the guy is very talented! Its no surprise that the best thing I liked about They was its unique visual style. And most recently hes also directed Highwaymen which I am now compelled to see after knowing that Harmon directed it.The movie had many shots that just amazed me, like the one where Jim kicks the hitcher out of the car and the camera does this really cool close up shot of the hitcher...great stuff.I also really enjoyed those opening sequences with Jim and The Hitcher in the car...those scenes were oozing with atmosphere and suspense. You actually felt like you were in that car and that it was really about five in the morning or something. The storm outside, the night...and the Hitcher all sweaty and wet. The director really achieved something with these scenes and payed great attention to detail as I literally felt I was really in that car with a loony by my side. The script by Eric Red was also top notch as the dialogue and situations that happen here are complex and intriguing...more so then youd expect from a film that has an apparently simply premise.The Hitcher himself, who was marvelously played by Rutger Hauer, is an incredibly ominuous and mysterious villain. Many complain that his motives are not explained but I believe if you look closely at the film you can actually detect that The Hitcher does have a motive and he says very clearly at the very beginning of the film..."I want to die" A great character, evil came out of every pore of his being. He had some great intelligent lines that I really liked.I really wish that Rutger Hauer would be in more films cause hes one great actor in my book. This movie is one of those movies that actually makes you feel for the villain. Believe it or not, I felt sorry for the guy at one point, cause you dont know whats led him to want to go out on a suicidal run like this one, but you kind of get the feeling that the guys got the hard end of the stick in life...and that this is the reason his gone berserk.Jim Halsey, your average american teenager as played by C. Thomas Howell, is thrusted into deepest darkest levels of hell by the Hitcher. I like how the character changes through out the movie...from a wimpy normal average kid, to a hard as nail "dont f*** with me" dude wholl spit in your face if you mess with him. It was almost like The Hitcher was helping him become a man almost? I dont know maybe Im getting a bit too phylosophical here but thats the vibe I got. By the time Jims voyage with the Hitcher was over his ass was carved out of wood.The premise of the movie appears to be simple...but somehow this movie actually manages to grow in its levels of complexity and intensity. Its not just about a guy who picks up the hitchhiker from hell...theres more to this movie then that. Its actually a smart film...you do not feel like you are watching a dumb slasher. This ones got brains and action and suspense all in the same package people!Hey! If you havent seen this movie yet....do yourself a favor, get up from your ass, like right now and go rent this great flick! You wont be dissapointed. Its in my humble opinion the true definition of a modern day classic.Rating 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taut thriller with good cinematography and editing. Howell is slightly underwhelming, though. Rutger is great as the title character. I recently bought the DVD but was disappointed to see that the powers-that-be didn't remaster the original print. The DVD is pretty grainy, but, I was thankful to finally get a copy. I definitely recommend "The Hitcher" to anyone who likes a good thriller with a lot of realistic violence thrown in. I like any movie that compels the viewer into a world that is just slightly unrealistic but not so much that it detracts from the story. "The Hitcher" does have a few parts that invoke a I-wouldn't-do-that-if-I-were-in-his-shoes. Thankfully, those are few and far between. Get out the popcorn, throw a log on the fire and snuggle up...ENJOY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Hitcher", along with the Terminator films, is a perfect example of how to do an action film: Combine nailbiting suspense, surreal horror, and crackerjack violence then shake vigorously.Jim Halsey is caught in a nightmarish situation...he's being pursued by a murderous, sadistic hitchhiker with a death wish who seems not so much intent on killing Jim as toying with him in an attempt to drive him over the edge. The hitcher is omnipresent, following unseen and then popping up just long enough to do serious damage to people and property alike, cleverly setting our hero up for every crime. As the hitcher continues to pile bodies over the Texas countryside, a manhunt for Jim ensues. The police soon turn into robotic killers hidden behind their chilling, garbled radio messages, proving themselves to be almost as dangerous as the hitcher himself. Jim ends up doing the only thing he can do: Fight his way out, hoping to keep both life and sanity intact.The acting, directing, action, score, writing, and pacing are excellent, making this film one of the best of it's genre. It's a wild ride.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) is driving from Chicago to San Diego and stops to pick up a hitch-hiker by the name of John Ryder (Rutger Haeur). Jim soon realises that Ryder is a sadistic madman and seizes an opportunity to eject him from the vehicle. Believing that his encounter with Ryder was now at an end, Jim continues his journey undaunted. However, Jim is soon to find out that the incident in the car was just the beginning of a horrific nightmare. Jim learns that sometimes mother does know best. Rutger Hauer's somewhat short performance is probably the highlight of this exceptionally well crafted horror movie. Hauer plays his role as the psychotic John Ryder with wickedly adept style and manages to convincingly portray a seriously deranged murderer. Whenever Hauer is on-screen the atmosphere becomes increasingly dark and dismal; such is the power of Hauer's performance in this movie. Without ever changing from the dangerously calm exterior that Hauer fronts, he is able to make his character seem like one of the most insane killers in horror cinema over the last thirty years. Hauer is able to feed off a well-written and unrevealing script from Eric Red to truly portray his sinister character. Very little information is ever exposed about John Ryder, which effectively makes him a mysterious and quite intimidating presence. Ryder is also intelligently prevented from becoming a one-dimensional killer due to some remarkably well-written dialogue. From the script we can gather that there is a reason behind Ryder's actions, it just seems that this reason is never revealed and the viewer is left to make up their own mind as to why Ryder systematically slaughters those who he comes into contact with. ?The Hitcher' was Robert Harmon's directorial debut and it probably remains his greatest achievement in cinema. Through some proficient direction, Harmon is able to give ?The Hitcher' a desolate atmosphere somewhat similar to ?The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974) and ?The Hills Have Eyes' (1977), yet still maintains a brutality within the movie all of it's own. Echoes of the isolated highway style of ?The Hitcher' can be seen in some more modern horror films such as ?Jeepers Creepers' (2001), however the style of ?The Hitcher' far surpasses any of it's imitators. Harmon paces the movie incredibly well and although the tension and suspense continually rises, there are some uncomfortable respites in the action that allow the viewer to contemplate the situations. To its benefit, the style of ?The Hitcher' changes from a psychological horror in the early scenes, to a more violent and fiery slasher-esque movie later on. In fact, there are moments during the film (particularly some explosions and a couple of car chases) that could easily be placed into many action films, proving the genre-diversity that ?The Hitcher' possesses. The climax of ?The Hitcher' is extremely powerful, and in some ways moving, as the movie builds to the final, lingering scene which portrays emptiness and an air of finality that can leave the viewer in an almost trance-like state. C. Thomas Howell surprisingly excelled in his role as Jim Halsey. Howell comes across as a regular man who has been thrust into the seventh level of hell, after simply trying to help a man by offering him a ride. The way Howell manages to portray his character as becoming increasingly unnerved and desperate is admirable, and another reason this film holds up so well. Jennifer Jason Leigh is also worthy of mention for her part as the sympathetic Nash. Leigh's performance, albeit very short, was a welcome addition to the film and allowed Howell's character to display humanity thus allowing the viewer to connect with him. ?The Hitcher', in my opinion, is a vastly underrated horror movie with a wonderfully created atmosphere of desolation, fine acting performances, some breathtaking cinematography (courtesy of Jonathon Mostow), great scripting and some very skilled direction. Even though it is not a perfect movie, with a few unrealistic situations and moments of suspect acting from the supporting cast, I highly recommend this one. My rating for ?The Hitcher' ? 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7/10 - I had mixed feelings about this one. I did LOVE the first have of the movie. Now, having said that, if the rest of the movie were near as good, I would have given The Hitcher a "9" instead of a "7". The movie started off with a great premise, had excellent suspense, and really was an "edge of your seat" type of film. Unfortunately it turned into a routine chase movie half way through and I got somewhat uninterested. I also question a lot of the character's motivations. They never really explained what the deal with Hauer's character was, nor why he was so intent on tormenting Howell's character. I was left scratching my head at the end thinking, "That's it?!". On the up-side, Hauer did put in a great performance and the movie is worth seeing for that alone.</fullReview>

And just when we arrived there, a bomb, a real one, destroyed a shop just across the street. That place, where we would have been if we hadn't changed sides.At that time some terrorists from Algeria were trying to "bomb" some of their mates "free", killing innocent people.

		<fullReview>Rutger Hauer has always been one of my family's favourite actors. I had heard of this film years before I actually saw it, and when I finally did see it, I was not disappointed.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Hauer is brilliant as the mysterious and relentless killer Ryder. C. Thomas Howell is also great as Jim Halsey, the hapless teen who picks him up on a lonely Texas highway. After Hauer makes it clear that he is a killer, Jim manages to outsmart him by ejecting him from the car, but this is where the game begins as Hauer follows Jim everywhere he goes and arranges things so that Jim appears to be the killer. The only one who believes that Jim is innocent is truckstop waitress Nash, and it isn't long before both she and Jim are on the run from gun-happy cops. But the omnipresent Ryder is still there, like a phantom pursuing them.One of the great things about the film is the fact that Jim matures as the film goes on. As Ryder continually pushes him, he begins more and more to take charge of his predicament. After Nash's death at the hands of Ryder, the killer is taken into police custody. The sympathetic captain advises Jim to let the law handle Ryder now, but Jim knows that it's not that simple. Sure enough, Ryder escapes from custody and it is up to Jim to make sure that Ryder can't harm anyone ever again. When it finally comes down to it, Jim is able to do what he couldn't do before. The ending is rather ambiguous. Some people may read it that good triumphs over evil, or is there more to it than that? Like other people on this site, I can't believe that Ebert hated this picture so much. The performances are brilliant, the suspense is kept up, it is brilliantly filmed and Mark Isham's dreamlike score (a bit similar in places to the music in Spielberg's DUEL) compliments the action perfectly. There is also practically no gore in the movie, which makes it all the more terrifying. This is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! I strongly recommend it to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a great film. Roger Ebert thinks it's beneath contempt. When two opinions collide head-on like that, you know something's up.As the thriller genre has deteriorated, The Hitcher has been made to look better and better. The pacing is deliberate. The photography, design and film editing are all first-rate. C. Thomas Howell can barely act, but fortunately Rutger Hauer and the rest of the cast pick up the slack. Also, what was at one time considered a brutally violent movie now seems almost tame, at least in terms of the actual on-screen bloodshed. I've seen far more grisly scenes on ER.Anyway, I loved this movie, and I know I'm not alone. Someone very clever called it a compelling treatment of Freud's "death drive." Why not. If you like your thrillers served rare, this is for you. If you need your thrillers to provide you with a certain psychological distance in order to feel safe, Ebert's review is the one you should read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie again last night and it was just as good as I remember. This movie happily bides by the philosophy that what you don't see, and what you don't know is way scarier than what the director shows you.John Rider is one of the coolest movie villians ever. Though his character seems under motivated, Rutger Hower plays him so well that you are still convinced, and he is very scary.C. Thomas Howell is great to as a every-kid type of character thrown into extrodinary circumstances and forced to deal with it. A great performance on his part.This movie has one of the greatest car chase sequences of all time too, for those of you who love action.I also like the way this movie's setting stuck to the microcosm of the desert hiways. Other than the cars and a couple haircuts this movie is completely undated. It could easily have been made last week.There are questions as to John's motivation that arise through out the movie. At one point Jim asks, "Why are you doing this to me?" and John replies, "You're a smart kid. You'll figure it out." I suppose the simple answer is that he just likes to kill people, and Jim Halsey becomes a playmate for him. He wanted to be stopped, and Jim stopped him. From that point on Jim becomes a challenge, or perhaps merely a human toy that John has decided to play with. An interesting diversion in a boring string of hiway murders. Or perhaps John really does want to be stopped and he feels that Jim is the only one who can stop him, but he must be compelled to do it. If John messes with his life enough eventually Jim will find a way to kill him, even if it means hijacking a police truck and chasing down the prison bus to make sure he's dead. That's just my opinion though. Perhaps it's more interesting if you have no idea what's going on.Overall I'd give this movie an eight out of ten. My only complaints are some of the minor events seemed a little extraneous. John Rider just shows up out of nowhere and messes up Jim's life for no reason over and over again. It works in some places, but other times it seemed a little forced, like they were beating it over the head too much. The cops were a little too one-dimensional also, automatically pinning the murders on Jim, without even considering other options, even though Jim's story seemed completely viable. These are only minor complaints though, and you don't really notice these things unless you are looking for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher is a very nice suspenseful horror film from the '80s. When I saw this movie recently, I was worried that it was going to be filled with outdated '80s pop culture, but, thankfully, it wasn't. The movie was actually very good. Probably the best coming-of-age film I've ever seen. It's scary and suspenseful, and definitely not that predictable. A great film to watch when hackers are hacks and slashers are slacking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made the mistake of watching this movie late at night, home alone. It's a definite thriller, with fast-paced action and decent acting. One is left wondering what John Ryder's motivation was; my guess is that he just enjoyed the thrill of the chase. All in all, this one's worth renting, but try to watch it during the daylight hours! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies of all my life.This movie makes you think, it's not the usual thriller: it is a symbolic ride into the human mind.Hauer is really great, even better than he is in "Blade Runner", and the way he depicts the dark side of human mind is really astounding.This is also a road movie, and ... boys ... wonderful photography! Wonderful landscapes! Wonderful shots! Wonderful colours!This movie can be disturbing because it contains a lot of violence (but it is only a suggested violence, you never see a murder happening .. and there are a lot of murders!) moreover it requires the full use of your brain to be understood ... but to me it is almost THE perfect movie.Don't miss it .. go and rent it!This is a real Cult Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film leaving an impression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching this movie something told me: nothing new here, all Hollywood cliches, boring. I was wrong. The film kept growing and growing and at the end I felt I had seen one of my all time highs. It was certainly not a deep film as of Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch - but it had the same guts, tightness and atmosphere. I know now why and what made it special. The lack of cliches.Everything was set up for boy meets maniac meets girl. Boy and girl goes through so much bad and while assuring each other of their endless goodness they overcome the bad guy, gets married and have the most beautifull children. That didn't happen! This is also the reason for so many people to dislike it I guess, they feel uneasy when it doesn't follow the standard Hollywood pattern.I normally never get scared about any movie, this one pulled my nerves though because it was so unpredictable and raw - except for the ending which was a bit of a disappointment, too easy a way out. Thankyou to Robert Harmon and Eric Red for showing some guts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This blows all other road movies away.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget Joy Ride or Duel, this is the road movie you should definitely see. Yes, this movie does have that '80s look and feel, but oddly enough, instead of taking away from the movie it adds something to it. This and the terrific scenery and music give this film a mood that's absent in all the other road movies. The terror begins when C. Thomas Howell's character stops and lets madman Rutger Hauer in his car, not knowing that he's just slaughtered the last guy that gave him a lift. And there's the classic line from Howell: "My mother told me never to do this." The film wastes no time at all jumping right into the suspense. Instead of a long, dragged out conversation between the two men, Hauer's madness comes into play almost instantly when he confesses to being a murderer, holds a blade to Howell's throat, and taunts him to do something about it. When Howell finally gets the man out of the car, it seems that he's home free. But that won't be his last encounter with the psycho. Terror follows Howell the whole way, as Hauer manages to slaughter everyone Howell encounters on the road in a mad game of psychological horror. Is Howell the one that got away, or is Hauer skillfully calculating everything for some unknown reason? This movie has a terrific feel. The mood is unbeatable. Desolate, lonely highways, rustic old towns, isolated gas stations, the hot countryside. It's all great. And the score is fantastic. This movie has many hair-raising moments which makes me wonder if other movies that followed it are ripping it off. A horrific scene with Jennifer Jason Leigh tied between two big trucks by her hands and feet, about to be ripped apart is very reminiscent of Leelee Sobieski's shotgun-in-the-face scene in Joy Ride. Howell is pursued all through the countryside, as his nemesis leaves a trail of bodies in the wake. Not even the police can save him. You're left to wonder why Hauer has singled him out instead of just killing him like the rest, and why he keeps letting him go. Roger Ebert had to have been on drugs to give this movie zero stars. I don't think I'll ever look at him the same again. No motive for the killer? Good! That makes it better! Unnecessary violence? It IS a thriller! Gore? Huh!? This movie has NO gore. There's BLOOD. Does blood on Hauer's face bother you? I hope not. There are no grisly scenes anywhere in this movie. They're IMPLIED. That's what makes this a sort of Hitchcock-like thriller. You don't really see all that Hauer does, he just tells you about it. And the Hitchcock elements are all there. Ebert had to have been high. This movie has some classic scenes that will chill you to the bone, like Leigh's death (mentioned above) which manages to be a horrifying scene without any blood or guts. The final showdown between the two men is what the movie has been building up to. There's clearly something going on between Howell and Hauer, and their final battle on a lonely highway suggests that this is what Hauer was leading up to. But why? If you want to see a great, overlooked classic, rent this tonight. I hope its cult popularity never fades, because this movie is a hidden gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been many road thrillers made that have been frightning and suspenceful, (Joyride, Breakdown, Duel, etc...) For some reason, The Hitcher has been overlooked and ignored, and I canot understand why. This is a CLASSIC masterful suspence movie that rates as one of the best road thrillers made.I remember watching this one in the 80's, and being scared out of my wits. Then I just recently saw it again, knowing and remembering every scene, and it STILL held my attention almost like the first time. There have been movies to come out since then have have done as well, maybe better, but The Hitcher cannot be ignored as one of the best. A Hitchcock style classic that deserves more attention.And Hey, now that a sequel is in the works with C. Thomas Howell reprising his role, maybe now this classic original will FINALLY get it's chance to shine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher fascinates on more than one level. First of all, there's very little dialogue. Most of it's force is achieved through its pictures and underlying sense of sadism and senseless violence. Several scenes indicate there's a special relationship or bond between the Hitcher and his victim Jim Halsey. Some say it's a homoerotic-sadomasochistic thing , others think the Hitcher symbolizes the dark counterpart of Howell's character (the shadow, so to speak, in Jungian psychology). I guess it has something of both. Maybe the Hitcher killed off Nash out of jealosy, trying to gain Halsey's unshared attention? The movie's surrealistic and kafkaesque (God, I sound like an "art fag"...) mood indicates there's a deeper layer to be explored. Is the Hitcher just a projection of Halsey's own dark side? And by finally defeating the Hitcher he overcomes his own shadow? Or did Halsey succumb and lose the battle against evil by killing the Hitcher and becoming like him? All in all a true masterpiece from the 80s: disturbing, quiet, yet powerful. Roger Ebert gave this film ZERO stars: I couldn't agree less with this usually sensible critic, his analysis of The Hitcher however is surprisingly good nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killer On The Road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C. Thomas Howell portrays a young man driving a car from Chicago to San Diego who soon lives to regret picking up a sinister hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer) on a rainy night in the west Texas desert in this 1986 horror film, which has become something of a cult classic.When Hauer threatens Howell at knifepoint and regales him with gory tales of his crimes, Howell bodily ejects the hitchhiker. But Hauer keeps reappearing in his life over the next several days, littering the highway with the grisly corpses of his victims, and making it appear like Howell killed these people. Jennifer Jason Leigh portrays a local restaurant waitress who comes to sympathize with Howell's plight--not that it does her much good in the end, of course, as she falls victim to Hauer. The final desert showdown between Hauer and Howell is very reminiscent of Sergio Leone's 1960s spaghetti westerns.Like the latter 1997 film BREAKDOWN, THE HITCHER takes inspiration from such classic thrillers of the 1970s as DUEL, STRAW DOGS, and DELIVERANCE, with Howell's performance as the frightened auto motorist very convincing, and Hauer's evil hitchhiker being particularly cunning, cool, and sadistic. The film is marred only by the somewhat extreme violence of the murder scenes, a mistake on the part of both screenwriter Eric Red and director Robert Harmon to appeal to slasher film freaks. Otherwise, THE HITCHER is worth the '7' rating I'm giving it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a theory no one has yet delved into. It actually came to me in a dreamstate. I hope others can possibly expound and expand upon it; since I haven't seen the film again since this occurred to me.Many have wondered about the strange bond between pratogonist and antagonist in this movie. There seems to be a "knowing," between them. In fact, Howell's character, all of a sudden-like, knows the Hitcher's real name after he's apprehended. I was wondering where he came up with it or how he knew.Then it struck me; one of the first lines of the movie was, "My mother told me never to do this." Someone else on here pointed out the wedding ring on Ryder's finger. Possible conclusion: The Hitcher knew or (or was married to) C. Thomas Howell's character's mother.Help me out here people.</fullReview>

Being used to disappointments when it comes to those childhood favourites, I didnt hold too much hope. How wrong I was!This film is carried by the great performance of Rutger Hauer who manages to portray an utterly bizzare maniac without making his role pathetic or over-the-top evil. I sat on the edge of my seat and couldnt believe that this film hasnt been recognized as one of the absolutely best 80s thrillers!? (which of there arent too many anyway)The truth of the matter is that the overall acting, with C. Thomas Howell (Soul Man anyone?) as the lead character, is hardly special. But hey!

What a great setting for the story to unfold along a strip of highway that is virtually barren. This is a place where there are no "city eyes" to watch your every move and the nearest police officer is 45 minutes away, all the time! We thought it was safe to travel down these roads. But we were wrong, it's the perfect breeding ground for severely disturbed people who litter the roads with bodies, blood, and body parts.If you think you've seen it all, then watch The Hitcher.It's relentless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While delivering a vehicle from Chicago to California, young Jim Halsey (C Thomas Howell) picks up hitch-hiker John Ryder (Rutger Hauer). Uh-oh. A sadistic psycho on a motiveless murder spree, Ryder challenges Jim to stop him, thereby kick-starting an increasingly violent game of cat and mouse down dusty Texan highways. Jim finds an ally in waitress Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh), but the police are convinced that Jim is the maniac and set off in hot pursuit. As Ryder continues to kill, maim and torture at will, the wholesome teen must leave his innocence burnt and bloodied by the roadside as he tries to clear his name and defeat his seemingly indestructible nemesis. This film is a tremendous thriller with Hauer and Howell in top form. Hauer's ability to appear out of nowhere and seemingly get himself out of any tight spot without detection adds to the tone of the movie. As I watched it I thought for the first hour or so that John Ryder was a flip-side of Jim Halsey's character. Every time Ryder appeared on screen it seemed that either (a) anyone who saw him died - bar Halsey of course or (b) nobody saw him only Halsey. Yet right at the end of the movie Ryder is captured by the police so he is indeed a real person. A very evil real person. The one question that has to be asked after this film is this : whatever happened to C. Thomas Howell? The man was on top form with The Outsiders, Soul Man and The Hitcher in the early eighties where the likes of Tom Cruise was only in bit parts (check out The Outsiders). He was the top prospect at super-stardom back then but has faded away to b-movies. Come on C - let's get back to the good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** Little spoiler coming**The summary really sums it up. Rutger Hauer may scare the shit out of you as John Ryder. C. Thomas Howell as Jim Halsey is picking up the hitcher John unsuspectingly, thinking he is doing a good deed. We follow their battle on the road with desert as long as you can see. With scary action on the way it ends with a climax able to take your breath away. If you loved Rutger Hauer as a replicant in Blade Runner, you'll love him as a deranged psycho killer in The Hitcher. In Blade Runner we had some empathy for his caracter "Roy Batty". We felt sorry for Batty when he died in the end. In the The Hitcher his role as John Ryder has no redeeming qualities. He is just pure evil. His acting is so good you would believe he REALLY was that crazy."Ordinary" commercial movies always got a good ending. Not this one. If you expect things to end well, forget it. See this movie on a big widescreen TV 40-inch or higher, it deserves it and it looks scarier!PS.

		<fullReview>i understand why people might think the violence in this movie is over the top, but this is certainly no reason to dismiss it offhand as roger ebert and his goons did. let's remember that ebert is the same genius who gave lynch's 'blue velvet' a half a star. (maybe he didn't get his goobers or heavily buttered popcorn before the movie.) forget about the violence and concentrate on the hauntingly surreal, atmospheric terror of the film, and you will immediately realize that it is a real cult classic that has been unjustly overlooked. in a decade when people actually listened to bands like poison and made movies like staying alive 2, the hitcher stands out as masterfully well paced, extremely involving, and absolutely terrifying. hauer should have gotten an award for his performance as the hitcher that howell is unfortunate enough to have picked up, and the ambiguity as regards his motives and who or what he actually is (an invincible supernatural entity? the delusion of a deranged mind?)simply adds to the overall fascinating enigma this film is. some of the gore is indeed repugnant, and i did not enjoy seeing a finger on howell's plate or the scene in which a young girl is torn apart after being bound to two huge trucks, but these are basically trivial flaws. the surreality and astounding mystery of the movie more than compensate for it's sadism and senseless violence. it is like being taken into another, more shadowy dimension of reality. chilling and effective, as good as halloween. buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over-looked and underrated. The moment you first start watching this it's obvious it's not just going to be another straightfoward action film. There are action scenes in the Hitcher, which are great, but that's not where it's power comes from. The whole atmosphere of the film is disturbing and downbeat. The desert surroundings in the film are empty and bleak and you can't imagine anything in the Hitcher not happening for a reason. The Hitcher played by Rutger Hauer seems to represent some kind of dark side of Jim Halsey's personality, who picks up the Hitcher deep in the desert on the way to California. Despite some blackly funny touches there doesn't seem to be one upbeat moment in the film and in the end nothing seems resolved, but it works, and is a lot more memorable for it. I don't think this film would appeal to everyone. Thing's don't always work out the way you might want them to, and it does seem kind of bleak in places, but I think it's all this stuff along with some exhilarating, fast-paced action scenes that makes the Hitcher such a great film. The acting and haunting music contribute to the disturbing and vivid feeling of the film. The more and more you watch the Hitcher the more unnerving the atmosphere of the film becomes. The Hitcher is unique in that sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only Kastore (among imdb reviewers) appears to have noticed Ryder's wedding ring. Did whoever was symbolized by that ring go through what the kid here goes through with Ryder? When he tells the kid to repeat "I want to die," after him, Ryder says it like he wants to die himself. Is this a bizarrely drawn out case of suicide by cop? Or is the film more metaphoric than that? The mayhem Ryder causes in this film is performed so affectlessly that it seems almost inappropriate to refer to it as evil. Ryder is more like a force of nature, impersonal and devastating.This certainly isn't some cruddy little exploitation picture. It has style and atmosphere, and three fine performances from its leads. Those reviewers who have pointed out that movie violence has moved far beyond "The Hitcher" are right, but it is the anomic quality of the violence that is most disturbing here, not its actual degree of grisliness. The average viewer may find this difficult to deal with.The most unsettling thing about this movie is that Rutger Hauer brings to it his special talent for giving psychos a quality of soft-spoken tenderness. This injects a great deal more dimension into the developing relationship/duel between him and Howell, and makes the encounter in the diner perhaps the key scene in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie used to be notorious for its scenes of violence, but these days the mayhem seems downright tame, especially compared to recent horror films. What makes "The Hitcher" work is not the gory violence but the haunting atmosphere of the film. Jim Halsey picks up a homicidal hithchiker and is soon sent spiraling deeper and deeper into a bizarre sadomasochistic battle with the killer. What we react to is not the violence but Halsey's reactions to Rutger Hauer's evil. The shots of the vast Texas desert give us the feeling that Jim is alone and vulnerable to this maniac. Mark Isham's brilliant score adds to the dream-like feel of the movie, and we become more and more convinced that this is truly a nightmare. "The Hitcher" is one of the best horror films I've ever seen, and is worth a look for anyone who loves a memorable flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling and unsettling thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eric Red's unsettling and somewhat empty tale of a young man (Howell) traveling to California, only to pick up a soul less mass murdering hitch hiker (Hauer). A deadly game of cat and mouse ensues. Leaving behind a trail of dead bodies. Police think that Howell is the killer, and the hitcher is following him every step of the way, taunting and increasing the havic and body count. The flick took some flack by Ebert for being "Corrupt and Diseased" written from the mind of a psycho. I understand what he's trying to say. The flick is suppose to be symbolic. Of what? I really don't know. It leaves alot of things up to the viewers imagination and I like that. The hitcher himself is simply a cold and soul less murderer with no past and motive for committing these crimes. There are also some strange happenings that may lead the viewer to believe that the hitcher is a figment of Howell's imagination. One of the most chilling aspects of the film is the bond between the hitcher and Howell. They seem to have gotten close to one another. Are there homoerotic overtones? Yes. The movie is almost devoid of dialogue, relying on action and fast paced directing, a plus in my book. There is little on camera violence it is mostly left to the viewers imagination. The rig scene in particular where Jennifer Jason Leigh meets her demise is quiet disturbing. The movie is quite strange and leaves the viewer in a dumbfounded state. You have to set back and let it all soak in before you can rate it. In the beginning Howell is a easy going kid, but by the end he is almost like the hitcher himself. The hitcher is granted a type of supernatural power in the flick. This is a pretty mumbled review I know, but the flick is almost the same way. It isn't for everyone and those who do watch it probably won't like it. I however, did like the film. It worked on many levels, but..... It's hard to explain. A one of a kind flick. My rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road movie from hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic film noir thriller borrows a lot from urban legend and movie-going history but still manages to stir up a lot of surprises and shocks along the way. Rutger Hauer is in masterful form as the psychotic hitch-hiker of the title. Creepy and convincing, he makes the unimaginably evil hitcher frighteningly realistic. We can only guess at his motivations as he pursues hapless C Thomas Howell across the American highway. Eric Red wrote this before going on to the equally frightening horror road-movies, 'Near Dark' and 'Cohen and Tate'. Like Spielberg's 'Dual' the tension comes from not knowing what the evil pursuing us truly is. A real , road-movie from hell'.</fullReview>

Made before the urban legend of the killer hitch-hiker was popularized Rutger Hauer delivers his Best work (comparable only with his work in Blade Runner) along with C Thomas Howell( whose comprable best work is in the Outsiders) A shame that both these actors now do films that absolutely bomb. Nevertheless The Hitcher is a thriller on par with Silence of the Lambs. The theme for this is copied several years later with David Duchovney and Brad Pitt in Kalifornia</fullReview>

There was a bizzare relationship going on and C. Thomas Howell and Rutger played it well. Call it a strange bond. Good againt Evil. Whatever.

		<shortDescription>an incredible thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is for me one of the best example of what a filmmaker can achieve with a great screenplay and actors that fit perfectly inside their characters. The movie starts pretty quietly with a young man driving his car across the country. By taking a man (?) inside it, his destiny will change forever... What is, to me, fascinating, is the interaction between the two main protagonists (the hitchiker and the kid)... As one of the IMDb user wrote, it might be possible that the hitchiker is not really a man but rather a spirit or an entity meant to change the life of the kid. The viewer can take whatever he wants or just guess that the guy is just plain crazy...The power of the movie is that you can choose to see is that way or go deeper into it and feel it with your own guts... In addition, some of the camera movements are great and the settings and landscapes add to the oppression and the emptiness of the rest of the life that awaits the kid.I just love this movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher vs. Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hitcher was the movie that introduced me to Jennifer Jason Leigh. Which is not so abnormal: there aren't many movies where a heroine gets torn apart by two trucks. Not that this is a spoiler: it only adds to the tragedy of the movie. Yes, far more than horrific (which it is as well), this horror movie is tragic. The story starts with C. Thomas Howell (as Jim) driving around when he sees a hitching Rutger Hauer (as John Ryder) in the pouring rain. Of course, he picks him up, unaware that Hauer is a psychopath. We're in urban legend territory where every man you pick up is a maniac with the sole intention of torturing or killing you. Most movies on this subject are lousy, mainly because you need a very good actor to pull it off. Hauer is such an actor. And with Hauer and Jennifer in the same movie, you know bad things are going to happen. Certainly for Jennifer's character...When Howell succeeds in getting Hauer out of the car, the mad hitcher wants only one thing: revenge. The strange thing is that the more John Ryder hunts Jim down, the more you can see that there is a strange bond developing between both men. Compare this to John Carpenter's classic Halloween: the more Michael Myers kills or stalks Laurie, the more you realise this character is just not human. (And on the bond between Michael and Laurie: please remember that in the original movie you don't find out that they are related.)And even though the hitcher's revenge gets more and more spectacular and implausible, the viewer still swallows it all. That's why The Hitcher is a great horror movie. It'll never get to be a classic (it lacks a certain je-ne-sais-quoi), but it'll remain in your head for the rest of your life. You can bet your life it'll be there to haunt you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>first-rate slasher horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was in the news recently (Sept 2000) when it was revealed that George W Bush had invested in the production company that funded it. It was described in the press as a horrible, unimaginative slasher flick. Well, it is a slasher flick, but it is anything but unimaginative. It stands out from the rest of the genre because it is so atmospherically creepy. Rutger Hauer plays the serial killer, but the real story behind the movie is his relation to the hero--Hauer never tries to kill the hero, but kills everyone the hero loves, and tries to draw hero into some sort of complicity for the crimes. This is what gives the film its psychological edge, and makes it much more disturbing than the mere depiction of violence could do. The film is also well-directed; beautifully atmospheric.</fullReview>

The man could find something to love in almost every movie he saw but he gave it No Stars, saying it was a cruel and worthless piece of trash. I use his review as a way of illustrating the savage kick the film delivers. Either you're in its world or not. There's no middle ground. But 'The Hitcher' is a creative, well made, effective little movie. It's well thought out and makes absolutely no apologies for its utter cynicism, which for me is a good thing as honest films are hard to come by, especially in the oh so highly respected horror/teenage slasher genre.It's a cult film for a reason.

		<shortDescription>Zero stars???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished reading a posted review of The Hitcher and had a laugh at the reference to Roger Ebert's "zero" rating of the movie. I too wondered about this and even went so far as to e-mail Roger regarding this questionable rating for a movie that he, in his review, barely said a negative word, except for his view that it was "diseased and corrupt" as well as "reprehensible". He did not reply, but I've read in a few places that he reserves "zero" star ratings mostly for movies that are bereft of a moral compass (or in so many words..."evil"). Seems a pretty weak argument when the so called slasher movies are able to score two or three stars ("Scream" is not exactly brimming with virtue), besides, when has morality had anything to do with good movie making ("Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" comes to mind...3 1/2 stars from R.E.)? In short, I agree that he was probably having a bad day because this movie is no more or less "diseased and corrupt" than half the movies that come out of Hollywood and is in fact one of the best thrillers of the 80's if not the past few decades. However by giving it zero stars Roger may have actually helped it more than hurt it. Better than damning it with faint praise by giving it 1 or 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably Rutger Hauer's best known role - and *the* perfect example of how good an actor he is. His magnificent performance adds to the film's strange and surreal atmosphere and creates one of the most chilling movie villains of all time. A mysterious modern Flying Dutchman, shadowy and coming from nowhere, undead and cursed to roam not the sea but a desert and kill over and over again, Rutger Hauer's "John Ryder" cannot be liberated unless *he* himself is killed... and this is what, he hopes, a young driver he has met will do. The movie is not a standard, down-to-earth thriller. It creates its own world and you can only understand it when you watch it and have the Flying Dutchman's story in mind. Only then will you see that what some people thought to be mistakes and holes in the script are in fact deliberate and well-thought elements of the plot. Watch the movie thinking of "John Ryder" as the Flying Dutchman, and you will understand every comment he makes, every line he says, and every action he takes. And, hopefully, you will appreciate the genius of Rutger Hauer and director Bob Harmon.</fullReview>

His performance in The Hitcher is fantastic.Ok, so there's not much blood and guts but you don't need that to make a horror move. The creepy atomsphere and Hauer's creepy face is all it needs to be a true classic horror movie.Rutger Hauer deserves more from this movie, so does the rest of the cast.

		<shortDescription>A remarkable look at alienation and terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of J.G. Ballard's favourite films, and it's easy to see why. Its eerie, dreamlike atmosphere and the alienation of the long, dusty highway and its steel travellers is not a million miles away from 'Crash'.I also love the utter mistrust of the police that this movie breeds in the viewer. The classic Hitchcock notion of 'the innocent man wrongly accused' is brilliantly used here. And just as Trippi Hedren in Hitchcock's 'The Birds' is attacked for no reason, other than a vague culpability because of her feminine wiles and her complacency; so the main character in this film is pursued only because he is guilty of being a middle class youth adrift in the modern world.Best lines in the film: 'Why are you doing this?' 'You're a smart boy. You work it out.' He is a 'smart boy', like the 'smart boy' in a schoolroom who gets the crap kicked out of him and demands to know why. 'I'll do anything' is the kind of undignified plea a 'smart boy' makes under duress, but it misses the point.I recommend watching this at 4am on your own, in an empty motel room. Then watch the sun rise over the tarmac and wallow in the emptiness of your world.</fullReview>

Consider that it is set in the dark, lonely byways of the heartland ... and you can feel the walls closing in on you.An ironic and razor-sharp sense of claustrophobia sets in early. Our star Howell has 500 thousand square miles to escape the twisted Hauer, but Hauer is there at every turn, grinning and licking his lips. Parts of this movie (especially the first act) are studies in Neo-Hitchcockian tension building. And unlike the reams of predictable thrillers Hollywood churns out, The Hitcher has plenty of surprises. Not recommended for solo viewing.</fullReview>

A merciless horror/action movie, The Hitcher is not a film that everyone would like. I saw it over ten years ago, and I like it now even more than ever. Set entirely in desert towns and a highway, this film has a mood to it that is very similar to Near Dark, an excellent vampire movie written by the same guy (Eric Red). There is no actual soundtrack (thankfully), just atmospheric music. The dilalogue is short and to the point, and is very realistic. Ths isn't a film where you have to wait for something to happen, the first 5 minutes lets you know what to expect. Great performances by everyone in it, lots of death and violence (although it doesn't show all of it), and killer plot. One of the best 80's films made, under-appreciated by critics. My suggestion is to watch this film following a viewing of Near Dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>starts out good, falls apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One wonders if the filmmakers knew what kind of a film they wanted to make. This movie starts out promising, with C. Thomas Howell as a kid driving across the great dusty southwest (beautifully and desolately photographed and eerie in a Stephen King-esque sort of way) on his way to California, only to be inexplicably pursued by a homicidal maniac, played with cold glee by the chilly-eyed Rutger Hauer. There is a promise here of a psychological thriller a la Hitchcock, with Hauer seeming to have a near-supernatural and truly menacing presence. There is something inhuman and demonic about him, though it's hard to put your finger on precisely what. The relationship (yes, one can call it that) that develops between Hauer and Howell is interesting and deeply disturbing. Behind the enmity, they seem to have some truly dysfunctional need for each other, which makes the cat-and-mouse game all the more suspenseful. Unfortunately, somewhere around the middle of the movie, it degenerates into just another shoot-em-up action flick and Hauer's character seems silly rather than demonic, while Howell is just annoying. After about a half hour of this, I just wanted both of them to die. I didn't care anymore. Had the filmmakers known how to write (and direct) a satisfying, appropriate conclusion to the very suspenseful first half, this could have been a great movie. Instead, it falls on its face--and is all the more disappointing because we expected something better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main criticism I hear regarding this movie is the apparent improbabilities of what happens. The Hitcher (Ryder) always turns up in the right place at the right time and appears to have almost supernatural powers. This is a movie that requires you to suspend disbelief, but if you are able to accept the events and absorb the story you will be well rewarded. This is a movie set firmly in reality, but you have to accept that something almost supernatural is going on.Halsey picks up Ryder on his way to California but soon begins to reget it when his passenger turns weirdo. The more Halsey tries to distance himself from Ryder, the more he gets drawn into Ryder's psychotic world of murder. The police think that Halsey is responsible for the murders, and the more he tries to prove his innocence the more trouble Ryder is able to get him into. Halsey's efforts are thwarted mainly due to his lack of identification, and eventually he has to resort to criminal acts to escape the clutches of the cops.Throughout the film Ryder could have killed Halsey at any point, but never does. Instead he gets him involved deeper and deeper in criminal activities. At points he is almost coaching Halsey.Ryder is finally caught following a brutal murder committed in such a way that he could never escape capture. Hauled into the police station we find that Ryder, too, is a man with no identification and no criminal record, as unidentifiable as Halsey.Both sent their seperate ways (Halsey free and Ryder to jail) the bond that exists between Ryder and Halsey is so strong that Halsey pursues the police bus that is transporting Ryder to jail. Ryder again displays his almost mystical powers by breaking free of his captors and the final confrontation begins.Before the final battle, Ryder throws down the shackles that held him in the police bus and, free, both men can pursue their respective fates.And with that we come full circle.This is a movie that you'll either love or hate. It's the kind of movie that still has you thinking about it 2 hours later. If you still wonder why Silence of the Lambs is so titled, this movie isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was much anxious about 'The Hitcher'. The other day I bought its DVD and gave a watch to it on my home theater. It was an interesting flick but there is much lacking in it. First, I never like movies with some brainless teen-agers as the central characters. They just create mess and instead of pulling the story, they are themselves pulled by the story. Other thing, when I watch a movie , I don't expect it to be like real but it would be a hard nut to crack for me to suspend my disbelief willingly to such extent that it remind me again and again that I am far away from the real world and watching a movie. In this movie villain is always omnipresent. It is quite odd. No body has the guts to stop his heinous activities. He seems not only omnipresent but also omnipotent. There is no clear reason why this psychopath is persistently after the young hero. It is an interesting movie but not a great one. I would give it six out of ten. I also recommend you Break Down of Kurt Russel. Better see Curt's movie first. The Hitcher can be your second choice. If u want to see it, just watch and enjoy it but please do not use your brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher (1986) was a nail biting thriller filled with homo eroticism that starred C. Thomas Howell as a young man who's driving his brother's car cross country. He makes the mistake of picking up a bored psychopath (Rutger Hauer) who develops an immediate crush for the kid. C. Thomas ditches the nut job at the first chance he gets. But the crazy psycho wont give up on chasing his sweet heart even if he has to track him down in the middle of the southwestern wastelands.C. Thomas doesn't put enough miles between him and his secret admirer. The crazy nut job catches him and makes the rest of the cross country trip a living hell. He sets him up for several capital murders and brutally murders a girl (Jennifer Jason Leigh) he falls in love with. After getting caught red handed and treating the kid to some authentic finger food, the bed bug doesn't let a prison bus or a pair of heavy shackles stop him from having a desert shown down with his "lover'. A brutal fight ensures with C. Thomas blowing away Rutger with a pump action police issued riot shotgun with an extend clip. Followed by a sequel.A tense game of cat-and-mouse. Rutger Hauer plays a role that he knows and fits in like a well worn glove. C. Thomas plays a naive and dumb kid like he was custom made for the part. Great stuff from the enigmatic Eric Red.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher was one of the first movies I ever rent and I remember I was totally amazed by it, but twenty years later (and hopefully having grown up a bit more) the thrill has gone just because there are too many blank spaces left... The idea is very simple...a teenage boy (Thomas C Howell) picks up for the very first time in his life a hitcher (Rutger Hauer) and of course he is dealing with a psychotic and if all isn't enough, the police suspect Howell to be the murder and it's only with the help of some waitress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that he can convince them it ain't like that.... The first thing that amazed me was the poor acting... Rutger Hauer doesn't really act (all he does is using his scary gangsterface), Thomas C Howell plays the ordinary schoolboy but can never hold our attention and a totally misplaced Jennifer Jason Leigh. That are the bad points but the good points are that Harmon (who only could have come up later with the Van Damme-vehicle, Nopwhere To Run) made a sort of roadmovie from it. The cliches are there but it's done in such a direct killer-victim relation that it makes it a thrilling movie, even if it can be quite dated as well...just compare it with the suspensefactor in Spielberg's Duel and you know what could have been...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish but frustratingly unlikely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young man picks up dodgy hitchhiker in the desert and is then SERIOUSLY messed about by him. Extraordinarily unlikely chain of events will have you screaming "no-one would do that!" at regular intervals. Presumably supposed to work on a 'mythic' level, but just having lots of facial close-ups of meaningful looks and a bit of a 'weirdy' soundtrack aren't really enough. However, if you can ignore the above shortcomings, Rutger Hauer is tremendously good in the meaningful-looks and scary-psycho department; the photography is excellent (esp. the final scene shot against the desert hills); and the director knows how to serve up suspense and shocks - even though most of the situations could have been avoided by a moderately itelligent chimp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A twist on Duel that is effective and enjoyable for what it is (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Halsey is driving from Chicago to San Diego when he stops to pick up a hitcher along a desert road. However when the man's weirdness turns into murderous madness, Jim manages to force him out of the car door and keeps on driving. Further along the road Jim is overtaken by another car that has picked up the hitcher but, before he can warn them, he finds them dead. He continues along the road to find a phone but the hitcher continues his murders ahead of him and, when he eventually does get to a phone, Jim finds himself suspect number one for the killing spree.I can understand the problem many viewers have the film in regards the issue of John Ryder having the supernatural ability to be everywhere at once and be able to silently kill any number of people with great ease. However, while watching the film this wasn't a major problem because for the majority of the film I was kept unsure if John even existed as a separate entity or if I was seeing events through one half of Jim's brain. I don't mean to make this sound like a deep film (it most certainly is not) but the air of uncertainty helps keep an element of mystery to the whole thing that kept me from scoffing at the whole idea.The great pace also helps and we are barely a minute or two into the film before we meet John and learn how violent he is. This pace keeps up throughout the whole film and produces a tangible feeling of fear and claustrophobia. Again I'm not suggesting this is a classic but it knows what it wants to achieve and it does it very effectively. Harmon directs solidly throughout and maintains a good sense of tension. The cast are pretty good too. Howell is the lead role but it is the title character that steals it thanks to Hauer's dead-eyed turn as the psycho ? ever present and doing a great job with surprisingly few lines or screen minutes. I will probably never forgive Howell for Hourglass but here he is actually OK, convincing as a teenager sucked in to the point of breaking. Leigh is reasonable enough but is just doing what is asked of her ? the same which can be said for the rest of the cast.Overall this is a solid thriller. The sheer unlikeliness of the narrative is a bit of a problem but the element of mystery for the majority keeps these questions of logic or physical impossibility at bay. In a way the film isn't too concerned about these as it sets about to do what it does and, in that regard, it is effective and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil Lives, why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is a great film, but almost all reviews miss out on the allegory this film offers.The Plot: A teenager picks up a strange man, John Ryder(Rutger Hauer) who taunts the teen with various killings and his unwillingness and his being incapable of stopping him no matter what he does. A really hard scene to watch is where Jim's friend, Nash, is tied between a truck and he has a chance to save her by shooting Ryder between the eyes. Jim is very late to the "justice" party.The Hitcher seems an allegory for the unwillingness of many people, sadly mostly liberals, to confront evil doers. Considering the tenor of the times in the 80's, with the Death Wish series, which advocated action in a judicial system under the Warren Court which was very sympathetic to criminals and not victims and let many criminals go free in a mistaken belief that they were the real victims, it is not surprising that this film reflects the attitude of inaction.This movie shows how easy it is for evil to flourish because of our own inaction to confront it early. Jim represents a feeble morality and unwillingness to do anything to deter such evil, even at the taunts by Ryder to do something, anything. To bad they fell on Jim's ears and not Charlie Bronson's ears.Even the USA was reluctant to enter WWII, thinking that the problem was "over there" and developed an isolation attitude. How wrong we were to ignore obvious evils.Still, The Hitcher is a very enjoyable and tense film, that is well made. Very tense and exciting leaves views with conflicting opinions, and emotions. And a classic acting job by Hauer.</fullReview>

Jim Halsey (Howell) is a teen driving through the desert and meets a hitchhiker, John Ryder (Hauer). He learns John is a psychotic killer and nearly escapes from him by kicking him out of his car. Jim becomes part of his deadly game when's he framed for murder and running from police. Jim also meets Nash, (Leigh) a waitress who believes he's innocent and helps him out. Jim and Nash become pursued by Captain Esteridge (DeMunn) who soon realizes that John is behind the charade. Jim, Nash and Esteridge learn that John is not the killer's real identity and is a twisted man with no conscience. I've always enjoyed this film and Rutger is a great villain as usual. I recommend this good 80's thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>C. Thomas Howell. Run Thomas Howell. See C Thomas Howell run from the Hitcher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the best films in the 80s are disarmingly straightforward and The Hitcher is most definitely a prime example of a lean mean plot. Whether it is one of the best films in the decade is for you to decide.A young man named Jim (C. Thomas Howell) is traveling the long road to California when he picks up a hitchhiker in the rain. The Hitcher is straight to the point, his name is John (Rutger Hauer), he has killed before, and he will kill Jim. Very soon.Understandably a little perturbed by this turn of events Jim makes a lucky escape, now alone again and exhausted he continues on away from his near death experience.What a story he will have when he arrives in Cali! But wait, there's more. Jim and John come across each others paths about 237 more times over the next hour and a half, sometimes by coincidence, other times due to John's almost supernatural ability to know exactly where Jim is on the long desolate road ? maybe he just has a sat nav unit some 25 years before anyone else? Such is Rutger's domination ? they call him John but he's always Rutger to me ? that he disdainfully declares to Jim at one point that "I can kill you whenever I want".And so it goes up and down the highway, Rutger/John casually teasing and menacing up and down the highway.C. Thomas Howell.Run. Thomas Howell.A waitress at a diner with the very sexy name of Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) becomes embroiled in proceedings, but the cops all think it is Jim doing the misdeeds, with Rutger/John being somehow invisible to all else but Jim and Nash.We have the usual situations where the stoopid cops don't listen and it costs them, the bad guy who always seems to be around the corner or in the car or room without anyone knowing, and the desperate teens who just want this all to be over.Rutger obviously relishes being the bad guy in a time when it wasn't that cool to be one on screen if you were a big star. His John is genuinely nutso and blas about the risks he has put himself under. He has no real motivation behind what he is doing and no masterplan to get out of it ? he simply enjoys topping people on the highway and takes particular delight in shadowing the understandably panicky Jim.At times he almost seems apologetic that he is so far ahead of his quarry such is his apparent omnipotence, and he gives the duo a headstart to make the pursuit more sporting.The Hitcher is even more straightforward than perhaps the above stuff made it sound, but even though it has some predictable moments they are quite well handled and while there is never any doubt as to how the film will finish the ride is worth it.See, I resisted a lousy "this is one ride worth hitching on to" joke.Final Rating ? 7 / 10. Some 80s movies were straightforward and formulaic, many movies of this millennia should stand up and take notice that this isn't always a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hitcher has a great premise, which it promptly abandons in favor of numerous road-rage action set pieces where John Ryder miraculously pops up whenever and wherever the plot needs him. Maybe I needed to see this back in 1986 to appreciate it, but in 2007 I've seen enough unmotivated car chases, gunfights, and phantom villains for one life time. Thanks.I did like the beginning of the film when Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) first picks up the Hithcer aka John Ryder (aka Rutger Hauer). Trapped in a claustrophobic car with a madman wielding a knife ? again, an awesome premise with ample suspense. "I'll do anything," Halsey begs for his life. And so Ryder sets the terms, "Say four words: I want to die." A nice little psychological dilemma ? can he bring himself to say words expressing a desire to die in an effort to save his life? Well played. Kudos.The cinematography looks great, and paints the titular character into more than just a psychopath ? it paints him as an icon (on top of a creepy performance from Hauer.) C. Thomas Howell does fine as the vulnerable kid who slowly hardens (not to mention loses part of his sanity) until the ultimate confrontation at the film's climax. The film nicely communicates a disturbing bond slowly forming between the victim and the stalker. And lastly, deserving applause, the film's willingness to create genuine sympathy for the sole character who gives Jim support, and then strike a tragic chord with a unique and creative kill (Hollywood, I hope you're taking note.) But I did not like how damn near every single remaining element of the film served the plot. Actually, "served" isn't even the word. Everything in the Hitcher is enslaved by the plot. John Ryder shows up wherever and whenever the plot *demands* him to show up ? if Ryder misses only one of his predestined appointments the entire film does not work. Jim makes stupid decisions that get him deeper into trouble because the plot *demands* his bumbling ? if just once he decides not to further incriminate himself by running or picking up a gun the entire film does not work. Every other character in the film exists to persecute and harass Jim because the plot *demands* such prejudice because if only one cop gives him a chance to explain (assuming the Hitcher doesn't pop up to kill him) the entire film does not work. Now, I don't have terribly high standards for thriller plots ? many of my favorites wear similarly flawed plots ? but good God this is so flimsy that I was afraid just looking it would make everything come crashing down.After awhile it becomes painfully obvious that the sole motivation behind *everything in this entire world* is to bring on another doomed attempt at an explanation, another attempt to "wow" and "awe" the audience with a surprise that isn't so surprising, or an action sequence that's, well, another action sequence.Let's be frank. This is a thriller. Thrillers, by nature, are absurd. Nobody goes to the theater or pops in the DVD wanting to be the reality-snob or the artsy critic championing high art. I watch thrillers to be, as the genre title implies, thrilled. Give me energy, give me wit, give me suspense, take me to the edge of my seat, and let's just have a fun ride. While the genre doesn't require the most sophisticated stories or the most sympathetic characters, there is still a baseline. And, yes, a film can fall below that baseline, which is very very dangerous in a genre that all but dares the audience to disbelieve.The Hitcher sinks below that baseline, which is a real shame because the action looked pretty cool.</fullReview>

C. Thomas Howell is all grown up from E.T. and gives an excellent performance as the confused kid who is being chased by Hauer and blamed for his deeds. Young Jennifer Jason Leigh made this the year after making Flesh+Blood with Hauer. Not as good an ending for her.Now, I would advise people not to pick up people on Texas Highways.

		<shortDescription>Well-directed but idiotically written mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of ****I read somewhere that in order to appreciate The Hitcher, you have to use your brain. I followed this person's advice, and found myself flabbergasted at some of the most blatant plot holes and contrivances I've ever seen. To an extent, I understand these leaps of logic come from the result of The Hitcher's omniscient, ubiquitous actions, which in turn is meant to jack up the creepiness factor. I suppose I can see how a villain who knows all and sees all could be frightening, but director Robert Harmon obviously struck the wrong chord with me here, seeing as it is I spent more time trying to make sense of the situation than I did cowering in my seat (which I actually never did).This is all too bad, because the movie's got a great premise. Unsuspecting guy (C. Thomas Howell) picks up a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer) who happens to be psychotic. It's a concept that inherently intrigues and frightens me, and it's a premise that could be played two ways, as a quiet, psychological suspense/thriller or as an action-packed ride. The Hitcher tries both ways, but never fully succeeds as either.There's a lot of things that happen that tread the thin line between unlikely and outright preposterous. Here's a list: Howell somehow has pieces of evidence slipped into his clothing without his knowledge and when questioned by the police, he inconveniently forgets who he's driving the car to. Hauer's psycho is able to park on a desert road with the police in plain sight. He also shoots down a helicopter with a pistol while driving his black truck off-road (that got the biggest laugh out of me and the friend I was watching it with). Near the end, Hauer breaks free of his handcuffs (this happens off-screen), kills a bunch of cops, and then (spoiler) appears to willingly let himself be killed by Howell! It's possible all this is meant to be taken symbolically, but how compelling can a villain who wants to die (with not a single reason even hinted at) be? The Hitcher develops a weird relationship with Howell, whom he feels intent on framing for the murders he committed. Why, this is never hinted at. Just another instance of the script preferring to keep plot complications from arising. But it feels more lazy than inspired, and this is from Eric Red, a genre favorite who wrote the excellent Near Dark and the underrated Body Parts. I expect better from a veteran of the genre, especially one with as much talent as Red.It's ultimately Robert Harmon's direction that saves this piece. The cinematography does a fine job of capturing the dark beauty of the desert landscape, making this a movie that's at least almost always nice to look at. Better yet, Harmon delivers one knockout action setpiece, a fairly lengthy car chase/gunfight that's truly thrilling, even if it ends on a ludicrous note. The climactic action scene isn't as well-crafted, but is a tense enough sequence to conclude the movie. A straight-to-video sequel is soon to be released and I'm actually going to give it a look, if only for the super-hot Kari Wuhrer, who's beginning to make a career out of horror franchise sequels.</fullReview>

After kicking him out the hitcher starts to cause all kinds out unpleasant things to happen to the driver played by Howel. This guy can't get rid of the stalking hitcher and he finally has enough of the guy at the end. The movie ws great, they couldn't have picked a better actor than crazy Hauer. This film reminded me of previous Hitchcock films in the past that had that creepiness and scenes that put you on edge. The only flaw in the movie was Jennifer Jason Lee.

What's the nature of his relationship with the protagonist? If the filmmakers didn't at least give us more clues, perhaps it would have been best not to raise the issue in the first place. Maybe it would have worked better as a straight thriller, rather than as a puzzling, unsatisfying allegory. The violence gets over the top at times. There was at least one gruesome image, from the aftermath of the Hitcher's bloody rampage, which I thought was completely unnecessary.Overall, it's a fairly interesting movie, with some genuine suspense, but in many ways, it's also a misfire.Note: Armin Shimmerman (Quark from "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine") appears as a police interrogator.Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)97min/Released by HBO through TriStar Pictures</fullReview>

I thought that the twist would be that the kid was nuts and imagining it all and that he was the killer, or that Hauer's character would somehow transfer to him. But no, this wasn't a Twilight Zone episode. It's just a good premise ruined by a lack of writing. Jennifer Jason Lee is wasted with a silly character, and the police are just clowns in this farce. The stunts are laughable and over the top. The car crashes and Hauer's character shooting down a helicopter with a pistol from a moving vehicle are a joke. The final scene should never have been shot. The film should have ended with Hauer's arrest and leaving the audience wondering what it was all about. Instead we go through another silly chase scene and the kid stretching far beyond his limited abilities as an actor to hunt down and kill the Hitcher. You'll laugh as Hauer jumps from the bus and through the police truck's windshield, and you'll howl when he flies out again. An unsatisfying end to a short story premise with a lot of crap in between. 4 out of 10. 1 out of 10 without Rutger Hauer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too scary but well made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, older horror films do not scare me anymore. For example, I think the new "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is way better than the original, which makes sense because filmmakers have many more tools at their disposal now than the people making movies decades ago - without the help of computers - did. "The Hitcher" is good by older standards, but it simply doesn't hold up against many recent horror films ("The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," The Hills Have Eyes," "Wolf Creek, " and even "High Tension")."The Hitcher" is good from a cinematography point of view. It is pleasant to look at, featuring well balanced shoots and nice scenery. It is mediocre from an acting point of view. The performances are okay, with Rutger Hauer's standing out. C. Thomas Howell's acting isn't anything special; he isn't always believable when he is in peril or frightened for his life, which is crucial to keeping the audience engaged and in the mindset of the character. The plot is far-fetched but fun and full of action. The pace of the movie was good. The hitchhiker kept re-appearing to off more people or blow something up. This film reminds me of the recent French release "High Tension." ("High Tension" was a solid film until the finale, which was ridiculous.) What "High Tension" achieved that "The Hitcher" didn't was realism and genuine fear. The audience actually dreads having to watch the protagonist face off against the marauding killer. In "The Hitcher," the killer is a little too goofy to be taken seriously. There are also plenty of the requisite scenes in which the timing is questionable and the main character escapes by the skin of his teeth. I haven't seen the new film yet, but I suspect it will be much better, mostly because the special effects will be far superior. If I were you, I'd go see a newer horror film and actually get freaked out, not just watch a movie to see how they looked back then and realize how much horror has improved. 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie did have plenty of potential, Rutger Hauer can be a scary guy, but the diologue and mood seemed so corny and silly, especially the introduction of Leigh's character. Although there was a few scary scenes(especially the strecting one), the film still cannot rise above "close, but no cigar", too bad. Roger Ebert gave this film no stars, I think he went a little wild on it, it deserves about ** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE HITCHER (1986) **1/2 C. Thomas Howell, Rutger Hauer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jeffrey De Munn. Action packed original thriller with cross-country driving (and very gullible) Howell encountering The HitchHiker From Hell Hauer (in his trademark stoic, psycho style) plaguing him at every turn down the highways of dusty America's desert lands. Inventive and at times frustratingly dumb (you keep wanting to slap Howell into some sense at certain points). Nasty demise of Jason Leigh is perhaps the most memorable off-screen offing in recent cinema history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an implausible, irritating, mullet-infested piece of 80's try-hard crap. If you want to see a film which delivers good shocks, tension and unease then try and avoid this one. I saw it first in '86 and thought it was average, then again recently - though I only made it part way into the movie before tearing my hair out in frustration at its stupidity. If you pick up a man wearing a long, black raincoat in the middle of the desert then you deserve what comes to you.

		<shortDescription>The Hitcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taut, tight, tense terror tale about young Jim Halsey(C Thomas Howell)driving a car from a company in Chicago across country to San Diego to it's owner when he has to misfortune of picking up psychotic hitchhiker John Rider(a quietly menacing Rutger Hauer). Able to push Ryder from his car, Jim believes he's seen the last of John, but doesn't know that this is just the beginning of what he'll be up against. Anyone Jim comes in contact with, including local police or a family in a station wagon, perish at the bloodthirsty hands of sicko Ryder. Ryder frames Jim, however, placing the murderous knife he has been using to slash victims in his coat pocket. Local police send out a massive manhunt when, while Jim is imprisoned, John kills all the police officers in the station setting up the poor young man as the one responsible. The mystery in question is why doesn't Ryder just kill Halsey? Why all the cat-and-mouse that ensues? Perhaps John wishes for the murderous impulses to stop and believes Jim is the one able enough to succeed? Jennifer Jason Leigh has a supporting role as Nash, a waitress on her way to California who saves Jim from possible death at the hands of a cop seeking retribution for the murder of two deputies he believed were killed by him(..yet, we know that it was committed by John;it's a pattern in this flick where Jim seemingly has no hope as Ryder is much more good and prepared in this game than him). Will Jim be able to protect Nash when he himself could've easily been dispatched numerous times by John? And, will Jim ever be able to clear his muddied name and just survive the carnage lying in the wake of John's murderous rampage? They just don't make movies like this anymore. There has to be numerous twists and surprises instead of a straight, tense roller-coaster such as this dark, violent road thriller where surviving seems impossible. Sure, the flick has some moments where logic seems to be in question, but the flick is so well made and the suspense and style so ratcheted up, I could forgive momentary lapses of realism. I'm not sure Hauer's killer could get away with the things he does against the police, and I'm pretty sure Howell's tormented hero would have a hard to eluding police. But, those questions merely entered my mind briefly as I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched this again, after a few years, following a viewing of the same director's much later, 'The Highwaymen'. The later film is watchable enough, but shows none of the brilliance and assuredness of this little number. Part of the power must be due to Rutger Hauer's sensational performance but let's take nothing away from the director, here he truly got it right. This is relentless and suspenseful with not just a hard edge but a black soul. As is the victim, who first picks up this deranged hitcher, we are as thrilled as we are horrified at what his adopted mentor just might do. I'm not sure why I have not just given this the full score but maybe we could have done with just a little more variation. I don't know but worry not this will not disappoint and over twenty years on it still packs a punch. Nice understated performance from Jennifer Jason Leigh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE HITCHER is a predictable and slow-paced thriller about a teenager who is haunted by a violent psychopath he picks up and ditches en route to California. As far as thrillers go, this movie has little decency. You can tell that C. Thomas Howell was never really a heartthrob just by looking at his performance here. Jennifer Jason Leigh tries a lot, but fails at playing a decent Texan. Rutger Hauer as the killer is the only interesting character, but even his character is quite confusing. Given the poor script it has, THE HITCHER is also a disappointment for its gruesome violence, which is so graphic that you would be too afraid to go to bed if you viewed it at nighttime.

		<fullReview>Have just seen this for the first time after picking up the SE DVD at the right price. After seeing it I can't describe What seems to be something of a cult film as anything other than disappointing and unsatisfying.Right from the opening we're subjected to the idiocy of the lead picking up a hitch hiker (despite his momma having told him never to do so). Poor choices and bad judgement abound at every opportunity from there on in along with numerous plot holes, time line errors and implausibilities all cast aside to keep the contrived suspense moving along.I was especially fond of how you can drive and drive for hours without seeing any sign of civilization, yet if forced to abandon the car or proceed on foot, a settlement or other such place is just right around the corner or over the next hill.I don't mind C. Thomas Howell at all but I was really wanting to see his blood spilled everywhere more and more as the film progressed. He was just so damned annoying and irritating. Not only was he annoyingly irritating and stupid, but so too were the cops right through the film who are portrayed as (literally and figuratively) cowboys.After seeing part of the looking back doco on the extra features where they boast of it's multi genre appeal and debate if the film should be a horror, thriller or action film and tell us it's a little bit of each; I must admit they were correct. It's decidedly average though in all three stand alone categories and might just be where they went wrong if that's what was intended.All that aside, Rutger Hauer was good again as a villain and some the shots and production values saved this from being an absolute stinker. I can't help but think Hauer might have made a good Terminator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Hitcher' starts well but soon becomes bored with logic and relies instead on wild implausibility to keep the plot going, ensuring that it's impossible to take it seriously. C. Thomas Howell is delivering a car to L.A. by driving across the country; he picks up Rutger Hauer on a dusty back road and soon discovers that his new passenger is one plot hole short of a screenplay. As Hauer terrorises Howell and frames him for numerous murders, Hauer's ability to appear whenever and wherever the screenplay requires him to, and his power to predict where his prey will turn up next, turns what was an absorbing thriller into a missed opportunity. It's a shame, because the low-key direction and steady pacing make for some carefully crafted suspense in between all the silliness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw that they're making a remake, so I gave the title respect by renting the original. It's not very good. This movie could've been done in 30 mins. A plot is completely non-existent...at one point, after Halsey asks John Ryder the inevitable question "Why are you doing this to me?", Ryder replies, "You're a smart kid, you figure it out". That was the end of it. Needless to say he never figured it out. I'm not saying to explain every minute detail, but something has to be the cause of everything going on, and we get nothing. I watched the film only for Hauer (who didn't disappoint), and was rooting for him to kill Halsey, who comes off as a total wimp with no brains at all. For once, a remake of a film has a chance of being better than the original....while I'm not confident that it'll actually happen, in this case it's possible. If not for Hauer's performance, The Hitcher would be a COMPLETE failure.*1/2 out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thick on Suspense, Light on Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) is driving a car cross-country for his friend when he runs across John Ryder (Rutger Hauer), a serial killer who hitchhikes. Halsey escapes, but that's just the beginning: Ryder is going to pin all the murders on Halsey.This film does many things right. First and foremost, it nails suspense. We are brought from scene to scene with the most tension possible. From the very beginning, when Ryder and Halsey share a car ride... that's tough. It's almost hard to sit through, simply because I squirm in anticipation of what might or might not happen. And Rutger Hauer... perfect for the role. Probably even more than Sam Elliott (the original choice).Where the film goes wrong is with the "R" rating. They probably could have pulled off a PG-13, as the only thing really wrong is some violence. I would expect more violence, and much more gore. There is much potential for gore, and it is heavily played down. Jennifer Jason Leigh could have had a more mild accent, as well. More gore, less accent, and a bit more cursing would have been nice. That is the difference between suspense and true horror! All in all, it remains a modern classic, and is worth viewing. I'm not sure if the special edition is available in America, or only Europe. Mine is not a special edition, but that would really make the disc worth owning, not just renting. A decent commentary and the short films on there really make it a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is not smart or clever but what it lacks for in brains, it makes up for in guilty entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most interesting thing about 1986's The Hitcher is its bad guy, John Ryder (Hauer), who is a sort of steel faced homicidal hitchhiker whose chosen serial killer lifestyle is: getting picked up, killing the people in the mode of transportation and then getting another ride. He operates across a long, straight highway running through an American desert state. What's also interesting is that he is never really given much of a history or a formal introduction; indeed the first time we see him is in the rain as Jim Halsey (Howell) picks him up out of pity. The character is so interesting and mysterious that not only are the police useless at finding out the information even we desperately want to know but the actual title of the film revolves around him: The Hitcher.I think The Hitcher tries to cash in off the success that was The Terminator, released two years earlier and by far the superior film. Like The Hitcher, The Terminator is named so after its lead villain who is a faceless killing machine that gives a bunch of cops a hard time; but I think The Hitcher fails overall, not as a comparison to the film I'm linking it to but as a piece of entertainment overall. It's true to say that I was never feeling a sense of hate toward The Hitcher but I was frustrated with its incidental script and sloppy execution. The film also suffers in an odd way that it tries too hard to make its antagonist, no matter how evil and brilliant invention he is, just seem more dangerous. That is to say, just when it looks like Jim or whoever might gain a little ground and pull of a minor victory in whatever situation, Ryder will pull something out of the bag or something will happen that sways momentum and morale back into his favour.The film also gets some of its other principles wrong. The film is at its essence a road movie but for a film to rely on a genre where great care and attention should be made to space and distance to make so many spatial errors is simply unforgivable. A good example of a film doing this brilliantly is Road to Perdition where Law's character is chasing Hanks and his son's. Here, the time it takes for day or early evening to turn into the dead of night is still not enough time for Halsey (who's in a car) to get as far away from Ryder as possible (who's on foot, initially). Ryder is also given the ability by the film to jump numerous stages of the highway in order to get in front or behind the helpless Halsey; this can only act as an excuse to throw momentum and advantage back to the antagonist who has by this time been established as an absolute psycho. So The Hitcher tries to create its suspense and scares for the best part by fabricating false loops and un-realistic jumps in the continuous game that is cat and mouse.Part of the reason The Hitcher fails as the sort of film its attempting to be is because of its lack of logic, which at the most important of times, it uses to move emphasis from one person to the other. There is a scene in the diner where Ryder pops up, seemingly out of nowhere further emphasising the dodgy spatial jumps, and tells Halsey that his revolver is empty of bullets which it amazingly is. This contradicts the scene previously where two sheriffs are held up, at gunpoint by Halsey and the said revolver but at no point did they notice there weren't any bullets in the thing. This is somewhat surprising as they had a clear view of the gun whereas Ryder could tell from a glimpse; but in the end, the scene ends with Ryder actually leaving him some bullets and just disappearing. This scene not only highlights my two arguments that the character is seemingly blessed with luck and good fortune but it also acts as a rather clear example he can jump apparent large spaces in the time it takes to cut away.There is also a sequence or two in The Hitcher in which characters appear underdeveloped or do fabricated things to merely advance the plot. When Halsey is first taken by the police, they appear all angry and agitated in their handling of Halsey and haul him off without so much as a glimpse inside or an investigation; so sure that they 'have their man'. This is right after Nash (Leigh) is introduced and a friendship is developed somewhat based on a first meeting; it will be enough of a development to aid future events. The second scene takes place twenty or so minutes later when Halsey is one board a bus and is ready to give himself up for his apparent crimes but Nash, who clearly believes him and trusts him enough steps in and they escape. Not only was I unconvinced Nash would do such a thing but further evidence of emphasis on the bad guy are apparent when Ryder shoots at some police in a chopper chasing Halsey and Nash; he is slightly off road but the police cannot see him. He is also able to disappear into the desert thereafter with the ensuing police cars crashing sloppily into the downed chopper. Where The Hitcher isn't necessarily a horrible film, it is just clumsy. Echoing what I said, it feels like a Terminator rip off with the invincible psycho chasing the couple with no one to help but this time, through a rural setting. The Hitcher might be fun in a guilty sense but it isn't that clever, no matter how many people might say it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Manipulator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.All movies start with a bald fact: there is the filmmaker (or group making the film) and there is us, the viewers. They manipulate us. Its their job to anticipate our moves, to travel along beside us and intervene to frustrate our normal routes.Some films are ABOUT such an intervention, a manipulation. Even though the Freddy movies are cheesy, they stand on this intelligent notion (made explicit in one of the sequels where Craven enters the plot). In such cases, the filmmaker is expected to be a brutal to us as his monster is to whatever hapless victim is involved. So we have all sorts of assaults on us -- many of these clearly staged for their effect on us rather than on the victim in the film.So far, the idea is pretty common. There's a similar notion in "Bladerunner," that the plot involves creating a person out of nothing just like a filmmaker does, and the notion of borrowed memories is common to both the film and the story within the film. Hauer symbolizes that for most of us, an association he has been exploiting ever since.Here we have the two notions combined. Pretty effectively and cheaply, I'd say. The flaws are significant, though. They didn't know how to end it, and that's important when dealing with such matters. "Identity" and "Silence of the Lambs" did it well. The other flaw is the misuse of JJ Leigh. She's not a great actress. She doesn't have what Depp has, but she comes from a similar awareness of self-reference. Here, she is badly drawn (sorry).Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

I realize I am in the minority here, as most people love this film. But that says a lot about the human condition, doesn't it? Why do people enjoy watching gore, violence and overall disgusting stuff on screen? Spare me the psychobabble BS (the hitcher is just another side of us, etc.)...really, it's so tedious.

		<fullReview>When it comes to cinematic psycho killers, they don't come much loonier than John Ryder (Rutger Hauer), a creepy murderous hitch-hiker who just wants someone to try and stop him.When a tired Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) picks up John on a lonely stretch of Texas highway, hoping that the company will help him stay awake, he finds himself involved in a deadly game of cat and mouse with the killer, which can only end when one of them dies.Smartly directed, with stunning cinematography, a brilliantly restrained but very effective soundtrack, top performances from all involved, and a wonderful script from Eric Red, The Hitcher is brilliant entertainment from start to finish.As the story progresses, poor Jim is framed for a spate of gruesome highway killings and becomes the target of not only Ryder, but also the police. Fortunately, he is aided somewhat by a friendly waitress (played by the scrumptious Jennifer Jason Leigh), but with the cool and calculating Ryder calling the shots, it is only Jim who can put an end to the psycho's reign of terror.Perfectly blending scenes of suspense, moments of blistering action and the occasional brutal death, director Mark Harmon delivers a gripping, engrossing, and completely unmissable thriller, and even, perhaps, one of the best films of the 80s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly first rate thrill-ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe upon seeing The Hitcher that the film never saw the inside of the cinemas. It was video rental that got this film known, and thank god it did because The Hitcher is a truly first rate thriller! The film doesn't waste time with intricate plot details or explaining character motivations; instead, The Hitcher puts all the focus on the central theme and that does the film no end of favours when it comes to thrilling the audience. The central plot line follows the 'cat and mouse' structure, as we see a young man pick up a hitcher, only for the hitcher to turn out to be an unrelenting madman. What follows is a relentless chase across a desolate desert setting as the young man tries to escape the man that he tried to do a favour for. The idea behind the film had been used before in films like the brilliant 'Hitch-Hike', but The Hitcher makes the plot line it's own simply by not letting up for a minute. Every time there's a slow moment, the film quickly turns around and delivers more shocks and thrills; and it's that mentality behind the film that ensures the audience will be kept on the edge of their seats.A huge reason for The Hitcher's cult success is Rutger Hauer's performance at the centre of the movie. His portrayal of the title character is rich in ambiguity and is one of the few genuinely frightening performances in all of cinema. Hauer ensures that he's frightening by never giving any reason for his attacks and that, coupled with his very cold persona; make the character the last person you would want to pick up on a deserted desert highway. C. Thomas Howell is the exact opposite in his role as frightened kid, and he and Hauer make a very good cat and mouse. Jennifer Jason Leigh rounds off the cast with her performance as a trashy waitress. Despite being made for cable television and not having the biggest budget in cinematic history, The Hitcher never seems stretched and this reflects best during the car chases and the gas station explosion scene. The film never goes over the top with the special effects, but the ones it does have work and this ensures that you never question the film, resulting in a plot line that an audience can easily buy into. On the whole, The Hitcher is easily one of the most exciting films ever made and comes with high recommendations to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I confess I saw the remake of The Hitcher before I saw the original, despite me hearing a few good reviews about it, I never really got around to seeing it. But when I saw the remake, I swore I would see the original. The remake sucked, I told my friend about it, she told me to just stick to the original, so I rented it a few days ago and watched it, I have to say that it was definitely better, it had a lot of chills and scares here and there. In my opinion, there are a few flaws here and there, like the kids are still not that likable, and some things didn't work that well, but I'd have to give spoilers to tell.Jim has been traveling for quite some time from Chicago to California, when he is trying to keep awake, he sees a hitcher that he offers a ride too. The hitcher's name is "John Ryder" and quickly threatens Jim's life, but Jim manages to get him out of the car. Right as things look good for him, we realize it's only 15 minutes into the film, and John is not going down without a fight and frames Jim for murders that he committed himself. Jim meets a young pretty waitress Nash and she tries to help him get out of this mess, but John is not going to give up that easily.The Hitcher has some very intense moments that were great, John Ryder is one of the best villains in horror movie history. The guy just won't give up on making Jim's life a living hell in the series of murders that he is leaving behind for Jim to take the blame. My problem is that he said Jim was a smart man and would figure out why he was doing this to him, but I never found out why. Oh, well, I guess maybe it was just me.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cat-and-mouse... but why this target?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C. Thomas Howell, looking perpetually dumbfounded, plays chain-smoking young kid who picks up a psychotic hitchhiker while driving cross-country. Masochistic thriller might've been sharper as a short-film; at this length, one begins to question why Rutger Hauer (looking a bit like Robert Shaw) is so fascinated with this pinhead youth with the cigarette hanging from his mouth. It's dragged out too far, and the "surprise" ending is such a labored clich I wouldn't be surprised if audiences laughed at it even in 1986. Good car chase midway through shows professionalism, but the rest of the picture is a strenuous ride. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent thriller. Don't give rides to strangers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is set among the twisting lonely desert highways of Texas. Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) is traveling to San Diego, to deliver the car he is driving to a customer. He's very sleepy and almost nods off behind the wheel in the early hours of the morning, an on coming trucks horn wakes him up. It begins to rain heavily. He sees a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer) on the side of the road. He decides to stop and give him a lift. Little did Jim know the mistake he was making. Jim tries to start a conversation with the hitcher who says his name is John Ryder, but apart from telling him his name the hitcher says nothing and acts very strangely and coldly towards Jim. Jim stops the car and tells him he should get out. The hitcher pulls a flick knife on Jim and tells him to keep driving. The hitcher describes how he killed the last the last person to give him a ride. Jim manages to throw the hitcher of the car and drive off, thinking he is safe and that his ordeal is over. Far from it, as Jim continues on his way he notices another car and in the back is the hitcher. From then on the hitcher follows Jim around the Texas desert terrorizing him at every twist and turn.Directed by Robert Harmon I thought this was a excellent thriller. Technically as good as you would want. It's a very well made film with some strong performances, especially by Howell and Hauer. Jennifer Jason Leigh as roadside caf waitress Nash is the love interest. Eric Reds script is great, the relationship it develops between Howell and Hauer is gripping and has some nice twists and turns although I thought the fist half of the film was slightly better as it concentrated on Howell and Hauer, rather than the second half when all the local police are introduced. I love the scene when Howell picks Hauer up for the first time, Hauer is intense as he talks to Howell about puncturing his eyeball while holding his flick knife to it, and asking if he knows how much blood a slashed throat would gush. The script also resists the temptation to have Howell and Leigh jump into bed together at the first opportunity. My one real complaint would be the ending which is a little low key, I was expecting a big showdown between Howell and Hauer that never happened. And don't expect a happy ending where everything turns out perfectly for everyone, because that doesn't happen either. The script also seems to suggest that the Texan roadside is littered with cafs, truck stops and gas stations, there seems to be one or the other every mile or two. There's one or two nice tight restrained action sequences and some harsh but not explicit violence. A really great, suspenseful, interesting, character driven thriller that delivers the goods and relies on a strong script. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Pick Up This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rutger Hauer plays a homicidal psycho traveller in "The Hitcher." His nemesis is the young C. Thomas Howell, who does some of the stupidest things I've ever seen in a thriller before. Together they form an invisible bond through their eternal strugges--the question is, by the end of the film, do we give a hoot?Jim (Howell), who works for a car transportation company, is driving a vehicle to California. Bored and tired on a rainy night, he pulls over and gives a wandering stranger, John Ryder (Hauer), a ride ("My mother told me never to do this), in hopes of keeping him awake at the wheel. Ryder (get it?), is strange, and eventually he reveals a knife, commanding Jim to keep driving him onwards. Jim, bawling like a baby, finally manages to bump Ryder out of the car, whereupon he yells like an idiot and curses Ryder, who is rolling helplessly along the sandy highway stretch.But Jim finds himself relentlessly haunted by Ryder, who seems bent on playing with Jim. Sometimes he wants Jim dead. Other times he does not. He frames Jim for his own murders. Then he saves Jim from a police station after he is apprehended.The motive for the killer is unclear, though I suppose that is the purpose. Ryder carries an almost supernatural evilness to him. He's the Uncatchable Villain, the type of bad guy who can walk into a house, unseen by anyone, murder the inhabitant, and walk back out, locking the door behind him without so much as a key to do so.But the interplay between the two is grim and unmoving. Jim's traits do not make for an attractive character--he whines and boo-hoos when held hostage, yet moments later he acts like a jerk, waving his fists in the air in triumph after losing Ryder. Okay, so it's enthusiasm. But you have to create a brave, likable character first. For example, take "Die Hard." Would we care for John McClane if he stopped in the middle of his gunfights, put his hands on his head and started crying like a child? No. Because though the everyman isn't a brave warrior, to make a movie you need a brave one-in-a-million hero. You can't rely upon a hero and give him unattractive and uninvolving charms.Then again, part of of the problem with our hero lies in the actor portraying him, the annoying and squeaky-voiced C. Thomas Howell, whose career has also brought such other wonderful modern classics as "Red Dawn" and the worst film of the year (I haven't seen "Gigli"), "Gods and Generals." His character is just plain dumb, and often I felt like jumping into the TV and strangling him (I tried that once--it doesn't quite work). I can't put it writing the type of profoundly stupid things he does and says--you have to see it for yourself.Another problem is the film's tension--it has none. It's not the fast-paced thriller that "Speed" was, nor the smart action extravaganza that "Die Hard" was. It's not as gripping as "Misery," which often had me pinned to my seat, and it's not as gruesome as "Silence of the Lambs." It tries to be fast-paced by quickly cutting to the next scene and the scene after that, but they don't hold together and the film becomes messy and convoluted. It tries to be smart by using John Ryder as a metaphor for death and the Grim Reaper, but in turn comes across quite dumb. There are no tension-packed scenes that leave you breathless and sweating. And it tries to become as unnerving as "Silence of the Lambs" by employing tons of blood and guts--but "Lambs" wasn't sickening because of its violence, but rather because it introduced us to the sick world of cannibalism. It psychologically affected us. How does a bucket of splattered blood psychologically affect us? Even then, the blood and carnage--by today's standards--is quite tame.I waited for a final showdown between Jim and John, and I was let down. There is a brief showdown towards the end of the film, after John escapes from a moving police transport van and (get this) leaps out of the back onto the hood of Jim's car, crashes through the windshield, falls out again, rolls across the road, then gets up and tries to shoot him with a shotgun. Boring, stupid and way too unbelievable. I don't mind when things aren't realistic in movies, in fact, that's often what I go see them for in the first place. But when the ending betrays the film itself, and provides nothing but a really boring shootout that isn't even remotely exciting, and has been done over and over beforehand in countless other films...I'm insulted.Hauer is by far the best actor of the film, giving his villain evil traits, but even then I found his John Ryder character bleak, dull, and not very interesting. Yeah, he's a metaphor for death incarnate, but so what? There is no character progression in this movie--by the end we have learned nothing at all. "Why are you doing this to me?" Jim asks Ryder. "You're a smart kid--figure it out." As for me, I'm still waiting for an answer to the question, John.1/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hitchhiker's Guide to SICKO- Galaxy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now we FINALLY know who was driving the freaky old truck in Steven Spielberg's classic "Duel"! It was Rutger Hauer's character John Ryder and he's still prowling the deserted American highways?only without the truck. Young Jim Halsey picks him up to avoid falling asleep behind the wheel, but Ryder soon makes clear that his intentions are very hostile. Halsey fights back, though, and this makes him the perfect adversary for Ryder's insane and blood-soaked road games. The entire movie is one giant chase in which Ryder commits gruesome crimes and Halsey gets the blame for them. "The Hitcher" has a very simplistic script but that's probably why it's often so terrifying. The raw cat-and-mouse interactions between the nihilistic madman and the innocent kid supply the movie with genuine suspense, at least, if you don't ask too much questions regarding the unlikely powers Ryder disposes of. He seems to have to the ability to appear in several places at once and he can even butcher an entire police station without waking up Halsey who's asleep in the cell next door! There are several more unlikely elements in the plot, but you easily look past them, simply because it's such an adrenalin-rushing and explosive thrill-ride. In fact, the real flaws only begin to show when the screenplay attempts to bring depth, more specifically by suggesting a certain connection between the two main characters. The forsaken Texan highways excellently fit the film's disturbing tone and they're beautifully filmed by John Seale. The story definitely owes a lot of its impact to Rutger Hauer's surefooted performance. He can surely give image to a malicious bastard like few other actors can. Last but not least, the film contains a couple of highly memorable shock moments, notably the truck-stop sequence and the inside the diner (better always check twice before you put fries in your mouth!). As briefly indicated before, "the Hitcher" reminded me a lot about "Duel". Both thrillers introduce psychopaths with unclear motives, or even no motives at all, and their actions only get crueler as the movies develop. "Duel" is a better film, in my opinion, but "the Hitcher" certainly is another highly recommended thriller and still underrated even though it gained a modest cult-reputation over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average thriller with one big plus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And that one big plus is Rutger Hauer. He really plays a very memorable scary psychopath, one of the best out of movie history. I really feel that at least an Oscar nomination would have been a proper thing.The story is kind of thriller average, as a matter of fact there isn't really a story. It's a road movie/thriller combination that feels and looks like a straight to video B-movie. But it's a combination that feels and works surprising well!C. Thomas Howell is not a great leading man but luckily Rutger Hauer compensates a lot. I can't even imaging how this movie would have been without him. Probably very, very bad and forgotten. He makes some scene's really worth watching and scary.But of course not just only Rutger Hauer is good. There also are some nice cruel sequences and some nice but not always interesting situations. Unfortunately the movie is a bit too short and leaves more questions then answers.Not really that recommendable unless you really want to see Rutger Hauer in a most excellent psychopathic role.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitcher, The (1986) * 1/2 (out of 4) Here's another 80's film that I've heard a lot about but never got around to seeing. When the end credits started I hoped that the remake would fix all of the errors found here. A young boy (C. Thomas Howell) is taking a car from Chicago to San Diego when he stops and picks up a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer). It turns out the hitchhiker is a psychopath who goes on a killing spree setting up the young boy as the killer. Soon the boy has the police after him as well as the killer. The only word that comes to mind in regards to this film is stupid. This is without question one of the dumbest films I've ever seen. Yes, films like this are certainly going to take liberties with things but this film is so incredibly over the top that I couldn't help but roll my eyes ever few seconds. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a waitress who, for some reason, goes with the boy but it's hard to believe she'd go with this guy. It's hard to believe that Hauer could take out half of the Texas police force. It's hard to believe any of the action sequences. It's hard to believe the ending. It's hard to believe anyone would take this film serious. The film tries to ask all sorts of deep questions about the connection between the two men but we never get any answers due to the stupid screenplay. Instead of a smart thriller we just get countless acts of violence, which are (surprise) stupid. Howell is a complete bore in his role and Leigh is wasted at every moment. Hauer comes off quite good but that's about it. A really, really bad movie all around.</fullReview>
