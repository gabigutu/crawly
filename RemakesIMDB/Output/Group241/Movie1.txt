		<shortDescription>What a shocking surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the 2008 Swedish film "Let The Right One In", I was originally very frustrated when I heard the news about the upcoming remake. "How do you ameliorate something that is already perfect?", I asked myself. I treated the remake with hostility and vowed to stay away from it. And then, I decided to open my mind. I attended the world premiere of this film at the Toronto International Film Festival on Monday, September 13. I am very lucky to live in the proximity. This was the first year that I've attended the festival. Before seeing "Let Me In", I saw "127 Hours". I liked the idea of seeing the remake of a film that I recently gave a second viewing. I thought it would be a fun challenge to sit there and compare both films while watching. Before the screening (or it might have been after), the director, Matt Reeves (who launched his career with "Cloverfield"), was welcomed on stage to say a few words. It surprised me to find out that he, too, thought the original was fantastic and didn't understand why he was asked to remake it. However, after reading the book as well, he had the desire to work on his interpretation of it. After this speech, I gained a significant amount of respect for this man. When the movie began, I was only expecting something satisfactory. But as the story progressed, I was breathless. It was a very captivating, interesting take, and I loved all the little modifications. I honestly believe that "Let Me In" is one of the greatest American remakes of all time. Nevertheless, I still see the original, "Let The Right One In", as a superior film. Although it may be a biased opinion, I preferred the mood, atmosphere, and cinematography in the original. While the remake seemed to take a greater interest in the horrific violence, the original had the perfect blend of genres (thriller, romance, horror, fantasy). Both films had many beautiful contrasts: coldness vs warmth, chaos vs peace, guilt vs innocence, darkness vs delicacy, and despair vs hope. I must also mention that I preferred the sense of ambiguity presented in the original. Very few questions were answered, and the whole film was more of a mystery left to interpretation. In contrast, Matt Reeves was more clear and direct in his screenplay with the mystery surrounding his characters. It's all a matter of personal preference, though. I believe that most people will prefer what Matt did, since the original has a certain style that less people can appreciate. Despite the comparison, I believe that they are both great movies that can be enjoyed by everyone. Fans of the original-- rather than being narrow-minded and boycotting this version-- should give it a chance and appreciate it for what it is. Wouldn't you want more people in North America to discover this mesmerizing vampire tale, anyway? I really enjoyed every aspect of "Let Me In". The child actors, Chloe Moretz (Kick-Ass) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) were both excellent choices. They proved to us, once again, that they are among the only child actors who actually have talent. Now that I think of it, the only thing that didn't impress me was the music. For an original score composed by Michael Giacchino (Up), I was quite disappointed. It was mediocre, in my opinion. It didn't convey the same emotion as Johan Soderqvist's music in "Let The Right One In". Aside from that, "Let Me In" is a surprisingly great film for the fans of the original. And it would probably be a bloody masterpiece for those who haven't seen it. And yes, that lame vampire pun was definitely intended. 7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the background to this film, I must start by saying I have neither read the book it is based on, nor seen the 2008 Swedish original. After watching this masterpiece, I intend to do both.This is a truly sensational film. When you can't really pin a film down to a specific genre, you know you're onto something special. Calling this film a "vampire movie" doesn't really do it justice, given the preconceived notions most film goers bring to the genre. It is part horror, part dark family drama, part love story, with all 3 categories succeeding admirably.In my estimation, the director has come on in leaps and bounds since "Cloverfield", a movie with a clever idea that was hampered by a poor cast and so-so execution. Here the director sets a mood of oppression and isolation from the very earliest frames and never lets up. The locations are used superbly, as are lighting and sound to create the gloomy world poor Owen is stranded in.The film undeniably belongs to Chloe Grace Moretz as the young vampire Abby. This girl is an absolute powerhouse of an actress, turning in a dark, subtle and convincing performance that belies her tender age of 12. If she does not make the shortlist for next year's Oscars, the Academy needs its collective head examined. She embodies the potent mixture of lovable innocence and animalistic darkness within Abby with such ease, you will be genuinely astounded.My fellow Aussie, Kodi Smit-McPhee, is also excellent, making you really feel for the put-upon Owen and share in his joy at finding a spark of happiness with the mysterious Abby. The entire film falls apart if this pair fail to convince, so it is a testimony to their respective talents (particularly Moretz') that you invest so heavily in their relationship.Don't let the press about this film being a remake put you off. I must say I'm very disappointed to see this hasn't done too well at the box office in the USA, as it is a vastly superior film to the likes of "Paranormal Activity 2".If anyone is in two minds about seeing this film, take the gamble and shell out your hard-earned. You'll be glad you did, if for no other reason than witnessing one of the most impressive performances by a child actor in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Romance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stop right there if you think this is a horror film. This film dances around a horror atmosphere while hiding in the shadows of a thriller. It's actually first and foremost, a romance.Chloe Moretz, of Hit-Girl fame from Kick-Ass, plays a child vampire who moves in next door to a boy named Owen, who is very much alone and bullied at school. Owen's mother is an alcoholic who won sole custody and Owen's father is not allowed to come around. Moretz once again steals the show as the tragic character of Abby.Let Me In is an adaptation, written and directed by Matt Reeves, of the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In. Barely anything has been changed from the original story, but the cinematography, some dialogue, different actors and adjusted characters make for a new movie. Although many fans of the original boycotted this film for months, Let Me In will allow for the original to be viewed.Matt Reeves does an excellent job and I've enjoyed his first two films I've seen. Let Me In and Cloverfield are his only two pieces of work I've seen and they are his most popular thus far.This is a romance because it plays very intimately between the two lead actors. The scenes between Owen and Abby are tender and very romantic for the age of the characters. It's surprising to see how well two child actors can be this mature and loving with such a great chemistry. It has some thrills and chills and there's room for drama but it's definitely meant to be a romance.Personally, I've not seen the original film, but I do think this is a great film in its own right. It certainly did a good job to get me interested in watching the original whenever I get a chance.It has a very short list of cast, as the only other names I can recognize are Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas. Their involvement is less than secondary characters and even then they are still overshadowed by the breathtaking Moretz. At 13 years of age, Moretz amounts maturity and skill in her acting as much as an adult can. Her timing and delivery is well-established and crafted almost as if she's been doing this work for decades.I can't say anything bad about Let Me In because I haven't seen the original to compare and mostly because I really enjoyed the movie. Perhaps it's my favourtism of romance movies and I am fascinated by Moretz and child actor leads, but whatever the reason, I believe Let Me In is going to be a great success with audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully composed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one for "scary" movies, but this movie was so much more than that. And in a time where I'm becoming more and more reluctant to watch vampire films, I needed a movie like this to remind me just how good this type of subject matter can be. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz were phenomenal. They brought a subtlety to there characters that was gently heartbreaking at times, while exquisitely silent and perceptive at others. The dynamic of the characters was tangible, and the viewer ends up with a sense - not of whether the actions of the characters are right or wrong or whether vampirism itself is okay when presented with the face of a 12-year-old girl - but of whether they themselves believe in the rightness or wrongness of where the story takes this young boy. Unlike most "scary" movies, this one leaves the viewer with something to think about when they leave the theater. And if that's not good storytelling, I don't know what is.The soundtrack was beautifully mellow at times as well as keeping on point for the more thrilling parts of the film. The shots were lovely and simple at times and rather artistically impressive at others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Vampire Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning we are treated to spectacular creepiness. Who is the man who covered himself in acid? What kind of a strange young man wears a mask and pretends to stab girls? Who are the new neighbors that move in under cover of dark? This film is much more violent and has more suspense than the original, a Swedish film hailed as a landmark in vampire cinema, which might turn off some people but it really made it great for me. The film was a roller coaster of emotion and rhythm, each tender scene followed by a horrific moment. Some people may feel that it moves too slowly, but each quiet moment is meant to be enjoyed because deafening horror is soon to follow.Overall it is not just a vampire story. It is the story of a lonely boy who finds companionship in the most unusual place. It is a wonderful study of human nature and asks important questions. Are there truly evil people in the world? And are they always evil, or can they actually be wonderful in the eyes of some? One of the great strengths of this film is that it constantly moves between two worlds--the sweetness of youth, and the horror of what a vampire really is. We get a front row seat to both and must decide if the evil outweighs the good.I can't think of the last time I saw a vampire movie that impressed me as much. This has all the blood and action that was missing from the original, but maintains its commitment to carefully revealing the characters to us. There are wonderfully creepy additions and a truly artistic filming of a car crash that elevate this film onto a different level than the original. If you are a fan of horror films this one is not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In Will Quietly Haunt You Long After the Lights Come On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let Me In" is an adaptation of the Swedish Horror Classic "Let The Right One In". Being an adaptation many fans of the original may have been against the idea of an adaptation on the basis of many adaptations of other films in the past which had failed to do the original justice, those fans should be happy to know that "Let Me In" not only does the original's brilliance justice, but builds upon it to give an even better experience, and a new take of an excellent story to those who will see this film."Let Me In" (LMI) will make you do what the title asks, it will make you open your mind, heart and subconscious where it will plant a seed that will grow and continue to haunt you long after you have left the theater. Unlike most Horror genre movies these days LMI is a movie that doesn't lean heavily on visual effects and gore to scare you. Instead LMI builds its foundation in an already excellent story, complimented with great direction, acting, and cinematography. Normally the horror genre is one I choose to avoid due to the frequent use of cheap visual thrills rather then hard hitting emotional trauma and mental unrest. This is where LMI transcends the genre, as it is a film with depth and emotion that will truly stay with you long after the lights come on.The acting in LMI is award worthy, especially Chloe Moretz as Abby, who's acting is amazing and makes the film's most complex character work. Give her the statue please! Worth mention for those who have seen the original is compared to Lina Leadersson who did an exceptional job as Eli, Chloe was responsible for both the acting and the voice, while Lina was dubbed. Also award worthy is Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen, without Kodi's Owen to compliment Chloe's Abby the film would have lacked a soul and fell flat despite a great story.The one area I thought the film lacked compared to the original was Musical Score, whole LMI has an excellent musical score, it is far more direct than the brilliant and creepy Score that supported the original, just nitpicking here though.In my opinion LMI is a brilliant movie which perfectly compliments the original, as well as one of the best this year.9.6/10***Spoilers Below This Point***I hope my review doesn't come off as disjointed since I have separated the spoilers from the rest of the review.LMI is driven only by the relationship between Owen and Abby, two brilliantly conceived and acted characters. Abby is a very complex character, many on the IMDb boards have taken Abby to be a pure evil, calculative, and manipulative 200 year old lady who has perfected the art of tricking others into helping her, I do not agree with this. Abby's character is brilliant because despite these 200 years that she has lived, she is still a 12 year old trapped inside of a monster. There are many hints throughout the movie that evidence this. For example when Abby's caretaker fails to bring back blood for her she is furious because she will now be forced to do the sinful deed herself. Abby's reluctance to get her own hands dirty is evidence that somewhere inside her the 12 year old girl still lives, rather than an insatiable monster who would jump at the chance to enjoy adrenaline pumping moments of a kill. This makes Abby kind of an ironic character, she is defined by her disease as a creature that lusts for human blood, as well as one with the power to obtain it herself, but instead she is reluctant to do so when it can be avoided, because somewhere inside her the 12 year old human girl still lives.Owen is also a very complex character, but in a way that almost is the inverse of Abby. Owen is a helpless school boy constantly tormented by bullies in his school. He is weak, and has a poor family foundation with his parents going through a divorce. But, when we look into his character, and in certain scenes, we see he has a desire to do harm to his tormentors. One example of this is the scene where he is stabbing the tree with the knife and pretending that it is the group of bullies that torment him on a daily basis. So his character can be described as a weak 12 year old human boy, who wishes for the power to exact his revenge on his tormentors and imagines doing them as well, yet he still lacks the power to do so.If one looks at this Owen and Abby work sort of like the puzzles Abby loves in that each of them compliment a void in the other, hence when they are together they are complete and they are happy. This is what makes them a perfect match, as when Abby is with Owen she can be her 12 year old self which the majority of her clearly prefers to be, and on the opposite end of the spectrum Owen is no longer lonely and at the same time has someone who has the power to defend him.Neither of these characters would be even remotely believable without strong performances to back them up.LMI is also one of the greatest Romantic Tragedies ever made, because despite the happy tone the film ends on, one is assured there is nothing but trouble ahead. Either Owen will outgrow Abby and due to his love decide to keep himself useful and become her replacement caretaker, or she will choose to share her curse with him, where both will have to share in the curse of what a Vampire is a Victim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did not expect much going into this movie. Just the basic hope that it was somewhat entertaining and made sense. It is amazing to me how easily a movie can go bad from a single action or phrase. This, however, was not the case for "Let Me In". It was flawless! A perfect combination between a captivating storyline and interesting characters that have an almost fairytale like interaction. At the same time feeling completely natural. Add to that an amazing soundtrack that submerges you even more into the characters world. I have always found the "this is how it would actually be" approach in depicting fiction and supernatural stories to be more captivating and effective. The movie is a complete underdog and is definitely worth seeing. Walked away wowed!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie casts a spell that endures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A life as a companion and living on the run is better than living without love. This is a film for the bullied and unwanted children in our world. The roles portrayed were executed with honesty by all actors involved. The director was clever in not showing the mother's face for very long and we never see the father. The poor lad is left pretty much alone to face the cold, wintry world without a single friend. Then comes the new girl. She seems as utterly sad and alone as he..... and she is. It was refreshing to see how their chemistry blended and bloomed. The only fault I found was the CG attack scenes. That was unbelievable for me. I would have portrayed a vampire as having total control and with slow, deliberate moves. Imagine a fiend that would regard his next meal with detached urgency. That would be much more scary. After all is said I believe that this film will be regarded on it's own as a good love story although with some mayhem and gore that makes a fine cocktail to patiently consider as a film thats heads's above many other horror films .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have no doubts. See this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not your typical horror film, though it does have horror elements (e.g. suspense, violence, gore). Really it's a story about the complex loving relationship that develops between two children. The fact that one of them is a vampire just makes things more interesting.I read the book and watched the original film before seeing this adaptation. Even so, I ended up twisting in my seat the whole film. I couldn't find a single dull moment. The whole theater was ewwing and awwing and giggling. This film has its flaws, but it's very emotionally affecting nonetheless. It's thrilling and disturbing, and as real as a film can be. I can't wait to watch it again.- Compared w/ the First Film Adaptation -I say it's better than the original because more time is spent on the principle characters and the changes tend to make the story more believable.I prefer the acting and cinematography of the original film, but overall I think this is the best film adaptation anyone could hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartbreaking Story That is Disturbing and Bittersweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before finding out about this film, I had no knowledge of the book nor seen the Swedish film adaptation of "Let the Right One In." After first seeing a TV spot for "Let Me In", I got the impression that this was going to be a very original vampire story unlike any other. I went in the theater keeping my expectations leveled and I came out with a sense of complete satisfaction."Let Me In" feels fresh and it left a good impression on me. The pacing of the film felt right and the cast did a great job. I got to praise Chloe Moretz's portrayal of Abby/Eli. The character of Abby is so eerie and it is never implied if she is really manipulating Owen for her own motives or if she genuinely cares for him. As a vampire, she is a ruthless monster that will stop at nothing to murder a helpless victim to satisfy her cravings for blood. As a "twelve year old" girl, she appears innocent and comes off as introverted. Overall, I feel that there is a lot of tragedy in the character of Abby, but the question is does she really have a heart? I would like to think she does, but I cannot give a straight answer to that, so that would be up to the viewer to decide.Kodi Smit-McPhee does a good job playing Owen. You can really feel a sense of alienation in Owen's world due to the constant bullying from his classmates and having nobody to rely on. It is easy to see why he develops a friendship with Abby who also happens to be a loner living the type of lifestyle she does. It was a treat to watch scenes with these two together, because it sheds a bit of light in a film with such a dark tone. Not only that, but it helps prevent "Let Me In" from being classified as a straight up horror movie.There are some pretty gory moments in the film, but overall, the whole thing stays focused on the character's interactions. The film does a good job by staying focused on the relationship between Abby and Owen and not relying on violence to completely overtake the film.I also got to give Richard Jenkins props for playing Abby's father. There is a lot to this character and I couldn't help but feel sympathy for him. All of his scenes are intense and a pleasure to watch.I praise this film for introducing me to such a beautiful story. I feel a personal connection to "Let Me In." It really hits me on a deep level of emotion. I know there are people that feel that this film should not have been made, but If it was not for this film, I probably would not have known about the novel or the Swedish adaptation of "Let the Right One In." Update: After watching "Let the Right One In", I feel that these two movies are similar, but they each have it's own differences which is enough to make both the Swedish and American version stand on its own. The Swedish version blew me away just like the American version, but in ways that are different from how I reacted to the American version, which is a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm glad I went in. A beautifully made and excellently acted vampire/romance story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is a Hollywood remake of the Swedish version of the film Let the Right One In, that is based on the book. A lot of reviews on this website consist of the audience comparing the remake to the original having seen both. Well I haven't, but this looked liked an interesting film and I went to see only this afternoon at my local cinema. I thought this would be a good film but my expectations weren't exceedingly high and I was glad in a way as by the end it made me appreciate all the more for that reason.As soon as the first scene comes up I was intrigued and my attention never wavered from the screen throughout the running time of the whole 105 minutes of the movie (minus the credits). The basic story consists of a lonely and bullied 12 year old boy Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) whose parents are getting divorced, whilst at school he is bullied by Kenny (Dylan Minnette) and his two friends Mark and Donald. Meanwhile a 12 year old girl Abby (Chloe Moretz) and her father/guardian (Richard Jenkins) move in to Owen next door. Soon they strike up a friendship as a unique bond forms between them, but she appears strange, at one point Owen tells her she smells bad and despite it being winter with snow on the ground, she often goes outside in the courtyard of the flats they live in to see him barefoot without any shoes, but dosen't feel the cold. There is a reason as she has a terrible secret of being a vampire where her father goes out and kills innocent strangers to obtain their blood so she can survive and eventually Owen becomes entangled up in everything when he finds out her secret and he stays with her despite knowing the truth. This is a fantastic film from start to finish, it's beautifully made with a very bleak atmosphere. The cinematography gorgeously enforces this. It cleverly mirrors the loneliness the two children feel in their lives, Owen who is bullied with no friends and parents who are on a verge of divorce and Abby who is also socially isolated due to being a vampire along with her father who is torn at helping her but wanting to give up. This film takes an intelligent insight into two kids with fractured souls who fit together in a unique and unexplained way of being whole. The friendship that blossoms between them is wonderfully depicted and builds up in a believable pace. This is due to surprisingly excellent performances from McPhee and Moretz who perform a terrific job of capturing the essence of their characters and radiating a very mature presence on the screen, which is an incredible accomplishment. They are so superb that they put some of the adult actors I know to shame. Due to these terrific performances the chemistry is superb and it's a wonder to see them touch each others hands, hug one another or kiss on the cheek. This makes you feel for their predicament as you come to care about the characters and realise Owen will do anything to protect and be with Abby as they care about each other so much. The supporting performances like Richard Jenkins and Dylan Minnette is great and they deserved to be mentioned. Jenkins gives surprising depth at feeling torn at helping Abby, particularly in a heartbreaking scene when she touches his face as she can see the weight bearing on him of what he does and Minnette perfectly portrays the menacing bully who also in a way is like a lost soul just like Abby and Owen when you see him being bullied by his older brother, which partly explains why he is so mean to others like Owen. Director Matt Reeves has done also a sensational job on striking a precise balance between the tone of the film where we feel disgusted and scared at how Abby is, what she is doing, but also saddened by her and Owen's predicament and moved in a happy and sad way by the friendship between her and Owen. This is helped by the lovely music by Michael Gucchino who uses it effectively at the perfect time when Owen and Abby spend time together.The dialogue and script is good too, particularly the facial expressions McPhee and Moretz make. The special effects of when you see Abby's face contorted when she eats is brilliant as it is terrifying. Also it is beautifully shot with some interesting camera shots. For example we never see Owen's mother's face, which I don't know if anyone else noticed was intriguing. It certainly got me thinking that even with his mum, Owen feels truly alone and the (whether intentional or not) never seeing his mum's face could depict the further isolation he also feels from his own family and that she isn't really there in Owen's world as it's just him and Abby. Matt Reeves has to be commended for a stupendous achievement of making a film that is beautifully made and can connect with the audience on a emotional level. I first saw Chloe Moretz acting in (500) Days of Summer and Kick-ass. She was terrific in that and she has grown since then and is turning into a superb and mature young actress. Kodi Smit-McPhee from The Road, which I saw him in earlier this year I found to be an engaging young actor, with lots of potential and it's lovely to see him continue to fulfil that. This connected to me on every level and has become one of my favourite movies of this year and though it may not receive Oscars, it certainly deserves to be nominated. I am very pleased with the IMDb rating on here. Let Me In has a powerful resonant that radiates to it's audience, I'm glad I let this film in. Absolutely incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film two weeks ago with my Mum (who loves horror films just as much as me) and although we went expecting to be frightened, we were entertained much more than with a few scares. We were however, shocked that we were the only ones in the cinema and for this reason did not expect the film to be as good as it turned out to be! Having seen the original (Let The Right One In) 18 months ago, I was more impressed with the 2010 remake (which doesn't happen often!) The two main characters Owen and Abbey draw you into the story and into their lives. Owen, a 12 year old boy who has no friends, an alcoholic mother and is being bullied at school and Abbey, a young vampire girl who relies on her keeper to feed her. Also a loner, Abbey befriends Owen and later in the film we learn that he will replace her current keeper (Richard Jenkins). Unlike usual horror films, Let Me In shows the reasoning behind the villains motives and similarly to We Are What We Are, the audience is intrigue by the killer and are let encouraging their behaviour. Unlike We Are What We Are, Let Me In is much more than a horror film, its a story of friendship, teenage anxieties and family break ups and for this reason I give the film 10/10. A highly recommendable, enjoyable, believable portrait of Vampire life (if there were such thing) which is acted and directed faultlessly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection from a personal connection.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Wikipedia: Acclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote "Let Me In is a genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last 20 years." Personally, how can I top the master writer himself with my own praise? This is the best horror film I have seen since "The Shining." The relationship between Owen and Abby was beautiful and complex, and was masterfully done by the two young actors. So masterful for their age I was immersed immediately! The story was superb and their chemistry was perfection. The acting by Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas was spot on and authentic, as could be expected and cannot be overlooked. The cinematography and musical soundtrack were a perfect combination to create atmosphere and feeling. The orchestral music furthered the intensity and seriousness of Abby's need to feed, and protect, but the classic rock tunes from the era echoed the universal teenage experience of social rebellion and awkward sexual curiosity. I was personally further drawn in because of being bullied at that same age, with no friends to rely on. The solitude and emotional pain are immense. I could only dream as most?of having an mature and loyal friend like Abbey to help me through that tough time..The strength that Abby provides, and ultimately uses to rid this problem for Owen is enormous and addictive. (much like this film!) Thus it is easy to see why he would leave with her immediately and forgo the average life. I am addicted to this beautiful work. Very few things inspire or move me anymore. But this film captures a powerful moment in the human condition even with it's fictional elements. Though a realist, I am currently in fantasia. Though cynical, I am currently inspired by greatness. In a time when horror films pretty much suck, It was a privilege to see this masterfully done work of art.</fullReview>

Before I go into the film itself I have to comment that this is a re-make of a Swedish film called "Let The Right One In" from 2008 and both films come from the novel of the same name by Swedish author Tomas Alfredson.The film itself is a masterpiece and hats off to director Matt Reeves for brilliant work on what was a difficult task re-making an already loved film for American audiences (and all those who don't like subtitles). The film is shot in the eerie Los Alamos, New Mexico snow, mostly at night time and it is truly gorgeous and the dark, cold land gives a real genuine vibe to the tale and you feel Owen's despair .The story itself centers on Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who is a twelve year old child whose parents are going through a divorce and is a victim of bullying, he lives with his mother and is dangerously isolated and becoming slightly weird. All his problems are answered when the amazing Abby (Chloë Moretz) moves into the apartment next door. She is a self assured twelve year old who helps Owen overcome his bullying problems, gives him someone to love and their friendship blossoms.However all is not right with Abby who is played by the highly capable Chloë Moretz, (Hit Girl in Kickass) her performance is remarkable and the chemistry with her and Kodi Smit is all the more special when you take into account they are only children. You feel every touch, you love every second Abby and Owen are together their bond is beautiful yet you know all is not well. Abby is a vampire, she "needs blood to live" and she will do anything to get it, indeed even jump on an innocent persons back as they go for a nice jog and feast on their blood. Yes there are plenty of shock moments in this film it is scary but its more than that.Like Owen we (the audience) has to see past the fact Abby is a vampire and become immersed in this special and beautiful friendship and we do; thanks to the performances of both Kodi and Chloë, that are nothing short of brilliant, and long may they succeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best vampire film since Bigelow's NEAR DARK; one of the year's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LET ME IN (2010) **** Chloe Moretz, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Richard Jenkins, Cara Buono, Elias Koteas, Dylan Minnette. Eerie and excellent Hollywood remake to the Swedish import vampire film "Let The Right One In" scores on all points particularly the smart casting of Smit-McPhee and Moretz (both stars on the rise, justly so) as (respectively) a put-upon tween whose life changes in more ways than one when his new neighbor, a pale barefoot girl, moves in his apartment complex with her dubious guardian (Jenkins in fine low-key form), resulting in a sinister yet romantic kinship. Director Matt Reeves builds up enough suspense, tension and lets the blood flow copiously with élan in this, the finest vampire film since Kathryn Bigelow's "NEAR DARK". The poignant puppy-love story and dark underpinnings of the undead and the living attempting to bond is both heart breaking and fear inducing. One of the year's best films (NOTE: Although I didn't see the original foreign film I'm sure it's a worthy adaptation).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK So Let the Right One In is one of my favorite films so when I heard they were going to Americanize it, I knew one thing for sure, I'd be obligated to see it just to compare it to the brilliant original.So here we are a year or so later and after seeing this movie all I can say is I was completely blown away! This movie is as good if not better than the Swedish original and it's my job to tell everyone why...This movie is almost exactly the same as the Swedish original except it has some more terror and fear then the almost non-frightening original. The two movies are so close that I knew exactly what dialogue was coming next... Kinda like Will Smith in I Am Legend. Now it's one thing to copy scenes and another to have the top notch acting to go along with it. Well I can honestly say the two leads completely nail their parts to the point where you stop believing it is a vampire movie and an actual story of friendship and courage.Matt Reeves succeeded at what many failed to do... make a fantastic sequel up to par with the original, not to mention a good horror movie. I firmly believe this film will be overlooked when Oscar time comes because of it being a box office flop. This is a shame that this masterpiece has been overlooked by so many people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The factors that make Let Me In stand out from other films is its sincerity and honesty. I have not seen a movie this sincere in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is a remake of the Swedish film Let The Right One In. I made it a point to watch the original before trekking off to the theater to see the remake. I was quite surprised at how much the American remake held true to the general feel of the first film without watering down the contents.The original has more mature and dark undertones while the newer version is more "cute".The factors that make Let Me In stand out from other films is its sincerity and honesty. I have not seen a movie this sincere in a long time. The movie is classified as a Drama/Fantasy/Horror/Romance. It does cover all those genres, but with no emphasis on any specific one. The film takes upon all these segments ever so delicately. They are also portrayed deliberately enough so that you pay attention throughout the entirety of the piece.It is a very sweet and sincere film with dark notes. I definitely recommend this film to any of my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent remake - a pleasure to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am in a strange position reviewing this film, as I had already watched the first 30 minutes of the original movie, but hadn't finished it. So on the one hand I was comparing the two movies and was really interested to see what the whole story had to offer. First of all, an excellent story from the Swedish? author. As a novelist who has written his own supernatural thriller, I feel somewhat humbled that my story is a bit clichéd, this one most certainly wasn't. The romance between awkward schoolboy and undead vampire was masterful. The acting from the two young main leads was quite superb and I am sure are two future stars in the making. The direction by Matt Reeves was superlative, keeping the same pace as the original. Now that I have seen this, I will have to go back and finish the original movie as well. I don't want to ruin the story for others out there, but the ending of the film was quite simply mind blowing, and one wonders how far back in time our young lady has been finding and making friends with impressionable young men. I could feel some people in the audience were a bit fidgety with this movie because it is not a typical horror movie, rather it is a multi-layered social documentary on isolation and friendship, on being different and being alone in a crowd. The only reason I didn't give this a 10 was the dislike for so many reviewers on this website who give out tens to the most banal movies. Minus two points if you don't like vampires and it still gets a 7/10! A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming from a hard core fan of the original...Let Me In is Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both Let the Right One in and Let Me In are both masterful bites on the vampire genre and cinema alone. With both films I felt the exact same sensation. It was a mixture of every adolescent feeling I had endured throughout my life. For me its beyond a movie going experience, it's being absorbed into a thing of beauty and art. This is when you know you are being wrapped up into something that will forever leave an impression on you.If your not familiar with the original's story, which is kept essentially as the exact same thing in Let Me In, tells the story of a lonely pre- pubescent boy whom is an extreme outsider of anything relatively well, that has to do with life. This connection he can't make is due to the hindrance from the lonely home life being endured from a divorce mother and bullies at school. The boy evokes every attribute of innocence, something that is trying to be corrupted against his will thus the loneliness. All is cold and somewhat hopeless until a mysterious young girl who is the same age as Owen moves into the same apartment complex. After nights of awkward mingling on the freezing, iced over playground belonging to the apartment complex, Owen and the mysterious Abby who only comes out at night barefoot, finally make an immediate intimate connection. Oh yes, did I forget to mention that Abby is a vampire? From there the film spirals into the emotions of lost childhood, innocence, beauty, regretful violence, and every intimate emotion that has been dealt with in life.What has made this story so great from the start is that its a tale of emotion, and not horror. But more importantly the horror of our confused emotions as children. We have all felt this and we can all connect to it. The story of Let Me in is constructed beautifully by Matt Reeves' chilling directing. Some shots evoke a mirror image of the original thus showing his infinite amount of respect for the original. Yet Reeves adds enough of his own talent to make it his own vision. There is one scene in which I won't spoil that is probably one of the most well constructed scenes I have seen in quite some time. Reeves knows how to direct quite moments of loneliness, and pulse pounding action scenes. The best addition to the directing is the tone of the film. When you watch it, you feel cold, and you feel as if your in New Mexico with the characters.All the acting in the film is sensational rivaling they're Sweedish counterparts. Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit Mcphee are flat out THE BEST child actors alive. Kodi as Owen portrays the feeling of lost innocence with spot on portrayal. Although Chloe as Abby isn't physically as menacing as her Sweedish counterpart, she plays the role with the right amount of anger, and the look of a lost soul. Watching these two characters interact is a true privilege.If there are any problems with the film, its with the Richard Jenkins character which is Abby's caretaker who drains his victim's blood for Abby to feed off. The problem I had with this version of the character juxtapose to the original's is that the character's back story is kept completely ambiguous in the original. In Let Me In there is sort of a hint as to who he was at one time. This felt as if the filmmakers were depriving the audience of letting us use our imagination. This isn't to say Richard Jenkins gave a bad performance though. He is actually quite good as this character.With one subjective criticism aside, Let Me In is truly a remarkable film. A film that doesn't come around too often. Its something that you make an actual intimate connection to. After its viewing you feel as if you have relived your journey of growing out of adolescence. Something we all miss right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reeves has done it. Saw this at Fantastic Fest with director and cast present and I have to say I was very impressed. The acting is great as my heart went out to Kodi's character Owen. I honestly wanted to jump into the screen and make the cruelty stop. It was heartbreaking. Chloe is a wonderful actress and she portrays Abby very well. I wanted a bit more from that character but it is good. The scenes together are very good and sweet. Jenkins who plays the caregiver is very very good. His portrayal is a very real and creepy take. His means of attaining victims was chilling. His character climax is great, my jaw dropped.Reeves does a wonderful job with cinematography and I loved the setting. I have been eagerly awaiting this movie and I was not disappointed. If you have seen the original you still haven't seen Let Me In.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightning strike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the original, it was with much trepidation when I read that it was going Hollywood. Too many examples of bad remakes exist to bother naming them. Then again, lightning occasionally hits the target, too. Matt Reeves' remake is a lightning strike! While there are minor changes, there are fewer thematically or otherwise than in, for example, critical successes like Harry Potter or LOTR. So the real question becomes: does it succeed in creating its own reality? Happily the answer is a resounding YES! There's little purpose served in hair-wringing comparing it to the original. Better to enjoy two artfully-crafted versions of the story, each with their own unique merits. Take note filmmakers - this is how to remake a foreign-language movie into an English-language one. Like a great singer who covers another artist's definitive song, it does no disservice to the original when it's newly owned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that really is as good as the original (if not slightly better).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its reassuring to say the least that while highly renown, yet highly divided vampire films (Twilike or a Twifright) can leave an irritable stain on media, the lesser known films can have more humanity, pungency and raw emotion that the tips of the latter could scarcely touch. The cult clamped Swedish horror: Let The Right One In was sadly still in the airbrushed shadow cast from it fellow vampire films, despite being a remarkable exception that hadn't drowned in its own neck pierced blood.So while the remake may have sparked frustrating and insensitive glares from the lovers of the original, Matt Reeves has faithfully and delicately delivered a worthy successor that too many remakes have made of a bad name of doing. This bend in the rule is like Cloverfield's deliberate use of shaky, amateur camera, which was either tirelessly memorable or sickly forgettable. Let Me In is just the same. A point-blank refusal to even look at the trailer ticks the forgettable box, while enjoying, or even admitting it's as good as the original ticks the other. In several small but noticeable footsteps it actually goes as far as slightly improving on the Swedish version, but we'll let that point settle in before it's resurfaced and explained.For Kodi Smit-McPhee's character Owen, things are as tough and lonely as they were earlier in the year when he was in The Road, and as for Chloe Moretz, she Kick's Ass in a very different way than when she was Hit Girl. Bullied Owen and Abbey first meet when she moves in next door, and their relationship begins to form one of great envy. Both being only twelve, the awkward overused issue of sex isn't on the playing court; their friendship is consoling each other with company of the other and finding comfort and understanding. A children's story with adult themes if you like.Moretz and Smit-McPhee handle the awkward, defensive first meet with maturity and talent, more so than with the actors who played Oskcar and Eli. This makes their relationship throughout have more depth and meaning, so when it's good you smile and when it's bad you worry. This is something you rarely feel in a remake because the characters would have their paths so clearly outlined through a parallel plot of the predecessor, there's a lack of effort to care when you know what will happen. Not with Let Me In. The special effects are also an improvement on the original. The fits of hunger Eli had are nothing compared to the bone snapping aerobic attacks of Abbey, not to mention the welcoming departure of the original's hissing cats that boasted bad B-movie effects rather than successful cult Swedish horror.But if anyone, deserves the most limelight for such a fantastic remake Reeves should be bestowed that honour. His scripting and artful direction doesn't feel the need to go full Hollywood (which was also his method for Cloverfield) and glamorise every little blip of action - for example the shot inside the car crashing. It's this faithfulness not to stray too far from the original's rigorous control but take risks that don't push the boundaries, which make this masterpiece as being every bit impressive it's original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly disturbing film will hang with you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supposedly based upon a true incident, as all "good" ghost stories are, this is the story of what happens when several people seek to remake a beloved modern classsic. It seems that a bullied young boy befriends a young female vampire who lives in secrecy with her guardian, a quest which opens up many doors that should remained closed. What happens from there will shake them, and the audience.This is a good, quietly disturbing horror film. It's a film that relies on mood and lighting and half caught images to slowly build the tension. When was the last film that sent chills up and down your spine with just the sound of a creak? Or a lot of creaks? This is a film that is mostly free of fancy special effects. The vampires we see are decidedly low tech, but they are effective. They are glimpsed on the edges of the frame in the background, and occasionally right in front of one of out protagonists. It all helps to build to a real sense of unease. I don't know when I was left feeling this uneasy. Certainly I don't know when a film invaded my dreams and had me dreaming of ghosts all night. This is not a film of scares and screams, there are a few jumps and starts, but mostly this is a film of slowly building dread that never is fully dissipated.Its not a perfect film. It's a film that has a great deal going on that isn't said. Things are implied between characters. The narrative kind of wanders and moves with a dream logic that seems to leave things out. It builds tension but also a bit of confusion. I kept feeling I was missing something. The films ending, which I'm sure was truly terrifying in a theaters, works less well on home video. Its still bothered me, but not as much as it would have had I been in a theater.Over all this was a pleasant surprise for me. Normally I'm up and down with Swedish horror remakes, finding them either truly scary or more times than not dull and boring. This was neither dull nor boring. This was a more than slightly unnerving experience. Definitely worth a look, especially if you're curled up in a dark room on a stormy night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Kick Ass's Chloe Moretz don't go in expecting "Hit Girl does Dracula". Moretz is great, but in a totally different way. She's sad, creepy, and downright scary.I enjoyed the entire cast, Kodi Smit-McPhee was also very good as Abby's human "friend". Richard Jenkins didn't have as much screen time as I thought he would but was good as usual.Some great cinematography throughout too. One in particular was a car crash done from an unusual perspective. Also some effective use of music in several scenes.This kind of vampire situation is one that I've wondered about since seeing Interview with a Vampire. The "child vampire" is a story left unexplored for the most part. Let Me In gets into what that would be like and still lets you use your imagination...a good balance between the two.Abby does not have a good life. There is nothing cool about it and she doesn't get to sparkle in the sun or wear goth outfits to school. As you would imagine, she is a lonely creature who does long for companionship and seems to need caring for. She's an "old soul" obviously (we are never told exactly how old) but seems to have retained quite a bit of her childlike needs. We are repulsed by her at times and feel great sympathy for her at other times. Several moments will tug at your heartstrings. The simple act of eating a piece of candy or a tentative attempt at human contact. The end is a bittersweet resolution. A kind of "the cycle continues" type thing. You can see the whole thing playing out again years into the future (which would be today).Understandable that fans of the original would be upset about this one but some are determined to hate it. They seem to forget the original movie was based on someone else's work as well. But this really is a great movie and the story deserves to be seen by English audiences. Like every society on earth, English speaking audiences are going to enjoy a movie made in their own language more than a dubbed or sub-titled one. I have no problem with sub-titles myself, but I don't see why it's a sin to not like them. I wonder if Indian movie watchers are made to feel guilty if they don't like English movies with sub-titles? The original wasn't a hit, so at least a few more people will see this great story. Reeves also changes quite a few things about the story...some are major changes which I feel improve upon the original. (The Caretaker is completely different)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece, rivals the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the Swedish film "Let the Right One In" (In my top 10 favorite films of all time), I was excited to find out about the American remake, but also worried. I however did have faith in it. Owen is a 12 year old boy who is constantly bullied in school and lives with his over protective religious mother. Then along comes Abby, the new 12 year old next door neighbor. The performances by Kodi Smit-Mcphee and Chloe Grace Moretz were absolutely astounding. These two slowly start to form a bond throughout the film, until something strange about Abby starts to show up. She is a vampire who has her current guardian out murdering people and bringing back blood for her to feed upon. Although the film has its gruesome moments it is not a horror film, it is a love story between two children and the forming of their bond. The films directing was beautiful, Matt Reeves, director of Cloverfield really had some great shots in this film, (I.E. when the nurse in the hospital looks for Abby outside). The film shows true dedication between two children and how although both kids are a little messed up, they are perfect for each other. The only complaints I really had about this film was how Abby looked when she was feeding on blood, she looked very grainy and exorcist-ish, I didn't find it necessary but I did not dwell on it at all. For people who feel as if an American remake is not necessary, go watch it. "Let Me In" is a beautiful story that deserves to be given a chance. I'm also not afraid to say that it rivals the original. Great acting, great directing, and just truly, truly, truly a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An even better remake than I had expected.I never thought I'd find a favourite film after seeing hundreds and hundreds of films from every genre but one day I did. I never expected and never even thought that my favourite film would turn out to be based on a book, based on a foreign book and the film be a foreign film. "Let the Right One In" is my favourite film.I never thought a remake could be as good. I always knew this film was going to be good because of it's casting actually casting good actors instead of actors who are just in the film to bring fans in. The director couldn't have been a better choice and what was even better was that he wrote the screenplay to the film too.This is a complete surprise. Let the Right One In is what Twilight should have been if Stephanie Meyer and the writers of the films actually thought out a good story. Let Me In is also what Twilight should be, Let Me In puts shame on Twilight.The acting in this film is wonderful, I actually found the film more emotional than the original (a remake more emotional than the original?). The film was also more scary and surprisingly it has really good scares.In fact there is just absolute wonder with this film. Inception is an original film therefore Hollywood will want more original films, Let Me In is a good remake so hopefully any remake now WILL be good.The music is good, I liked it although even though I know who the composer is I can still tell it's him by his style. I can hear some cues that he has used before in some other films and TV shows. 7/10 The directing is really good, good effort. 8/10 The acting is extremely good, although not as good as I thought it would be but still really good. 8/10 The script. One word - wow. 8/10 Casting, production design, costumes - 9/10 Scares, thrills, emotions - 10/10 Captures the spirit of the book and original film - 10/10 This is a film that is extremely true to the original and if you don't like remakes and can't stand the idea of this remake of your beloved film then you should be shamed. GO and watch this film when it's released properly. I will be going to my local cinema to see it instead of travelling miles and miles to another film festival.But if your a fan of the original or not, then still go and see this film. If you hate Twilight for spoiling vampires then see this film, if you hate remakes but occasionally give them a chance SEE THIS FILM.I think when I re-watch the film I will probably enjoy it more and my rating will go up higher and I'll probably up date this review.This film is a breath takingly emotional, beautiful, scary and actually the best remake ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most faithful adaptation out there...but still provides something new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Let The Right One In" first came out, I ignored it because I disliked the whole vampire trend with Twilight. Finally, two years later I decided to watch it and was amazed by it...simply to see a trailer for Let Me In come on television. My emotions were polarized, I disliked the thought of remaking a recent and amazing film, but at the same time I was curious. I think many others will love or hate this film in relation to the first...I consider the first about a 10, and Let Me In about a 9.6 (I rounded up).Overall, I liked the style of this film. It was obvious that those who made it had seen and liked the original and were going for an "American Version" as opposed to a reboot or conventional remake. Many of the scenes play out the same, but just at different angles and with slight changes. For instance, the grand ending is in tact...but plays out in a different manner that references the first. Many details are kept in place, such as the progression of Eli/Abby's entering a room without invitation and the said effect. The original screenplay is followed for the most part, little was removed and some bits were added. The context of one death scene is changed, but in a way that is both entertaining and faithful to the plot.The score itself does not feel American, aside from some song selections, which actually fit into the movie under the context of scenes (I apologize for the vagueness, I'm avoiding spoilers). The fact of the matter is that I enjoyed this film almost as much as the original, and any surprises that came about were fitting and interesting. Even though I knew the whole plot, the movie played out just a little differently throughout, allowing me to actually pay attention and be entertained. Here's a breakdown.Pros: Faithful, well filmed, great cast and soundtrack. Something newcomers and fans of the original will find intriguing.Cons: Abby's mystical actions are fairly forefront, and the CG used can be mildly distracting.Other factors: Mild actions cause the viewer to further question the character dynamic as to the relationship between Abby and "Father" as well as her and Owen, which may disrupt the way some have the characters positioned in their heads (who she loves and who she may be using). It is not as horrific as some people in the audience anticipated and American audiences may find some of the intimacies between characters to be comical rather than dramatic (references to gender ambiguity, the bed sharing scene, etc.) All in all I highly recommend this film for any who like the original or the blending of horror and drama with a dash of comedy...it's a feel-good horror flick. It saddens me that this bombed at the box office, because it seems to be a grand attempt to bring a wonderful story to an American audience, not a financial leeching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Undead Star-crossed Lover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let Me In" is a breath of fresh air for fans of the vampire-horror genre that are suffocating on the current teenie-bopper "Twilight" trend. The vampire lifestyle is not romanticized or glamorized, with the undead being iconic, aloof, seductive, or misunderstood in the world. A little girl and her father move into a low rent apartment, becoming nameless neighbors, in this instance with the inability to afford shoes. Though presumably this vampire has survived for decades or centuries, she is just a little girl, fumbling through a relationship for the first time. She is not a wizened old soul in the body of a child. She is a child like any other, until her hunger takes control and she becomes something feral. An original, enveloping, American horror movie has not been presented in years. This movie is not an exception (it is a Swedish remake), but it is nice to see something that isn't a remake of a film that is Japanese, or from the 70's. This film is well made and well performed, with a story line new to American audiences, making it definitely worth the ever-inflating price of theater admission.</fullReview>

There are some harsh vamp scene in the movie but then there are Romantic scenes also! you have to rate this movie in all three categories Thriller/Romantic/Drama as it qualifies all three categories. Amazing movie with great climax!! kind a remind you of popular Vampire/Human love stories such as Buffy/Angel and Edward/Bella (twilight) and of-course with gr8 ending!!!!

		<shortDescription>A Vampire film and much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You probably don't want to see this movie unless you like Vampire films with all the blood, gore and death, so they can live another day. But if you like this genre you will get a lot more than just the horror show. It is a very touching story of the coming of age of two 12 year old kids (even if one is 250 years old in a 12 year old's body) which beautifully show the innocence of adolescent awakening. There is a very vivid and painful depiction of bullying by young people which reminds us of the dread that a child who is the victim of it will feel every day. When there is revenge for this type of treatment, you can imagine what a Vampire. can do. The audience also experiences a palpitating anticipation, which is served up in this type of a movie and greatly helped by a music score with appropriate sound effects which reverberates through your body. This is all the work of Matt Reeves, who wrote the screenplay based on the novel Let The Right One In and a Swedish movie by the same name. Reeves who made Cloverfield, was a guest speaker at our screening of this film. He was very clear on what he wanted to achieve, apparently keeping true to parts of the novel, paralleling the European film and writing from some of his own childhood experiences. He used two excellent child actors, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace-Moretz and allowed them to teach him what a 12 year old might feel in these types of situations (of course this required them to rev up their imaginations to the fullest). They really did an outstanding job as did Richard Jenkins who was put in the role of a most evil person and yet the audience almost wanted him succeed in his grim tasks. Be aware that about 20 % of our screening audience which probably didn't know what the subject matter was going to be, walked out on the movie during the first 15-20 minutes. There certainly was no one under 40 in those walkers. If they had stayed until the end they might have appreciated the thoughtful writing, excellent acting and a top notch Vampire film.(2010)**** Filmrap.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In improves on the original in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is an improvement on the Swedish version (original) in my opinion. Everything in this movie is top notch, the cinematography, the acting and the sheer creativity from things such as cutting away to another shot just before something violent happens. Those little details really help this movie come alive. The only problem i had with it was the CGI elements, they are a little wonky here and there but they don't take away from the cinematic experience. You really feel for these characters, Abby and Owen, and that makes the climax so much more memorable. Also the soundtrack stands out as it adds a suspenseful and creepy mood where needed and gives a sincere gentle mood on the other side. The one thing I think some people will have problems with is the removal of some scenes that were in the original and the some what identical scenes that were only slightly changed in this new version. I myself had no problem as this was the version I saw first. After seeing the original I felt it actually benefited Let Me in as this created more character development in the two main characters since it focused more on them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love at First Bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years ago, nobody would have thought that vampire love may be romantic. Now, it seems as though that is the only way people can picture vampire love. Sookie frequently gets ravaged by Bill on True Blood. Bella is evermore loyal to Edward in Twilight. Along came a spider called Let the Right One In, a charming and disturbing Swedish film that was about adolescence and love infused with a little vampire horror. It was a film that was said to be perfect in many ways. And then it was remade as Let Me In and in a surprising turn of events, it worked very well. Let Me In is almost as good as Let the Right One In. Matt Reeves has masterfully matched the tone and cinematography of the Swedish film and tweaked it a little bit to make it his own. Some of the best performances of the year so far are in this film and Michael Giacchino's score shines in a subtle and beautiful way. The few plot changes are inoffensive and the writing is well done.Let Me In is not what it seems to be. It is a case of poor advertising in which it so frequently portrays the film as an in-your-face horror movie. Let Me In is actually a rather tender tale of boy meets vampire. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a twelve year-old who is constantly bullied at school. One night, Owen meets a strange, but friendly girl who moves in next door. She is twelve (more or less) and appears perfectly normal. Her name is Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz). One problem: she is a vampire. The film beautifully examines pre-pubescent love. It is only a horror movie sometimes, but most of the time, Let Me In is a drama and romance.Matt Reeves, who previously directed the cinema verite horror film Cloverfield, slows it down a lot with this film. He has reproduced the tone of the Swedish film quite nicely through color palettes and cinematography. The film is often subtle and solemn, except for in the gory scenes, which nicely contrast with the rest of the film. The score from Michael Giacchino, who has also composed the scores for Lost and Up, matches the tone of the film. At one moment, the score can be sad and sweet, while in the next moment, it can be loud and booming. What is most interesting is the switch between the two moods, which is equally as subtle as some of the action and chemistry that goes on between Abby and Owen.Reeves has also done a very nice job with the actors involved in this film. Chloe Grace Moretz, who plays her role with equal maturity as she did for Hit Girl in Kick-Ass, is worthy of an Oscar again for playing Abby. She makes the viewer, as well as Owen, feel so emotionally distant simply through facial expressions and simple mannerisms. Kodi Smit-McPhee does a fantastic job as Owen. Never once was there a time when the audience did not feel sorry for his character.It is very possible that Let Me In is the best remake to date. Nobody would have ever predicted that someone could reproduce Let the Right One In in a way that was original and faithful at the same time. It may not be the horror movie that the studio was advertising, but it certainly is a movie that is worth watching. Matt Reeves, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Kodi Smit-McPhee are names that people should keep an eye on. We'll see a lot more of them in the future. As for Michael Giacchino, he has got some tough competition from Hans Zimmer for the Best Original Score Oscar, but he definitely deserves it.People may criticize Let Me In for being too much of a direct copy of Let the Right One In, but honestly, a good movie came out of it, so who cares? Besides, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rivals the original... certainly an adaptation worthy of the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say I was extremely reluctant at the thought of an American version of the beautifully haunting 'Let The Right One' In would be an understatement. But after seeing it's TIFF premiere I'm happy to report that Matt Reeves has knocked it out of the park! 'Let Me In' is incredible... dare I say just as good as 'Let The Right One In'.It is truly hard to believe that a flawless adaptation -- it's based on the book: thus not a remake -- of this great story could be done this well twice. But the level of skill on every point is beyond compare.Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz are simply captivating. The cinematography is gorgeous. Michael Giacchino's score is gripping. And Matt Reeves simply gets it. He understands that this is a coming of age story of two lost and isolated children and he hits every note perfectly.For those who love 'Let The Right One In' (like myself) fear not. This film will only make you appreciate more the story both films are based on. And for those reluctant to watch a Swedish horror film, know that you can watch 'Let Me In' and not miss a bit of the story. Certainly there are some different artistic choices. But the story is the same and it is the story that is the important part.This is one of the best film stories to come around in years. And since Reeves faithfully sticks to the story it means a new audience who may not have watched the subtitled original will get a chance to take it in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just goes to show that remakes can cut the mustard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am ashamed to say I have not yet seen the original Swedish version of this movie although it is on my list of to do's for the very near future especially after seeing the Hollywood remake which is in one hyphenated word.; Jaw-dropping.From the very first frames it captivates you with every cinematic tool available. The scary bits are very scary, the photography stunning and the acting beyond description for a cast starring two 12(ish) year olds. But then Kodi Smit McPhee has previous starring as "the boy" in The Road, another mature and beautiful performance. One wonders just how far he can go on the basis of these two Oscar quality performances. Abby, the vampire is played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely stunned in Kick Ass as Hit Girl.It's billed as a horror movie but it's actually a love story and a very moving one at that. The quietness and intensity of the young couple's illicit (in so many ways) relationship is at the core of the movie and their shared screen time are the real beating pulse of the movie. You will not see a better and more intimate love story this year.Matt Reeves, as director, is surely one of the most promising Hollywood talents out there. His previous film, Cloverfield, is one of the most underrated films I've ever seen. Why is it not considered amongst the best aliens movie ever made? Anyway, you can be sure, that after this he will be moving onto the A list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampire movies should be more like this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Reeves, who is most famous for his monster film "Cloverfield", took on the task of adapting and directing this film. Two years ago, film festivals were in love with the Swedish Horror film "Let the Right One In" and it was almost a given that it was needed to be made American. In our culture vampires have kind of turned into more of romantic figures and a lot of times represent sexuality. This film goes back to basics and makes this vampire what I think they are sup post to be, which is completely scary and messed up. What is very impressive is that Reeves takes this and in a way, his changes actually enhance the story and kind of makes it better and more entertaining. Kodi Smith-McPhee who was spectacular in last year's "The Road" and Chloe Moretz who received most of her fame as Hit-Girl in this year's "Kick-Ass" carry this film and both of these kids bring a type of eeriness; these kids both knew exactly how their characters were sup post to be and they hit it spot on. This gory, terrifying, and dark film turns into some type of odd entertainment and represents why people would even want to see a horror film; it has a strong story and an even stronger scare. Instead of going over the top Reeves bends this movie into a tension roller-coaster more than anything. Very rarely can a foreign film be successfully adapted and made a success in America, but Reeves made something that can stand a distance from the original, but still he true to its origin. It is a great movie for the Halloween season, it will most likely refresh people who are used to "American Vampires" and give them a real vampire movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Once A Superb Hollywood Translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YESSSS! Hammer Films are back! Not the 70s-style Benny Hill horrors with cheesy sets and plenty of female flesh, but a thoughtful, intelligent and well-realised update of the Swedish vampire movie Let The Right One In. I enjoyed the original while thinking it a bit overpraised; and I was very pleased with this Hollywood remake, which contains much of the same story but is certainly not a shot for shot clone. Writer/Director Matt Reeves has done a fine job of bringing the story to English-speaking audiences.The movie concerns a bullied 12 year-old - here called Owen, Oskar in the original - and his friendship with new arrival on the block Abby. This vampire tale has been transplanted from the original Swedish location to Los Alamos but contains a similar bleakness. Owen's mother is wrapped up in religion, his father has left and is undertaking divorce proceedings; and on top of that Owen has to deal with 3 sadistic school bullies (the leader of which looks uncannily like a young Brian Wilson!) Owen soon realises that Abby is strange and different, and is drawn to her; the two quickly become fast friends. But there is a punchline...for Abby, you see, is a vampire.This is not a Twilight-style story, but a mature examination of childhood loneliness and horror, and it packs a hell of a punch. The gore content is upped slightly from the original, and although there are shocks they are well-paced and not just thrown at the viewer. I actually thought the acting was better in this version than the Swedish film. There are some changes, including the central revelation being removed from the film altogether - it's just hinted that Abby is not er, all there physically.This is a great little movie. Hammer may never be the same as they were in the old Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee days, but what a come back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, the real awkward teen falls for vampire story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let Me In", set in 1983, tells the woeful story of Owen (Kodi Smith-Mcphee) who is not exactly living the dream of adolescence. In addition to being thin, awkward and bullied, his fractured home life is anything but a refuge. Into his life comes new neighbors who will change everything. An older man and young girl move next door to Owen and he can easily eavesdrop on them from his bedroom. Owen soon makes friends with the young girl, Abby (Chloe Moretz) and almost instantly senses a soul mate. At first she is presented as timid, insecure and possibly neglected. The story moves pretty quickly and doesn't really try to hide that Chloe is actually a vampire, older than she appears and as much vicious killer as timid perpetual adolescent. There, now we've done the set up; so let's dissect this movie. The atmosphere in "Let Me In" is stark and never lets you rest from the sense of foreboding and that is exactly as it should be in this type of movie. I commend the director for keeping the gore and blood at a level that satisfies without turning off the viewer. He replaces some of the visuals for sound. Just know, when Abby feeds her need, you will have no doubt what is happening even though it may be shot in the shadows or off camera. The acting is good all around but success rests on the four characters who take up a majority of the screen time. I am in awe of Kodi Smith-Mcphee's portrayal of Owen. I instantly connected with the character and Mcphee's ability to play both the hopelessness and rage of a victim. His bullying at school is the most humiliating sort and is lead by a student who I will describe as a sadistic, future closet-case who is pretty scary despite having Justin Bieber hair. Chloe Moretz would really surprise at this point if she failed to deliver an excellent performance. You will, I think, also be blown away by how she conveys tenderness toward Owen at one moment and animalistic need for blood the next. Richard Jenkins, a chameleon like actor who can play both the silliest of comedy and the tautest of drama, plays Abby's shadowy protector who has obviously sacrificed his life to feed her endless appetite and protect her from the consequences. Owen's mother is played by Cara Bouno and don't worry if you don't recognize her. She is excellently shot the entire movie out of focus with a glass of wine in hand or nearby in a way that clearly says the parents are unimportant in this story.I'll close by saying that "Let Me In" is a dark, delicious Halloween treat that I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sexy Little "Kick Ass" Vampire Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cloverfield" director Matt Reeves does a very good job of remaking the superb Swedish vampire saga "Let the Right One In." Reeves adds more gore in his effort to Americanize this chilling little tale about a 12-year vampire girl who helps out a shy 12-year old boy who suffers humiliation at the hands of bullies in his New Mexican junior high school."Let Me In" qualifies as a creepy, eerie, little exercise in suspense and terror, and Reeves keeps about 90 per cent of everything that Swedish director Tomas Alfredson had in the original. The differences between the films is minimal. The nude scene in the original is conspicuously absent here because it would constitute simulated child pornography. Similarly, the scene where the cats freaked out and attacked the adult vampire is missing, too. Presumably, Reeves must have felt that such a scene might have induced hilarity rather than horror. Nevertheless, the ending to the Reeves' remake differs significantly. "Kiss Ass" actress Chloe Moretz makes a fantastic little vampire. Her performance is very modulated. Mind you, we never see her bare fangs. However, direct exposure to sunlight will singe her skin and the skin of any vampire. There are no scenes where she casts a reflection. The seldom used dictate about vampires is referred to in the title. Our protagonist has to invite the vampire girl to cross the threshold or she will start bleeding from the face under such an invitation comes forth. No, the little vampire doesn't assume different animal shapes, such as either a wolf or a bat, but she spends most of her time wandering around the snow-swept terrain in her bare feet because cold weather doesn't bother her. Her eyes turn a feral yellow when she goes into feast mode. Our bullied hero is dazzled by her, and Kodi Smit-McPhee and Moretz kindle some genuine romantic chemistry that is as sincere as it is believable. Amid all this horror lies the real horror. The protagonist dodges three heartless ruffians that take advantage of him and impugn his masculinity by calling him a little girl. "Let Me In" emerges a fantasy of revenge, and the adolescent bullies provide strong villainy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let it be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just got out of a preview screening of this movie (UK viewer) and it is the first time i have left the cinema with a smile on my face in years. It was a brilliant remake of the Swedish original, and although it takes the structure and the characters from the original, it stands on its own as a different take on the story.Critics, including myself, had fingers at the keyboard ready to slaughter this film, and hang it and use it as a hung example as to why Hollywood shouldn't remake foreign films. It is completely the opposite, it has kept the integrity of the first film and focused mostly on the relationship between the vampire and the child, but added much more depth to their characters, and some better more intense than the original.Although it is advertised as a horror film to bring in the masses, it is so much more. There is a lot more blood and guts than the first but not taken out of proportion. And the bond between the protagonist's is beautifully played out, such a bizarre situation made to feel real by two blossoming young actors. Every performance was of great quality.I don't want to spoil the movie, but expect some of the same but something completely different. An intense thriller beautifully shot and worthy of it's original... check it out9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy remake of an excellent original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved "Let Me In" for the same exact reason I loved "Let the Right One In", which I saw in theaters two years ago. And might I add, both of them are what "Twilight" should be. The movie follows Owen, a bullied and shunned twelve-year-old as he befriends the girl, Abby, who lives next door. Things get complicated though, when Abby turns out to be a vampire. Their inability to fit in with society forms a common bond between them, and soon they fall in love. After all of society has cast Owen aside, it's a vampire, a predator, who realizes and understands what a beautiful human being he is, and in turn, Owen sees the inner beauty of Abby, who, mostly by her own doing, has been cast aside as well due to what she is. When they can't have anyone else, they have each other. The thing that I find fascinating about both the Swedish version and this version is also the chemistry between the two kids. Kodi Smit- McPhee and Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl rules!) nail their roles just like Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson did two years ago, by giving us two overlooked individuals we care about and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a highly original and enjoyable vampire tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In stars two young, but extremely talented, actors: Chloe Moritz as Abby and Kodi Smit-McFee (The Road) as Owen. Both give astonishing performances that transcend the usual vampire tale. There are no pale heart throbs here, and yet there is more emotion and character investment than a typical slasher film. This positions Let Me in - a remake of the Swedish film, Let the Right One In - as a highly original and enjoyable vampire tale.This newer film is a haunting and oddly redemptive tale of two children, both lonely, both with secrets. Owen is being bullied and threatened at school and is neglected by both his parents, who are going through a divorce. He steals money from his mother and buys candy and a pen knife which fuels his fantasy of defending himself at school. Abbey has a much older and gruesome secret, one that should be more horrifying than it is, but her well written and superbly acted character makes us care for her, despite her supernatural urges and abilities. (Okay, she drinks blood; nobody's perfect.) The film owes much to its excellent direction by Matt Reeves, (Felicity) as well as its soundtrack and also its sound editing. The classic creepy movie noises ? screeching hinges, slamming doors, gasps of surprise and screams of pain ? come across as pristine and new in this film, whose overall mood is also enhanced by its locale: the stark winter landscape of New Mexico and the courtyard of a sad, low rent apartment building.Reeves also gives much homage in this film to both John Ford and Clint Eastwood as well as Hitchcock. Ford and Eastwood for the carefully constructed shots that border on iconic: of figures in doorways, or shadows highlighted against the winter snow. Hitchcock for the recurring scenes of sudden violence, that while gruesome, also became somewhat rote and thus, more threatening: See how easy it is to kill someone? The inherent suspense of this movie should have been diluted by the fact that the trailer and also the early available information on this film both reveal that the haunting and haunted young girl, Abbey, is a vampire. And yet, even with that information in hand, we are surprised by how much we like her, and begin to understand the awkward, deeply emotional relationship that develops gradually between the two children, who find a bond in their mutual isolation and outcast status. Like Owen, we are aware of the violence that Abbey represents but against our own good judgment, (and all that blood) we will feel ourselves liking her and rooting for a good (if not happy) ending. (This review won't spoil the ending for you other than to say it is both expected and unexpected.) A strong supporting cast rounds out the film: Dylan Minnette (Saving Grace) plays the despicable school yard bully who is ultimately revealed to be a victim in his own family; Richard Jenkins (The Visitor, Burn After Reading) adroitly plays the tortured older man who many believe to be Abbey's father.Best for viewers who enjoy thrillers. Unlike most slasher films, Let Me In conveyed strong, believable, emotion, pathos, and inevitable empathy for a character who many would not want to meet on a moonless night. But be aware that it also had a lot of blood and gore. Good for older teens and above only. Leave grandma home, but see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that I read the book a week before watching this movie, and watched the Swedish film a few days after seeing it. I found that all three were very different takes on the same tale, each with something very valuable to offer. Lindqvist explored the social context of the tale in far greater detail then either movie - the degenerate society of broken lives and relationships, alcoholism and drug abuse, pedophilia, crime, schoolyard bullying, and vampires. I had a strong feeling that killing people for blood was no worse than what was going down on a daily basis in that society.Alfredson chose to concentrate on the story. A beautiful movie, somewhat detached viewpoint, just watching the story unfold.Reeves, in Let Me In, was all about the relationship between Abby and Owen. The acting by Smit-McPhee and Moretz was outstanding, conveying so much so authentically with body language, expression and tone of voice. The adult actors did a great job too. Visually it was very different from the Swedish film. More moody I guess. As a visual artist I was fascinated by the different artistic decisions the two directors made. While watching the Swedish film I had to sometimes remind myself that it was the same story I had seen a few days earlier, so different were they.I've been watching a lot of Japanase Yakuza movies lately, and have no problem with different movies telling basically the same tale in different ways. For Let Me In the original source material is the experiences that the writer and both directors had of their own childhoods, and all three artistic works are beautiful and powerful reflections on those experiences. I encourage anyone to see Let Me In because it is beautiful and powerful cinema. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that defies the odds and stands tall alongside its foreign predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tomas Alfredson's Let the Right One In was loved by almost everyone who saw it two years ago. No-one was impressed when they heard the news there was going to be a remake ? why would we be? We've become so accustomed to shoddy, dumbed-down versions of films we adore ? especially in the broader horror genre ? that the word "remake" can only be met with a scoff of disgust. I'm ecstatic to report that director Matt Reeves has achieved the impossible. Not only is this American revamp not shoddy or dumbed-down, but it effectively matches the Swedish original in almost every way.Reeves creates an imposingly ominous mood from the very outset. Employing Greig Fraser's sombre cinematography, Reeves washes away any sign of sunshine or brightness which visually encapsulates Owen's life to tremendous effect. The haunting score and intelligent sound design also serve to enhance the gloomy ambiance. Reeves last helmed Cloverfield, a film which was known for its dizzying hand-held camera techniques. Conversely, in Let Me In he frequently ? and wisely ? opts for lingering, static shots that enable the viewer to take in the bigger picture whilst cementing the unnerving atmosphere.The intelligent script (also by Reeves) finds a satisfying balance between staying close to the original and adding new elements where it feels beneficial to the story. As mentioned previously, there's been no simplification of the content to accommodate the lowest common denominator, it remains ambiguous without being pretentious and contemplates many things. It credits the audience with maturity (even though some of the moronic people in the session I attended didn't deserve it) and as such layers the film to allow multiple standpoints.All of the above wouldn't have worked so successfully had it not been for the perfect casting of the two young protagonists. Australian actor Kodi Smit-McPhee evokes our sympathy whole-heartedly without ever having to milk it, his Owen is immediately recognisable and easy to associate with. Chloe Grace Moretz (the awesome Hit Girl from Kick-Ass) nails the wise-beyond-her-years Abby, instilling her with a scary combination of volatility and kindness. Together they share an innocent yet complex chemistry on screen.A remake that defies the odds and stands tall alongside its foreign predecessor.4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In -- Emotionally Wrenching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is an emotionally wrenching film. My opinion/review is for this film, not the original.Hopefully you know that the gist of the movie is about a lonely boy who is bullied at school and then a young girl moves in next door who is a vampire. By emotionally wrenching, I want say how expertly this film made you feel: anger and fury at the bullies, helpless for the boy Owen, sadness at both Owen and Abby's isolation, frustration at Owen's parents, hope for Owen and Abby with their budding friendship, and genuine surprise/horror at the violence of Abby's vampire actions. You will walk out with a lot on your mind after this movie.Definitely NOT your mindless horror/vampire film and as a movie on its own (not compared to the original) it is capable of pulling lots of different emotions. It also definitely had some jump-in-your-seats moments, too.This movie for kids? Definite NO - this is not a sappy romance with pretty actors. It is a dark movie with heavy themes. You need to gauge it appropriately for tweens -- it has some heavy plot lines regarding the kids at school and what Abby&amp;'s father-figure is willing to do for her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to compare this movie to 'Let the Right One In'; The acting is comparable, which is unusual for an American movie. Abby was unbelievably good for an American child actress.The directing was good for its purpose. Reeves made the novel into a horror movie - to him Abby was a monster, the love story was an afterthought. He made the movie to please everyone, there is an excellent horror movie entangled with a fairly convincing love story. I think he was fantastically successful.Let the Right One In is more of a love story - a standard 'freaky awkward girl and weird awkward boy fall in love' with the twist being the girl is actually a vampire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Let Me In", the remake of "Let The Right One In", doesn't just match its Swedish predecessor. It Surpasses it. I don't know how to describe it, but something Great happened in the refresh. It was different from the first in many significant ways but it kept its two main characters at its center. It might be doing better for telling it in such an easily graspable way, giving less screen time to secondary characters. There was nothing I didn't like about it. It had parts of the book the first movie never had, left out parts of the first and the book. It kept itself perfect. Keeping some exact dialogue, changing some, and taking some away. Copied scenes but with a visual twist, changed some entirely. Overall was just great, "Let Me In" was great. I should also mention it deserves its R rating for violence/small gore, some swearing, realistic portrayal of bullying, and you do see a couple start to get intimate and even see the woman's breast early on in the movie. Whatever you are familiar with, the book and or the original Swedish movie(or none), you are likely to be pleased with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I should say that I have watched this film, without seeing the 2008 film, Let The Right One In.I saw this at the cinema last night, because I knew that Chloë Grace Moretz stars in this. But overall, I enjoyed the film regardless.This film is what the filmmakers called 'a re-adaption' of the Swedish novel, Let The Right One In. I have heard about a lot of people who have praised the 2008 Swedish film of the same name, I admit I haven't seen this film, the main reason being... I don't like subtitled films. It's not because I can't be bothered to read them (believe me, I'd be more than happy to, as I enjoy reading), but I feel that if I watch a subtitled film, then I'm reading the subtitles without watching the film. Sorry, but this just doesn't work for me. But I'm sure that this film was great.It is about a twelve-year-old boy called Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who is facing all kinds of trouble in his life. He's bullied at school, his mum and dad are getting divorced and he seems to spend most of his time in his room, spying on his neighbours. One night, he spots a young girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and her 'father' (Richard Jenkins) (who turns out to be some kind of servant) moving in next door and feels immediately drawn to her. They later meet that night and she tells him that her name is Abby. However, she also tells him that they cannot be friends. In time, though, they spend more and more time together and form a great friendship and bond well together.This friendship, however, is put to the test, as a series of gruesome murders take place in Owen's quiet, remote town and Owen finally faces having to accept that his new-found friend could be a vampire.The direction from Matt Reeves was good; the acting in this film I thought was very good. I was particularly impressed with Kodi Smit-McPhee and, of course, Chloë Grace Moretz (who is my favourite actress). I just know that we are going to see these two people for a very long time. Also, amongst quite a few of the adult cast, Richard Jenkins was great, albeit being in the film for a limited time. But, this allowed Kodi and Chloë to shine, which was a good thing. I found the film quite scary and was always leaving in anticipation for what was to come next.Again, I have seen this film without seeing the 2008 film or reading the novel, and because Chloë Grace Moretz was starring in it, but I found this to a great film. I felt it was so great, that I'm sure those that loved the 2008 film, will also love this one. The Chloë and Matt Reeves have both said that this is almost a scene-for-scene remake, but with a few changes, so I highly recommend this film to anyone.Overall, I give this film 9/10, purely because it wasn't an outstanding film, but a great film nonetheless. Plus, it starred Chloë Grace Moretz as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart Person's Vampire Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a classic in every sense. I love the slow buildup...the very-well paced dramatic scenes, the cinematography was absolutely amazing (expecially the car-crash scene...one of the best I've ever seen, IMO rivaling the car attack in The Children Of Men). I also like the fact the movie-makers did not dumb this down with an overpowering score, or unnecessary or over-long plot explanations...the producer expects you to "get it". I got it...but apparently most of the American viewing public did not, due to the fact that this movie did not perform well during it's initial release, which shows that unfortunately the studio did a poor job marketing it (possibly because they didn't think it would perform well? Talk about self-fulfilling prophecy) and/or an American audience that expects action and plot and emotion be handed to them on a silver platter, and spoon-fed to them. Not only is this one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen, it was an enjoyable movie-going experience. It was everything Twilight should-have been and more...mature, disturbing, evocative, and thoughtful. I'd rather belong to Team Abbey any day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still have not seen the original, so went into this hearing people saying this not as good. I found this mostly excellent. The two kids did a great job, the tension was mostly set just right. The slow build-up at start was not remotely tedious. The actual gore is just the right level, not over the top. The only scene for me that didn't seem to live up to the rest of it, was when she attacked the police officer after he crept through the house. Don't know what it was, just for me didn't quite match the other tense scenes in the film. At 2 hours, it was the perfect running time. The bullying scenes were well acted by all. Now I can't wait to see Let The Right One In, if it's even better than this, it will be a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disreguard all of the snobbery over an American remake of, "Let the Right One In". This movie was well made. Its true that much of the reason it is good is that it is largely a scene by scene reshoot of the Swedish film its based on though.The two young leads also acquit themselves just as well as their Swedish counterparts, and this was certainly an excellent vehicle for Chloe Moretz.Of course, the movie does add a car crash scene, so if you're looking for a reason to hate it because its American, that is probably enough for you.There were script subtleties that appeared to make Eli a bit more of a victim herself than Abby, but there is enough ambiguity to drive a hummer through, and that is part of the pleasure of this movie as well as the original: you can project your own ideas into it.The special effects were just enough...maybe even a little over the top. I actually liked the subtlety of the original more in that regard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspired depiction of pure horror, redefining the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Owen and Abby, both 12, are what some kids in a suburban school in Los Alamos, New Mexico, would call "besties" -- close friends. Unknown to them is that the two have just started going steady. They're quite an odd couple, those two. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), undernourished and underweight for his age, has a familiar face, especially to a trio of bullies who hacks on him every chance they get, taunting his girlie looks. But nobody has ever laid eyes on Abby (Chloe Moretz) who's just moved in next door to Owen. She's moody but is otherwise normal, so who'd ever guess that she has been 12 "for a very long time" and that she's in fact a vampire?The pact between Owen and Abby is as simple as the games children play. Their exclusive club has only one rule: If one of them wishes to enter the room of the other, one must ask and wait for a clear answer. A nod, a gesture or an approving look won't do; one has got to say it. Never mind that Abby has special powers which she could use to have her way. She can easily leap from the ground straight up to his room, or smash the window with her wolverine teeth. Indeed, we see her later decapitating a victim in one crunch of the jaw. Can she be trusted?"Let Me In" is a virtual reproduction of the widely acclaimed Swedish 2008 horror drama, "Let the Right One In." The chosen style of the original film's director Thomas Alfredson and the remake's director Matt Reeves is minimalist, a relentless, drip-by-drip account of what happened in a suburb Los Alamos that winter of 1983. Both movies peel the genre to its bare minimum, resulting in an inspired depiction of pure horror and a redefinition of it.Reeves (who also wrote the screenplay) strips the main characters to their bare essentials, to a fault, resulting in a slow-moving first half that is stronger in mood than in plot movement. Owen's character is defined by the sadistic bullying in school, while Abby's is framed by her constant thirst for blood as supply dwindles, and the danger that the law would catch up with her and her guardian.The face of Owen's mother, a devoted but alcoholic Catholic, is studiously kept out of sight, an unnecessary and puzzling tack that could be excused as an attempt to increase the sense of Owen's isolation, shedding light on why he finds comfort in Abby."Let Me In" discards many conventions of vampire films. There's none of the crucifixes, garlic gunk, holy water, mirror phobia and, happily, none of the high-tech dabbling of recent ones. The coffin concept lives on, but in the form of a sinister-looking room that Abby shares with his stepfather (Richard Jenkins). Also kept is the idea of sun rays as a vampire slayer, as well as the vampires' powers of flight and instant mutations.The second half of "Let Me In" operates on the level of horror classics. Carefully paced, the suspense and the shockers pile on to each other and what was a simple storytelling in the first half becomes a fascinating interweaving of story threads. The killings become increasingly bloody, including an attack inside a young man's car and another that takes place in a tunnel (where the split-second decapitation occurs). A body bursting in flames instantaneously is quite a sight, if only in a flash. While busy killing, the vampire morphs into several beasts in a row, now looking vaguely like a wolf, and in a wink shifting into the contour of a demon or some monster rising from wisps and swirls of gray smoke.Two extraordinary scenes Of special interest to fans of horror and suspense are two scenes that define the creators of this film and the original as genuine film artists. The first occurs during a class excursion to a frozen lake where Owen, accidentally gets hold of an ice hockey stick and, when threatened, follows Abby's advice to the letter ("you got to strike back hard"), punctuated by shrieks of terror from his classmates. The other scene comes later at the school swimming pool, where the sadistic bullies exact a vendetta against Owen."Let Me In" does not flinch away from graphic images of violence and mayhem ?- blood smeared on the lips, or acid trickling down and searing the face ?- but it does so with a certain grace and never in excess. They serve one purpose: to advance its theme of the presence and persistence of evil. The evil in Los Alamos, as it was in Sweden's Blackeberg, permeates the air, ready to pounce anytime and is bent on perpetuating itself. It takes many forms, from something as banal as school bullying, as sad as a messy divorce to something tragic such as the murder of people we love.From the start of production, this movie was going to float or sink depending on its two lead characters. As Owen and Abby, Smit-McPhee and Moretz were lucky to have a director in Reeves, who clearly has great rapport with preteens; a very able cinematographer Greig Fraser who frames them in the most fitting angles; and an editor who makes up through cuts and timing what the young actors lack in finesse. Their roles get a boost from the more talented Dylan Minnette who as Kenny is a natural villain, high school bully and closet wimp.Precisely because of their complete lack of artifice, Smit-McPhee's unsullied looks and air of vulnerability combined with Moretz's angel-to-demon transformations convince us and prevail, down to the movie's final twist. They leave a memorable and tragic portrait of a boy from the world of imperfect humans and a girl from the netherworld of the undead -- he the flesh-and-blood Romeo and she the vampiric Juliet -- trying to make sense of their doomed existence.</fullReview>

That is that the movie seemed to try and get you to sympathize with a character that in the book, really was disgusting and evil and got all that it deserved. I find it disappointing that they tried to evoke sympathy for a character who in the book was a child molester. Over all though I found the movie to be great, there were some editing choices that I thought were fantastic and the cinematography really captured a melancholy feel of the movie. The two leads were fantastic, as was the supporting cast, and I thought the soundtrack was great as well.</fullReview>

The story of a 12 year old boy who lives in an apartment complex and is the constant target of bullying at school. A 12 year old girl and her "father" move into the apartment next door and she befriends the boy. The twist is, the girl is a vampire. Thee story focuses on their enduring friendship, her need to feed and her intolerance for those that bully her new friend.I don't want to give anything away, but suffice to say I would not want to be one of those that bully the boy. She is truly a unpleasant foe.Prepare for a sufficient amount of gore in some parts of the film. I've viewed both the European version and this one and the American version is very much an improvement.Well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hammer delivers an answer to the sappy emo vampire movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a must-see for those of you who liked the classic Hammer vampire movies (such as those with Christopher Lee). Performed by unknowns and character actors that many will recognize, solid, believable acting is provided throughout. They are not impossibly beautiful or cartoonishly ugly. The settings are ordinary, thus giving the impression that this could happen anywhere and to anyone. The story is engrossing, subtle and complex ? but easy to follow. The main characters, two children as portrayed by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloë Grace Moretz, are especially impressive and compelling.Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) pays homage to the Hammer tradition and provides a tale of how a vampire survives day-to-day. But there is ambivalence toward the subject as we are seduced into empathizing with the characters, if not condoning their behavior.Rather than being cliché as is the case with many slasher/horror movies, some of the victims do indeed have it coming to them, while others are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. There is some gore in this film, hence the R-rating, but not gratuitously so. The bloody violence serves as a warts-and-all reminder that a vampire is a predator of human beings.The traditional aspects of a vampire's existence are provided as a child would learn them, rather than stale plot constructs. A vampire needs an attendant, cannot be in sunlight, must be invited to enter ? and they need human blood. This is not pretty. This is not cute.Vampirism is matter-of-factly depicted as a slice of life. Tragedy, justice, cruelty and triumph are juxtaposed in realistic measure. There is neither a pat "American" happy ending nor a dark "European" ending either. We are not told what we should make of this story. It speaks for itself and we are left to make our own assessments, based upon what we carry with us.This is the first movie of 2010 that I highly recommend. But bear in mind that it's not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to the Swedish movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS IS A REVIEW, NOT A SPOILER! (If you haven't seen the movie, this won't hurt you) LET ME IN (2010) is an English version adaptation of the 2004 novel LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, written by Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist. It was first adapted to the big screens in 2008, with the same tittle.While most reviewers here seem to prefer the Swedish version, I honestly prefer the "American" adaptation for a few reasons. I'm considering style, what kind of crowd it wants to attract and time of its release: It is early October, LET ME IN is out just in time for Halloween. It is a horror movie. And as a horror movie, it achieves much more than the Swedish version.Considering that the book Let the Right One In is a contemporary vampire fiction, it takes elements from Gothic Literature. Both movies involve the same features: terror, isolation, death, darkness, and, last but not least, vampires. However, LET ME IN succeeds by far in many respects when it comes to those elements, and I'll talk about some of them in detail.TERROR: is usually described as the feeling of dread and anticipation that precedes the horrifying experience. LET ME IN creates terror from its opening scene. You know something bad has happened, you just wait to see what it was. The way the movie starts with its inverted chronology was a great idea and I personally think it works better (for terror) than the linear timeline of the Swedish version.ISOLATION: the characters in LET ME IN are presented much more isolated and lonely than in LET THE RIGHT ONE IN. In the American version, the boy seems hopeless and unprotected in every way: not only is he bullied at school, he also has a hard time at home. There is a feeling of abandonment (by his father), not a real connection with the mother and unfriendliness from neighbors. In the Swedish version, the boy is pretty close to his mother, even his father is somehow present (apparently, his parents' divorce hasn't affected him) and although the bullies' acts at school are basically the same, the Swedish actors do not convince in cruelty and suffering. When it comes to the girl, both movies portrait her basically in the same way.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The cinematography of both movies are completely different. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN looks like a Lady Gaga video. Its lighting is bright throughout the entire movie - a fluorescent white light, the kind they use in supermarkets. That doesn't help translating the movie's mood. On the other hand, LET ME IN has a very low light throughout the movie, it definitely increases the story's dark atmosphere.There are only two things I could do without in the English version: the use of CGI in a few scenes and its timeline advising cards: "two weeks earlier" was completely unnecessary. It's time for movie makers in America to let the audience understand what happens in a movie on their own.I also consider LET ME IN more of an adaptation of the Swedish movie than an adaptation of the novel. And it melancholically outshines the first motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really? Your going to remake a movie 3 years after it was released? Is that even necessary? About a year ago, i use to feel this way about this production. Seriously, just go to the video store and watch the original....it's cheaper than going to the theater. But then i realized that it isn't that simple. If you want to show people good cinema, you really need to force them to watch it. Honestly, if i told someone to go to the video store and rent an awesome Swedish vampire movie, they would probably skip my suggestion, and pick up "Couples Retreat" or some crap. The only way someone would even view a portion of this film, is if they came over to my house, as i am in the middle of watching "Let The Right One In", they sit down and finally ask "What movie is this again?". So no, i am no longer dissing this movie, because in order for people to truly accept something good and different, it needs to be shoved in their faces.Now when it comes to reviewing remade movies, all you can do is compare and contrast. So let me go ahead and get that out of the way so i can speak to the majority of you who have not seen it. The film is not an exact carbon copy of the original. However, it still has the same working parts. Sure they changed things around a bit, nothing too major......but they really did hit the nail on the head by still maintaining the overall eseccense of what this movie promotes, and that is crucial for this feature. The one thing that they did improve on however, was the musical score. It was more developed and very fitting to the gritty style of cinematography. It took those really eerie yet intriguing sequences, and made them that much more entertaining. As far as the acting, i am leaning towards the original, but it is a very VERY close race.So with that being said, this movie is probably the best horror movie of the year. Yes, it is a remake, but i don't care. All these original ideas still do not compete with something that obviously works. This movie is very dark, the way a vampire movie should be. Not with it's gore, which is amped up by the way, but it's method of storytelling. That is the hook in this film. That is what gets you. It isn't some crybaby teen heartthrob, it is an in-depth storyline told in an entertaining yet odd fashion. It is very different compared to any vampire movie you have seen. Take Kiersten Dunst character in "Interview with a Vampire", and make a whole movie about her.....thats pretty much what this is.......somewhat.Bottom Line, hopefully this movie will bitch slap all those wannabe vampire geeks harder the second time around, because this is how you make a vampire movie people. Yes, i still like the original more, but this movie gets as close to the original as you possibly can get, and that is saying a lot in my book. I urge all of you to see this, because there is a reason why they wanted to remake it so quickly. However, if you do get the chance, please still try to watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the original Let The Right One in, and when I heard of a remake I was skeptical. Why did we need a remake this soon? However, I approached it with open eyes, as I have seen very faithful remakes in the past. I thought that the Swedish version was a good, sometimes very good film, but I ended up loving this new version.I knew what story was coming, but I also knew that the journey is in the experience. Let Me In does a great job of creating a mood and tone that, while similar to the original's, it also adds a fresh perspective on it. That is in part thanks to the director Matt Reeves. I have only seen his previous film Cloverfield and while it is entertaining and rewatchable, I had no idea he was capable of the subtlety that is needed for this story. The cinematography is itself also amazing, and there are some shots that will linger in my memory. Part of what I liked better in this version were the performances. Honestly, I think Chloe Moretz is just as great as the original performance, but I think the film definitely belongs to Kodi Smit- McPhee. He gives an incredible performance full of nuance and longing, and I do not recall being this impressed with the boy in the original version. I also feel the need to stop comparing them because a film should stand-alone on it's own, and this certainly does. It is a horror film, a drama, and a love story all in one, and along with the original, are vampire films to be celebrated among all the others in this time.</fullReview>

The original book was too long, too many subplots, too many characters and truthfully, not an easy read. The movie had all of the defects of the book. This new version really focuses in on Owen (the boy) and the movie is so much more powerful because of that. It also helps that Kodi Smit-McPhee is the actor that they chose. This kid is unbelievable! If he continues producing the same level of acting in the future that he has for this movie, he will become one of the great actors of the 21st Century. The movie, The Road, was a complete waste of his talent, a 3rd rate movie based on Cormac McCarthy's loopy vision of the future. So See Let Me In, you will totally love it, a great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a potboiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that Hollywood is reaching satiation point with reproducing its own back-catalogue, it seems it's looking abroad for inspiration. I have not yet seen the Swedish original ('Let The Right One In'), based on John Ajvide Lindgvist's novel; however, by most accounts writer-director Matt ('Cloverfield') Reeves had his work cut out. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) lives a lugubrious lifestyle in snowy New Mexico with his zealously religious mother (Cara Buono). She drinks and prays while he isolates himself to eat confectionery and impersonate those who implacably torment him at school. Owen's life brightens when Abby (Chloe Moretz), a somewhat demure, impassive girl, moves into his neighbourhood with a mysterious father-like figure. A friendship develops. They share secrets and sweets and before long Owen finds out that Abby is a vampire. This discovery shocks him, as it would do, but neither wants to leave the other.I honestly don't consider this a vampire film, not even a horror (though you may recoil when you see the aftermath of a character who douses their face with acid). The scenes that stick in my mind are the dialogue-driven ones between Owen and Abby. Who says youngsters can't carry a film? The acting of these two is utterly compelling. (I note that they are not yet old enough to see their own film.)The scenes where Abby attacks her victims for blood are as I've always imagined they should be for creatures possessing preternatural strength: unrestrained and savage; analogous to the way a wild cat would assail its quarry. Special effects are used sparingly and only to vivify certain scenes, never to vulgarise them. Michael Giacchino's plaintive music and Greig Fraser's bleak cinematography are effective throughout. It's usually advisable to approach remakes with a degree of cynicism, especially if they are made hastily after the original. But if they are intended to be more than just a potboiler, and they help to resuscitate the interest of the original, then why not make them? www.scottishreview.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'LET ME IN': Five Stars (Out of Five) 'Let The Right One In' is a popular best selling book in Sweden, which was released in 2004 by author John Ajvide Lindqvist. He adapted his book into a screenplay which was released as a film by director Tomas Alfredson in Sweden in 2008. The movie received much critical and fan praise when it was released; I saw it at an independent theater in Portland shortly after it was released at the recommendation of my friend Eric (as well as critics). Due to the fact that the original film version was so loved (I gave it a 4.5 star rating) many critics and fans have been skeptical of an American remake ever since it was conceived, deeming it unnecessary, but most cries have been silenced with the majority calling it equal to, if not better than, the original. I believe it surpasses the original on every level and until recently didn't believe that was nearly possible.Kodi Smit-McPhee (who you may remember from his remarkable turn in 'THE ROAD') stars as Owen, a twelve year old outcast boy troubled by bullies and the divorce of his parents in the 1980's. Having no friends he's drawn to a twelve year old girl named Abby (played by Chloe Moretz of 'KICK-ASS' fame) who moves in to the apartment next door to he and his mother (played by Cara Buono). The two hit it off initially but Abby warns they can't be friends; she has an odd and mysterious relationship with her guardian (played by Richard Jenkins) and remains very secretive but can't help but feel sympathy and the need to care and nurture young Owen. If you've seen the trailers or any advertisements for the film you know she's a vampire and needs blood to live.This film is as true a horror masterpiece as I've ever seen! It's directed and scripted by Matt Reeves (a buddy of J.J. Abrams; he co-created the TV series 'FELICITY' with him and directed 'CLOVERFIELD' which Abrams produced). Reeves brings a touch to the material that director Alfredson wasn't able to. The original film, while really good, had all the pieces and potential to be great but didn't polish them out as well as it could. This film takes what really worked about the original film and perfects it; it fleshes out the emotion and humanity to it's fullest potential, which is something the original film didn't do. It's surprisingly faithful but still makes enough changes to build a unique and better film. Some people hate remakes but the really good stories are the ones that can be retold again and again in different ways. Some may argue that improving on something that already worked isn't as impressive as creating something that really works from scratch but however way you look at it this is still a better film. The acting is amazing, Smit-McPhee and Moretz both deserve award nominations, and the directing is near perfection. This is an astonishingly beautiful film, the biggest tearjerker horror film I think I've ever seen. The characters are relate-able and the story is really touching and powerful. This is a true vampire romance; 'TWILIGHT' wishes it could be one tenth the film that this is. One definitely not to be missed.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocence Dies. Abby Doesn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An alienated 12-year-old boy befriends a mysterious young newcomer to his small New Mexico town, and discovers an unconventional path to adulthood. (Overture Films)Ignore the marketing for the film. LET ME IN is not an action-oriented horror film. Those who have seen the original Swedish film, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, would already know this. What LET ME IN is, is a thoughtful, harrowing, and heartfelt journey of a boy who befriends a girl who just happens to be a vampire. It's like a romance with horror elements. LET ME IN takes what made the original film so special, that is, the relationship between the two kids, Owen and Abby, and puts a lens focus on it. This, I say cautiously, is why I believe LET ME IN is the better of the two. In fact, the film puts less emphasis on the adult supporting characters and more focus on the young in the film. You don't even get to see Owen's mother's face!Ironically, the film is also more violent than the original film, but I guess that's due to the fact that most American horror films usually have gallons of blood. To those who are cautious about seeing the film, yes, LET ME IN plays out in a similar way like the original film (with some events switched together), but the atmosphere between the two couldn't be any more different! It's like you're watching a similar but different film. Get what I'm saying? Also, there are some different scenes to this remake, some for the better, including a brilliantly-shot car accident sequence. The bullying aspect of the film is also amped up considerably, which adds more emphasis of a threat for Owen.The two child leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz, do a terrific job in their roles. Smit-McPhee does great playing the confused, hurt, lonely boy while Moretz does well as the sweet but monstrous vampire lurking within. Richard Jenkins also plays a sympathetic but very conflicted character. Dylan Minnette pulls off a convincing role as the lead villain, especially the fact that I last seen him playing a sweet and an emotionally wounded son in the TV show, LOST.Director and screenwriter Matt Reeves also does a fantastic job. The film clearly shows that he has high respect for the original source, whether it's the book or the Swedish film. The cinematography is very beautiful as well. I loved the use of blurry images in particular. The score by Michael Giacchino is extremely heart-tugging yet conveys a sense of the 1980s time era, in which the film is taken place. However, there's one bad thing that stuck out to me: The use of CGI. Even though the overall use of it was kept at a minimum, some of the CGI effects were really dodgy, although not as bad as the infamous cat sequence in the original film, which was smartly removed for the remake. LET ME IN also didn't match up to the original's elegantly-orchestrated ending, which was disappointing.Overall, those who haven't seen the original film will definitely get more of a kick out of this than those of us who have already seen the original film (or read the book, for that matter). However, to those who have truly embraced the Swedish film, I can tell you that LET ME IN didn't "ruin" it at all. If anything, it embraced it. As for me, in particular, I actually thought the remake was the better version because it focused more on the relationship between the two kids, which is what these films are really about. LET ME IN is easily one of the best films of the year and one of the more commendable remakes ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a scary vampire movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We movie goer's seem to have a love of Vampires. I think it's because at some level we would all like to be one. However this movie definitely points out being a Vampire has it's drawbacks. This is a superb movie with great acting. For a movie to be great it must make us give a damn about the characters being portrayed. A great horror film must have tension, this one has plenty to spare. Very few horror movies are truly scary, this one was. As I read some of the reviews for this movie it struck me that everyone has seen the Swedish version and is comparing this movie to it. The rating of this movie is being hurt by this. I'm glad I haven't seen the other version and don't have to do comparisons. In fact I probably will never seek out the other version as I like this one so much. I just watched another horror movie called Devil - written by M. Night Shamala, it was very good and I gave it an 8, however this is a much much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Owen: You kill people. Abby: I do it because I have to. (from Let Me In)I do reviews of vampire movies because I have to; with the exception of Bella Lugosi as Dracula and Max Shreck as Nosferatu, I am rarely moved by weak attempts to play with the formula. Need I say more about the corruption of the sub-genre by the Twilight Series, an epic treatise on teenage longing devoid of vampire tropes and replete with long stares that take the stories nowhere.Let Me In, based on the Swedish smash novel and film Let the Right One In, is a somewhat old-fashioned and successful vampire tale about two twelve-year olds, vampire Abby (Chloe Moretz) and effeminate intellectual Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee). As for most pre-teens, theirs is a rough connection filled with doubts and discords, but through it all they are surprisingly close and caring. In the sense that a vampire story should have more than bloody necks, this film achieves the psychological crossover by being true to what I know and remember about those emotionally parlous times. Owen and Abby are social outcasts who suffer for their uniqueness, she because of her need for blood and he because he is sensitive (I don't have to forewarn you about what eventually happens to Owen's bullies).While the very red blood flows freely in the vampire tradition (I went home to cook a nice marinara sauce for my pasta in the Hannibal Lecter tradition), the film also includes common elements such as the divorcing parents, the snooping cop, the bully motif, and atmospheric music. I can accept all but the bullying sequences, which are trite and overwrought in the revenge category.Good bye brooding, grey Twilight; hello bloody Let Me In. This is a film that relies on both dialogue and openness to bring a loving relationship to life and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stays true to the original film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, after watching the movie Let The Right One In, I found out that the Americans were working on a remake.As I had greatly enjoyed the original movie, I had incredibly high expectations for this movie, and I must tell you now, it did not disappoint at all.Many of the sets and dialogue stayed relatively true to the original film, although the names of the characters and location had changed. I found myself pointing out "Oh this is when Eli (Abby)'s carer dies!" and so on, able to recognise almost every scene instantly.There were a few issues which somewhat got to me however, and these issues are what's prevented me from giving this movie a 10/10.First off, the people behind this movie removed my favourite scene from the original movie; the cat attack scene.Now, I know the cat attack scene was fairly pointless, and in the remake they've managed to do fairly well without it, however I really loved that scene (and I'm sure many other people also did).This movie also lacked the same level of subtlety as Let The Right One In. Most of the violence in the original movie was implied, minus the scene where Eli/Abby kills the school bullies. In Let Me In, much of the violence was just shown to the audience. Now, this is probably to impress the American audiences with "OMG YAY BLOOD AND GORE!" however it just didn't have the same effect as the original.There were only a few issues with this remake. And hell, for an American remake, it's done pretty damn well.I mean, at least this movie stayed fairly true to the original, unlike say, The Day The Earth Stood Still with Keanu Reeves. In the original, GORT was sort of like the space police, in the remake, GORT is a giant robot made of robotic bugs. You'll find no modifications of that scale in Let Me In when comparing it to the original.4/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good job, not disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that many viewers of this movie are fans of the original Swedish movie LTROI, so I won't be emphasizing on how much I am fond of the original one ? and here we are for the American remake.That being said, I just watched the remake. In general, I am not disappointed (if not a little pleasantly surprised) by this remake, though it still cannot catch up with the original one as a whole.Honestly, I was a little worried when I went to the cinema, being afraid that the story would be degraded into a superficial Hollywoodian fest of clichés and pure visual stimulations. Thankfully, that didn't happen.In general, this remake is in line with the original book (and the original movie). Many settings are almost identical with the Swedish one, so are quite a number of actors' lines (well of course they spoke English in this one, no Svenska LOL). More importantly, the tranquillity resembles a lot to the Swedish one. We can tell see that the filmmaker had no intention to challenge the basic tone of the story, a beautiful love tale under vampire's cover. This, on the other hand though, might disappoint some fans who watch the remake in search for a revolutionary interpretation of the old story, YMMV.Sure, there are still many differences. The first one is the ambiance colour tone of many scenes where Owen and Abby meet. The director has obviously chosen a warmer tone (under orange-yellowish street lamp) in which our two protagonists interact, as compared to the sharp contrast of white snow vs dark sky in the original one. Personally I give credits to that change, as it better alludes to the tenderness of Owen and Abby's friendship / love.The real gender of Abby is one of the hottest topics amongst fans. Here, instead of giving a direct shot to Abby's under (which I find totally unnecessary in LTROI), the director chose to interpret Abby's gender in a very ambiguous way, leaving much room for interpretation.Also, I feel that the American remake is more "focused" on the two protagonists than the Swedish one. "More focused" has two senses: in one hand, filmmakers tend to let Owen and Abby physically occupy a bigger part of the screen, instead of the wide-angle lens in LTROI; in the other hand, the director cut many "peripheral" scenes (scenes where actors other than Owen and Abby interact). I am personally neutral to that change, though I believe that we need not give further emphasize to Owen and Abby for a better character depiction. OK, now time for some negative comments. As a whole, I find the remake's interpretation of the gory scenes as a failure. They are too violent, bloody, and explicit, which, I think, largely spoils the basal tone of the movie, inserting some cheap and inconsistent horror elements in this supposedly beautiful, ambivalent movie.Last, the music. Here I have to say LTROI's soundtrack totally outworks that of the remake. LMI's OST is, to its most, up to a "hardcore" horror film's suspense scenes, whereas LTROI's music is as beautiful, as poignant as the movie.In conclusion, a good remake, loyal to the original story. One can tell the director's effort to re-interpret some minor details without changing the story's basal line/tune, though many of the modifications aren't as successful as they expect.Basic story line: LTROI = LMI: 8.5 (basically the same) Settings: LTROI = 8.5, LMI = 9 (I am esp fond of the colour tone?) Scene interpretations: LTROI = 9, LMI = 6.5 (not so implicit...) Actors: Eli = 10, Abby = 9.5, Oskar = 8.5, Owen = 8.5 (those young actors are just gorgeous ? both in Swedish and in American versions, Owen may not be as good looking as Oskar, but his acting is as excellent) Music: LTROI = 10, LMI = 5 (I bought the Swedish OST to fill my iPod. The American one? no thanks) Originality: LTROI = 10, LMI = 6 (afterall, LMI is a remake that has borrowed a lot from LTROI)OVERALL: LTROI = 9, LMI = 7.5 congrats to both, good job done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blatant Ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It pains me to see it once again: Hollywood plagiarizing original ideas and claiming them as their own. It's not hard to see why someone felt that this story could yield more money from the U.S. viewers - 'Let the Right One in', the Swedish film from which 'Let Me In' was blatantly copied from, was in fact a masterpiece in it's own right. To call this movie anything more than a facile, dumbed down imitation would be an insult to every great, original movie there exists.Aside from a couple of altered lines; some stripped scenes; a new, English speaking cast and an unnecessarily cheesy angel chorus score present all about the movie (to guide the poor viewer in his/her confused emotions), there were no real differencies. 'Let Me In' had some new CGI, which was outright needless to deliver the impact, as can be seen when comparing this to LTROI. The actors were worse here - an overload of that classic American mannerism we've seen a thousand times before, with little chemistry whatsoever. From the book, there were no new scenes which LTROI didn't have, which makes me suspect the creators of this movie did not even bother to read the book, but settled only to lazily copy the original film into another hollow remake.Some will moan about this being a whole different movie that shouldn't be contrasted next to it's inspirer, but that would be false. This IS 'Let the Right One In', made again in almost exact same style, with almost all scenes and lines exactly the same. Of course it is a magnificent story well implemented, but it is still a ripoff that should have never seen the daylight.I would not recommend this film, but instead 'Let the Right One In', the film 'Let Me In' tries so desperately to be. It has been done once, it needen't be done again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In line with the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one could have predicted the cult and international attention given to Let The Right One In - a small vampire film hailing from Sweden. It had two things working against it. First, it was in a foreign language, and the western world has yet to fully embrace at the box office the treasures of international film. Second, the movie dealt with vampires, to which, thanks to everything from True Blood to the Twilight series, was a tired genre. Yet, this small foreign vampire film about a bullied boy who finds love and revenge through a young female vampire, went on to glorious recognition (it now sits #208 all-time on IMDb.com's rating system). And for all its interest, when an English speaking version was being shopped around Hollywood, many (if not all) fans prayed that the original remain untouched and un-westernized. Enter Matt Reeves. Reeves had just come off the hugely successful Cloverfield in 2008 when the studio approached him with an offer to direct an English version of a film to which he admittedly had not yet seen. Matt Reeves eventually watched Let The Right One In, and like many of us, fell in love with the film. His only demand back to the studio was that they not bump the age of the two lead characters in an effort to make it more of an adult relating film. The studio agreed and Reeves was given the opportunity to make or break a two year old classic. Let Me In borrows just about everything from the original except the names of the characters. In the English adaptation, Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee from last year's, The Road) is a bullied kid in school who befriends Abby (Chloe Moretz of Kick-Ass), a strange new girl who just moved into his building. Owen has an innocence to his first encounter with Abby when she appears on the playground. He doesn't probe with too many questions (like why Abby wasn't wearing any shoes in the cold New Mexico snow). And when Abby quickly testifies, "Just so as you know, I can't be your friend", Owen quickly retorts with a school yard comment to deflect his severed feelings. As in the original, their relationship does blossom and Abby and Owen are soon exploring new adolescent emotions towards each other. Meanwhile, Abby still needs to feed, and she relies mostly on her minion only known as The Father (Richard Jenkins). The Father's role is to murder civilians and drain them of their blood to which he brings back to Abby. But when a kill's blood is accidentally spilled and another attempt to gather food results in a car accident leaving The Father in the hospital, Abby takes matters into her own hand and begins to hunt human prey for sustenance. This quickly prompts a police officer (Elias Koteas) to investigate the murders. The officer begins with attempting to question The Father who has doused himself with acid making himself unrecognizable and clinging to life. "Are you a Satanist?", he asks the dying Father in attempt to understand the ritualistic type homicides occurring in his town . As the murders continue, the officer focuses on Owen's building in an attempt to find the little girl that claimed to be The Father's daughter. The film could easily just incorporate the police investigation and Abby's attempts to conceal who she really is while trying to feed in a new town. But a more dramatic storyline follows Owen and his torment by three school bullies that use every chance they get to inflict pain or embarrassment on the overmatched Owen. From towel flicking in the locker room to threats of throwing Owen in the icy waters of the lake, the bullying is real and terrifying in depiction. Comparisons to the original will be impossible to ignore, but Reeve's adaptation of the John Ajvide Lindqvist novel is just as good as the Swedish counterpart. The setting is moved to 1983, Los Alamos New Mexico, but the feel and the awkwardness and sincerity of the budding relationship is admirably maintained. Reeves does a good job of keeping the feel of the movie in the early 80's. Everything from Ms. Pac Man and Gorf video games to Culture Club and David Bowie background music remind us that the film is initiated in the Reagan era. There were just a few things that were handled with less finesse than the original. Abby's vampire movements when attacking humans reminded me of Gollum in Lord of the Rings and her voice became than a demonic sounding adult when agitated. But what Let Me In does right is keeping things simple. Reeves didn't try to up the body count substantially or cut out subplots in an attempt to satisfy the blood thirsty western box office. Instead, the only difference was the placement of the opening scene which concludes with a title card taking us back "three weeks earlier". The acting by the two young actors will be enough to generate buzz for the film. Reeves surprised us when he told the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival screening that he had not seen The Road or Kick-Ass prior to casting as both those movies were not available to him. Moretz and Smit-McPhee had more chemistry than many combined Oscar winners in bigger films. Let Me In is not the most frightening vampire film of all time, but it is sure to be one of the most talked about when released in October 2010. It's exceptional storytelling accompanied by a fantastic original score by Michael Giacchino that reminded me of the musical score in James Cameron's eerie Aliens (1986). Fans of the original can be assured that the essence of Let The Right One In was captured and that comparisons between the two versions will be hotly debated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a great American horror flick that was everything "Twilight" miserably failed to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, I admit. I haven't seen "Let The Right One In" yet, even though it's been released for two years now. This is due to the film not being shown (or even sold in DVD) widely here in Malaysia, much to my dismay. So I now have no choice but to wait patiently until it appears on TV, or watch the inevitable American remake. So I'll try my best to avoid referencing the original and review this as a stand-alone film.Here comes the good news: as a film by itself, "Let Me In" is a truly terrific horror drama. It scares you, thrills you, and moves you. We haven't had this great of an American horror film since, well, I can't remember.Owen's a lonely boy. He frequently gets bullied, and his parents are getting a divorce. He even peeps at the neighbors across his apartment, and fantasizes about killing the bully occasionally. Out of nowhere, a mysterious girl and her father move into the apartment complex next to his. The girl doesn't talk much, and walks barefoot sometimes in the cold snow. Boy meets girl. As time progresses their relationship deepens, and more and more secrets about this girl are revealed bloodily.Right off the bat from the trailers and posters' tag-lines, you can tell that "Let Me In" is a vampire movie. But, this movie is everything that "Twilight" wanted to be. "Twilight" failed miserably. In fact, why am I even mentioning "Twilight"? To add that to a movie this good is an insult to this film's (and the original's) reputation. "Let Me In" is genuinely scary and creepy, but it also has a real human connection and heart, thus giving it humanity.Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz are terrific in their roles and prove heavily that they are among the best child actors today. Smit-McPhee gives a hauntingly innocent performance as Owen, he not only looks the part; he also fills up character in the role with a varying degree of moodiness, creepiness, frustration, desperation, and - during his moments with Abby - satisfaction and subtle happiness. Moretz's performance as Abby has a bit of nuance to it, shades of innocence, gloominess and mystery are exhibited by this extraordinary child performer. And the chemistry between the two are great, that one can't tell the difference between actors and normal children innocently getting to know each other. Not forgetting Richard Jenkins, who also gives a quiet but concentrated performance as Abby's "father", making his character ever more creepy. And to round of the performances department, Elias Koteas as the detective is O.K. but his character is not really that important; and the actors who portrayed the bullies give out terrifyingly menacing performances, that you not only hate them the instant they appear, but you fear them. Add to the fact that these sort of people exist in the world even now and you've got something even more disturbing than a mere vampire.It's mostly about innocence, this movie. It's not just about a vampire tearing people up - it has a beautifully written story to tell. And with that screenwriter and director Matt Reeves has succeeded. He had found a good story in the original novel/film, and decided to tell it to American audiences. But there is one thing about Reeves - he knows what he's doing. From the looks of the movie, it seems that Reeves put his heart into the film and really made sure that this film wouldn't be a rip-off, or worse, an insulting cash-in to the original - so he tried his best to be as faithful to the original material as possible. And this film by itself is great - that means Reeves did his job properly. The screenplay is written in a subtle, non-intruding (not shoving the facts down audiences' throats) way and the direction is focused and elegant. Instead of showing everything that happens like in many horror films Reeves took the old-school route and doesn't show us most of the terror, making us make it up in our mind, which is scarier than what is shown. And also the ability to control actors, both old and especially the young ones, to the extent that they deliver powerful performances, is something only a quality director can do. Matt Reeves has created a fantastic follow-up to his "Cloverfield" and he looks like one of the more promising American film directors to look out for.Technically, the film is absolutely outstanding. The production design is homely/quaint, making it calm, peaceful, yet very moody when it needs to be. The editing crisply paces the film at a steady pace without it being too fast nor too slow, it moves along very nicely; you won't feel rushed watching the film. The cinematography is eye-poppingly, beautifully, and serenely framed. Lastly, Michael Giacchino's hauntingly melancholic score proves him as one of the best, most promising and versatile film composers as of late.Of course, like every movie, there are flaws. Some of the cringing bloody/gory scenes (though moderate and not excessive like "Saw" and "Hostel") and one brief sex scene looks forced in to give the movie an R-rating (The bullies and their colorful language was enough to give this an R in my opinion). Having said that they do almost nothing to distract the movie's focus and good points. Fans of classic American horror movies, please give this movie a chance.Now I am frantically looking for the original Swedish version. If this is already great by itself, I can't imagine how excellent the original must be.Definitely, for me, one of 2010's best films. Bravo, Mr. Smit-McPhee, Ms. Moretz, and especially Mr. Reeves. Here's hoping to great careers ahead of you all.Overall rating: 78/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is going on with Hollywood these days? They are actually producing high quality movies such as this one. Don't get fooled by the title or the plot or the slew of little known actors. This is a solid movie of the sci-fi genre. This movie offers an interesting interpretation of the vampire legend. Instead of an austere aristocrat the vampire now takes the form of a young innocent-looking girl. With her are her devotees who love her and serve her unconditionally. Without their help the vampire cannot survive. Although violent, she is not a wanton killer. Although not human, she is capable of love. Although fundamentally a malevolent spirit, she is capable of defending others. In short, she is not a repugnant creature. Lethal, yes! Dangerous, yes! Repugnant, no! After all, how could such an innocent-looking little girl hurt anyone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The way vampire movies should be made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the internet last year, it seemed like the whole internet was buzzed with a movie called Let Me In. On a certain critic's site he was naming his favorite vampire movies and Let Me In was his number one. I had my guard up, sadly since the Twilight franchise became popular, vampires have become nothing more than a joke and it seems like the vampires are just a sick trend right now. When I read that it was about two 12 year olds, I was even more put back, I wasn't so sure how this would work, but with the overwhelming good reviews, I decided to take a risk and buy without watching and I just have to thank all the users who gave this film nothing but positive reviews because this is one of the strongest horror films I have seen in years. Being a vampire has been so glamorized, Let Me In shows that it can be a curse and the pain of adolescence can make it even worse. With great actors, a clever director who also made a brilliant script for it as well and wonderful special effects, Let Me In keeps you glued to your seat and takes you on a ride that you will never forget.Owen is an unhappy and lonely 12 year old boy, who is neglected by his divorcing parents, and continually harassed at school by cruel bullies. One evening, when Owen is alone in the courtyard of his apartment complex he is approached by a 12 year old girl who has moved into the apartment next door. Her name is Abby, she tells Owen that they cannot be friends, but regardless Abby and Owen grow closer, seeing each other at night in the courtyard, and start communicating by Morse code through the walls of their apartments. Meanwhile, Abby's father, occasionally goes out to kill local residents in order to acquire blood for the vampiric Abby. Abby continues developing her relationship with Owen, and Thomas asks her to stop seeing Owen, but she does not. Abby, saddened by the later death of her father, moves on to Owen for psychological comfort. Meanwhile, the detective gradually learns of the protector's connection to Abby. After Owen finds out about who Abby really is, after all she has done for him he vows to protect her.Chloe Grace Moretz is becoming such an incredible actress, such presence for a young age on the screen, she's like an old soul who you think would be in the business for a long time with her gift, who knows? Maybe she is a vampire for real, just a thought. Also Kodi Smit-McPhee couldn't have been a more perfect choice for Owen, his eyes were so strong in the sensitivity and loneliness that was needed for the part. He and Chloe had such amazing chemistry and their love story was beautiful and extremely tragic. I like the whole theme around Romeo and Juliet, seeing as Owen's mother being very religious compared to Abby who would be considered a demonic creature and how could they be together? At 12 years old, your going out of your "boys/girls are icky" phase and your hormones are insane, so it could have been turned into a love story that you really wouldn't have taken seriously. But since the characters seem like old souls, they click very well and really balance each other out.Let Me In is one of my new favorite movies, I watched it a couple of days ago and still cannot get it out of my head. I've been bragging about it to my friends and can't wait to show them. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, it's absolutely beautiful, elegant and one of the best horror movies and I'm sure will be a classic for years to come. Thanks again for the wonderful reviews, let's keep this movie going and make sure that more movies like this get made for the vampire genre, before we know it, vampires just might be scary again.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those that haven't seen "Let me in" yet...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let me in" is not a bad movie. It is actually a pretty decent horror drama flick especially compared to the Hollywood vampire-porn movies like Twilight. If you watch it without knowing about it and without any expectations, you'll be delighted for sure. You'll probably claim it is the best horror movie in at least the last 20 years.But please don't do that. Please don't watch it. You deserve even better. "Let me in" is nothing but a copy of real art. As I said, it is a decent copy, but it is still not the original. But why does it matter, you may ask... if it's still good? Right?Well it matters to me and it should matter to all people that value art and originality. It is the same as paying money to see a polished photocopy of Mona Lisa and be proud of that, giving all the credits to the copy machine that "created" it. And what's even worst... "Let me in" fails to tell the story of the original film and novel. The director claimed it will be his own interpretation of the novel, and not just shot by shot film remake. I was looking forward to seeing that. But in the end, I am really disappointed, because he didn't do that at all. Instead he copied almost everything from the original movie, even the cinematography style... there were completely identical scenes in both movies, shot from the same angle. Seriously? Speaking of lack of any imagination. Matt Reeves went even further away from the novel by removing important characters and events and adding a completely NEW ones that do not exist in the originals?! He also changed the setting of the story, it's main characters, even the title. Like the Americans won't accept anything that doesn't happen in their backyard. Everything in "Let me in" is simplified, conversations and acting is forced and not really believable at places. And the ending is completely ruined. I think the US viewers should consider this an insult."Let me in" is a $20 million copy that doesn't really work the way it is supposed. It is created by the spoiled copycats in Hollywood who crave your money for re-shooting an award winning script.Please do not support this expensive plagiarism. Go see the original "Let the right one in". It is PERFECT. And cheaper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spotlight on bullies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Moretz is one that children around the world can relate to. Both children exist within a dysfunctional conditions had their own coping mechanisms. For me, this movie spoke to the monsters bullying can create. "At least 10 percent of children are bullied regularly. Bullying is a truly serious problem in schools around the country, and it can be rather harmful, long term, to children. - http://www.bullyingstatistics.org (2009)" Owen, a young boy struggling between an alcoholic mother and absent father, is bullied in school regularly by a group of kids. You can see how this movie attempts to show you the beginning symptoms of a victim of bullying. He acts out in private through the role play in which he is the bully. This film shows how Owen's bully (Dylan Minnette is in fact, a victim of bullying himself because he is bullied by his older brother (Brett DelBuono). I think it is safe to say that Kenny and his brother also grew up in a dysfunctional household, implying that the cause of all bullies is directly associated with the child's relationship with the parents. I am no psychologist nor do i claim to be, but i think that we can connect the dots here.Abby, a victim of abuse herself, was attacked by a monster and thus, has become one. You can identify her monster anyway you like, a rapist, an abusive mother, a manipulating parent. In my opinion, the "vampire" story line is merely a filler for your own story line. Abby finds a commonality with Owen and grows closer to him and begins to care for him as he does her. They are both different, awkward and although Owen doesn't know her true identity in the beginning, he can see that she also is in need of a friend.What I came away with in the end is this: If you are being bullied in school, chances are you are not alone. Make friends and help each other through the tough times. I'm not saying you need to beat anyone up, but you should not let yourself become a victim. In the end, Owen and Abby chose to protect each other.Finally, it is in my opinion that all attempts at counseling children in school are wasted if the same counseling is not extended to the parents. Monsters create monsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just another remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why making remakes of great movies?", I ask myself every time I see one. Last time I watched a remake on a French "Taxi" movie - the car was a typical US yellow cab, all the people were black, main actor was quite a huge lady instead of a guy, the movie had a good mix of farting jokes, and so one... you get the picture, I guess. While I wouldn't recommend this taxi remake to anyone, I can imaging why they did it - a somewhat of an adaptation for a certain group of people. Speaking of this movie however... It's not that they brought another twist in the story line or added any originally as such, the quality of the director's work, acting and special effects are not better at all, so why bother? I can understand if some weird Korean movie with special effects from the kindergarten and budget of 1000$, but good story line, get to be reincarnated by Hollywood - you get much better picture, much better special effects and famous actors; this movie is just not that case. I simply refuse to accept that different language of a good movie is enough to spend time and effort creating a clone of similar, if not worse, quality. Lip-syncing is much cheaper! or put subtitles, it's not that they speak a lot there anyway! As a conclusion, I would suggest anyone to watch the original "Let the Right One In" and don't waste your time on this twin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>News from a Parallel Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This contains spoilers right from the start so please don't read if that is a problem to you.I loved the Swedish original and didn't understand why anyone would want to remake something that was already perfect. However, I had read so many good and positive reviews of this version that I began to believe there was some truth in them. However, watching the film surpassed my worst fears of how bad it could be and here's why: 1 Immediate alienation of viewer by starting with artificial pumped up action sequence followed by "Two weeks earlier." I swear this formulation of "X weeks, months or years earlier" appears in every other drama I watch these days and it is overused and annoying. It's bad enough on TV but it's spreading to movies now.2 Awful music - either vague angelic voices swelling to indicate a scary/portentious moment or tinkly piano music to tell us this is an emotionally significant scene.3 No doubt someone will tell me I am wrong but the snow throughout looked completely fake. It reminded me of one my cooking experiments gone wrong then smeared over everything in sight. Difficult to believe in the veracity of the film when the snow, which is significant to the story, looks fake.4 The CGI. This has to be some of the worst CGI work I have ever ever seen and that's saying something. In the original there is one significant CGI scene involving cats which is so grotesquely exaggerated that it works by drawing your attention to it. Here the CGI made me groan aloud every time it appeared.5 What was the point of the hospital scene with the woman catching fire except to stick a bit more action in? In the original you know who these characters are and you have an emotional investment in them. Here, they appear, you don't know or care about them, she dies.6 The director bottles it when it comes to the ambiguity of Abby's gender. It was pretty obscure in the original film but you get enough to intrigue you and make you go and read the book.The two young leads did well given how badly everything else around them was so poorly realised but I have to say that they come a pretty poor second to the actors in the original. The fact that Chloe Moretz played Abby was one of the reasons I decided to watch this as I think she is an enormously talented actress but I can only think she was poorly directed given her interpretation here.I really wanted to like this given the fact it was well reviewed, I liked Cloverfield, I liked Chloe M but the truth is that it's just awful. Maybe if we didn't have the first version to compare it to, Let Me In might have become a minor cult film in years to come but we do have the original and it is so much better than this in every respect that it eclipses the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to an almost empty cinema to see this film, a few short days after its release and not far into the movie one of the handful sized audience left - a woman, I guess, in her sixties. I have seen and love the original, Let The Right One In and for those who have not seen that movie will come across a treat in the remake. I am going to try and avoid a compare and contrast between this and the original, though very difficult to do. Set in 1983 - pre social networking and cell phones - where boredom and imagination were our friends. Even though the stars are kids, it moves well away from teen horror and slasher, and a mature audience is most likely to appreciate this fable. In ways it even has tints of Where The Wild Things Are.. The main characters are superb and we get drawn into that world and that era. On the one hand, the boy is 12 but the girl only looks 12 and that is the mystery and the trick that stops the audience judging such a cute kid so strongly. One is following the impulses of pre-adolescence the other an impulse to survive but there is an awful undercurrent of emotional abuse that makes the film so intriguing - and when pushed in those corners we make bad choices about friendships.I would also remind that this is Hammer's first movie since 1976 - and way different in their style from back then. I think the lady that left the cinema had seen the Swedish version, much more subtle, and left at the first gory scene - of which there are few in the original. There is a lot of horror in this tale and perhaps it didn't need to be visualized so much. The director did a great job of keeping hold of the essence but one feels the Hollywood machine wanted more visual gore to up the audience ante. That is the only flaw in an otherwise excellent Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Let Me In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Hollywood runs out of ideas, it turns to what's hot in world cinema, and picks up a film or two to adapt from and/or be remade. It could be a Martin Scorsese film based upon a Hong Kong crime action thriller, or of late, Swedish cinema being the hunting ground of choice with David Fincher's upcoming and much hyped about adaptation of Stieg Larsson's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and here, Matt Reeves translating one of the more inventive and evocative vampire films in recent history with Tomas Alfredson film based on John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel Let The Right One In, an almost shot for shot, scene for scene remake that makes you wonder why the effort to go through this adaptation process when a recent original already exists, and one that made it to the cinema halls in Singapore as well.Granted, Hollywood does come knocking with a larger budget to begin with, but here it managed to avoid the risk of attempting something totally flashy but useless for the story, I felt Reeves had remained on the side of caution in not wanting to branch off too much from what's already established and canon, and like Gus Van Sant in his remake of Hitchcock's Psycho, preferred to have recreated scenes as they are with no major departures or surprises, which to any audience already familiar with the Swedish version, may not find anything narratively more that Reeves' film has to offer. As it turned out Let Me In still had a longer runtime, but captured and retained all essence of the earlier film, with some budget going toward recreating the 80s era it was set in, and heightening the usual creepy elements to brand this a horror film, with the requisite gory elements that somehow when unintentionally but hilariously (to me at least) overboard, when it came to discover the what if that explains its title when permission to enter a home is not granted.Matt Reeves burst onto the scene with his found-footage film Cloverfield which featured some crazy hand-held camera techniques and angles crucial to the narrative, and here trades all that to jump into the other end of the spectrum in opting for the still camera that's a staple in any art house cinema. Unlike the usual Hollywood bastardized version of films that contain plenty of verbatim explanation and incessant talk to idiot-proof it for anyone to follow what's going on, this film has significant moments of silence to ramp up its atmospherics, with so much being said through so little, that you may mistake this for being anything but churned out from Hollywood. Attention was paid to detail, especially in populating the art direction with 80s era motifs, and elements, And for those who have seen the Swedish original, perhaps one of the prime reasons is to compare whether the leads of Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen and Chloe Grace Moretz as Abby measure up to the original pair of Kare Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli. It's needless to say this comparison will always exist, and personally I felt it was a mission accomplished as they both did a tremendous job in being equally on par without letting the weight of pressure eat into the performances. Their beautiful chemistry made the primary love story here believable, moving, and one which you will root for, nevermind the alarm bells ringing that it's something quite unnatural, and in some ways, the corruption of innocence. There are plenty of subtext still contained in the film from the way character relationships especially that between Abby and her "Father" (played by Richard Jenkins) and even their sexual orientation but if there's a flaw in this remake, then it is here that it didn't measure up to the way the Swedish original had dangled and tackled this deviation from the novel.Kodi Smit-McPhee was spot on in his interpretation of Owen/Oskar, being vulnerable when it calls for it, when he's bully fodder, or when the feeling of isolation just overwhelms from discovering the truth about his new squeeze and a mom who gradually finds solace from the bottle to numb the pain of an impending divorce, his false bravado in role play reversal of standing up against his physical and mental tormentors, and the child like innocence he fills the screen with when he plays Romeo to a Juliet that can never inhibit the same waking hours as him. Chloe Moretz saw her stock rise with her profanity-spewing Hit Girl in Kick-Ass, and here she's in a totally muted role as the 12 year old, more of less, young girl who's more than meets the eye. Moretz brought out her apprehension of being discovered and found out, her helplessness at the sight of plasma, and the start of yet another budding romance, although she was quite unmistakably replaced by a CG equivalent for her character's most violent action scenes, an effect that drew unnecessary attention to itself, whether be it scaling walls, or pouncing on the pack of her prey and making a rag doll out of them.To someone who has seen the Hollywood version first, you may be in awe with Matt Reeves' film, and may embrace his vision of the story. But take heed that the Swedish one came first, and you'll do yourself a favour by checking that out as well, since it's already available on DVD. For those who swear by Let The Right One In, I'd still encourage you to watch this for the actors' performances, as they step into roles that you hold dear to and are familiar with, showing that a strong story is essentially necessary, followed by a solid casting to bring the characters to life, no matter how many remakes (though it may be pointless after this effort) come by in future.

		<shortDescription>One of the most accurate and well-written horror remakes in recent years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let the Right One In was one of the most talked about films of 2008. Even outside the horror community, critics and moviegoers alike were raving how the film breathed new life into the tired vampire genre. While the Swedish film certainly had its moments and told a pretty amazing story, it wasn't quite as exceptional as everyone made it out to be. When word came that Cloverfield director Matt Reeves would be remaking the film for American audiences, there was a massive amount of skepticism. You've probably heard the complaints about remakes before. How they're never as good as the original and are only done to make a quick buck. Well Hollywood may have pulled a fast one on you and is set to release a remake that's actually worth seeing for once.The trickiest part when handling a remake like this is what the writers, directors, and anyone else behind the scenes decide to change in comparison to the original film. If they change too much then people complain that it strayed too far from the original, but if they change too little then people claim it's too similar to the original and that it was pointless to remake in the first place. They've got to find a balance; add just the right amount of different and new material while maintaining a film that follows in the same footsteps of whatever it was based on. Let Me In just does that.Let Me In is actually at its strongest during the scenes where it ventures away from the 2008 film. Just about any scene that takes place in a car is spectacular, especially during one particular scene where things don't go exactly as planned. There's also a scene where Abby attacks a jogger in a tunnel that's pretty brutal. These added scenes didn't take anything away from the already well-established story, but actually managed to add depth to these characters a good portion of the people seeing this are already familiar with. Considering most Hollywood remakes, this is well worth mentioning. Let Me In at least deserves credit for pulling off something like that.There are several alterations to the story that may put off some who were Let the Right One In enthusiasts. Oskar and Eli are now Owen and Abby and the film now takes place in New Mexico rather than Stockholm. Some of the more memorable scenes in the film didn't make quite as much of an impact as they did in Let the Right One In. Virginia being exposed to sunlight and the pool scene at the end of the film being the two biggest examples. It's not that those particular scenes weren't done well, but they just felt too similar or maybe weren't quite different enough to distinguish them in comparison to the original. That's probably my biggest complaint with the film overall. If you've seen Let the Right One In, then you know how everything turns out. That's a pretty obvious statement dealing with a remake, but knowing that going in really seemed to hurt the experience overall.Let Me In definitely deserves to be held in high regard as one of the best horror remakes in recent years and perhaps ever. Its newly added material blends in nicely into an already well-written vampire story. It just felt like the film could have been even stronger if it was a bit more unpredictable. Nevertheless, its wonderful cast, enticing storyline, and eye-catching camera work will satisfy just about any moviegoer and is a surprisingly strong horror film to be released this late in the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the right one in...72.5/100</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This American remake of the terrific Swedish film "Let the right one in" (L?t den rätte komma in) seems to have come out with undue haste perhaps...I reviewed the original (subtitled) movie here on 22 April 2009. When I heard that there was to be a US remake, I was sure I would ignore it, as the original was in no way flawed. What changed my mind? Two things: 1) Chloë Moretz. She was inspiring in the comic book themed movie "Kick-Ass". 2) "At the movies" mentioned that the remake was pretty close to the original. Personally I still find the original the gold standard for this film, so would encourage people to see that on a big screen before you see the remake.The story is identical to the original...a troubled young teenage boy (about 13 years old) doesn't fit in at his high-school. Then a similarly aged teenage girl moves to his town and to a flat right next door to him. She seems strange too. They form an unlikely relationship...which seems to perhaps offer up salvation to both of them. However, some brutal murders soon start occurring in the small, isolated town they live in. The local policeman fears that a Satanic cult or some such is at work in the town and he tries to find it.Comparing the two movies - since the original is still fresh in my memory, I had a check list watching the remake...seeing that all the key scenes for me were in the new movie. They pretty much were. Maybe that was a sort of distraction...ticking boxes as I watched the movie. Maybe a couple of extra scenes have been added in the US versions. David Stratton complained about one scene not being replicated in the remake...where the young girl is naked. In some ways this is better, I think. I'll go into that later.The original let me in more. With the remake, I felt a bit of a distance to the story. Kodi Smit-McPhee as the young boy Owen is terrific in this movie. He brings a subtle understanding to the character. For instance, I like the way he casually taunts Chloë Moretz' Abby about coming inside his house. Chloë is very good too, but maybe her ticking all the boxes as far as the physicality of her character goes left Abby with a lot less soul. Both convey a nice sense of alienation from society...sort of like mall rats.I suppose I was hoping that the remake would convey a very European sensibility. American movies don't really go for that or couldn't if they tried, perhaps...although "My girl" was a terrific example of an American movie capturing that European sensibility. Instead, you get a sort of American Gothic. You get a good sense of the character of place in the small town Owen and Abby find themselves in. The flats that both find themselves in are nicely represented too...sort of in the Barton Fink mould...I mean the hotel room that movie was set some of the time.Now, to the scene which didn't make it into the remake and which David Stratton criticised on "At the movies"...personally I think that maybe they made a wise choice leaving that naked scene out. Here's why: in the original, the interpretation you give to the Abby character's self-observations are directed towards viewing it as a question on her own anatomical status. In the remake, however, her question seems more about her essential nature. In other words, the remake gives you less information about the character, and I think that actually not having that information about her makes her self musings more philosophical...they can't really be taken literally any more.It was also a concern of mine that some aspects of the relationship between Abby and her guardian would not be featured in the remake. They are. You're really not missing anything storywise from the remake...it's just that the original was more fulfilling...to me at least.From memory, Abby looks more androgynous at times than her original counterpart (Eli). Australian actor Kodi Smit-McPhee looks the part as Owen. You also get the terrific character study of the original...perhaps made more explicit. E.g. you are constantly forming views of certain characters then having to reinterpret them later on, as more information comes to light. For instance, Owen is quite creepy early on in the movie. One of his class mates is also disturbing...but things aren't really that simple or black and white. It's a very nuanced character portrait many times in the film.My biggest problem with the movie was the ending. Sure, it ticked that box too, from the original. However, I felt that the pool scene in the original gave a feeling of exhilaration which the remake lacked. Perhaps the original constructed that scene better, or did the sequence of events in a different way. What should have been a great emotional high for the movie is really just flat. It just failed to manipulate my emotions as the original did. That's a great shame. Perhaps it being so close to the original in scenes and screening is to blame? Maybe, but I just think that the original did that scene much better too.Starting out wanting this movie to tick all the boxes of the original, in hindsight was a mistake...for me and the makers. If they had added many new elements to the story then perhaps the movie could have carved out its own identity more.It's sad to me that the need for this remake was thought necessary. Watching the original, the performances were captivating...the central characters had such beautiful voices that I wished I could understand what they were saying without the need for subtitles. Here now you have a movie where you don't need the subtitles, but something has been lost in the translation...a little bit of soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A British-American Remake of the Swedish "L?t den Rätte Komma in"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Los Alamos, New Mexico, the twelve year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a lonely and outcast boy bullied in school by Kenny (Dylan Minnette) and two other classroom mates; at home, Owen dreams on revenging the trio of bullies. He befriends his twelve year-old next door neighbor Abby (Chloë Grace Moretz) that only appears during the night in the playground of their building. Meanwhile, Abby's father is a wanted serial-killer that drains the blood of his victims to supply Abby, who is actually an ancient vampire. Abby advises Owen to react to Kenny fighting back; however, sooner he discovers that she is a vampire and he feels fear and love for the girl. Meanwhile a police officer is investigating the murder cases believing that it is a satanic cult. "Let me In" is a British-American remake of the Swedish "L?t den Rätte Komma in" a.k.a. "Let the Right One In". This stylish vampire movie is developed in a slow pace, like most European movies, with an original, sensitive and very well constructed story. The performances are top- notch and the greatest difference of this good remake is the language, since it is English spoken. Nevertheless, the original film is classy and unbeatable and the first Swedish vampire movie I have ever seen. . My question is, wouldn't be much easier to dub the original film for those that have difficulties to read subtitles? My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Deixe-me Entrar" ("Let me In")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard that this film was being remade in America, my first thought was "Why?". I saw the original two years ago at a festival and it was beautiful, moving and dark.Had I not seen the original, I may have liked the remake. Although, it still would not have captivated me in the same way. The two child actors playing Owen &amp; Abby I have to say do a wonderful job in their roles. The story is there. But that is where it ended for me.I was really disappointed, shocked even, to see the use of cgi. Why. It was so not needed. The music, the setting... It just didn't bring anything.What bothered me even more was that sentimental and intimate scenes which had been drawn out so beautifully in the original, caused audiences to giggle and laugh out loud. It didn't carry itself as a serious film.I can find no point to the remake of this movie other then to bring it to an audience that can't be bothered to watch movies with subtitles. But what should be realized is that that kind of audience, big screen - big budget, is not there to appreciate the beauty of original film making and non-standard stories.The original film was a masterpiece. The remake I'm sad to say does not do anything for a truly unique story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It completely misses the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While appearing on the surface to be very similar to its Swedish original, this imitation omits all the elements that have made the Swedish movie such a great success. And this is the reason why some people are led to believe that this is a romantic movie, or even a weird story with some magical explanations. The book and the original movie are not vampire stories. They are about identity and anger in teenagers, and the vampire/person character is more a symbol of this struggle for identity than anything else. The world of distancing and alienation between teenagers and adults is masterfully presented in the Swedish movie, and barely addressed in this version. Indeed, the Swedish movie repeatedly presents the adult world of inadequacy and inability to communicate with young people as a major theme, and this is not the case at all in this English version. Similarly, the boy's and girl's constant search for acceptance and their struggle with anger are also very well depicted in the Swedish version, and completely ignored here. If there is any doubt that the story is about identity searching and struggle with anger, look at some scenes in the Swedish movie, like the boy's conversations with the mirror, the shocking picture of the girl's genitals, or the interactions between these two characters and their parents. One crucial sentence in the original movie explains almost all, and is also missing in this version: "I kill because I need to; you would kill if you could", says the girl to the boy. Both characters have reached a point in their lives where violence is the only way of expressing themselves, and leaving the adult world towards the unknown is the only acceptable escape. A vampire by necessity; and a violent boy in self-defense mode. Because this English version reduces the story to interactions among teenagers and fails to acceptably address the intergenerational issues, it misses the major points of the original Swedish book and movie, and is just a superficial story without much value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant understand how all the reviews are favorable for this remake of the Swedish Film, Let the Right One In. The pacing , the acting, the suspense, was so well executed in the original, that it makes this movie seem like a cheap imitation. If you have never seen the original you might appreciate the novelty of the story but you wont see why this movie is so lacking compared to its predecessor. American cinema is so glossed over, we no longer see the artificiality of it. It was like watching robots, the indelicacy of it all. The places where the director chooses to diverge from the original seem hard sought and inconsequential. What was the purpose of even making this American version? This crude adaptation made the movie lose all its magic and its creepiness. The original was a sublime terror but this director chooses to use an exorcist type makeup for the Vampire that seems to have no place in the story other than to make the boys' conversion seem more extreme. What made the original so special is sucked out of this one by rapidity of the pacing, the clumsiness of the storytelling and the ridiculous urge to change small details in the wording or actions. It looked like a connect the dots of the original instead of a fluid and eloquent story. The original could not be improved on. If this is the first time you have seen the story than the original may not have the same impact. You may find the original tedious now. Thank you American cinema for slicing it up and serving it to me warmed over in a package. My sensibilities will have to take a chill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a completely unnecessary and inferior remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it 2, for those film goers who saw the Swedish original, or 4 for those who did not. Average 3. The Swedish version is much better, not to mention it was fresh and surprising. The Swedish had a better director, and the actors were better. I love Moretz in general but here she is kind of, no pun intended, colorless and flat. The kid is also mediocre, and the school bullies are like we saw in a hundred other American school movies. And I wonder, how can the old guy's face be all eaten up by the acid, I mean all, from chin to the hair, but both eyes are intact?? The bitten lady on a hospital bed, turning into a vampire, makes a final sacrifice of her life to destroy what she becomes in the Swedish version, here she is just exploded by the daylight, which is a huge difference and shows that the director is a third-rate one. Just two examples of the mediocrity of this film in comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trick'r treat, "Let Me In"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror fans mark this one on your calendar. Both elegant and chock-full of gore, "Let Me In" is a remake done right. Well, I can't really hold to comparison because I've only watched the first twenty minutes of the Swedish hit, "Let the Right One In" (2008). Unfortunately, it was dubbed in English, (a nightmare in itself) so I turned it off. Anyways, back to the American adaptation, "Let Me In," filmmaker Matt Reeves, fresh off the gimmicky "Cloverfield" (2008), shows a little mastery in direction. Honestly, I didn't really care for the apocalyptic, monster invasion, "Cloverfield." Perhaps if it came out before the whole found-video-shaky-footage rave, it would've caught my attention, but at the time, the concept seemed tiring. "Let Me In" is a unique vampire film about the unlikely friendship between a bullied, 12 year-old boy, Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) whose parents are in the middle of a divorce, and a mysterious girl, Abby (Chloe Moretz) that also happens to be a vampire. They meet outside in the snow-covered apartment complex, and the curious boy, always peeping out his bedroom window, is wrapped up in the mystery of his new friend and her older caretaker (Richard Jenkins). The director keeps the perspective towards the boy's point-of-view. When he sits down for dinner with his mother, the camera never cuts to her face. In fact, she's mostly seen out-of-focus in the frame or seen in a distance, which cleverly expresses her absentee presence as a parent. This notion sets-up the framework for the boy's new-found relationship, considering he learns a little life skills from a girl vampire. "Let Me In" holds onto the same mythology of old vampire movies (burning sunlight, thirst for blood, sleeping in coffins), but never goes overboard with the genre conventions. Reeves tries to take this story as seriously as possible. It doesn't poke fun at the genre or execute messy set-pieces of vampire violence. No, I'm afraid, non-stop violence fans, that the gruesomeness isn't senseless; it serves the characters, the narrative, and the gorgeously lit atmosphere. Along with the fresh take on the vampire genre, "Let Me In" is expertly photographed. In the scene outside the apartment complex, where the two friends meet by the snow-covered jungle-gym, the surrounding lights give the images a hard-orange hue. There were also times when the cinematographer doesn't completely block the lighting, letting in an ominous ray of metallic blue across the frame, which serves as a recurrent visual motif. Furthermore, in another fantastically shot scene where the unidentified guardian of the vampire attempts to dispose of a body in a half-frozen creek, the contrast between the snow and the dark night is so heavy that it almost looks as though it was shot in black-and-white. Shooting in snow-covered surroundings adds a crisp aesthetic, which is unlike filming in any other type of weather condition. Now, for the best part of the cinematography?the gruesomeness and blood-dripping gore is ironically a beauty to behold. There is no shock value here; it's just shocking how much blood there is when you suddenly forget you're watching a vampire movie, along with an absorbing tale about childhood friendships, hardships, bullying, and curiosity. Kodi Smit-McPhee is a child actor I'm going to enjoy watching grow up. He portrays a shy, pasty-looking dork, but at the same time, still remains utterly cool. One of my favorite scenes is where he puts on a record for Abby and slyly grooves to the 70s tune, trying to impress her. Come on, who hasn't tried to impress a person they've had a crush on with their favorite brand of music? Well, I have, and so naturally that little humanistic scene stuck with me long after the screening.Child performances in films of such darkness can be difficult to swallow. However, McPhee gives a remarkable performance of such subtlety and aloofness, I could easily identify with him. Let Me In builds to a conclusion I sensed was coming. It didn't matter though. How the scene was visualized by Matt Reeves was still a shock to me; my heart was literally racing with adrenaline. All I can say is this?sometimes it's what you don't see that brings out the most suspense.I know I can be a snob and completely disapprove of horror remakes (because American audiences can't read), but I think it's hard to deny that this is still a great horror film with a unique, improbable relationship. "Let Me In" doesn't spell out every detail to the audience. The director provides many nuances, which hints about the mysterious relationship between Abby and her older companion. Is he Abby's father, brother, a childhood friend, or a sadistic individual obsessed with vampires? Who knows exactly? Sometimes, it's the mystery that makes it all the more interesting. Overall, I enjoyed this moody little creeper of a keeper. "Let Me In" anytime, well, probably not during the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but completely pointless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a decent movie, but it was a decent movie because it almost completely mirrored the far superior 'Let The Right One In.' The scripts were borderline identical, and the deviations were not good ones... the plots were exactly the same but for different settings, only this one made obvious and waved in the face of the audience what the first film was subtle about and only hinted at in regards to her 'father figure', apparently assuming the American audience is less capable of figuring things out on their own. I can't say this is a bad movie, because its not. What it is however is a cheap(in terms of quality, I'm sure Hollywood spent more on theirs) knock off of a much better movie. If you have a choice between 'Let Me In' and 'Let The Right One In', the titles themselves make the choice pretty damn obvious. Seeing the original (with subtitles, not dubbing.. the dub track is pretty awful) is the only way to go with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick with the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following is an explanation as to why I prefer Let The Right one In to Let me In. Many people think it's pretentiousness to prefer the Foreign film to the domestically made one but really, it's not. It simply was a bad a film.1. I don't like the CGI. I see no point in adding blood with CGI. It looks awful.2. I do not like the implication that the boy is to be the next henchman (or whatever term you want to use). It goes against the original novel and the original theme of rare and true unconditional love without sex. The purist and most innocent love through darkness. That was at the heart of the original story and what made it so endearing. Also to claim Eli had known her/ his henchman since that henchman was a boy is wrong. He's too bungling and incompetent. He clearly is not experienced at killing and disposing of the body so how could he have been doing this his entire adult life? That version of the character in the remake does not make sense.3. The setting of the remake felt wrong. I like atmosphere and I like the unearthly quality of vampires and you lose some of that without the bare footed child in a t-shirt walking in snow and you can't see her breath but you see everyone else's.4. Making it clear that Eli was really a boy was important because it was the result of that mutilation that Eli was anti-social, avoided human society, was clearly awkward and shunned society with it's gender roles. Eli did not trust the outside world because of his secrets and because of what he suffered and some of that was lost. It takes away from the child vampire's tragedy. And the solidification of the fact that their love was NOT sexual but something far deeper. I think it's kind of depressing that we Americans can accept monsters but we can't accept that the child vampire was really a boy? The fact that being a blood thirsty monster seems "more acceptable" to the audience than the idea of the child being a boy says something is really wrong with our society right now.5. I feel the Swedish actress was simply a better actor in general. The girl who played Abby is now in Dark Shadows and I've been watching interviews with her and she's spacy and acts... well, kind of high...6. I just tend to prefer films that follow the original source material better.7. Let the Right One In was the first good vampire film since Twilight. And by "since Twilight" I do NOT mean that Twilight is good, but rather the first good vampire film since the whole annoying fad started!8. The remake disappointed me for another reason as I expect more atmosphere from the recently revived Hammer company and they let me down.9. I don't like finding out that the reason the title was changed was "The original title is too long for Americans." (real reasoning). That offends me. Especially when the original title was based on an English language song by Morrisey and the song definitely suits the movie. And the follow up short story is named for the next line of the song, Let the Old Dreams Die.The interpret it that OsKar / Owen (what's the point of changing the name? We have Oscars here in the US) is the next henchman hurts the film and the entire theme of the movie that love, actual unconditional affection, without need of sex, can bloom in the strangest of situations. That was at the heart of the story. For the boy and for the monster. And if you deliberately strip that out for the sake of your "interpretation" the entire message and meaning of the movie is lost just to appease contemporary and cruel cynicism. It's wrong to completely twist the very heart and meaning of the story to appeal a cold, modern interpretation based on the disturbing fact that people today have become too cynical to accept the notion that love can bloom anywhere at ny time with anyone. The heart of the story was that Oskar could love despite the fact that Eli was a monster and not really female and that Eli would love to a degree of fierce protectiveness she/he never gave to the henchman. To dismiss this and turn the film into something colder and shallow. And to be honest the mindset that does this... disgusts me.The writer of the original story said what it's about and wrote a follow up story to prove the way it's supposed to be seen. He says that Eli eventually makes Oskar a vampire after they finish the blood pact when they get off the train. To act as if he's wrong about the outcome of his own characters is like telling a child they are wrong about their own imaginary friend. That it's not a pink rabbit but rather a green bear.Watch the original, skip Let me In.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I can be kind of stubborn toward particular films that get heaps of praise from every conceivable angle (let's admit: the hype factor can saturate even a niche conscience to the point where interest is decreased as a result), it took me a good long while to get around to watching "Let the Right One In," the Norwegian vampire saga that is as interested in the fragility of children's relationships as it is in subverting conventional cinematic standards of the vampire mythos. In the end, I was converted into -- and still am -- a true believer in its greatness. The Americanization of foreign films has always been a tricky prospect (even in the decades preceding Hollywood's current infatuation with recycling), synonymous with "dumbing down" a concept for the sake of placating the impatient masses (and their notorious intolerance of subtitles). There is a lot to admire about "Let Me In," Matt Reeves' faithful U.S. transplant: the moody score is fantastic; the performances by Chloe Moretz ("Kick-Ass") and Kodi Smit-McPhee ("The Road") are delicately heartbreaking; and the sparing use of CG allows a quiet, simple story of childhood camaraderie (paradoxically complicated by the extraneous factors -- absentee parents, religious tension, schoolyard bullies, puberty -- that make a child's life complex) to take precedence above all else. Reeves deserves an accolade for resisting the urge to transform the film into a surround-sound, jump-scare-happy headache of the Platinum Dunes sort, instead challenging the viewer to something more subtle and deliberate. Where he falters, however, is in making the strong setpieces of the original (particularly the climactic "pool scene") truly his own -- there just isn't enough creativity or divergence present to reconfigure these now-classic moments into something that will impress those who have seen "Let the Right One In." Still, "Let Me In" coasts on a uniquely moody energy that makes it worth a look on its own terms.6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a bad remake of a good Swedish film, The original (Let The Right One In 2008) is the better of the two since it's original yet only two years later an American remake has me made, Why did it need to be remade, sure, it has better visual effects but that is it, they have changed the story line slightly (for the worse) and just ruined it. also, the acting is somewhat worse, the whole film is quick paced, so basically it failed to keep it's authenticity, characters were changed from men to women even if the original one was in Swedish, it was good, because in my opinion foreign films are better than American films because all they want is money money money and they rush their films badly, whereas other county's try to keep their films alive and could probably do so for several sequels so the film was good at some points, but extremely bad at most points so I give it a 3/10, I would recommend this to a friend, but it would be at the bottom of my list</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great remake and an amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was with some amount of trepidation that I first heard about the impending release of Let Me In. Like many others, I was quite taken by the original Swedish film, Let the Right One In, which easily secured a spot on my Top 10 of that year. I feared that a remake would only excise the poetic nature of the story in favor of a by-the-numbers vampire film. The attachment of Matt Reeves as writer and director didn't do much to assuage my fears. Cloverfield was entertaining enough for what it was, but its gimmicky shaky-cam aesthetic wasn't very indicative of his directorial abilities. Once the good reviews of the film started pouring in, I figured I'd see it just to say that I did and then forget about its existence shortly thereafter.Could I possibly have been more wrong? I ultimately saw the film five times during its brief theatrical run. It's been three months since then, and I still can't stop thinking about it. Never before has my reaction to a film been so contrary to my preconceived notions. Not only do I prefer the remake, it has fast become one of my all-time favorite films, and Matt Reeves has shot to the top of my "directors to watch" list. While there is much that can be said for how Let Me In compares to its Swedish counterpart, I'm going to try and keep comparisons to a minimum, because Let Me In stands firmly on its own two feet as a film. The wonderful thing is that one film doesn't have to supplant the other; Let the Right One In is a beautiful film in its own right, and Let Me In is another faithful and unique cinematic take on the same story.The story in question originally comes from the mind of Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist, who wrote the original film as well as the novel that inspired it. The plot revolves around a lonely 12-year-old boy who is bullied mercilessly at school and finds solace in his budding relationship with the girl who lives next door to him. Unbeknownst to him, the girl also happens to be a blood-thirsty vampire who has been 12-years-old for a very long time. Reeves' adaptation of the material is respectful, thoughtful, and personal. In rendering his version of the story, he draws on the overall structure of the original film, various details from the original novel, as well as some of his own ideas and experiences growing up. Reeves clearly has a firm grasp on the complexities of the material, and he crafts Let Me In as a poignant coming-of-age story, tender love story, and devastating horror story all at once. By thoughtfully transplanting the proceedings to 1980s Regan America, Reeves uses the social context of that era as a backdrop for Owen's tortured adolescence, resulting in a subtle exploration of moral ambiguity and duality. Whereas most modern horror films rely on excessive gore as a substitute for intelligence, Let Me In is one of the select few that brilliantly utilizes its horror premise as a multi-layered metaphor to explore a variety of thought-provoking ideas.While Reeves' screenplay adaptation is impressive in its own right, his directorial style is just as powerful and artistic. Simply put, Let Me In is one of the most elegantly directed horror films I've had the pleasure of watching in a really long time. Reeves' controlled and careful direction is a revelation in today's frenetic cinematic world. Let Me In is one of those rare films where virtually every shot helps reveal character and drive the narrative forward. Reeves is clearly an ardent admirer of Alfred Hitchcock, and his point-of-view driven visual storytelling does an admirable job of cementing the audience in the perspective of the central characters. Furthermore, he injects his film with a sense of dread and tension that would have made the Master of Suspense proud. Between Reeves' crafted cinematic approach and his cinematographer's haunting Gothic visual palette, Let Me In is a breathtaking and beautiful film to behold.Finally, a discussion of Let Me In's strong suits isn't complete without addressing the power of its two lead performances. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz may have only been 12-years-old at the time of filming, but their performances exude a sense of depth and maturity far beyond their years. Let Me In may revolve around two children, but it is a dark and complex film for adults, and the fact that McPhee and Moretz are able to shoulder the weight of the film with such a sense of grace speaks volumes for their talent as actors. Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas turn in excellent supporting performances, but the central story of Let Me In lives or dies by the success of its two leads, and McPhee and Moretz play a huge part in making Let Me In the emotionally charged film that it is.Although it didn't do nearly as well as it should have at the box office, Let Me In deserves to find a larger audience on DVD and Blu-ray. It's a rare and precious gem that got unfairly swept aside in the chaotic rush of awards season, despite its strong critical reception. In a cinematic climate where countless films are created solely to cash in and make money, it comes as a startling surprise that such a moving, layered, and crafted piece of cinema would come in the form of a remake. And yet, Let Me In is all of these things and more. Anyone who likes their films to have equal doses of artistry, emotion, and intelligence owes it to themselves to pick up a copy of Let Me In. Don't let the genre deter you; it's not just an amazing horror film, it's not just an amazing remake, it's an amazing film, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The innocence lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'd like to state, that I'm a huge fan of the original movie 'Let the right one in', thus I was very skeptical about this remake. In the end, however, this film turned out to be really good. I'm pleasantly surprised! On the other hand, the first one is still better, in my opinion. Though it shows the story from an entirely different angle, comparing the two is inevitable.The American version is much more concentrated, and compact than the Swedish original. This can be a good thing, or a bad thing, it only depends on the personal taste. This means 'Let me in' operates with a seemingly smaller cast, which means it is more focused on our heroes, Owen and Abby. Or at least it should mean, because I don't get the feeling that we get to know them much better than in 'Let the right one in' (but more on them later). We see most of the supporting cast from a greater distance also, which makes the bullying a more pivotal point of the story, but also makes other story lines weightless (for example, the neighbor who got bitten by Abby, is quite an unnecessary part in this remake, while in the original movie, we get to know the neighborhood a lot better). Also, the bound between Abby and her "feeder" is much more in focus, which is a good thing, but leads to some gimmicky (though well made) scenes, which distracts from the story.Another difference is that this version shoves everything in your face. It takes place in the 80's, so they go to an arcade, listen to 80's music all the time, and such. It's a coming of age movie, so Owen spies on the couple next door, and watches people kissing at the store. It's a horror movie, so turning into a vampire results in some over-the-top effects, and we get to see a lot of blood everywhere. The same goes to the main dilemma of the story, which in the Swedish version came together in the head of the viewer, but here, it is shown in the form of a photograph.But the biggest problem I had with this version is on casting choice. Namingly: Chloe Moretz. Owen and Oskar are almost entirely the same, but the character of Abby and Ely couldn't be more different. Don't get me wrong, I really like Ms Moretz (she was probably the best thing about 'Kick Ass' in the first place), but this is really not her role, in my opinion. While Eli at least seemed to be innocent, and a victim of her nature (again, what goes on behind that doe-eyed face is entirely up to the viewer in the original), Abby is openly manipulative, aggressive, and very intimidating. I think I can see what they were going for with this change, but unfortunately, this kills the chemistry between them. Moretz, though a year younger than Smit-McPhee, seems way older and stronger than him, making this 'romance' unlikely, and unpleasant to see.In the end, this version might be more focused on them, and their fate, eliminating other plot lines, but their relationship is just not as subtle, as it was in the Swedish film, making this remake just a tiny bit more weightless than the original.Still, highly recommended. I agree, that the story is good enough to deserve a worldwide recognition, and for those of you who have problems reading subtitles, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quality (if very similar) remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that a Hollywood would be remaking the brilliant Swedish film, Let the Right One In, I was a little concerned. Hollywood has a long history of re-imagining (and ruining) foreign films by simplifying the stories and characters, and adding in irrelevant effects and corny plot devices. But to his credit director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) has shown great restraint and remained quite faithful to the original movie and novel, so that the American version Let Me In is in itself quite a good film. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee )is a 12 year old boy living in frost-bitten Los Alamos, New Mexico. He is himself isolated - the product of a broken home, and the victim of vicious bullying in school. An escape arrives in the form of a mysterious girl of the same age, Abbey (Chloe Moretz) who moves in next door to Owen. The two lonely characters quickly form a bond. Meanwhile the town experiences some mysterious murders and attacks, and it's not long before Owen realizes that these crimes and the arrival of his new friend are no coincidence. It would be grossly unfair to simply call this a vampire or horror film, because it is so much more than that. In actual fact it's probably more of a love story/drama with some horror themes. But it's the clever story, complex characters and great performances from the leads that raise this film above the standard Hollywood vampire fare. It's kind of what Twilight hoped to be, but never was. If there is one criticism of Let Me In, it is that it's perhaps too similar to the original. Some scenes are almost shot-for-shot copies. Having said that, the Swedish version Let the Right One In is still far superior. It is one of the most beautifully photographed and directed films I have seen in a long time. It has an ethereal atmosphere to it that makes it an impossible film to forget. So if you don't mind the subtitles, I would recommend the original on DVD rather than Let Me In. But despite having that such a daunting original to live up to, Let Me In is still an acceptable alternative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-Teen Bloodsucker Out-Vamps Twilight Wimps in Let Me In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Twelve...but I've been twelve for a very long time." -- Abby (Chloe Moretz, in response to "How old are you?")You may recall that The Grudge was a remake of the original Japanese film Ju-On, whose retained foreign sensibilities breathed a breath of fetid air into a moribund horror market. Similarly, director Matt Reeves' Let Me In, a remake of 2008's Löt den Rätte komma in (Let the Right One In), Americanizes the quirky Swedish original, barely missing its greatness but still surpassing anything the mainstream American market has offered recently, especially in the overworked vampire subgenre, happily preserving the cold desolation of the original's frozen landscapes.Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) stars as Owen, a bullied 12-year-old living in an apartment with his single mom. He dreams of murdering his tormentors and seems to be on the path of becoming a serial killer, amusing himself with the Hitchcockian pastime of spying on his neighbors with a telescope. His life changes forever (or is locked into its destiny) when the enigmatic Abby (Chloe Moretz) moves in next-door and becomes his first puppy love, but the forlorn Abby is more than just another withdrawn pre-teen: She's not human.I thought I'd seen all the vampires I need to see, but writer John Ajvide Lindquist's story, in original and remake, tells the fable from the unique perspective of children on the verge of pubescence, addressing issues normally unexplored in these movies and ignored in the Twilight phenomenon. Abby ("Eli" in the original) isn't a wimpy, angst-ridden Cullen; she's a ruthless predator to whom humans are lunch, provided your lunch is a Bloody Mary, yet Moretz invests her with a soul in a follow-up to another difficult child role as the sadistic junior crimefighter in Kick-Ass. While the dynamic rightfully remains between Owen and Abby, the film grants gracious supporting roles to Elias Koteas (Shutter Island) as a suspicious police detective, and Richard Jenkins (Eat Pray Love) as -- well, we're never completely sure who he is; suffice to say he is who Owen may become.Dealing with children who aren't just props but are the prime movers and shakers of this little universe, Let Me In, like its progenitor, captures the true subversive nature of the best horror films, including a daringly erotic yet strangely innocent scene that addresses Owen's awakening sexuality. Director Reeves (Cloverfield) confronts uncomfortable themes that more mainstream films only pay lip service to, letting these kids be true individuals. There's no idealized Disney innocence here; Abby is a killer and Owen clearly wants to be.Nevertheless, while this is a fine adaptation with the sincerest of intentions, there are factors that distance it from the original beyond the minor rewriting necessary for its relocation. In the original, the first thing we see is the story's protagonist reciting a mantra of repressed rage, but bOwen isn't the first character we see in the remake. Rather, it's Koteas' detective, already in the midst of his murder investigation, creating some confusion as to whose perspective we're seeing the story through. A more strategic difference is that Moretz, with her plumper face, isn't quite as creepy-looking as the original's Lina Leandersson. Finally, I'm sick of computer-generated effects, and while Reeves uses them sparingly, they're still intrusive.Nevertheless, Let Me In is a solid entry in a genre that Hollywood has long since strip-mined, delivering appropriately seasonal chills, but more importantly confronting the dark side of adolescence we like to pretend isn't there.</fullReview>

This remake is a bit edgier than the original but the CGI attack sequences is why the original will remain the better of the two. The unbelievable/ unrealistic use of CGI is not at all a deal-breaker as the stellar performances keep this remake securely anchored. It omitted the one cheese scene from the original and beefed up the others... tastefully (pun). It even expanded on a few things. Now I must go back and watch the original as I have a new appreciation of this film. Genius storytelling and it makes Twilight look like Snow White.

You have a feeling most the movie this scene is coming, and I was really hoping for a scene where they are picking on Owen and Abby shows up and says "leave my boy friend alone!" then they turn to Abby and she toys with them, letting them think she is just a helpless girl, then they should have showed her killing them all! The effect they used when she moved fast and jumped on people was great and should have been used allot here.This was a great movie anyway, lots of things in the movie were done perfectly, acting was great, the cinematography was very good, and maybe this is my American film goers attitude showing, but sometimes I think you have to give people what they want in a end of a movie so people walk away feeling satisfied, I love a revenge movie, and they end could have been longer than the 10 seconds with Owen underwater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the reviews here I was really expecting something great. Note to self never let expectations get the better of me. So I settled down to what I thought would be a first rate VAMP Movie. I was bitterly disappointed! First in takes around 15 minutes for anything to happen. The settings are dark to dark! and the acting even darker. Loads of unanswered questions through the whole movie. I wont add any spoilers here so you can through the same hell as I just did.It was painful and I could not wait for this drab second rate rubbish to finish. Acting was awful - plot well your guess is as good as mine - scene settings - well couldn't make much out so god knows on that one.I am still trying work out what I just saw ? If you feeling down and low and are wanting even more misery then this is a movie for you. You will come away feeling even worse and will have witnessed everything bad about bad film making and acting. Alas I have to give 1 star as there is no zero star options.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not like the typical shows your grandmother used to watch on afternoon TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than anything, watching United Productions' "ILet Me In" brings back memories of the late 80s and early 90s, where in our middle class compound during the heyday of perennial blackouts and coup d'état, our "granny" would pull us off from playing the Nintendo Family Computer and force us to sleep in the afternoon. Then later at night, when the power goes out and the moon is full, it's time for campfire ghost stories. Sigh, us kids back then...Ah, but do bear with my digressions."Let Me In" (literally "Let The Right One In") is perhaps the best mainstream American film made this year, if not the last few years, simply narrating an effective drama about - well - a "child vampire" who is also a mother. (But then again, the competition is composed mainly of perfunctory romantic comedies and horror films.) Chloe Moretz is Abby, a fully grown kid who cares so much for 7-year old Owen. She feeds her, changes her clothes, fixes her things, plays with her... she loves her like a mother would to her child. Problem is, Owen ain't her daughter. She's the child of her employers, two white collar workers in an upper-class residential area somewhere in the metropolis (I'm guessing the Eastern United States) and she's paid to look for their child while they work their tushies off for their family's financial stability.Back in her home province, Abby's mother dies and she is alone with no one to be left with. And she is faced with a choice of whether to go with the child she has since considered as one of her own, or stay with the one who shares her same blood.Directed by Matt Reeves (who also ripped off the original Swedish film), the story gives a clear sense of the filmmakers' humble intention to create a noble tribute to the people the film tries to portray. The narrative is pretty much straightforward but there is sincerity throughout. The cinematography, production design, and music all contribute to a lavishly directed film. Unfortunately, it feels as if the directors tend to overindulge on sentimentality on a few parts. Not that it's detrimental to the overall product (it's a tearjerker after all) but the subtlety done in most scenes show that it's when restraint is practiced that the film has more impact. But it's a minor quibble, actually.And of course the acting. Chloe Moretz will probably be popping up on the lists of nominees for next year's oodles of local awarding bodies. Her understated portrayal of both a child and a mother is just brilliant and it's hard not to feel for her. Then there are those beloved young actresses who casually share an easy rapport with the star, especially Richard Jenkins who vividly exhibits the sullen insubordination of a precocious father while easily projects vulnerability and pain when the occasion calls for it. In a way, he reminds me of young Korean actor Geun-yeong Mun in that his mere on-screen presence is enough for me to sympathize with him.Ultimately, "Let Me In" is a finely crafted film with sincere performances that should do well with anyone who can establish a relationship between themselves and what the movie is trying to convey. I'll just look back to the good old days. Eh... and living vampires just trying to get along in our world, you might want to bring Kleenex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer to Sweden than it is to Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this one last Saturday, almost two years after seeing the Swedish "Let the Right One In". To be honest, I wasn't, at all, looking forward to see Matt Reeves' first feature film since "Cloverfield". I don't recall when it was released theatrically in my city, hell, I'm not even sure if it was. Did I know Matt Reeves was the director? Not really? so yes, it was one of those movies for me, one of those that you're not interested at all in them. But I had to see it at this film course I just began taking. And one day after I saw it I was getting "Let the Right One In" on Blu-Ray. Yes, "Let Me In" left me with great desire to finally see again that great Swedish picture. In a way, that's the biggest compliment I can give to Matt Reeves' movie. Why? Well, if this would have been what I was expecting, the typical crappy American remake (anyone else's attention was gained when at the opening credits we see the logo of Hammer? Mine was, so yes, this is a USA/UK production), I guess I might have been just very p*ssed-off, thinking again in "Let the Right One In" but at the same time sort of not wanting to hear of this story for a long time thanks to the *crappy American remake*. So fortunately, here we have a remake that's almost identical to the original. So yes, in a way that only confirms how unnecessary are these kind of remakes, but I get what's the deal with them (remember Amy Adams' character from "The Fighter" with her "I had to read the whole f*****' movie" dialog?) and if I watch them I want them to be like this one. It's certainly just a personal opinion, but I was glad, very glad that "Let Me In" recalled how great this story is and how great are the two main characters. My girlfriend had seen it before and she said it to me really clear: "I didn't like it at all, and I prefer, by a long shot, the girl with the huge eyes", in reference to Lina Leandersson who played Eli (here the names were changed: Abby instead of Eli and Owen instead of Oskar). To me there's no doubt in that regard too. The original is superior in all aspects, from the actors to those incredible shots featuring Hakan (here is played by Richard Jenkins). But really, I thought the main actors, especially Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen, here had their very own charm. But Chloe Moretz doesn't, indeed, blow your mind as Abby. She was definitely the weakest choice in the whole cast but still she was a bit more than just decent. And take there's this sort of key scene for the movie with Abby, when Owen sees her really as a vampire. It's a key scene because that is the exact thing we were expecting from a Hollywood remake: completely different to the original, louder? just the trying to be more spectacular kind of thing. If the whole movie had followed that patron, well I would have hated it, simply as that. Thankfully, most of it goes for the slow kind of thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In is one of the few takes on European films that does not turn out to be a washed-up material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Reeves take on the norwegian movie "Let the Right One In" it's more than decent but it doesn't hold the same powerful deliverance of the original. The story has also changes within the complexity of the characters and the approach of the relationship between Owen and Abby. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a young and lonely boy that is always bullied at school and he is searching for both encouragement and a friend. He finds one in this odd girl named Abby (Chloe Moretz) who is very different than than other human beings. Owen notices the differences in Abby's adaptation to his world so he starts to sense something strange going on about her. He also witnesses different conflicts between Abby and her "father" which is portrayed by Richard Jenkins. A friendship relationship starts to evolve between Abby and Owen and things get prettier when she finds out about Owen's problems in school. The problem with the story is that, though the changes are pretty small, I didn't felt the same approach for characters as I felt when I watched "Let the Right One In". I didn't find the same chemistry between these characters. I'm not saying the movie's message is not strong or that the story isn't beautiful but I'm just suggesting that it's not better than the original. Another positive thing is the way Reeves manages a great directing by containing a scrupulous mysterious atmosphere.The disappointment was in Chloe's casting as Abby. I didn't found her as mysterious and attractive character as Lina Leandersson (Eli). Though her evolution is tense she didn't balanced both her sides, emotional and brutal. She is interested in things but things are not that interested in her. Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen is more than okay. He plays very well the curious and confused young boy. His take on the role is dramatic enough to keep you interested in his path.The technical details in this movie are gorgeous and the presentation matches the original's. Great cinematography, great editing but I felt awkward by the overused yellow tint of the image. It created a too warm feeling and a not as dark image as the original did. What I felt it was sloppy was Abby's capture inside the tunnel. I felt they could have managed to pull some better effects to look more convincing. The original was far more creepier with a smaller budget. The music is simple, the small piano claps drawing the emotional core of the movie while the strong base lines and fast brass and drums claps add a visceral dark and creepy feeling to the audience.Overall, Let Me In is one of the few takes on European films that does not turn out to be a washed-up material. It has a solid directing, a beautiful narrative story, a great development of the characters, a good technical execution but it somehow lacks in sending a solid message and it doesn't deal with the same amount of mystery as the original even though it's more tense and suspenseful. Not darker, not creepier but tenser, Let Me In is one of the best vampire American movies and that, thanks to the wonderful achievement of Let the Right One In and the grateful execution of Matt Reeves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very pleasant surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know anything about the movie, never saw any trailer or review before watching it.Everything happening was a discovery for me, every little detail felt special and growing on me. As much as the story unfolds in the movie, there are many things left to wonder and I like that.People are discussing comparison between both movies. Original and remake. I say it doesn't matter which one you watch if you want the general idea of the book (though changed for movies, obviously).Yet, there are small things which define preference for one or the other. Like music, little differences in script, cinematography and of course actors themselves.I have to say I liked the remake a lot more. Mainly because of the little preferences I named above. Music is deeply emotional, covered and somehow unnoticeable at first, yet very brooding and even scary when you start paying attention to it. Acting is plainly fantastic. It's been a long time since I felt something like this, I want to watch the movie again and again just to see some scenes purely of the acting there. Fantastic! Pacing is great as well, I really like the director's approach. Somehow even toying with you, yet if you pay attention to every little detail you understand the whole picture.I guess the main affection thing in the movie is the story, for me. How tragic it is, cruel, yet honest. Pure evil with pure love. It makes it more realistic than anything, because life is like that - a double sided coin.I strongly recommend the movie for it's atmosphere and acting. THIS is the real vampire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Almost perfect American Version of Swedish Phenomena "L?t den rätte komma in"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LET ME IN ( A- ) It won't be wrong to say that "Let Me In" is one of the best remakes in Hollywood. Usually the remake movie looses its essence while adopting for Hollywood or in reaching out to the wider audiences. Thankfully, Let Me In stays true to the Original Swedish phenomena "L?t den rätte komma in (Let the Right One In)". I have seen the original Swedish movie so I knew about the story and how it ends. So, I was still amazed that Matthew Reeves's sensitive direction and Chloe Moretz and Kodie Smith-McPheer haunting honest performance kept me engaging the whole time. Though, it's not as Haunting &amp; Dark as the original Swedish "L?t den rätte komma in (Let the Right One In)" was but still it has successfully captured 96% essence of the original movie. One thing which did bug me in the movie was its creepy special effects of Abby's face, that was little too much. Chloe Moretz is truly a star, ever since I have first seen her in "The Amittyville Horror" when she was only 7yrs old, she has surprised me. Now, 2010 has been a golden year for her, first she stole the show as Hit-Girl in "Kick Ass" than she appeared as a confidant friend in "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" and now she again excelled in unusual Horror movie "Let Me In". I don't think there is anything now can stop her from becoming the Next Big Thing. Kodi Smith-McPhee was first got my attention in "The Road" with Viggo Mortensen. He showed a lot of strength &amp; Innocence. His innocence was perfect for movie like that, where Innocence was the soul of the movie. The chemistry between Chloe Moretz &amp; Kodie Smith-McPhee is the soul of the movie. Richard Jenkins as the old caretaker of "Abby" was believable. The trio of bullying Kids Dylan Minnette, Jimmy "Jax" Pinchak and Nicolai Dorian with Brett Delbuono were really gOod. Overall, "Let Me In" is a very good American adaptation and if we forget the creepy unnecessary special effects of Abby's face, it was truly a captivating experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampire movie for us grown-ups.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a vampire movie that doesn't make the vampires look like charismatic beings or glamorous sparkling teenagers. "Let Me In" has a very direct and raw appeal to it.The movie isn't a horror movie as per se, but it does incorporate certain horror elements. It bears more the touch of a thriller, drama and somewhat also of a love story."Let Me In" tells a very good story, one that picks you up right from the very beginning and drops you right into the fray, letting you wonder what will happen next. And you will be sitting there, trying to put pieces of the puzzle together and figure out the movie, but there is always something new just around the corner. I found the storyline really refreshing, because it didn't put vampires up on a pedestal for teenagers worldwide to worship and idolize.A movie like this couldn't have worked without good actors and actresses, and the two youngster in the movie were doing a phenomenal job. Chloe Moretz as the somewhat out-of-place vampire girl Abby, and Kodi Smit-McPhee as the next door boy Owen. These two kids were really carrying much of the movie on their shoulders, and they did so phenomenally. But of course, the other people in the movie were doing a good job as well. For example, Elias Koteas as the police officer, well it is not uncommon to see him in a role like that, and he did bring a good element to the movie.As for the movie setting, well it was really cool, especially because it was set back in the somewhat quirky 1980's, and the movie did have that particular touch and feel to it. And also, the vampirism was not glorified in the movie, which other movies tend to do. There were some scenes that may be a bit disturbing to some viewers.Oh, and when you came to realize who Abby's father really was, that was just priceless. That was really a good touch to the storyline."Let Me In" is really a good jab at the otherwise stereotypical vampire genre. If you like vampire movies, then "Let Me In" is definitely worth checking out, because it totally uproots the pop-culture that vampires have become and sets a new tone and course for the vampire genre. With the recent flood of teenage vampire movies, "Let Me In" is a most welcomed addition. This vampire movie is for a mature audience, and it actually gives you stuff to think about, not just showing off a bunch of sparkling teenagers with big hair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I for one am not fond of the over exposure to vampire films in recent times. I am a huge fan of the horror genre, all inclusively. Unfortunately, this film failed. In every way the original "Let The Right One In" succeeded, this film failed. Cinematically, score wise, and acting. It is evident alone that the title had to be changed because it was considered "too long" for American audiences. After watching this film, I am disgusted. The original is brilliant in every aspect, and all this film remake does is disgrace the original film, let alone the novel upon which both films are based upon. Please if you have the urge to view this film, watch "Let The Right One In" first, and do not bother watching this embarrassment of American cinema.</fullReview>

In case, some of you didn't get the movie : the supposed "father" was actually the lover of Abby. That's why he said don't see that boy anymore out of jealousy rather than fear that she would eat him and the photo that Owen found on the table shows the father and Abby when they were young. Ending, Owen and Abby ran away which was actually kind of like repeating the cycle of her relationship with the "father" again. Owen would go and hunt for her when he grows up and we never be sure whether did she ever loved him.</fullReview>

I felt the movie depended too much on their relationship and didn't bother to spice up the script. It was painfully slow to watch and boringly so. Good for you guys that enjoyed it because you don't get to feel like you wasted 2 hours of your life. It is movies like these that make me wonder what is going on in the movie industry? I mean, so many people aspire to be writers and directors and then you see those who already have such a unique opportunity and what do they do with it? Squander it on meaningless unimaginative uninventive nonsense. What a waste of opportunity. How quickly people forget their beginnings, when it was just ridiculous dreams and no glimpse of reality. It has to be because it is impossible to remember that little kid that was once you dreaming these things and then turn around and abuse it with such garbage for a movie picture. Either that or the more talented people are still going unnoticed, deprived of opportunity. So so tragic!! People need to start demanding more from the entertainment industry after all, without you viewers where will they be? I am sick of mediocre movies getting praised. Is this the best we can expect from the human imagination? Hollywood should really be ashamed at the mockery they have become.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK to start off , I found the casting choices to be nothing compared to the original Swedish masterpiece. Kodi Smit-McPhee gave a good performance , but seemed a lot like he was trying to copy K?re Hedebrant from the original which does nothing but help show how useless most American remakes are. Everything this film does , or tries to do, seems like a rip off of everything done in the first film , but this time lacks the true emotion and great cinematography. While I understand remakes are self explanatory , the few good ones help re-tell the story , while sill having their own style , this movie has little originality and style whatsoever. In the original the relationship between Oskar and Eli seemed very natural and innocent , here it seems forced and the innocence seems to be muddled by a very poor casting choice of Chloë Grace Moretz .</fullReview>

Although not a bad movie as a stand-alone, this movie is lifted almost line from line from the classic 2008 Swedish thriller, "Let the Right One In" which is in turn based on a great novel by the same name, in what is a clearly money grubbing attempt to capitalize on its success in a US market. This is the Swedish movie with all the subtlety and nuance removed, all the grey areas made black and white, and all the plot elements spoon fed to an American viewing audience in what comes off like a cross between a CSI TV show and an episode of Goosebumps. But, in a nation that is about to elect Donald Trump President, it's not surprising that we need a movie dumbed down for us. The only specific criticism I'll make: Did anyone really buy Chloe Moretz as a castrated boy? Do yourself a favor. Read Let the Right One In by John Ajvide Lindqvist, then see the Swedish movie by the same name.</fullReview>

I was honestly surprised how this movie is not shamelessly raping the original and managing not too suck too hard for American mainstream cinema. But still, it is undeniably 'optimised', modified to be easier to take in for average American people, simplified, to decrease the chance of confusing cheerleaders and ultimately loosing most of it's authenticity, intellect, dread and magic. Unfortunately, but as expected, it is in particular the savage Scandinavian poetry that has been entirely eradicated, stripping the very essence off this story and I did not feel that Let Me In would ever come to any real coherence or start to resemble anything of meaning. So not bad but kind of useless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dumbed Down Version Of The Vastly Superior Let The Right One In!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hollywood remake of the Swedish horror masterpiece Let the Right One In, Let Me In was released to positive reception from critics n viewers alike with many even calling it a rare American remake of a European film that doesn't add insult to inspiration. Even I used to have a similar opinion until last night when I revisited this remake after checking out the original first, only to realise how mediocre this film really is.Watching the two versions of the same story back to back not only exposed the weakness of this so-called worthy remake in ways not observed before but also added a tremendous amount of respect for just how superior, timeless &amp; far more subtle the original masterpiece actually is. It's surprising that despite being a nearly shot-to-shot remake, everything about Let Me In feels different in comparison to the Swedish version.The story of Let Me In takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico during the early 1980s, and follows Owen, a 12-year old boy who's neglected by his parents, bullied by his classmates, is lonely &amp; unhappy, and who likes to peep into his neighbour's apartments while wearing a stupid mask. The plot covers his blossoming relationship with Abby, a young girl who lives next door to Owen with her guardian and has a dark secret of her own.Written &amp; directed by Matt Reeves, Let Me In opens with a flash-forward segment that ends up revealing the fate of one vital character so we already know what's coming before really getting there. It also gives the audience something to hang on to by creating a false sense of interest before the slow first act takes over the screen. Reeves' writing &amp; direction totally discards the subtlety that made the original so interesting, and he tries too hard to make his point across.Even the introduction of its lead characters isn't properly done. Owen's troubles are shown to be born out of things that are irrelevant to the story, like the tension between his parents. Abby's arrival &amp; camera pointing at her bare feet whenever it can is an indication that she is not what she seems. The chemistry between Oskar &amp; Eli in the original was a treat to watch whereas the interaction between Owen &amp; Abby in this remake is too hurried, feels forced &amp; their relationship lacks a natural progression.Many of its set pieces are similar in appearance to the original. Cinematography makes use of warm palette to capture its unfolding drama, purely in contrast with the cold colour tones of Let the Right One In, and the calm, serene &amp; expertly lighted photography is replaced by a darker ambiance. With more budget, it also gives Abby an appearance of a monster when she kills, which was lame. Editing is inconsistent &amp; lacks a smooth flow, the pacing isn't an issue while Michael Giacchino's score is just forgettable.Coming to the performances, the cast of Let Me In comprises of Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloë Grace Moretz, Elias Koteas &amp; Richard Jenkins and while all of them do a fine job with what they're given, the problem lies with the script. Smit-McPhee exhibits Owen's emotions but not the right ones because of which the dynamics of his character changes. Grace Moretz is good as Abby but her character is far less sympathetic. While their chemistry clicks, it's no match to the maturity with which it is illustrated by its young leads in the original.On an overall scale, Let Me In is a dumbed down version of Let the Right One In that lacks the ambiguity, subtlety &amp; calmness of the latter and is mostly aimed at viewers who prefer everything explained to them instead of unraveling the underlying motifs by themselves. A carbon copy of the original minus its multi-layered narration that tries to differentiate itself from the superior adaptation by using lazy tricks such as contrasting colour tones &amp; mirror effects, Let Me In is severely hampered by Reeves' complete misinterpretation of what still remains the best vampire story ever told on film screen. Watch the immensely rewarding &amp; infinitely better original Swedish version instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're too incompetent to read subtitles, this one is for you.'Let Me In' is another one of those senseless remakes that doesn't improve on anything the original has to offer. The acting is average, not even close to the original, the line delivery is pretty bad, and felt rushed throughout the film - It's about as bad as 'The Hitcher' remake, where Sean Bean spews out Rutger Hauer's lines, but does so in such a terrible manner, that you'll either feel sick to your stomach, or you'll burst out laughing. Now, 'Let Me In' isn't as bad as 'The Hitcher 2007,' but when you copy a far superior film, with far superior acting and line delivery, you still can't help but feel ill, while watching a new set of actors attempt to copy perfection. It cannot be done. K?re Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson were outstanding in 'Let The Right One In,' which just happens to be my all-time favorite horror film - but it's so much more than that. It's a tale of friendship, it's a love story, it's everything you could ever hope for in a great film. 'Let Me In,' is everything you can expect from a remake - mediocrity.Random Ramblings of a Madman: Let's face it, 'Let Me In' is the kind of film that serves one purpose - to make the original material watchable for lazy people who can't be asked to read subtitles, because, hell, who wants to read a movie, right? If 'Let Me In' had been it's own film, it may have been enjoyable - but if you ever watch 'Let The Right One In,' you'll try your best to forget the remake even exists, because you cannot improve on perfection. There simply isn't any reason, other than laziness, to choose 'Let Me In' over the original, far superior film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither here nor there - a Swedish view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'll find many reviews here and on the review page for the original movie "L?t den rätte komma in" that will either complain that this remake is to close to the original or still not quite close enough and in a way both views have a valid point. Here is why:The original Swedish movie is a contemplative artistic piece that has a lot of references that are not only Swedish but that are typical of both the time period (early 80s) and the location (a working class suburb outside Stockholm). Having grown up in that area and time I can vouch for it's authenticity, but how does that relate to the remake? The director (Matt Reeves) could have done as the UK remake of "Wallander" (as Swedish detective series) and set it in the same location and time or taken the route of UKs "Sherlock" and built a new cultural framework.Let me in chose not to do either. It retells much of the same story but cuts away a few scenes that are too Swedish which forces it to be more blunt and adds some effects that make if feel more like a horror flick but without adding any real horror.This doesn't use any Hollywood muscle nor does it retain the original magic.If you can't stand subtitles then see this and then read the book, but anyone else should see "L?t den rätte komma in" or "Let the right one in". You may not get all the cultural references (I certainly miss some when I watch for example Asian movies) but maybe that could be a good thing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best...Horror Film...Ever (WARNING: SOOOO MANY SPOILERS!!! Watch MOVIE BEFORE READING!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate horror films. I despise them. I had never seen a good horror film before this. I thought it was a list art. But now there is a little bit of light for horror films. But none shall ever shine brighter than Let Me In.Based on a Swedish book called Let the Right One in, and a remake if a film of the same name, this film is full if suspense, horror, and... Kinda awkward nudity that is so brief it can be ignored (and it is only implied anyway). The film revolves around a bullied 12 year old named Owen who befriends a presumably 12 year old girl named Abby. Only problem is (HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMONGOUS Spoiler Alerts ahead and for the rest of this review in 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1: YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!) she is a vampire. A vicious, blood thirsty vampire with good intent, but age loses all control when she see's blood. She keeps this a secret to Owen, who is being bullied at school. He eventually cracks under all the torment and fights back, severely injuring the person who has been bullying him. Afters that fiasco has passed, Owen tries to make a pact with Abby by cutting his finger and shaking her hand. The sight of blood causes Abby to go berserk, and she kills a person. Owen finds out that Abby is a vampire, and us sad to here she must leave. The next evening, the bullies, out for revenge, distract a swim teacher in a swim class that Owen is taking (Who the hell has a swim class at night?!) and corner Owen, then drag him into the pool with intent to kill. As one of the bullies holds Owen under the water, Abby comes in and brutally murders the bullies (you may take it that Abby is evil, but if you watch the film you will not only be rooting for Abby as she kills the bullies, but hoping that they are damned to the fiery pits of hell after you see the sickening things they do to Owen). The film ends on a lighthearted note, as Owen rides a train out of town with a large trunk, which Abby is hiding in to stay away from the Sun. The two communicate via Morse code, and the credits role. This film is filled with so many different emotions that just want to pop out: sadness, happiness, fear, anger, etc. The acting is perfect. The chemistry is perfect. The setting is very pretty and feels like it could take place any time (although it clearly states it takes place in 1983). The story... I have no words for how lovely this film is. It's hard to word what it's like. Just watch it for yourself, and if you've already seen it, watch it again. Final score: A++, 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is basically a shot for shot remake of the Swedish movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moretz is nowhere near as good as the Swedish actress with dubbed voice over lines.The boy is about the same, but since the movie is about their relationship, he can't make Moretz any good. The dubbed Swedish performances have a much better rapport between the actors.There was no reason to make this movie. See "let the right one in" instead.In terms of Swedish movies, this is by far the best one. Its an easy 9 stars. The feminist propaganda is quaintly Swedish without being overwhelming, and the very minor introspection into Swedish society adds to the movie, where even the most isolated American could still relate.Some of the scene remakes, when most are exact copies, are questionable. The pool scene for some reason doesn't reveal the saviour at the end.See the Swedish movie twice instead of wasting time on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think Matt Reeves should stand in the corner of the theatre with a "dunce" cap on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2008 a Swedish film called Let The Right One In emerged that could honestly be described as one of the most original and spellbinding vampire films the world has ever seen. I personally seen it for the first time by renting it. My reaction to it was difficult to put into words as I tried to describe it to people. It was beautiful, atmospheric, frightening, compelling...the list goes on and on. Unfortunately most of the world has trouble viewing true quality beyond Twilight. Since this is the case then a film like Let The Right One In will get easily missed. But for those who experienced it, they cherished it. I was one of them. The two leads, Lina Leandersson and Kare Hedebrant were superb as was the rest of the cast. The Director based the film off of the book and crafted a groundbreaking visual masterpiece of the story.A couple of years went by. I was walking through a store and came across a familiar looking title and cover called Let Me In. They remade it. Okay, I wanted to check it out for obvious reasons. I assumed that in order to get the attention and money from the larger portion of America they of course whipped up a non-subtitled version and added an ample amount of CGI helmed by Matt "Cloverfield" Reeves.I'm gonna say this as clearly as I possibly can but first it must be said that every actor in this remake is excellent. Elias Koteas is one of my favorites and Chloe Grace Moretz is mesmerizing. Now........Is it good? Yes, very good.Is it original? No, it's a carbon copy.The Director did not base this off the book, he "based" it off of the other film. Movies are my number one favorite hobby so I am not going to try and sound rude instead I'll break it down for someone who doesn't know movies too well. Imagine you're a film Director and your task is to bring a beautiful vampire story to life on screen that has NOT been brought to life yet. You will have many different elements to consider whether or not you think something should be done a certain way, in other words it is your baby, for example......Casting the right actor or actressDeciding how quickly the film is pacedWorking with the Cinematographer to decide how a scene should lookWorking with the Composer to decide how the music should be Working with the actors to decide how a scene should play out.....just to name a few.....More than likely your vision of the translated story would be very different than someone else's. The chances of your vision being EXACTLY the same as another Director's is impossible. If Matt Reeves tackled this brilliant piece of literature legitimately without the convenience of cheating off of a Swedish, lesser known, subtitled gem then I would be willing to bet that his results would not be this very good movie you have displayed before you. You're taught at a very early age in elementary school not to cheat, but to study and be creative and original.It doesn't even need to be said but I'll say it anyway. Matt Reeves does not deserve one ounce of credit for this film. I give it the credit that it's due which is of course the performers.It is supposedly "Written For The Screen And Directed By Matt Reeves". Matt you have some growing up to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small footsteps kiss the white snow, darkness on approach. Innocence are the laughs and smiles forever gone, and bitterness are the bullies to rip you apart. A blade flashes through anger, and survival are the tears of blood now slipping under quiet. Raging fires of thirst threaten to consume, sirens flash of warning, and screams begin to fill the air, the end of a once small and quiet town. But boy meets girl, boy and girl become friends, and the wall between them, their secrets come crashing down. Would she keep him forever, or would he let her go? As stakes rise higher and higher, their lives intertwine, saving the other, and they steal away from madness, riding the train deep into nowhere, nowhere but where they would be forever, a heartbeat in a true chilling tale of Vampire, a tribute to the classics like the original Fright Night and Lost Boys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing visually stunning unique vampire flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why are horror fans so anti-remakes? Sure some remakes don't live up to the originals but some are mind blowingly terrific and shed light on the original film. I have not seen the original version of this movie but it is absolutely on my list now to check out. Let Me In is this sad, eerie, dark tale about a young girl and a young boy who are from completely different worlds but share a similar feeling of not belonging. The performances from the lead youngsters are just simply amazing and should rocket their careers. In a world saturated with Vampire flicks it would be near impossible to create something truly outstanding and yet the creators of this film made something truly awe-inspiring.Kodi Smit-McPhee plays the young lonely and bullied Owen. He adds such a sad emotional performance to the cast. He also has this terrific wide eyed naivety that carries the film perfectly. Keep your eyes on Chloë Grace Moretz because this girl has a big career ahead of her. She gives, in my opinion, an award worthy performance as the tortured and emotional Abby. Her and Smit-McPhee are just astonishing together and carry this movie like consummate pros. Her chemistry on screen will literally rivet you. Richard Jenkins is excellent as Abby's mysterious father figure. Jenkins' character has so much mystery and questions surrounding him and he is terrific and has excellent chemistry with Moretz. Cara Buono has a small but important role as Owen's mother. She does great with a very small role. And finally a character I would have loved to have seen more from is that of 'the Policeman' played by Elias Koteas. Koteas is a great actor and does a great job in the role but it is such an unfortunately small role.It doesn't surprise me at all that Matt Reeves and director JJ Abrams are close because they have a lot of similar style in their direction. Reeves co-wrote this screenplay and directs and delivers one of the most unique, dark, depressing and gritty horror flicks I have seen in years. The entire setting of the tenements and the snow and the bloody scenes and everything about it had this older style 70's feel to it and he keeps the mystery in tact. One of the most unique things about this film is the questions that are opened and that don't get answered but at the same time the film does not leave you unsatisfied. You need to see this outstanding film! It is a hidden gem that is truly riveting and entertaining!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is not a bad film. Just a pointless and sterile one. It looks great, the pacing was perfect, the performances mostly believable. However, I don't demand a remake be as good as or better than the original, but its existence should be justified. A film like The Departed, could have you watch it over the original for a number of reasons. The performances are great but different, the verbal sparring, the use of music, etc. Let Me In is such an imitation that there is no reason to choose it over the original. Reeves has made it too insular. He keeps our protagonists together, almost exclusively. The tension with the father is gone. Jenkins' character is now just a previous childhood friend. Koteas does the best he can with a pointless role. The original had a whole host of different characters that separated us from the leads. It gave us a breather from the world. They also allowed us to develop emotions with some of the victims. Now all the victims are random bystanders. I wasn't bored, and it was never terrible, apart from the use of CGI. But the whole time had me wanting to get back to the novel, or the Swedish film. There was one fantastic shot, involving a car crash as the world around the car seems to be crashing.</fullReview>

The two young actors in Let Me In were outstanding, especially Abby(Chloe Moretz). Her performance was brilliant, and hats off to the kid who played Owen, he did great as well. And you cant forget about Richard Jenkins, he was his usual self, awesome, to me, even though this was a small role for him, he did everything perfect and made his character haunting in so many ways. If your looking for a vampire movie with great acting, great storytelling, and something better than twilight, I suggest you watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake like no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having initially been scared it would not do justice to the book or the original film - to die for, incidentally, I was definitely not disappointed. In fact, I found it was better done, because the emotions each character feels is made clearer - in the Swedish version, the vampire was extremely cold and the feelings it felt for the boy were not shown as well as it could've been. In this one, on the other hand, Abby's human side is made much clearer in the way she interacts with Owen. Additionally, her love for him is shown a lot more convincingly, such as when, upon discovering the truth about her, he makes to leave and she instinctively moves in front of the door to block his exit. The only thing that disappointed me about the film, though, was the fact that the "be me" interaction between the boy and the vampire, one of my favourite scenes in the entire novel, was deleted. Having seen the deleted version of this scene, I felt that had it been included, it would've done it a lot more justice than the Swedish version, which had no flashback and defeated the purpose a little bit, whereas this version had its own take on the flashback the boy saw, with a 13-year old Abby being bitten by a ghastly vampiric creature while in bed, admittedly quite recently. But perhaps the thing I liked most about this film was the fact that the ambiguity of the vampire's gender was not expanded upon. Though there were subtle hints of it, I found the ambiguity of Eli's gender in the Swedish film, and the original novel, a little unsettling, and was grateful that it was not a prevalent topic in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of "Let the Right One In" just does't cut it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give "Let the Right One In" 9 stars, but this one only 5, and it's hard to say why.This is an unusual remake as they followed the plot almost TOTALLY from the original Swedish version. I guess maybe its only because I saw the Swedish version first that I give it only 5 stars. I can't really explain why, I mean, even the dialogue is almost the same word for word! I think it's something about those Swedish characters and how they live their life there, interacting with the main characters, that makes the original better.OK, so as the other reviews said, the boy meets a 12 year old girl, "but she's been 12 for a long time..."..My advice would be to skip this one and just watch "Let the right one in". What a wonderful movie! It's a little slow at first, I almost turned it off but my wife said, "just watch a little longer", and boy was I happy that I did, what a great movie."Let Me In" I guess if you haven't seen the original you may like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous &amp; Extremely Touching Masterpiece! Surpasses By Far 'Let The Right One In'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alongside Carrie (2013) this is the only other truly superb film I have seen in more than a decade. Chloe Grace Moretz again gives an extraordinarily fantastic performance in a film that gives the clichéd vampire theme an extremely welcome revamp and which realistically deals with the extremely damaging issue of bullying. Just like in Kimberley Peirce's Carrie, the story is extremely touching and anyone who has been bullied can easily relate to the wonderful characters in this amazing film, and feel what they feel. It's actually MUCH better than 'Let The Right One In', which is actually a very boring film, and not at all touching, with characters that are so detached you never really cared about, which is the complete reverse than here, were you totally empathise with them.Matt Reeves shows what a fantastic director and screenwriter he is, following from the very promising 'Cloverfield' (2007). The characters are so realistically drawn and the situations are also so realistic that you complete forget that it's fiction, as apart from the vampire theme everything else could happen to any 12 year old in the world.Something this masterpiece benefits tremendously of is the total absence of a typically clichéd ending, and instead it has one that goes perfectly with the rest of the story, and which you do not see coming at all (unlike so many other films). As well, the atmosphere is wonderfully recreated and allows you to get into the film right away, while the pace of the film (which some may think of as slow) is perfect for the story it tells, and once it's finished (just like with Peirce's Carrie and the best Stephen King's books, such as 'It', 'Christine' or 'Firestarter') you feel a loss (like if a best friend had just moved far away) and just want to watch it again. And again, like with Carrie (2013), this fabulous film just gets better every time you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very mediocre 'drama/thriller' at best; NOT a Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film and do enjoy Chloe Moretz but Let Me In left me quite disappointed. It is difficult to fathom why this film does have quite high reviews. The storyline moved along far too slowly, there was not much plot nor action, not even psychological or existential tones. Let Me In doesn't seem to fit into any category and this isn't to say necessarily that it should yet categorizing and labelling films into a genre (even if it crosses into many genres) is innate in film- making and obviously reviewing. As for the reviews that mention that this is a ROMANCE...I'm not sure what film those people were watching but it is most CERTAINLY NOT a Romance film. There MAY be what some would perceive as romantic elements but even that is far-fetched given the main characters are 12 years old. I would use Romance for Bram Stoker's 'Dracula'...but absolutely not for Let Me In.There are better movies out there far more deserving of attention with unfairly poor reviews...this one was a let down which managed to garner relatively high reviews. Unfortunate.</fullReview>

Yes, its a good film, but honestly, the original with subtitles is better. Its even closer than El Mariachi was to Desperado, and that was a remake with Hollywood money thrown at it - same story, and same writer/director for both. Movies like Let The Right One In, and Old Boy (Korean) do need to be seen as the original before money gets thrown at it, for those that finding subtitles difficult to manage. Its a very good film, but in this case, not as good as the original, and its also a shameful copy. There has never, as far as I know, been a closer copy of one whole film to another.

		<shortDescription>For Once a good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is the quick fire remake of the European movie Let the Right One In - I for one was expecting it to be the Hollywood style cash in on the twilight craze doing the rounds (Vampire Diaries / Tru Blood and all the other awful shows) however I was pleasantly surprised by the tone of this film. Although the two leads are children, this is very much an adult film dealing with difficult themes and not shying away from the gruesome aspects of the story. Kodi Smit Mcfee is wonderful as the young man being mercilessly bullied, who is lonely due to the almost emotional abandonment of his parents (we never see his mothers face clearly) and has a rage inside him, behind his sad face, that he has not shown. As he sits in the snow covered courtyard where he lives he meets another lonely person, a young girl played by Chloe Moretz (kick ass) who has just moved to the area with her 'dad' and they strike up a friendship. However Abby is no ordinary girl and the man she lives with is not her dad. Let Me In's strength is in its sober and harsh portrayal of the bullied kids world. The bullies are awful (as they are in real life) and you almost feel afraid for the lad every time he is in school. The friendship between the kids develops well enough and it is all pretty much played out to a satisfying conclusion. However as I have seen the original it is hard to watch this without comparing the two. This is a very strong film but sometimes is a little on the slow side. But in its defence It is also gorier than the original and I also feel the vampire effects in this movie are better. There are two things that let this film down however one that can be helped and one that can't. Abby is played by Chloe Moretz who is very 'in' due to her performance in Kick Ass, I just think she is too stiff in this. The girl in the Swedish film is other-worldly and strange and you can almost believe she is old but in this version the character is just miserable all the time. Also in the end as I have seen the original first - this version just doesn't quite measure up to it but it is an excellent attempt none the less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumbed-down version of a far superior adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) lives alone with his divorced mother. He is bullied at school and leads a generally lonely existence, until a man and what looks like a little girl moves in to the flat next door. The man (Richard Jenkins) kidnaps a young man, hangs him up by his feet and slits his throat, catching the blood. He slips on the ice, causing him to drop the blood which spills onto the floor. Later, we see the young girl Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) shouting at him for doing this. Abby and Owen start a strange friendship, and it soon becomes clear that Abby is a vampire. Owen shows Abby what it is like to be human, many things she has forgotten, and Abby teaches Owen that he must stand up to his tormentors.Matt Reeves' second adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's Swedish novel Let The Right One In faced a backlash from fans of Tomas Alfredson's brilliant original when it was announced. Reeves was adamant, however, that this was not a re-make of Alfredson's film, but a fresh adaptation of the book, relocating the action from Stockholm to New Mexico. This film would keep the same focus on the central friendship between Owen and Abby (originally Oskar and Eli), and this would be a film in its own right.I'll try not to mention Alfredson's 2008 version too much as this is a novel adaptation, but it is hard to ignore it given that it is one of my all-time favourite films, and, in my opinion, the greatest vampire film of all time (including Muranu's Nosferatu and Dreyer's Vampyr). Let Me In introduces the character of the Policeman (Elias Koteas), who does not appear in the original (I'm not sure if he is in the novel), and he seems to be there to play the moral centre of the film. This choice I could have lived without, as it is almost like they were worried that the whole film may seem amoral to an American audience. Well, it is about good and evil after all, and what defines it, so the addition seems wholly unnecessary.Thinking about it, the more I write about this film the less I'm liking it. I know I said I wouldn't mention the original too much, but even though Reeves said this was a fresh adaptation, there are a lot of shots and scenes that are exactly the same to Alfredson's original. Only here, they are devoid of any atmosphere or heart. The original's perfect pace, and creeping atmosphere really got to the heart of Oskar. It emphasised that he was a troubled child with a worrying obsession with crime, knifes and voyeurism. Let Me In tones this down, making him a much more innocent character. Everything that was dark and different that the first film explored - the revelation that Eli/Abby is a castrated boy; the hinting that Eli/Abby's protector is a paedophile - are wholly ignored. It's like Reeves and the producers felt the Western audiences would be stupid to grasp these dark themes.Also, the extremely poor CGI deserves a special mention. While it was used only when necessary in Alfredson's version, here it is used a number of times, especially when Abby is in her vampire mould, attacking a person or climbing up a tree before the hunt. It does nothing except take away the 'reality' of it all. This is a story that needs to be grounded in a believable setting, in order to emphasise the social themes, and to make the coming-of-age story more real and easier to relate to. But this is seriously damaged, and the film feels ever more like a fantasy horror, rather than a drama, which at the story's heart, it ultimately is.The good, there is very little of to be honest. The acting, especially by McPhee and the always-impressive Moretz, is very good, although it is a shame they weren't given the whole of their characters to explore. But everything the original made subtle, atmospheric and scary, this Americanised version makes obvious, loud and jumpy. I don't know when directors will realise that loud noises aren't scary. Overall, very disappointing, but wholly expected. This is not a re-imagining, but a re-make. And a very average one at that.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no matter how you look at it, this is just plain theft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What prompts me to give 'Let me in' 1/10 isn't that the film would not deliver on its premise, or that it would not be skillfully done, or that the performances would suck, but the fact that despite director Matt Reeves' claim that this was not a remake of the 2008 Swedish original 'Let the right one in', but rather another adaptation of the original novel, this is almost a shot-by-shot remake. The only considerable differences between the two films is Elias Koteas' cop character, which does not appear in the original (and is of marginal importance), and the abundant use of sepia-colored filters. The original is much darker, in light as in setting, and its bleak surroundings help to create its unique atmosphere.Therefore I could not help but feel rather irritated when the credits said 'written and directed by Matt Reeves, based on the novel and screenplay by John Ajvide Lindqvist'. Lindqvist initially supported the idea of another adaptation of his novel, arguing that it would be interesting to see a different approach to the story. That approach simply isn't there, all the pivotal shots and scenes are way too reminiscent of the original to be coincidental. Tomas Alfredson, the director of the original who was initially offered to direct this version as well, but turned it down, was fittingly disgruntled.Remakes don't necessarily have to be worse than the original, but if they're too close to it, they cannot possibly convince anyone who knows where it's coming from. And if they intend to be a substitute, they are doomed to lose in comparison. Remember Gus Van Sant's 'Psycho' remake, which was justified with the argument that the brilliance of the original should be translated into color to make it accessible for younger generations? Yet nobody wanted to see that. If you want to watch 'Psycho', you want to watch a Hitchcock film. It's pretty much the same here: even though the specs are better and the actors known, you can just feel that this is a copy. Something's missing, the inspiration, the ingenuity of a film that takes itself seriously, and has emerged from a long development.Such a masterpiece is 'Let the right one in', which for many critics was the best film of 2008. Don't ruin your experience: watch the original. The film deserves it, and you deserve it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started to watch this film with my friend and after the first half-an-hour we got so insanely bored we decided to turn it off. Then I had a look at some reviews and saw that people said it had a slow start so I decided to watch it again. And I kinda wish I hadn't. I mean, yes the cinematography was good and so were the actors, but I thought that the film lacked any depth and it didn't make me want to keep watching. Kodi Smit- McPhee and Chloe Moretz were both very good but the film in general just didn't manage to keep hold of my attention. Overall I would say that Let Me In is a good film if you like all the fancy cinema stuff but if, like me you just want an engaging film, give this one a miss. I would rate it 5/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone 13+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Most Viewers, You Should "Let the Right One In"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it cannot match the emotional authenticity, depth and overall excellence of "Let the Right One In" (the original film on which this one is based), "Let Me In" is still pretty good as far as simple entertainment goes. It definitely has some scariness/creepiness to it and it does a pretty good job of slowly developing the sense of foreboding over what may or may not happen to the Owen character. When compared directly to the Swedish film, however, it fails to measure up. "Let the Right One In" does a much better job of conveying the growing emotional intimacy between the two main characters as they begin adolescence. The young Swedish actors are much more believable as real, physical, breathing human beings. In the case of their American counterparts, it almost seems like the young actors figured out they were not supposed to play the cardboard cut-out "pretend" kids so common in Hollywood films, and then they got nervous and turned in tight performances. Also there's the problem of setting. The Swedish story requires a very snowy, very cold setting. How on earth does that translate into Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the average daily highs in December, January and February are all above freezing? Hey, film-makers, have you heard of Presque Isle, Maine; Grand Forks, North Dakota; or Anchorage, Alaska? Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad film. I might actually recommend it as a first choice to those who hate subtitles or those who would be profoundly offended by the very brief nudity in "Let the Right One In." It's just that when compared side by side with the Swedish original, the Swede wins - it's no contest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate remakes but this was surprisingly BETTER than the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of foreign film and almost ALWAYS do I prefer the foreign original to the remake. I say ALMOST always because Let Me In was the first time in I can't remember how long that I liked the remake better. I was understandably astonished (and for a moment a little embarrassed) at this realization. The main reasons are this: 1. Abby and Owen's relationship is much more developed and touching. Chloe Moretz was absolutely perfect in this role. An unbelievably mature performance.2. Lina's Eli looked like a boy and acted like a boy (and yeah, I get it) which for me took something away from the relationship. Also her acting was seriously wooden in many scenes.3. Film music is very important to me and the music is LMI was far and away better than the original. In fact it's one of the most memorable film scores I can remember. Completely gets inside you and doesn't leave for a long time. It perfectly captured the budding relationship of Abby and Owen.4. The feel of LMI was much more dark, poetic, and haunting. LTROI had too much exterior light and and felt too bland. The story is that of a Gothic fairy tale and the atmosphere of the film should complement that. The look and feel of LTROI was simply too light-colored and bland in my opinion.5. The cop was a much better plot device than the drunks. The cop added a level of reality and suspense whereas the drunks just made the original a bit crass at times. I had a hard time believing the vengeful drunk was so concerned and hell bent on revenge for his dead drunk friend. Especially when the blonde gets attacked by cats. Seriously. They thought that looked good?? That was one of the MOST RIDICULOUS AND UNNECESSARY SCENES I've EVER SEEN IN A GOOD FILM.6. The bully situation felt a lot more real and dangerous in LMI and it was much better developed. The main bully in the original didn't look or sound threatening at all.7. I caretaker in LMI was a much sadder, more developed and believable character. And I loved how they showed an old photo of Abby and (presumably) her caretaker as a kid. That small thing really brought an extra dimension into every relationship.8. Lastly, Abby and Owen acted circles around Eli and Oskar. Don't get me wrong Eli and Oskar were good and memorable but Abby and Owen were PHENOMENAL. I don't think I've ever seen or felt about a young relationship like I saw in LMI. Truly outstanding.So like I said it's a big surprise for me that I found the remake to be superior to the original but that's the way it is. Thank you Matt Reeves for finally creating one great American remake. All the rest can be *beep* But not this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the original several times and every time I'm intrigued.I saw "Let Me In" and I thing Reeves didn't get the heart of the story right. It felt a bit out of sync or something... I think if you didn't see the original you'd like this movie though. It's almost a direct copy and paste and lip synced to English with some twists here and there.For me a one time show.**Spoilers from here on**Cloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee are good little actors, but it felt a bit forced or "stiff". (freely translated from dutch) Like the scene where Abby returns from the shower and begins to dance. In the original you felt more joy in the scene. Here it just didn't catch my interest.The few scenes where some CGI took place (e.g. the tunnel scene) was so obvious that I found it ugly and distracting. The same goes for unnecessary blood and gore... e.g. the scene were the neighbor eats/drinks from her own arm, come on... this could be done a bit more subtle.There were some improvements though. You really felt the detachment of Owen, from his parents. This was better orchestrated in this version. I also felt the manipulative personality of Abby was a bit more clear in this version, although the "age" of the character wasn't... Cloe is just to sweet looking.Endgame: If you saw and liked the original, don't bother. IMOThank you for reading my first review on IMDb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the Swedish version instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Swedish film adaptation of the novel Let the Right One In has creepy atmosphere, laudable acting, excellent story development and the perfect tension-building pace. This film has none of those things in common with its predecessor. This one also lacks the character development and chemistry between the principle characters that was present in the Swedish version. The characters seem very two- dimensional.The director has stated that he wished to make the story more accessible to a broader audience. Translation: This is a dumbed-down version of the original. Film critic Beth Accomando said that it "makes obvious all that the original film made subtle and does so with less complexity." I could not agree more. If you are going to remake something, especially something so recent, you must have something to change or add to it to make it your own. In my opinion, this film failed to do so. Any of the changes that were present actually weakened the resulting product.I wish to add that I also found this to be a letdown for a Hammer Studios release. Hammer is a production company historically renowned for atmospheric vampire films. This movie did not lend much credence to such a reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary remake of an outstanding Swedish film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yikes. I can't believe the rave reviews for this garbage, especially the ones that prefer this over the Swedish original Let the Right One In. The acting, the cinematography, the lighting and overall feel of the original is far superior in my eyes. When Abby (the vampire girl in the remake) scales the wall at the hospital and then later the tree, it looks so animated and cheesy. The policeman character that was used instead of the concerned friend from the original was also silly. The character was never developed in any way. The way Abby's older friend went about getting blood for her was so unrealistic. I understand that he said that he was getting sloppy and maybe he wanted to get caught, but he had supposedly been doing this for years and seemed like an amateur. The developed relationship between Oskar and Eli (Let the Right One In) seemed way stronger and more believable than that of Owen and Abby. I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure which told the story more accurately. But strictly from a film standpoint, I can't see how the original is rivaled in any way. Even if I hadn't seen the original first, this would have been average at best for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why make this film??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well OK, its obvious, money. Let the right one in was such a good film, of course Hollywood were going to grab it, dumb it down, and cash in.But what made Let the right one in so special, was how different it was, Let me in looses most of what made the original so good. the 'Swimming pool scene' a good example of this. One of the finest scenes ever filmed, turned into a very average scene here.Of course most people who watch this film, will not have watched the original, or even know of it's existence, it had subtitles to read! So many people will watch 'let me in' as a stand alone film, which for that reason, makes this film actually pretty good.If you can't or don't want to watch the original, then this film will do nicely. If you've seen the original, you know exactly what to expect from this, so you might as well not bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original movie last year and this remake last night. I'll keep this short. If "Let The Right One In" was a classic piece of literature, "Let Me In" is the cliffs notes version.The film making in of itself is decent enough and enjoyable. The atmosphere is sufficiently haunting and creepy.However, if you were to compare it to the original, "Let Me In" is a mere shadow...a shell. Characters, motivations and subplots have been striped bare so what you have is very lazy and inept screen writing propped up by a facade of good atmospherics.This is an original movie vs remake comparison only as I understand that even the original movie is a striped down version of the book! (but isn't that always the case?)I wholeheartedly recommend anyone interested to seek out and watch the original.Can't wait to get my hands on the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a needless remake of a superb Swedish original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is an example of a pure American style habit to exploit someone's original idea and good work for lack of their own ones, only this time they did not succeed to destroy it entirely. The main children actors do their jobs very well. The screenplay was amputated of significant details in the plot, and altered unnecessarily or even harmfully for the story.All compliments found in the reviews are deserved, need no repetition here, but rightfully belong to the source. A guess, the remake was intended to become more edible junk for the native American mediocre - but it failed in spoiling the masterpiece, as pointed out already. So all the issue is about to earn more from the same work, in a new cover. Rating 8-9 for the origin, and -4 for the added value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unnecessary Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will fully admit that my opinion of Matt Reeves' Let Me In (2010) is entirely biased, as Tomas Alfredson's Let the Right One In (2008) was one of my favorite films of the decade. Going in, I thought to myself, "What exactly is the point in recreating a two year old film, that so many consider flawless?" My answer (at least in this case): There is no point. Reeves has emphasized in numerous interviews that he absolutely respects Alfredson's work and that he simply wanted to retell the story in a way that is more accessible to an American audience. Well, he certainly followed through with this statement. In terms of plot, these films are almost identical. However, Reeves took the simplicity and the subtle beauty of Let the Right One In and molded it into an exaggerated, classic Hollywood horror film. What I love about Let the Right One In is that it is just so real. Yes, vampires are fictitious, but this film truly exemplifies what life would be life for vampires if they walked this Earth. Eli is not intentionally evil or dangerous. She's just trying to survive. But, this is just my opinion and there are a number of ways to interpret Let the Right One In, but with Matt Reeves' Let Me In, various interpretations fade and our attention is directed to only one analysis. Now, I do not want to spoil anything, so I will not go into detail, but I can tell you through obvious exaggeration in narrative and aesthetic, Reeves took his interpretation of the Swedish story and tweaked it, using aspects of cliché Hollywood horror, to make that interpretation more defined and evident in his American version.Word of advice: Save yourself the $10.00 and watch the more genuine, well-crafted Let the Right One In on Instant Play Netflix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, the two main leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz did excellent work. But what I missed was the atmosphere. You just have Owen (Kodi) being bullied by some classmates. Then he meets a strange girl, Abby (Chloe) and they become friends, but she has a weird kind. She is actually a vampire. But for me things went wrong with the use of CGwhy (!) at the tunnel were she attacks one of her victims. Also, some transformations were done with CGI. But also, the movie takes way to long with times were they only talk and were nothing happens, did remind me of that other so-called vampire flick Twilight. It never becomes gory but the red stuff do flows but it was a bit lame. It's more about their relationship than about her abilities. I guess youth will find it good but for me it was just one of so many...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the Swedish original version, I was thrilled to see this American version! But I'm sorry to say that this was a disappointment! It looked like a cheap version made for television.The Swedish original version is so much more beautiful, the imagery and the scenery is really special in this version. Shot in a suburb to Stockholm during a snowy winter. I also think that the casting of the actors and the characters are better in the Swedish version. Even the special effects are better, for example how they've been giving Eli larger eyes in some scenes to intense the character.So try to get hold of the original Swedish version instead of this bleak copy!

		<shortDescription>Let Me In - Beautiful, Engrossing, Painfully Human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1992, I believe it was, "The Last of the Mohicans" starring Daniel Day-Lewis was released to a blockbuster reception by the public. It was exciting, well acted and beautiful. However, it was not a trans-literation (word for word) of the source novel by James Fenimore Cooper - far from it. Like many films that have novels as their story origin, you must endeavor to take the film on its own merits and not bemoan that what you loved in the book was not on the screen as you hoped. You can love both, one, or neither, but don't hate the one for being unlike the other.This is the problem many early critical reviewers of "Let Me In" seemed to fall into. They had loved the original Swedish book and film ("Let the Right One In"), but didn't like this American version because the tone and focus is slightly different. (An example would be Reeves' decision to make nearly all characters in the film outside the primaries into archetypes, not only simplifying the narrative, but also re-enforcing Owen's isolation - a brilliant choice.) Many critics said things like it's "a needless remake" or "not as faithful as the original" or some such. The damaging thing is that Matt Reeves' beautiful film was not taken on its own terms and therefore was not given a chance by some of the very audience it was made for."Let Me In" is beautiful, haunting, disturbing, painfully human and engrossing. The pace is deliberate, but spot-on. This was not made for the slasher film crowd. This is a movie that dares you to think what would life be like for a vampire and those around them. It works as a morality tale about, effectively, a serial killer. It also is the story about adolescence and the horrible pain of that age and the joy of finding a kindred spirit.What is disturbing is the questions that arise from the relationships in the film. Who needs who, for what reasons, and where does the line between 'love' and 'need' end and the other begin?The two leads in this film are stunning. No other word will suffice for their performances. They are brilliant and carry the film with their facial expressions. Moretz and Smit-McPhee deserve high praise for their work. Utterly amazing. (Compliments to the secondary players, Jenkins and Koteas, for excellent work as well.)One final thought, a great film is enhanced by a great musical score. Like "Mohicans", the music in "Let Me In" soars and makes this film an indispensable one.See "Let Me In" for all the right reasons. If you are a lover of film, this is a can't miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some directors who believe that it is necessary for female actresses to expose their breasts for no reason other than to possibly titillate male viewers. The director of 'Let me in' is certainly in this category, he managed to have a 'man caressing breast' scene at the beginning of the film and by doing this he seems to have totally missed the point of the story, where did he get the idea that Oskar age 12 would be spying on his neighbours with a telescope? incidentally this scene was neither in the brilliant 'Let the right one in' book by John Ajvide Lindqvist or in the Swedish film of the same name.I would recommend you watch 'Let the right one in' 10/10 which is far superior in many many ways (acting, characters, atmosphere etc) to 'Let me in'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember when it was I saw this, but it was in an old movie theater 30 minutes from where I lived. Just the start of the night was eerie. A couple of my buddies wanted to go see this movie, I knew nothing about it but never turn down a movie trip. After paying for the ticket and passing the booth, the lobby was empty.. completely silent, no one walking around, no noise. The only break in the dead silence was the Wall-e promotion that talked as you walked by, except it was gurgling more or less. We enter the actual movie theater, with 5 minutes to spare before start of the movie.. no one.. not a single person in any of the seats. It remained this way for the entire movie, no late comers, not even an usher to look around. With such freedom, we picked top row and I found a bucket of popcorn nearly full. Snatched the f (because the f word is apparently banned from IMDb) out of that and enjoyed free 10 dollar popcorn. The intro started and we relaxed to what we thought was gonna be at least a C level movie.Now that I've bored you with a needless story, let me preface by saying that is the extent of the good times i had watching the movie (not to mention the only parts I remember of that portion of the night). That short story about someone you don't care about and have zero interest reading about was how Let Me In's plot played out. It is a carbon copy of generic horror movies of it's time. Now, even if this came out before the likes of The Ring and The Grudge and so forth and so forth.. It was still terrible. The cgi was unnecessary, the character development was nonexistent, the twist was as creative as witch costumes on Halloween, and jump out scary parts were laughable at best. I rolled on the floor laughing when I saw the vampire cgi baby dialing on the cellphone, it nearly put me in tears, and I'm the kind of person who is scared very easily by jumpy kinda movies. To this day I still state "vampire baby dialing a phone" when ever it comes up in conversation.In general, I blocked this monstrosity of a movie from my mind. I literally don't remember any specific scenes other than that.Would I recommend this movie? For laughs, yes, maybe to some people I don't like, never to anyone I cared about or loved. This movie was stupid, boring, a joke of a horror movie, even worse than just about every crappy low budget horror films. I can honestly say I'd rather gouge my eyes out with cow dung and a dull, rusty spoon than watch this movie again. There are very few movies in my mind that I can say that about, a hypothetical action that was thought up while watching Epic Movie, the trash of a movie that was.Leaving the theater was like a breath of fresh air, and life. People were gathered around the theater that was previously abandoned, as well as employees actually maintaining upkeep. It was a completely different setting, I think the Wall-e promotion actually talked too. Leaving the once empty building, one of my buddy's phone began to ring. He looked down at it, and as soon as he did it stopped. The message Let Me In shone proudly and brightly across his screen. We all looked at each other and laughed into the cool, breezy darkness.See, I can write a better horror than Let Me In without even trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why let the wrong one in?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this movie is "Let Me In".But what is the point? Why should someone let just anyone in? Shouldn't the person you let in to a secret so big you can barely imagine you could tell it to anyone -at least be someone special?When I heard that Matt Reeves wanted to direct this movie because he was so impressed with the Swedish movie I expected him to have understood what the movie was about.When I watched "Let Me In" however I at first could find no sign that he would have understood the original film. How can Matt be so impressed by a movie even when he does not seem to understand it and spend time and money making a lookalike without any content from the original story and excuse the making of this lookalike by wanting to expose the story -story that he did not seem to include in the lookalike- to a larger audience?Then I realized... perhaps the understanding of the actual story of the original comes as a subconscious understanding to some. An understanding so disturbing they feel an overpowering need to censor the understanding away by theatrically materializing a pretense story over the real deal so they can forget the disturbing masterpiece.But to me "Let the Right One In" was not disturbing, but beautiful and tender movie of innocence and purity whereas "Let Me In" was truly a horror movie of normal people and the normal contents of their normal souls: sin, guilt, shame and self-deception.Perhaps this is how normal people react to the natural innocence of beastly souls, they think it is something from a horror movie so terrible you need to remake it the image of normal humans just to censor the natural bestiality away.The misogynistic world of metaphors that populated the original Swedish masterpiece and allowed the viewer to eventually actually realize what the title "Let The Right One In" within that story actually meant was kind of the entire point of the story and a deep philosophical and emotionally moving story it was too.It is arguably possible that a remake with a larger budget and with more expensive movie technology can possibly be a good thing, so I do not talk down on using big money or making remakes in general, but making a good remake is only possible if the story is included in it too.The only story in "Let Me In" that I found, was not what the movie itself was trying to tell me, but what the replacement of the masterfully deep, well balanced and natural world of the original story with western kitchen-psychological framework from evidently Christian cultural background told me about the color of the soul of the director.</fullReview>

"L?t den rätte komma in" is only a few years old, but already have Hollywood made a "remake" of an already good movie.More than that, they don't make it better! They completely ignore the issue of Abbeys sex and sexuality. Lei from the original movie was a boy, a castrated boy, but still a boy. In the end he and Oscar begin gay relationship.Hollywood throws this, one of the cornerstones of this story, in the bin, instead focusing in the old and boring concept of alienation and depression. I'm guessing Hollywood is too cowardly to bring this theme up, sure you can be gay while adult, but kids being homosexual? God Forbid! Thus, how good the writing and acting was, I can't bring myself to consider this movie good, since is just as worse remake of a already good, modern movie. I can't see anything but greed inspiring Hollywood taking this turn. They've already done this with the Millennium trilogy, and trust me, these won't be the last.In short, Hollywood is basically copying good foreign movies, because they can't seem to accept that their own superior position in the movie business is being contested, if not taken over, by Europe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The techs who 3D modeled the movie did these steaming pile of effects that distracted from the story. Perhaps as an attempt to cover up the poorly adapted screenplay. The characters did NOT possess the depth that the story demanded. The actors are not to blame, doing the best they could. The script writer clearly lacks the talent to connect the audience to the characters. They failed to connect to each other, for that matter. Clearly the story demanded for it. It is supposed to be a love story! The audience is just supposed to accept that these characters would love her so much that they would live just for her. Commit murder after murder just so she could live. where is the love? I mean this is a great sacrifice! This has to be shown in scenes and it wasn't. I couldn't see it in the way the characters acted towards each other. It made no sense in the American version. The love is shown in the Swedish version, in a subtle yet genuine way.I must say that the make up artist did an excellent job with the burn victim "father" figure. That was make up, not CGI. He even suggested that she didn't need a lot of make up. Yet they piled it on in post. She ended up looking like a Linda Blair ripoff. Did the director forget she is vampire and not Demon? She moved like a spider monkey. Either showing off their mad "skillz" or perhaps they where put under the gun to create some "snazzy" effects to impress the kids enough to watch this mess. "Hollywood" thinks people won't want to see a movie that doesn't have these inappropriate video game style "special effects." This is not Resident Evil. Not that there is anything wrong with that, this is just not supposed to be that kind of project. This entire movie ended up being done in 3-D modeling. They should have just made it an animated movie and marketed directly to preadolescences.I want to to know how much the 3-D modeling guys were paid to ruin this "Independent Film." The liars in Hollywood tried to slip it in... they think the American population is nothing but a bunch of dim witted F*cks who would not be able to grasp a simple beautiful literary work adapted for film.I am done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared to the original, not very good, but by no means awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let The Right One In was good for many reasons, Subtlety being one of them. Let Me In is not subtle. It constantly reminds you of what you're supposed to be thinking, how you should feel and what's happening while it's happening. The only scenes in the movie that works are scenes that are a complete rip-off of the original. Matt Reeves, however, is trying his hardest to make people think he didn't copy the original. "How", you may ask? By having the shot composition made differently in every single scene, he even goes so far as to invert the color on the credit sequence. Every single scene in Let The Right One In was meticulously packed with nuance and detail, helping every scene to convey so much, while doing so little. It's very important that Matt Reeves understood the original, otherwise the movie can become very incoherent and hard to follow, which at many times, Let Me In, is. For one: the scene where Owen finds out about Abby's caretaker, in which Owen leaves at the end and Abby responds with"I thought we could have been friends", which is profoundly confusing in the scheme of things. Or the scene where the cop (who apparently is unnamed) is suddenly going to Abby's apartment and breaking in. First of all: What cop would just break in with no warrant brandishing a weapon? None! It's just a movie cliché and a cheap attempt to make people worry about what's going to happen next. secondly: He doesn't even know who or what he's looking for, or if it's gonna be there. One of many annoying things about Let me in is that while the original had a second hand story about getting revenge for two of Lacke's best friends because of what Eli was doing to them, the remake decided to replace all this with a story of a cop that we don't even get to know the name of.Matt Reeves did not know what he was doing while making this film. He picked too many elements of the original film and remade them in a way that would pick up the attention of the audience because he didn't think the movie would be exciting enough for the audience to keep watching: Not only the incomprehensible dialogue and the B story about the cop, but also the warm color pallet the movie is filmed with which is a cheap attempt to make the movie more inviting and therefore make us care more about the characters through the use of deception and artifice. Contrast this with the original's ability to make us legitimately care for the characters despite the cold and very uninviting look of the film. This is a testament to the skill of the filmmakers to draw us in when we should be pushed away. The special effects too: the vampire aspect of the original was done with minimal special effects using real life whenever possible. Meanwhile the remake was naturally done with Hollywood-budget-cgi- effects, the more money you spend the less believable it is. Cgi effects is a norm for standard horror films these days, which is exactly why the originals effects were so refreshing. Isn't it much scarier when there's a little girl covered in blood rather than a cgi monster? Well, i think so at least.I must say i'm baffled to how overwhelmingly good the reviews of Let Me In have been. It has a 88 rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the consensus says the following: "Similar to the original in all the right ways - - but with enough changes to stand on its own -- Let Me In is the rare Hollywood remake that doesn't add insult to inspiration." Let The Right One In is so good that not even the Hollywood remake could screw it up, apparently. The sad thing is that more people have seen the remake than the original. Why was this movie even made? When i first asked that question to myself i thought because the director literally thought he could improve it (which he didn't!), later on i think i'm getting the impression that it was made because Hollywood was out of ideas. My latest implication is that it was made because Americans are so averse to reading subtitles. Now, i'm 18 years old and i have been reading movie subtitles since i was 7-8. Before that i would only watch movies in my native language, or if i watched a movie in English i would have my mom explaining to me what's happening or what they're talking about. I personally find it completely ridiculous that a remake would be made just because people wouldn't have to read the subtitles, if that is the case, of course. The director of Let The Right One In Tomas Alfredson, hated the idea that his movie was being remade. To quote Alfredson himself: "Remakes should be made of movies that aren't very good. That gives you the chance to fix whatever has gone wrong", what was wrong with Let the Right One In? Nothing! So i suggest that out of the two or if you want to watch them both; Go watch the original first. If you watch the original before the remake, you will understand what the remake was missing out on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior vampire movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the Swedish movie "Let The Right One In," "Let Me In" is a complex story of love, loneliness, bullying, absentee parents, the need for companionship, and what people are willing to do to for those they love?and yes, this is a vampire story, and a reasonably scary one at that.Taking place in 1983 (a time before security cameras and cell phones were everywhere), Kodi Smit-McPhee plays an unhappy boy who doesn't have any friends, has parents who are separated, and gets bullied by three boys who are each twice his size. His life is about to get very interesting ? for better and worse ? when new neighbors arrive at night to his apartment complex. Enter Chloe Grace Moretz (as a little girl who only appears at night, and who is accompanied by an old man presumed to be her father). Moretz and McPhee have their first meeting in the snowy playground, she being barefoot and quite hostile to McPhee's presence; but as time goes on, a trust between them forms, leading to a strong bond that will be tested when Moretz's true nature is revealed to McPhee and the body count rises and the police slowly figure out who is doing the killings.My most memorable, movie moment of "Let Me In" is the scene when McPhee finally fights back against his bullies. Holding a large stick, McPhee faces off against his three tormentors. Lead bully says he is going to take the stick away from McPhee and shove it up McPhee's ass. Lead bully takes a step forward and McPhee hits him on the face with the stick. In what seems to be slow motion, lead bully stops, falls on his knees, and then starts screaming like a bitch. At first I thought the bully was just a punk who couldn't take a little hit, but then it is shown that the bully's left ear has been ripped almost in half! Oh, well, serves him right."Let Me In" stands apart from the other vampire movies because the two main characters are played by little kids, and we get to see the evolution of the relationship of these two outcasts go from being strangers to lovers (using the word's most simple definition). I enjoyed the amazing performances of McPhee and Moretz, the outstanding direction of Matt Reeves, and the tight screenplay that moved things along fairly quickly even with scenes that were "slow." One major complaint though?a shenanigan, actually. Why did Moretz let the old guy do most of the hunting for victims? Although small in stature, Moretz had the strength of about 10 men, so she could easily hunt for herself; or better yet, she should hunt with the old guy so that the chances of success would be much higher. This is the biggest flaw I noticed in this movie; but no movie is perfect, and I thoroughly enjoyed this story despite this huge shenanigan. Vampire fans should not miss "Let Me In" as it's one of the better vampire flicks out there in the past 10 years.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe you know already, it's the remake of "Let the right one in" which surprisingly is only a few years older.I watched that too, it was an interesting &amp; very dark story about the (complicated, of course) relationship between a young vampire girl and a loner boy.I really don't want to join the discussion pro/contra remakes, but the original from Sweden worked for me because of it's cold touch. Dark, hopeless, depressing, violent and the characters fit that criteria. A movie with depressing content can be interesting and fun to watch as well, if you know what i mean.*If* they stick with it. And here is where the remake fails. The characters are adapted to main stream audience. The vampire girl looks too normal and accessible. Yes she still turns into a beast when the time comes, but it's not the same. She didn't give me that strange feeling. Similar goes for most characters. The boy just seems lost, while in the original i kept thinking "Yea that's a serial killer in the making".The story thou, it's almost identical. If you already watched the first movie, then it's a complete waste of time. The few different parts, i had the feeling they were left out because they didn't want to confuse.4/10 because they didn't make it too cheesy (you can look forward to some bloody murders and vampire stuff), but in the end it's only a cash crab and people should watch the original if they have to choose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of Tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film immediately after having watched the original version, and it bored me. Part of this could be because I already knew what was going to happen and there were subsequently no surprises, but I've seen many scary films over and over again and the best ones still mesmerise.They ramped up the vampire special effects in some places and went in a bit harder on the school bullying, but even though special care was taken with Moretz' character in replicating the look of a homeless twelve-year-old girl, the brooding subtleties of a young girl living in the cocoon of an eternal vampire were sadly lost. Yes, we saw a metamorphosis between a young girl and rabid-eyed vampire on a regular basis, but we didn't see the intermittent skin discolouration and general change in well-being that we perceived so unnervingly in the original film, including greasy hair and scabby nails.The biggest flaw, however, was the lack of tension between the main two actors, such as subtle differences in feelings and physiognomy being less apparent. The original film has a stark, almost trance-like beauty about it, which I just couldn't find here.The relationship between Eli and her father was all wrong as well. It's portrayed as a bitter, condemning relationship, instead of a sad and tender one. Something that the first film captured well.I guess that because I'd already seen the original film and liked it so much, this version of the film had little impact, but I kept on asking myself "what's the point" of this film, just because people don't like paying to see/renting, or even downloading, foreign language films. But I guess that is the point. An English version with American settings would get greater exposure and introduce people to the original, much better film.I didn't really enjoy this movie because it's a carbon copy of a better film in a different language, but if you can't get hold of the original 'Let The Right One In' (Lat den ratte komma in) and really don't like watching films with subtitles, then get hold of a copy of this. It's still worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well done film that is interesting, has a steady pace and is edited finely to keep the viewer interested.Needless to say it pales in comparison to the Swedish original particularly the brilliant casting of the 2 young lead actors that is simply so captivating, and timelessly unforgettable.The films young actor and actress leads do a fine job attempting to show the hell bent bond that is slowly building between them. The exception being the exchange in the common area in which Abby's age-or lack of an explanation of it-seems somewhat canned. Perhaps this conversation could have been better however that is somewhat minor.I loved the 80's setting that I remember so fondly and the social mixing at the video arcade that today's poor kids only experience from behind a video monitor and not in real life.Some of the plot changes from the Swedish film are right on time the addition of a detective investigating the bizarre crimes along with the elimination of the scenes from the Pub that made little sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching this, I had no idea it was a horror story about a vampire. But the vamp is a pre-teen instead of in high school. The story was slow moving but creepy as we get short snipits of what Abby is like in her other form. There is also a brutal murder in the beginning that had me saying, "what!!!" But later it makes sense. Abby has just moved to a new place and befriends another kid, Owen. She tells him they can't be friends, but soon forgets that. But, when Owen sees her doing strange things, he basically over looks it since she's his only friend. There's also a gruesome pouring acid on your head scene. But this movie is more about the characters and acting then gory parts.FINAL VERDICT: Different take on vampire movies. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully expressive throughout this film takes the vampire genre to heights seldom attained by other movies. Out with the formulaic story and in with a skillfully crafted tale which would be just as eye catching were there not a vampire in sight. But the vampire content gives it an edge that is almost, daft as it may sound, more human. We have feelings for the characters because of the way we are presented with them.Go and see this just as an introduction to how horror movies should be made. Yes we must be shocked. But we must also understand why we are shocked and this film gives us the chance to understand and feel something more about it rather than just something we would rather not think about or watch.It is compelling to watch with absolute blindingly good performances from the two young leads Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz and excellence elsewhere from the support.This is a very special horror movie which is every bit as good as the original.

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary? No...Lacking Details: Yes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard most people say that this movie was unnecessary to remake. I hadn't seen the other movie or read the book yet when I saw this movie. I've seen the Swedish version, and I'm currently reading the book, so I guess you can say that I'm going backward. I don't necessarily believe that this remake was unnecessary, but I feel like the adaptation of this version was somewhat confusing. I see now why the detective didn't need to be in this movie, and why they didn't need to show the man in the hospital in the beginning. I'm still not sure what the relationship is between the man and Abby, and I didn't understand why she had to be invited in each time she entered a room. I didn't understand the significance of the lady Abby killed later on. Another thing I didn't understand was why Owen was singing the "Now and Later" candy theme song at the end of the movie. I really wanted to know Abby's purpose more in this movie other than the fact that she needed blood to survive. As I'm reading the book, I see a lot more detail as far as what the author was telling about sexual activity, but It's pretty deep as to what these older men are doing, and I'm understanding Eli's (Abby's) story a little more in the book. I believe this goes a little deeper than a vampire and a fight against bullying. Maybe some things that are people aren't ready to see here in the United States. All and all, it was an OK movie. For me, it just sort of lacked detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great film and well worth watching. The only thing I really found awkward were some of the bullying scenes. The bullying is a bit over the top and more likely in an inner-city school than small town. However, assume that it's typical. The problem is that the settings are so improbable. One setting is an open frozen pond with teacher and other students around. It's simply not an environment for concealing bullying. Also, a pool filled with students completely clears out allowing for the bullying to take place there and in the adjoining locker-room. But where did the students go? Dripping wet in swimsuits and out in the night in the dead of winter without any stop in the locker room for clothes, car-keys, etc? Someone didn't think some of this through very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get the right one in..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite simple ? if you want to watch the most original, eerie, expertly crafted and beautifully shot vampire movies in a generation, do not rent Let Me In. Instead you should rent Let The Right One In, the Swedish film on which Let Me In is based (along with the original novel). All the things that make the remake any good are because they are virtually identical to the original (almost entire scenes are carbon copies). All the things that make the remake inferior and surplus to requirements are when they have embellished (often through poor CGI) some of the more vampiric characteristics of the lead female protagonist. Let The Right One In is an excellent character story about the relationship between two children, made complex by circumstances seemingly beyond their control ? one of these circumstance (but not the sole) being that the girl happens to be a vampire. Let Me In, on the other hand, is a vampire film with kids in it. Not the same thing. Do yourself and the cause of world cinema a favour and rent the original instead. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let Me In is a remake of the Let the Right One In film from a country I can't remember. I saw the original and honestly this one hits pretty close to it the only reason why I probably like it better is because I didn't have to read it.So the story goes as this creepy kid is being mercilessly bullied at school so he is a little nuts and then this mysterious girl moves in next door with a man who could be her father. So these two become friends then it turns out she is a vampire and needs to feed or she will turn into this animalistic stage and just kill people at random. Compared to the Twilight vampires this little girl is a beast.The characters are all interesting the little girl and the boy really work together and the bullies seemed like real bullies not to over exaggerated. I honestly didn't like the main character played by Kodi Smit-McPhee for two reasons one he is way too psycho for me to root for him and for some reason that every movie I see this kid in he whines it annoys the hell out of me. Richard Jenkins is great as the care taker for the little girl he is such a mystery character and you can tell he feel terrible for the things he has done.The pace in this movie is slow I think they could've had more going on but that doesn't ruin the movie. Another problem was the special effect were so noticeable it did take me out of the movie and that did ruin the experience a little bit.Overall this is a high rental film I say see it once you will be happy there is no reason to watch this again.</fullReview>

This film will draw you in and lull you almost to sleep, then toss a cold bucket of water over your head to wake you. To truly enjoy this movie you must let yourself go, this can be difficult but it makes a viewing experience much more enjoyable. The veil of innocence over Abby makes you begin to feel for this character even though she is not necessarily good. Because of the slow quiet pacing the violent scenes are that much more horrifying. And to add in youth to those factors makes the film strangely disturbing and detached. All in all masterfully done and butifully shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>almost as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of the original, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, have probably been following news of the remake LET ME IN since it was announced and already know what the movie is about and who stars in it. For those who don't, LET ME IN is based on the original film and novel and written and directed for the screen by Matt Reeves, who also directed the 2007 monster thriller, CLOVERFIELD. The film is set in the 80's and centers around two twelve year-olds, who first meet at the neighborhood jungle gym. It stars Chloe Moretz as Abby, the twelve year-old girl who moves into the small town in New Mexico and quickly befriends a little boy, Owen, who is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee. Supporting cast members include Elias Koteas, who stars as the town policeman and Richard Jenkins as "The Father" or caretaker of Abby. There is a catch though, Abby doesn't seem like a normal twelve year-old girl; she doesn't wear shoes, only comes out at night, and doesn't even go to school. She is a vampire.Within the first few minutes of the film, it becomes well-known that Owen is bullied by his other classmates on a daily basis and doesn't really have any friends. He lives with his mother who has recently separated from his father and spends most nights alone pretending to get revenge on his classmates or peeking into windows of his neighbors across the way with his telescope. After a few nights have passed, Abby appears at the jungle gym and starts out by saying she cannot be friends with Owen. He finds the shoeless girl a little odd, but considering this is probably the first time he has gotten "attention" from someone in weeks, he strikes up a conversation with her anyways. The two children continue to meet in the courtyard and develop a relationship.Considering the majority of the screen time is shared between Owen and Abby; the two young and talented actors who played them were excellent choices for the roles. Both of the actors have shown a lot of promise in their short careers and hint at a bright future for themselves. Even though Chloe Moretz is the more well-known actor of the two, I think Kodi Smit-McPhee out-performed her and the character itself matched the original "Oskar" more closely. His "toothpick" build and awkward body language only helped contribute to the believability of him being an easy target at school for bullies to pick on. It's a true portrayal of a lonely child looking for anything to cling on to in hopes to be accepted by someone for once.Matt Reeves pulled off quite a "feat" by sticking to the original core of the story while adding a few of his own kinks at the same time to bring new life to the screen. Not to discredit the director, but I do think he had unfair advantage compared to the original though. Reeves was given more money to "play" with on set and the luxury to use the original film as a "cheat-sheet." One noticeable and notable complaint I have for the film is the use of CG. Although the scenes were entertaining, it looked rather fake and took me out of the film a little. From the trailer, LET ME IN looks almost like a shot for shot remake of the original, and although there are some very familiar scenes, there are enough changes for each film to stand on their own. Some plot elements are completely removed or changed, but done so in a tasteful way that will not distract or disappoint fans of the original. For making it his own, I give Reeves a ton of credit and thank him for not completely ripping off the original.I have seen the original nearly a dozen times and every time it is as engaging as the first viewing. The story of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is so rich and has a lot more to offer than just what's brought to the surface in the film. Many different audiences should appreciate LET ME IN because it can fall into categories other than just a vampire movie. Fans of drama, horror, vampires, and even the TWILIGHT fans are all target audiences. I liked some of the little touches Matt Reeves added to the film, even the way he chose to open it, but I don't want to discuss them and I will leave it up to the audience to discover them on their own. If LET THE RIGHT ONE in is a 10, LET ME IN is a 9. I adore them both as separate films.</fullReview>

Meanwhile, Abby's father is a wanted serial-killer that drains the blood of his victims to supply Abby, who is actually an ancient vampire. Abby advises Owen to react to Kenny fighting back; however, sooner he discovers that she is a vampire and he feels fear and love for the girl. Meanwhile a police officer is investigating the murder cases believing that it is a satanic cult.I Saw This In Cinemas And To Be Honest - With All The Other Remakes That Are Coming And Turning Out To Be Crap - I Was Pleasantly Surprised(I Thought That This Would Be Like Twilight - BOY WAS I WRONG).I Will First Talk About The Acting.

I Also Feel That This Needed The Scene Where Owen And Abby Talk About The Dark Side Of Humanity Because That Was The Most Well Written Scene Out Of The Original.As Far As Character Development Goes, This Movie Is Great At It. I Found Myself Caring For The Characters And The Two Lead's Relationship.The One Major Problem I Have With This Movie Is Its Existence. I'm Not Saying Its A Bad Movie But Why Did They Remake This? What Was Wrong With The Original? A Problem That Occurs In Both Movies Is That It Is Left On A Cliffhanger And It Just Doesn't Feel Right.As Far As I Am Concerned If Anyone Says That All Remakes Coming Out Are Crap Should Watch This. I Am Not Saying F##k The Swedish Version But This Is The Most Half Descent Remake Out There.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood has come out with some great vampire movies. They were original ideas. When they borrow ideas from so s.w.e.d.i.s.h. guy who does not know what doing. And every one says he is a genius. When really he is just an amateur film maker. Who would not know how to make a good vampire movie if his life depended on it. No it is not creepy. The brides of Dracula and Nosferatu are creepy. This is just stupid. There is a little girl vampire going on a killing spree. She falls in love with the little boy who lives next door. The s.w.e.d.i.s.h can not see how stupid that is. And apparently nether can Hollywood. The story line in this movie is awful. The ending is so stupid. Good actors wasted there talent being in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film without knowing anything about it so did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and as a result have developed a bit of an addiction to the story.I have now watched the original Let The Right One In, have just about finished the book, and recently saw a stage adaptation at the Royal Court Theatre in London by the National Theatre of Scotland (well worth seeing if you get the opportunity).The acting from the lead characters, Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit- McPhee is excellent, and for two people so young they brilliantly portray their growing relationship. Smit-Mcphee is brilliant as Owen (Oskar) when it comes to the bullying scenes and portrays his lonely, introverted character with just the right amount of 'weirdness' required for the character. Moretz is great throughout and it was clear that from her portrayal of Abby (Eli) she was going on to much bigger projects.The supporting cast is also very strong with Richard Jenkins as The Father (Hakan) showing his sinister devotion to Abby admirably.Abby's intentions and overall character can be interpreted in a number of different ways however it is not for me to influence and therefore leave this up to you to form your own opinions.The downside for me with this film is the ongoing score, which never lets up. Silence could have been used to great effect in some moments of the film and I feel this was a wasted opportunity.This is not your traditional vampire movie with lashings of blood and gore (although there is enough to keep people happy), but is more of a story of friendship, love and devotion.All in all, an excellent and underrated film massively passed over by mainstream media.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me in is a true masterpiece. It's one of those rare movies were everything that makes cinema interesting and entertaining comes together perfectly. Superb acting, cinematography and score. Great adaptation of the book keeping the raw feel of the extraordinary situation gritty and grim as it should be.Lead actors Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloë Grace Moretz are in my opinion true revelations. Their acting talent and maturity give the story so much punch that you won't know what hit you.This is, of course, a remake of the Swedish movie. I have seen both and I think that this version is much, much better in every respect. Let me in will touch you in so many ways that your life will never be the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Let Me In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is a remake of the successful Swedish horror Let The Right One In [2008] and despite not having seen this I am led to believe sticks to the storyline extremely closely. This is not what I would call your typical vampire movie with the vampire taking shape in the form of a 12 year old girl Abby (Chloe Moretz) and not a wooden stake to be seen. If anything it is more of an emotional love story.We start, as is the growing trend these days at some unspecified point in the future with a man being rushed to hospital finding out along the way that he is the prime suspect in several murders occurring around the sleepy backwater town of Los Alamos, New Mexico. Whilst is left alone in his hospital room he jumps from the window to his death.Rewind two weeks where we are introduced to Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) a boy who is bullied at school by three of his peers and whose parents are currently going through a divorce leaving him somewhat of an introvert and lacking confidence. The director is clever in that the father is never seen and the mother is only in scenes briefly so we do not get to know her which means we really only get to know Owen and hence share his loneliness. With the arrival of Abby and her father though, he finds happiness in her company and the pair create a friendship that Mortez and Smit-McPhee act out excellently.Alongside this growing friendship is the more sinister hunt for fresh blood which leads to the disappearance of some locals and the police search that ensues. Where many vampire movies head down the vicious mass murdering group who go around killing for fun this paints the picture of a much more calculated sect who kill to survive and are aware that many killings will lead to too many questions being asked and them eventually being found. It is a means to survive nothing else.There were some well crafted pieces of cinematography with one scene in particular involving a car crash making up for the poor use of CGI and special effects (that were thankfully infrequent) which would be more in line with a lower budget production.The background and history of Abby and her father is kept vague for most of the movie which invites the viewer to create their own past for them, suffice to say that we are assume they have been around a long time. This leads to an interesting question that wasn't really answered- if Abby had been around a long time trapped in a 12 year old body surely her mind would have grown up? Yes there is a sense of maturity surrounding her but at the same time she never really shakes off that sense of still actually being an innocent kid. Perhaps this was intentional and shows the innocence of youth prevailing over the evil within. Either way Mortez is fantastic at depicting her character showing us that she has a very bright future in the industry.When I sat down to watch Let Me In I was not expecting what was served up before me. Luckily though it was a pleasant surprise as the movie gets you hooked at the start and thanks to the great on screen chemistry between Mortez and Smit-McPhee keeps you engaged right up until the credits start rolling. Definitely worth a watch.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake is not that much different from the original and it's worth watching. But if you don't have a problem with subtitles you should rather see the Swedish original as I think it has a greater feeling. But I might be somewhat biased since I'm Swedish.I would say that this remake is a 7 and the original is a 8,5 or maybe even a 9.The book is good as well and even if I read it after I saw the original I thought it was a good based on a novel movie(both).Now lets see how good the remakes of the Millennium-movies/-books will be. I really hope those will be at least as good as this one.</fullReview>

Chloe Moretz did a very good job in this role.While, a horror film, it was more. It was a love story between Abby and Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who accepted her just as she was.Definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Let Me In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pitch: Haven't I seen you somewhere before? The Review: Hollywood does many things well, and one it seems to do extremely well is to make a complete Horlicks of remaking successful foreign films, either losing the essence of what made them so special in the first place or adding in element that don't work in context. There's a spate of high profile instances going through the production cycle at present, and it's two of the Scandinavian movies that have won widespread acclaim in the last couple of years that are currently getting the most attention. The first out of the box is Cloverfield director Matt Reeves with his re-imagining of the Swedish classic, Let The Right One In.First of all, re-imagining may be too strong a word for what Reeves has done. Claims that he's returned to the source material prove unfounded and there is, in places, an almost slavish dedication to recapturing the look and feel of the predecessor, to the extent that you have to pinch yourself as a reminder that this is set in New Mexico, not Northern Europe. While Reeves has made a few attempts to distance himself from the original, at times this has the feel of a shot for shot remake in the style of Van Sant's Psycho or Haneke's English language Funny Games, and feels about as essential as either ? in other words, not at all if you've any familiarity with the first film.So to those areas where the differences come in, and this is still a story about a young boy who's isolated and ends up living next door to someone who gradually reveals their secret, except now they're called Owen and Abby instead of Oscar and Eli. There's one change, in the modus operandi of Abby's guardian, which leads to a stunning set piece seen from a fixed viewpoint at the back of a car that equals and, whisper it, possible even betters anything in the original. Additionally, we never see Owen's mother clearly, which serves to reinforce his sense of isolation. But apart from that, other than the casting, any other changes actually work against the overall feel, including some ill-advised CGI which serves to take you out of the scene rather than further into it.The casting, though, is about as impeccable as you could possibly hope for in such a situation. Chloe Moretz, while occasionally less androgynous in appearance than her Swedish counterpart, still nails the role of the creature years beyond her young appearance, while Kodi Smit-McPhee, Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas round out an excellent central cast. Michael Giacchino's score is also moodily effective and worth a mention. But other than that, this first film from the relaunched Hammer studios feels like the safest possible bet that they could have made. So let's be clear ? it's a great film, but the original was outstanding, and is so recent that I bought it on Blu-ray as soon as it came out. Imagine having been given an orange flavoured, chocolate covered cake snack from a supermarket's own range when you already own a packet of Jaffa Cakes ? why would you not just eat the Jaffa Cakes? Why see it at the cinema: The car set piece deserves a view on the big screen, and this is absolutely dripping in atmosphere. It's also a real thrill to see the Hammer logo on the big screen, and long may it remain. But if you've encountered the original, then move along, for there's nothing to see here.The Score: 8/10 (Author's note: I was eating Jaffa Cakes at the time of writing.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very often I get disappointed with the American remakes of movies from around the world (Like "Quarantine" or "Hachiko: A Dog's Story"). In some cases, the American remakes are as good or even better than the original movie (Like "The Ring" or "The Grudge").In this case, I was looking forward to see this film, because I really enjoyed the original one. I can say it is good, entertaining and sometimes scary. Acting, and directing are really adequate, the score and photography are superb.However, I really felt that a big part of the success of this feature was the fact that it is almost the same movie as the original "Let The Right One In". There are several scenes in this that look like a "copy/paste" work.One could say: OK, this is because both films are based on the same book source. Well, it is not. This American version feels like a superficial, politically correct digest version of the Sweddish one.I don't want to be too hard on this movie and keep comparing it with the original Sweddish film, but this is nearly impossible since here in Mexico City "Let The Right One In" was one of the most popular movies of all time and, without a doubt, the most popular European movie ever. In 2009, when it was first showed in my community, it lasted over six months in theaters.So, if you really don't feel like reading when going to the movies (If English is your native language, of course) this is a very good option for a vampire flick, and it is very refreshing considering what vampire movies are nowadays. Otherwise, you should really give the Sweddish version a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, disturbing and at times heart warming, but better than the original? Mmmm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes I have seen the original Swedish film 'Let the Right One In' (2008), and yes I enjoyed it very much. Based on the Swedish book of the same name by John Lindqvist 'Let the Right One In' is a unique and touching, but very unsettling vampire/love story that wowed the film critics and created legions of followers. So what happens when a foreign film wows critics and creates legions of followers? A Hollywood remake is inevitably announced, followed by much groaning from fans. After watching the sublime 'LTROI', I too thought that a Hollywood remake would never capture the heart and soul of the film. I awaited the wave of reviews that would pan a giant critical stake through its heart. However I was rather surprised to find the critics didn't pancake the film much at all? in fact they pretty darn liked it, with many calling it a powerful and chilling film that equals if not surpasses the original. So I bought a ticket and went to see for myself.If you're unfamiliar with the story here is a brief synopsis; boy meets girl, boy likes girl, girl likes boy, girl turns out to be a vicious vampire offing the locals. So the plot is not hard to follow which is the beauty of the story created by Lindqvist; simple but very effective. Australian child actor Kodi Smit-McPhee plays the boy Owen, one of the most pitiable characters you will ever see. Smit-McPhee is perfect for the role, skinny and feeble, you can't help but sympathise for this poor kid as he gets viciously bullied at school, neglected at home while his parents are going through a bitter divorce, and is just generally friendless and lonely. That is until his life changes drastically when a new girl Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), moves in next door with her apparent father (Richard Jenkins), and he meets her continuously in the courtyard outside for the next few nights. There is nothing sweeter than young love, and thanks to the considerable talents of McPhee and Moretz, Owen and Abby's relationship is a real charmer, starting off as a budding friendship and then blossoming into love as the film progresses. However is it really all so sweet and sugary when the girl is a bloodthirsty monster? Ummm? not really.Director Matt Reeves has wisely kept the story near identical to the original, although there are notable differences. The story focuses entirely on Owen and Abby; the secondary characters appear only when they have to. Even Owens's mum and dad are largely absent, with his mum being a faceless presence and his Dad being a voice on the phone. This makes the film much more confined and claustrophobic than the original, and I think it is an improvement. You really feel the loneliness and emptiness of Owen's world, where strangely the only person who shows any love and humanity to him is an unholy creature. Also changed is the visual style and feel, with the original film having a dreamy surreal quality to it, where as this is much more dark and gritty. If the original film is a dark dream, then this film is positively a nightmare. The murders in this film are much more intense and disturbing, with Abby turning into a creature that shrieks unholy noises and bashes her screaming victims' heads against walls, before feasting. The way she quickly turns from a seemingly sweet 12 year old girl into a demon, is the most horrifying aspect of this film. Another slightly altered feature is Abby's caretaker played fantastically by Richard Jenkins. In this he is a more sympathetic character and it is strongly hinted that he was once like Owen in love with Abby as a young boy, but was manipulated by her to become her caretaker for life, and you have a feeling that he is more trapped and lonely than even Owen.Which begs the question, is Abby a monster or a victim? Which way you decide completely alters the film. If Abby is indeed a monster, then she is one of the most heartless and evilest villains to have ever graced a screen. Making Owen believe that they are in love, and manipulating him into being her next caretaker, until he becomes "old and "sloppy" like Richard Jenkins character became, and is disposed when she finds another. Or is she a victim as much as anyone else, and is only doing what she does to survive, and is very much in love with Owen. They are two halves of a whole that complete each other when together. She giving him the companionship he craves, and he making her feel human again. The latter is how I see it, and I'm sure most people do to.With the whole film resting on their shoulders McPhee and Moretz are absolutely fantastic. Moretz in particular is a real star, having already blown up the screen in 'Kick Ass', she is again amazing in this film, giving Abby the right amount of innocence and menace, seriously this girl is destined for great things. I preferred McPhee's version of Owen/Oskar, he showed more emotion, and some scenes he did were truly heartbreaking. Jenkins and Elias Koteas as the cop hunting Abby do the best with the little screen time they have, and it is a shame both don't appear more. Credit must also go to Matt Reeves for sticking as close to the original as possible, and the changes he has made I feel better the film. By simplifying the story even further by focusing on Owen and Abby, Reeves has constructed a film that is disturbing and emotional, but with a very human heart at its core. Better than the original? I can't say, though I did prefer this film's version of the two central characters, so I feel my answer would be yes. There may be hope for Hollywood remakes after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid, brutal and offensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2008 Swedish vampire movie Let the Right One In is fantastic. When I saw Let Me In described as a close remake - even criticized by many critics for being TOO close - I decided to give it a try. I could have saved my money. The bare plot and some of the dialog may be similar, but the two movies are as different as night and day.The Swedish original is quiet, eerily calm, subtle, brooding, chilling, and unlike any other movie ever made. It creates an entirely new and fascinating type of vampire movie. This remake is a Hollywood horror movie stuck onto a Hollywood action movie stuck onto a Hollywood slasher movie stuck onto a Hollywood vampire movie stuck onto a Hollywood tween romance movie.This movie is far more violent than the original, both physically and emotionally. The Swedes make calm terrifying, but that's too subtle for Hollywood. A threat of violence is no good without the violence itself, and plenty of it.In this movie, the boy gets beaten savagely by the bullies, because in Hollywood a threatening look or flicking the tip of his nose isn't violent enough; it has to be a bone-shattering blow to the jaw and multiple kicks in the gut (these are 12-year-olds, remember).And something that may seem small but is of great significance is what the bullies call the boy - and what he, therefore, calls them in his fantasies. In the Swedish original they call him a pig; in Hollywood they call him a little girl.It's no longer cool in Hollywood for boys to call each other "fa9got", but "little girl" means EXACTLY the same thing in a context like this. They're saying he's not tough like a dude, he's weak and despicable, like a girl or a fa9got."Pig" offends nobody but the one being called it and pigs. "Little girl" offends girls, and by association (since this is what the bullies actually mean but can't say in Hollywood any more) non-macho boys - that is, gay boys - as well. I don't understand why women and gays aren't screaming their heads off about this movie.So Hollywood has turned an innocuous but effective enough insult into a brutal, sexist, homophobic expression of contempt for all of the human race except macho straight men. That's typical and totally predictable for Hollywood, but it's also a telling example of only one of many ways they've brutalized this movie to enhance its appeal to the straight adolescent male goons who are now Hollywood's primary audience.Hollywood couldn't stop with just brutalizing characters' behavior and sexualizing their insults; they also had to blast away any trace of the sexual ambiguity that's key to the book and present to a reduced extent in the Swedish movie. In both of those, the girl vampire is in fact a castrated boy (in the book but not the Swedish movie, he's also a victim of pedophilia).But such a character would make Hollywood's straight male goon audience rip up the seats and throw them at the screen. So they had to make her all-girl, and they replaced that dark sexual ambiguity with truckloads of creepy Reaganism and tired, stereotyped Christian fundamentalism. The result is moronic, about as subtle and interesting and worthwhile as dinner with Ron and Nancy Reagan.Let Me In is Hollywood garbage, worth seeing ONLY by the typical Hollywood adolescent male audience and other people who are too stupid to read subtitles. Let the Right One In is an infinitely better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst kind of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a "not half bad" remake of, what many consider, a masterpiece. I urge everyone to watch the original, "Let the Right One In", first. If "Let Me In" is watched first, you will likely be contaminated. "Let Me In" elaborates, and embellishes "Let the Right One In" while removing many of the nuances.Deciding to recreate "Let The Right One In" is like deciding to recreate the Mona Lisa. Sure, the recreation will be decent, as it is based on masterpiece, but every embellishment made will make it worse, not better, because the original was already perfect.Embellishments made in "Let Me In" include, actors, location, language, cinematography, music, dialog, and story.For me, the area the bothered me most was the lack of a feeling of relief when Owen and Abby meet. I just do not get the feeling that they love each other. The chemistry between the actors just didn't compare to original.Also, the bullies in this film are along the lines of truly evil. They don't pick on Owen for a laugh and maybe occasionally go overboard. These guys are deliberate, cold blooded, and seemingly put on earth for the sole purpose of making Owen's life a living hell. They are unrelatable and unrealistic.This is not a bad movie, but it is still a travesty of a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young Owen lives with his religious mother in an apartment complex in Los Alamos, New Mexico. He is a quiet child, bullied at school, he sits in the snow covered playground of the complex at night waiting for dinner and spies on the neighbours through his telescope from his bedroom. One night he sees a man and a young girl move into the next apartment and later he meets her in the playground. Eventually they befriend each other and spend the evenings talking or tapping on the wall in Morse code, but Abby isn't what she seems. Something evil is in her, a lust for blood and after some bungled attempts by her 'father', Abby takes matters into her own hands. Owen meanwhile continues to get bullied, but encouraged by Abby suddenly fights back, but this leads the bullies wanting further revenge which leads to horrific outcome.Let Me In is the American remake of the the brilliant Swedish horror Let The Right One In. It is for the most part an exact remake, albeit in a new setting and the film's plot changes slightly. There are however some major differences, one being the style; in the Swedish version the style is almost abstract with it's camera angles and stylized use of colour, the American one is more standard. Abby also is slightly different, being cleaner than her Swedish version and when feeding becomes more evil in appearance with deathly eyes staring into the camera. Yet there is little of note worthy change hear, the bullies are still nasty, there is still a touching moving element to Abby and Owens friendship and the film still holds a punch in certain scenes, although one noticeable scene missing is the cat lady and the cats going berserk.It is difficult to watch this and not compare the two films, they both stand out as great pieces of work and both are fine examples of the vampire genre movie that is firmly miles away from the Twilight type stories. Yet perhaps if you have viewed the Swedish version, it's difficult to watch this and not know what's coming, it doesn't have the element of surprise unless you view this first. Whilst it is a good film, it also doesn't seem to match the original for style and direction with the Swedish version being a far superior film that presents a far more involving and emotional yet beautiful and fascinating story.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the right one in vs. Let me in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While both movies were good, I did like one better than the other. The American language version Let me in stayed very close to the original Swedish Let the right one in. The American version did a great job sticking to type for the characters. The actors looked very similar to the original. The location was also duplicated very well. I like how in the American version the vampire Abby was barefoot in the middle of winter from the beginning. That made the audience uncomfortable right away.But other things added didn't add to the story at all. The most glaring omission or rather addition was that of the police officer vs. the woman from the neighborhood. (Spoiler alert) In Let the right one in the vampire Eli "turns" a woman from the neighborhood. There was also the nosey man from the neighborhood that got it in the end. There was no reason for the police officer in Let me in that added to the story line at all.I hated the special effects in the American version when Abby attacked. It was so much more believable in Let the right one in when she just jumped on her attacker. The effects in the American version were cheesy and distracting. Just because you can use a special effect doesn't mean you should.American movies seem to spell things out a little too much. Case in point was the boardwalk picture. I believe that American audiences would have been savvy enough to figure out the nature Abby and her guardian's relationship and the fate that stands ahead for Owen, her 12 year old friend.So, overall I think Let the right one in wins as the better movie to see; as long as you don't mind subtitles.www.rivareviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate having to sound like one of those "the original was far superior" guys...but here goes. Come on now, isn't it usually the way anyhow? True, there are some instances where a remake is better due to resources (money, technology, etc.) that weren't available for the original, but in most cases, what the filmmakers see as improvements or "twists," usually fall flat no matter the budget. Tim Burton's remake of "Planet of the Apes" comes to mind as one of the more colossal failures in it's "re-imagining" attempt.It's only fair that I confess to being a huge fan of the Swedish original ("Let the Right One In.") I wasn't looking forward to seeing it "Americanized." I changed my mind when reviews started rolling in, hailing it as exciting, scary, etc. I was suckered in. Yeah, I'm man enough to admit it.Not that it was bad. It's not. It's just another pale remake of an original. It doesn't deviate much from the original at all. In fact it's very similar in the way that a photocopy is similar to an original. Same basic information, but not as sharp or crisp. That's the problem with "Let Me In." The acting is not quite as good. The mood is not as creepy and foreboding. The supporting characters don't strike home.Where it truly falls flat is in two places. The cinematography is far inferior. It seeps into B-Movie territory by relying too much on darkness and close-ups to convey horror. It doesn't work and leaves you squinting and wondering, "what just happened?" The second serious flaw is that it's far less shocking than the original. I'm not going to give away any spoilers, but there are several times in "Let the Right One In" where you say, "Whoa! What was that!" Things you wouldn't see in a mainstream Hollywood film, things I predicted wouldn't be in the Hollywood version, and...surprise...things that were conspicuously missing from the Hollywood version. To their credit, "Let Me In" TRIES to include watered down variations on those scenes, but, like anything watered down, it's bland and tepid.My advice, and you had to see this coming unless you began reading this review here, is to see the original. Here's the rundown: If you've seen and enjoyed the original: There's no need to see this remake. You'll be disappointed and probably bored, as I was.If you saw and didn't like the original: There's also no need to see the Hollywood version as there are no notable plot twists or variations. Essentially, it's the same basic story, just not told as well.If you haven't seen either: The Swedish version is original and fresh and the American version is predictably Americanized, mainstreamed, less edgy and mostly boring. The only reason to pick the Hollywood version over the Swedish might be if you don't like subtitles. In which case, I'd recommend you to get over it. It's essentially a vampire/horror movie and it's not exactly verbose. (Note: There is a dubbed soundtrack on the DVD/Blu-Ray if you prefer...I'm just a fan of subtitles in foreign films.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Better Than the Original - There I Said It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone has to dare to say it. This is better than the original. There is a conspiracy amongst the film elite to criticise this film as being an unnecessary remake. That the Swedish version was so good this remake is pointless. They not only claim it's not very good but almost refuse to consider it. Saying the American remake is better is akin to saying you're an idiot. Well the Emperor has no clothes. This is better.The fact that the original is in Swedish is not something you can immediately dismiss. If The Shawshank Redemption, had been in Swedish I would have enjoyed it less. If Friends, Fraiser or The News were in Swedish I'd enjoy them less too. I read one reviewer saying that if you are smart enough to get this film or LTROI then the fact that LTROI is in Swedish wont bother you, and if it does then you wont get either film. This is just snobbishness. For me Film, like Television is about enjoyment. The actual artistic merit is just a distraction for people who are paid to be supercilious and tell us what we should like.Aside from the language issue this film is just better. If Tomas Alfredson had been given more money and a second go at making LTROI it would have been better second time around. To pretend otherwise is nonsense. And that is what has happened here, LTROI has been used as the final draft for LMI. They are very close, this is not a re-imagining, it has has just been slightly improved, as you would expect from one draft to the next. Everything that was good remains and a little has been touched up.In it's own right this is a charming film about the relationship between to outcast children set against the back drop of one of them being a vampire. There's plenty for fans of vampire movies, there are some interesting ideas on the vampire rules, in particular with the way vampires age and the whole idea of having to invite them in. But this is not really a vampire film. It's about childhood and struggling to fit in as much as anything else. Chloe Moretz is as good as ever, you empathise with her situation, though never really know her motives.It's not highbrow, there is a great deal of subtly in the personal relationships because the film is so well written. But no more so than the relationships of every day life. The film is not difficult to 'get' it's really a fairly simple story. The film critics idea that you have to be a genius to get either film is not true. It's a good story.A great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost good enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad movie, it would have been a shame regarding the original material it is based upon, but here you can measure the difference between good, and really good. And as in every arts and crafts, the higher you get, the harder it gets to find that little thing which makes the difference.And the biggest little thing here is Lina Leandersson whose presence is sorely missed. As Eli/Abby, she was far more ambiguous, complex, strangely mature, eerily ironic, and... simply ghoulish. Chloe could not bring these dimensions here, she's not bad either, just too cute and childish for the part. Thirteen years old miracles are that rare. It was just a unique combination.What Matt Reeves added can often been seen at best as surperfluous, and at worse as flirting with ridicule, like the long shots on Abby's transfigured, evil face. A kitsch Tomas Alfredson rightly avoided. Make-ups and effects here just distract from the dark, but essentially realist core of the original. The emphasis on the police inquiry, both in story and construction (the initial flashback), is just another concession to a supposed hollywoodian canon, with its feeble attempts at some good old suspense. Again, more is often less.Regarding the cutting, some important scenes (like the two main protagonists encounter) seem to be rushed in, again, Reeves (or a higher hand) did not trust his audience. All this is revelatory of the principles behind the project : this is a production, not an original vision. In the end, an acceptable, but dispensable effort of a remake.And as an effort, it can only trail behind the grace and subtlety of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that NEEDED to be made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignore the reviewers who say this film was only remade for the 'dumb' people who hate to read. These people love to think they are a more intellectual class of film goer due to the fact they read subtitles. Personally I can't help but feel it takes something away from the actors performances when you need to look away from their face to understand what they've said (a lot of the actors and directors work gets missed, especially on the big screen).Despite not really liking subtitled films, I did enjoy the original but this remake made the story deeper with two things. The first was the expansion on the guardian character. It gave a more heartbreaking back story and hinted at the perpetual cycle to Abby's life. The second was the two young leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloë Grace Moretz. They both gave performances that made this into a believable love story with a vampire twist as opposed to a vampire story with a love twist. Child actors can often come across as pretentious when acting out situations beyond their years but these two are destined for great things, especially Chloë Grace Moretz.The only thing that feels out of place in this film is the CGI which was a bit OTT, despite this it managed to have me enthralled all the way through. Well worth it a try regardless of if you have seen the original or not. It may give you as nice a surprise as it did me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesser of the Two Versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who has been bullied at school makes friends with a young girl (Chloe Moretz), who may not be merely a girl at all. Soon they form a bond that is unbreakable, but possible deadly. From Hammer Films.Chloe Moretz is the only child actress today who could have played Abby, so I cannot even begin to express how elated I am that she was chosen. Without her, I think the entire film would have collapsed.The character of Abby is not the same as Eli. When Abby is called weak, she says, "I'm stronger than you think I am" and after saying "I'm not a girl", she follows it up with "I'm nothing", playing down -- practically removing -- any of the gender ambiguity subplot. Abby has more of a violent streak than Eli, more of a temper. She does not have quite the level of innocence that Eli exudes. The music is darker and there is more reliance on CG and animation (the original kept it pretty minimal besides the cat scene).Richard Jenkins has a much larger role as the keeper than his Swedish counterpart. I think this is a strength, because not only is Jenkins a vastly underrated actor, but the role he plays is mysterious and it does not hurt to give us more hints to his existence (though the use of an unclear background is nice, too).The setting has moved from Sweden to New Mexico, but kept the early 1980s (now with Reagan rather than a Soviet political landscape). The camera moves and shakes more, blurs more, which may not be a surprise given that the director's last picture was "Cloverfield". Although both films are dark, the original is grittier. And Oskar is a bigger wuss than Owen. What is up with Owen's mask? The hospital fire scene is much more intense, which is great because it is a highlight of the film.Although this film is not the powerful film that "Let the Right One In" is, it is still a decent film in its own right. If it was not bogged down by comparisons, it would probably get even higher praise from me and from others. As of this writing, they have submitted the film for Oscar considerations. I do not expect them to get any nominations, but one never knows... Moretz deserves a chance sooner or later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious remake of the Swedish sensation "Let The Right One In"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religious remake of the Swedish sensation "Let The Right One In" follows the original so closely that it is more likely for mainstream English speaking audience who is new to the story. A couple of minor notches below the standard set by the original, nevertheless this will be a new (and much better) genre rendition to try out for those who thought The Twilight Saga is the only romantic vampire genre around.Director Matt Reeves has paid faithful homage to Tomas Alfredson's version not because he had a lack of creativity, but simply because this remake is meant to reach out to a wider audience who've yet to see it in order to spread the love. Hopefully with an English speaking cast and language, it will be widely appreciated by more people with the mass distribution of the film.That said, we shouldn't really criticise Reeves' take for the homage effort.Given a choice, I believe the film-makers will want to produce unique works of their own. While the fans of the Swedish original may be ranting on how the US version is trying to regurgitate and ruin the reputation that the original upheld with somewhat less subtlety and slightly commercialised elements, we need to remember that they are experiencing these sentiments because they've already seen the original.What first time audience will need is a fair and just objective opinion of the film instead of negatively-charged subjectivity.Following the success of the original, the film tackles the disturbing issue of the state of our younger ones in the society who are facing danger when left alone without care. Broken families and adult neglect often lead to these youth finding no one to go to for resolving woes. Under repression without guidance, some begin to harbour twisted intentions and often end up sporting vicious violence as Owen is seen wielding a kitchen knife in front of his dressing mirror mimicking demeaning taunts of his school bullies."Are you scared, little girl?"Owen suffers from severe bullying by three boys in his school, which is escalated to a heavier dosage than the original to stir more raging sentiments within the audience. Reeves also offers a great opening that works to get the audience unsettled with an urgent ambulance scene and a nerve-teasing hospital ward flashback. Just for these, I tend to feel that more is more as it induces a higher level of emotions.Otherwise, less should be more as in the original.Music and sound are a tad bit overly handled as the upbeat nature of the audio reduces the subtlety feel that is a trademark of the original. Visuals also took on a punchier style with more blatant blood attacks achieved via CG animation. With these, it allows the remake to feel brisker in pace to get the heart pumping a little.Chilling subtle horror amidst warm tender love.Owen is a 12 year old boy who is left alone by the adults in his life, his mother is an alcoholic Catholic settling a divorce with his father while the teachers in school often do not go beyond their line of duty and mind their own business outside academic syllabus. With such, he is often spotted sitting in the playground within his residential courtyard silently singing peculiar tunes that go:"Eat some now, save some for later"Abby is a blood thirsty "thing" who has been 12 years old for ages, it is also unsure if Abby is a boy as highlighted in the original that has been left out in this remake. Abby also verbally repeats in the film that she is not a girl. In the novel, there's a brief flash-back mention of the possibility of Abby being a boy who's been castrated by a vampire a long time ago. Since Reeves' version has chosen to leave the question of Abby's gender out to keep affairs simple by implying instead that she is not a girl (not human) but a vampire, let's not dwell astray.Moretz and Smit-McPhee's performance has been wonderful in this film, not to forget Richard Jenkins' great role rendition as Abby's "guardian" who stumbles every time he hunts for blood to feed Abby. His position as an elderly guardian will be challenged during the later part of the film to instill a surprising and satisfying twist to those who're unfamiliar with the story (so no spoilers).An artful portrayal of a chilling romance story between a vampire and a mortal boy, this brings the new genre that used to be dominated by Edward and Bella to a whole new level. That said, you'll not want to miss the Swedish original after watching this remake.Maybe it is a better routine to watch the remake and then the original.</fullReview>

We wait all movie for something exciting to happen but it doesn't. At last in the end of the movie we don't have a clue about the faith/future of the characters, so, whats the point of all movie?

		<shortDescription>Stunning vampire-horror flick with a powerful edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Matt Reeves, the director behind the surprisingly successful found footage thriller 'Cloverfield' comes a riveting remake of the Swedish vampire-horror thriller 'Let The Right One In' comprised of Reeves' powerful writing and provocative performances by its two young leads. Kodi-Smit McPhee steps into the role of Owen Baker, a lonely 12-year old boy with a troubled life at school, he's a designated punching bag by a school bully Kenny (played by Dylan Minnette) and his goons; and lives a broken home life with his mother who is going through a divorce with her husband and has developed an alcohol addiction in response. With no friends to turn to, Owen spends his nights taking his anger out on a tree, stabbing a tree as if he was stabbing Kenny and the bullies. This is until one night he spots a barefoot girl named Abby (played by Chloe Grace Moretz) about his age, move next door to his apartment with her father (played by Richard Jenkins). Owen and Abby form a friendship that eventually becomes love, but little does he know, Abby like her father, is vampire and must feed off human blood to survive. The closer Owen comes to discovering her secret, the closer the bond between the two grows.The vampire genre has solidly active in for many decades, some vampire films like 'Fright Night' and 'Interview with The Vampire' have gone down as modern day classics for many horror fans. But none of them have come remotely powerful and riveting as this one as the writer take the vampire genre in this film and take to a whole another direction. Instead of a story centering on characters fighting against a blood-sucking serial killer or a horde of them, this film focuses more on the young boy's bond with a vampire, and not in that cheesy way like in the Twilight movies. Carrying nearly the same structure from the original film, the plot treats the bond between the two main characters in a way that is very mature and moving, and it steps into their lives of how they both have troubled home lives like Owen's mother after his father walked out on them. With the intelligent screenplay by Matt Reeves, the mature and thought-provoking themes that transcend into the story are handled brilliantly. Kodi-Smit McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz are gripping every time they come on screen together, these two showcase such emotional chemistry and the performances they deliver make the friendship and the bond between them so believable you can almost feel their emotions. These youngsters are just beyond their years in their roles. When these two are not on screen, the audience is pulled into some significantly scary moments that leave them gripping their seats. This movie moves at a pace that could easily be described as near perfect and provides just the right amount of suspense to pervade its riveting atmosphere. Let Me In was a rare and stunning film of the vampire genre that carries a powerful edge and is blessed with some amazing writing by Matt Reeves. It is both scary and quite emotional, and certainly the type of vampire film that will extremely difficult for any film of the vampire genre to measure up to. This film is strongly recommended for all horror fans, and something that will surely make a solid subject of discussion after watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bullied schoolboy Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) befriends a 12 year old girl named Abby (Chloë Grace Moretz) who turns out to be a vampire.Stephen King called Let Me In 'the best American horror film in the last 20 years'; what he should have said was is that it is 'one of the better American horror remakes of the last 20 years', the film not being all that different to the Swedish original Let The Right One In.Yes, there are a few changes here and there, some of which might be seen as improvements, others that seem rather pointless, but if you've already seen the original, this Americanised version will hold very few surprises. Which of the two films you prefer will probably depend on how you feel about reading subtitles rather than any alterations made to the plot.I say give each a go?they're both very well made, stylish and touching movies?but I suggest leaving it a good while between viewings: watching them back to back might feel like you're seeing exactly the same film twice in a row.</fullReview>

The performances were all excellent as well; particularly the two young leads; Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen and Chloë Grace Moretz as Abby. They were ably supported by; Richard Jenkins as The Father, Elias Koteas as The Policeman, Dylan Minnette as Jack and Cara Buono as Owen's Mother.I find it hard to talk about this film without drawing comparisons with the original. I guess if I hadn't seen, and fallen in love with the original, I would have thought this was quite brilliant. The trouble is, it's almost shot-for-shot the same film; with some obvious references changed. I noticed also that it was set in the 1980's also, giving scope for a sequel with Owen as a grown-up. So how does it compare; well I must say I preferred the mystery of the original and it will always be my favourite version. However, I still found this one perfectly watchable and have no problem in deeming it Highly Recommended if you're not lucky enough to have seen the original?

		<shortDescription>Let Me In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of "Let Me In", the American remake of the successful "Let the Right One In", is similar to its inspiration. While I think it is very well photographed with evocative compositions and conveys a prolonging (to the very conclusion) sense of melancholy, to me this movie was simply unnecessary. Chloë Grace Moretz is still a teenager but in movies like Kickass and this one, you can see the temptation by directors to shoot her as an object of desire. That's how I felt; scenes where little, frail Owen (a scrawny Kodi Smit-McPhee who could desperately use a little meat on the bones, but right for his part, his face emitting loneliness, longing for affection/friendship, and fear of the constant ridicule of bullies) watches her in a towel after she showers the blood from her flesh or feels her cold naked body next to his when she gets in bed besides him (these events seem to occur after feeding time), there's a sense that we are supposed to yearn to see her. That concerns me, but I can see the point because she must appeal in multiple ways to an impressionable kid so needing companionship and a person to converse/connect with. Scenes that remain relatively intact include: a female victim burning alive when sunlight hits her while recovering in a hospital, Moretz' *companion* (Richard Jenkins) finally messing up during an attempted kidnapping which results in his own hospitalization (he "goes for a flight" out of the hospital window), the discovery of a body frozen under a lake while Owen faces his customary ridicule from a punk kid, Moretz' rescue of Owen who was almost drowned by bullies in a swimming pool, Moretz climbing trees and scaling building walls, Moretz bleeding out while waiting to be invited in Owen's room, and the train trip conclusion which says that Owen will just wind up in the same position as Jenkins after forty years of "courtship" with his vampire love. The reveal of a *member* seen shockingly in the original is absent here (no surprise), but this film does more to establish that the grown man masquerading as Moretz' father was once Owen's age and her side-kick, now a tired relic burned out of hunting down human victims for his master just so he can keep her happy. There's a sad scene where Moretz offers a bit of affection, her hand caressing Jenkins' shoulder and face, because it gives us a glimpse of what once was and is now almost gone between them. The tragedy is that Moretz should be put down because as long as she lives, no one is safe, and, most importantly, her chosen partner will have to be an active participant in the ghoulish deeds involving securing fresh bloody meat for the creature to devour. Elias Koteas (balding, with librarian glasses and a worse-for-wear disposition) is the detective who has been following after Moretz, perhaps closing in?his fate is probably the most memorable scene. There's no doubt that Moretz will be the object of attraction by many a director/cinematographer once she has flowered into a young woman. Most grisly scene could be a face after an acid bath and ripped flesh as (and after) Moretz feeds. There's a yellowish hue at times that gives the film a garish look and always presented in the cold of winter, both appropriate for the depressing atmosphere the film reeks. And, above all, the film is noting to us that because Owen is so isolated due to his parents fighting and divorce and friendless because he remains so guarded due to the bullies who never cease to terrorize him, escaping into himself because no one is there to turn to, he's an easy choice for Moretz, needing a new "chaperone" for protection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake no one wanted is surprisingly decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it was first announced that that Swedish film Let the Right One In fans of the original bemoan why do it? Is nothing sacred? I even shared this view point but I decided to give Let Me In a chance and there plenty of things that work and some that do not.Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a 12 year old who is a loner, bullied at school by a sadist kid (Dylan Minnette) and his parents are going thought a bitter divorce. He plays with knives and is a serial killer in the making. One day a man (Richard Jenkins) and his 'daughter' Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) move into the apartment building. Owen slowly befriends Abby who gives him the confidence to face the bullies. But Abby has a thirst for blood, which her 'father' has to get for her and the police end up investigating a series of mysterious and brutal murders.There is a whole question why is Let the Right One In being remade, especially because Matt Reeves shot it in the style of original. But Reeves does bring his own approach to the film, the scene where he attacks the teenager in the car as his friend is in a petrol station and we see the fight in the background, the car chase afterwards, seen completely within the car and a quick creepy scene where Owen finds an old series photo of Abby with a boy with glasses. Reeves also cut out the scene with the cats, which in the original was one of the few weak links. The relationship between Owen and Abby is made out to be a little more fun loving, that she attempts to be a more jolly character because Owen shows affection. The acting throughout is very strong, Smit-McPhee and Moretz are two of the strongest child actors around and they both give understated performances, Moretz being the slightly stronger performer. Jenkins too gives a rather understated performance and Elias Koteas is simply a cop trying to do his job: he was not an evil or even a bad character.But of course there are problems. One involves the special effects when Abby attacks people. When she attacks her first victim it looks pretty much how Gollum would attack someone, it was almost comical. It was handled much more subtly and better in Let the Right One In when she was picked up and then she bite him, having made sudden impact then it turning into a fight scene. The bullies were just sadistic. The is a problem of the original as well, but they were so unrealistic: they were just psychopaths, willing to kill a 12-year-old boy and they are meant to be 12 themselves, though Minnette looked older. There are some small differences as well that I personally think work better in the original film, like the cutting out of the other resident of the building, the cutting of Owen's dad and the scene of the new vampire being set alight when she see explored to the sun was more over-the-top in this film seeing that a nurse also gets killed by the flames. But I might be a little too critical because of my affection for the original film.If Let Me In was a stand alone film it possibly it would have stood up better but as a remake it is surprisingly good and well done, if a little too reliant of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let Me In is a creepy remake of a crazy Swedish film called Let The Right One In. This movie is well known by critics because it shows one of the most lifelike sides of a vampire, as if it were actually real. I never watch movies twice. But I watched this remake and enjoyed it. There were two bloody scenes that were a bit fake in my opinion but there were others that were good. Besides that the movie was spot on and contained the naked and empathetic emotions of the original. Kodi Smit-McPhee does an amazing job like usual, this was probably even better than his acting in The Road. Chloë Grace Moretz (Kick Ass) also shows her true talent here as well and acts better than I expected. She does an amazing job as the movie goes on. I liked the ending of the original a little bit better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern bittersweet romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is back where movies should be. it is outstanding in its appearance. You could start writing a very short review by asking what wasn't made good at all in this movie. But let's take the other way. Screenplay, camera work, scenery, actors, dialog where right to the point. Especially the two main actors are wonderful, just like bitten in the right apple. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloë Grace Moretz have performed very, very well and absolutely professional, something even the most popular couples haven't achieved in years. The two main actors: A young but horrific vampire sealed in a adolescent shape, stunning with her girl-like attitude and appearance, and the naive day dreamer, always curious for miraculous things in his dire young life. As "Let me In" is a remake of "Let the right one in", we know both actors had a blueprint. Nevertheless they added a lot of shades to both characters, compared to the dilettante original (for instance the horrible makeup of the young vampire female.. ) Observing the grace, the beauty of the scene, of Abby and Owen, of the ever timeless vampire story, where light and dark are as close as they can get. This is cinematic poetry. and every verse made me love them more. However, the movie isn't flawless, as remakes are commonly not known for improving the story at all. But a lot of questions beside the main story weren't quite answered, effectively making the end obviously somewhat shallow, but graphic. what about owens father? what about the police investigation? what about his mother? the school with the ripped corpses? And Abby and Owen? Had she never the thought of making him a vampire too, sharing her dismal destiny? Applause to a marvelous view into our souls, which is accompanied by a martial, well-known horror story in contrast. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close to the original, but not close enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a tough movie to give criticism on because it is basically the exact same movie as Let the Right One In, and I've actually never seen a remake stay so close to the original.I knew from the start that it was going to be a remake, but this is literally scene by scene, almost verbatim, the exact same movie. I was hoping for a bit more back story on Eli, such as how she became a vampire, or showing more of the back story on her relationship with Hakan, because I'm sure he wasn't always fine with helping Eli get her blood. The only differences that I saw was the beginning of the film, where they showed the climax of the film at the beginning, doing a typical "Tarinto" scene, and also some of the scene were shot with different angles. I'm not sure if the director was doing this to be more artistic, or if he was just wanted to have something different about the film, and that was his easiest option. Like I said it is hard to criticize this film, because most remakes I dislike due to the fact that they change so much, but with this film almost nothing is changed. My only problem with this movie is why a remake was necessary. I already have a hard time swallowing remakes to begin with, but I can understand sometimes when the movie has been outdated and is need of a remake by the right director, but Let Me In came out barely a full two years after the original. There is absolutely no need for a remake that soon, unless for two reasons, to add more to the story, or simply because people do not like reading subtitles, therefore people always give up on foreign films without ever giving them a chance. I think it is much easier and much more enjoyable to just leave a film as it is, and just read the subtitles, and watch the movie as it was originally intended.On the other hand, Let Me In isn't that bad of a film. My favorite part of the film were the two main actors in the last one, and I must say the two American kids they picked for these parts are actually pretty on par with the other two. Although I feel like they don't have that connection and chemistry that the other two had. The biggest problem I have with this film is just how recent it came out, and to me it just looks like Matt Reeves wanted to take the shine away from Let the Right One In. I'm sure that actually was not his intention, but to me there was no reason to do a remake, and especially a remake that is so close to the original. If you're deciding on which one to watch first, without thinking watch the original, it is a much better film in all aspects. Unless you are someone who can't focus during a movie with subtitles, than go ahead and watch Let Me In, it does its part in staying true to the original. http://tgtbtw.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, I did not see the original before this. Perhaps it may be a crime that I do not watch it, but I simply cannot stand subtitles.This film was everything I wanted it to be and the ending was very VERY satisfying. If you like vampires (especially if you don't like the Twilight kind) I can easily say that you will love this movie. There are none of those cheap "make you jump" kind of scares, at least, not those that are going to make you audibly yelp. The suspenseful scenes made me grip the arms of my chair, and although it isn't much to shout about, the orchestral score did its job.Why a 7? Well, not a 10 because I have not yet come across the perfect movie (and probably no one will ever make one), not a 9 because it's not such a masterpiece as say, Pulp Fiction, and not an 8 because it's not a "Titanic". I wish I could give it an extra .3 for effort though.Certainly a movie to be watched for Vampire fans who are looking for something deeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be quick here but I must say to anyone who is even slightly interested in horror to watch this film, because at times you almost forget you are watching a horror movie.An incredibly moving, heartbreaking and sad horror film if there is such a thing, the whole film from the phenomenal performances from the two leads to the incredible visuals the score, the loneliness and pouring of emotion this movie makes you feel is amazing.All in all not just one of the best horror films but in my opinion one of the best films I have seen.And having seen the original Let The Right One In and as fantastic as that was I believe the remake has got it covered, and that's a rarity when it comes to remakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I went past the point of falling asleep and actually died. This is the worst vampire film I've ever had the misfortune of seeing.The predictable-on-every-level plot and most of the music is straight from "the wonderful world of Disney".This takes the sex and seductiveness of the vampire genre and turns it into the "pampers for baby" version. There is such a lack of blood and gore I nearly decided to stake myself through the heart just for the thrill of it.None of the characters ever seem to have a change of clothes in any of the scenes. They wear exactly the same costumes throughout.The music is entirely inappropriate for a traditional vampire film, but entirely appropriate for this "made in candyland" version.Avoid Avoid Avoid. Don't buy, don't rent and don't even waste bandwidth downloading this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You need to have good movie palette</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love sci-fi and critically acclaimed movies, but I just did not like this movie at all. When a movie is so well reviewed by professional critics yet has made so little money in the theaters, you know you to have a pretty advanced palette to like it. I thought I did, but this movie was just so different than anything I've seen, yet so uninteresting as well. I would say 9 out of 10 average moviegoers probably will not like this this. I am a big fan of Chloe Moretz and think she is a fabulous actress. I thought the other kids in the movie were great actors as well. This does not make up for the plot.. I don't know what else to say, it was just really bland. I can't suggest this movie and feel I am worse off for having watched it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best vampire movie around!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just excellent. It has wonderful performances by child actors which usually is not the case from children. It mixes horror and romance which is a good twist out of the normal comedy romance which in my opinion just ruin comedies.This movie is about a little boy who gets bullied and doesn't have any friends. One day at the jungle gym outside his apartment complex he meets a little girl. He sees her again and again and they start to make a strong friendship. Though as the movie progresses he discovers this sweet little girl is not as innocent as she appears. This is by far the best vampire movie i have seen. It has a wonderful script and great acting. Very intense scenes with a nice amount of blood and gore. It has a great plot and a very good ending i like it a lot. If you like heartwarming movies or a good vampire flick this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film with an slightly different perspective but still second best to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the original and when the English version was announced I refused to watch it but one reviewer here said that if you liked the original you owed it to yourself to watch the English version and I thought that was good advice- what did I have to lose? In a way I am glad I reconsidered and watched Let Me In.Comparisons to the original movie are inevitable but I'll do a review of the movie on a stand alone basis.It's a slow movie but well paced and that's a good thing because this isn't a typical vampire movie that caters to the masses like twilight is. You get a feel for the main characters even without any back story. Ignoring the original you know that there's more to Abby after she arrives in the neighbourhood and Owen's life.I feel that this is more of a love story than a horror. The main plot concentrates on the relationship of Owen and Abby, from their brief introduction to their friendship and then into something deeper. Matt Reeves does a fine job of keeping the attention focused on the main story without getting to bogged down with any side plots.The music too is quite excellent, especially the love theme that plays whenever Abby and Owen are together. I really enjoyed the awkwardness the two had when together. It's very unlike what you'd expect in young teens these days. So all in all it was a a good effort.Performance wise both the main actors do a very good job and the makeup department did a really good job in making Owen look identical to the original boy, Oskar.So why isn't it better than the original? The bleakness of the environment in the original perfectly matched the situation of all the characters. In the original the boy has so many troubles- the separation of his parents, the bullying at school, his loneliness. The girl's situation too is none better. She requires blood, is dependent on one person and is essentially alone. The frigid Swedish winter and dark settings perfectly complement the characters predicaments. In Let Me In you don't get that sense.Also, some of the side plots are abandoned and the only diversion that the movie focuses on is the bullying. The scene in the swimming pool at the end of the movie is better handled in the original. You really get a sense of the girl's power and her love and protection for the boy. In the English version it comes off as cheap and disappointing. Also, showing Abby's changed face when she feeds is just pure Hollywood- as if to shock us as to the changed appearance of a little girl. I liked the mystery of the girl better in the original. Most of the action scenes are in darkness and you only ever see the girl with a blood covered face or clothes.All in all it's still a movie worth watching but to really appreciate an excellent story watch the original, Let The Right One In. The only thing that the original lacks is the haunting music theme that Let Me In has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I believe I am 12. I've been 12 for a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a close English language re-make of the Swedish movie, "Let the Right One In." So there really isn't much to add, except I believe I like the original a bit better. Still, I found this version enjoyable too.Kodi Smit-McPhee is Owen, 12 years old, sort of the frail, non-combative type. He gets picked on often by the small band of bullies, and they call him "girl." The rest will have SPOILERS, don't read if you have not yet seen the movie.A family moves in next door in the brick apartment building, in Los Alamos. The child is Chloe Moretz as Abby, also 12 years old. (Although we eventually figure out she is much older.) Richard Jenkins is "The Father", although he confesses later that he isn't really her father. Abby really is a Vampire, and he is with her to collect blood. This involves surprising young men in their cars, killing them, hanging them head down from a tree, and draining their blood into a plastic gallon jug to bring back to Abby. Until he messes up and meets his own demise.But Abby really is a sweet person, she just needs blood. She becomes Owen's friend and when he says a mark on his cheek was caused by a boy at school she tells him to hit back, "Harder than you ever imagined." When he gets cornered again, he hits the main bully with a metal pole, and badly damages his ear.All this sets up the same final scenes as the Swedish movie, in the natatorium where the boys are holding Owen under water, and we don't see Abby but she takes care of them. Then finally on a train, Abby in the trunk and Owen traveling with her. As he grows older he will become her new blood gatherer. Sept 2015 edit: Just watched it again after 4 years. Knowing the general themes and outcome made it an even better viewing.</fullReview>

Huge props to the actors and the director. The scenes between them are so tender and sweet against the backdrop of the violent killings. Chloe Moretz will be a star with the same amount of adulation that Charlize Theron and others have. Elias Koteas who played the cop did amazing also. His part was minor but did keep the pacing of the film. I didn't even realize it was him until I looked at the credits. That's usually the mark of a great acting job. And the bullies getting their comeuppance is always sweet in a movie. I don't think I gave away too much and if you haven't seen it yet prepared to be impressed by a couple of 12 year olds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good - But the Original is better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the American remake of the Swedish film "Let the Right One In" The original film made my list of the top movies of the last decade. There was great debate as to whether a remake would tarnish the nearly flawless original, because today's movies are all about remakes and sequels, with the most original content coming from overseas. Both movies are based on the book "Let Me In" from Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist.The giant task of remaking this film fell on the shoulders of Matt Reeves of "Cloverfield" fame. Having seen so many horrible and lifeless horror remakes in the past few years, I had obvious doubts about this one. Although the cast was absolutely top notch I still had some strong reservations. I did see it in theaters last September and a few more times on the just released DVD. I can honestly say without hesitation that this is a quality and well thought out remake. Major props go out to the fantastic acting jobs from the whole cast. Chloe Moretz from "Kick-Ass" plays Abby the mysterious new girl. Kodi Smit-McPhee, who was previously in "The Road" with Viggo Mortenson, plays the tormented Owen. Richard Jenkins is brilliant as Abby's "Father". Finally Elias Koteas, plays the police officer investigating a string of brutal murders in the Los Alamos, New Mexico community.Like the original this story takes place in the early 1980's. The main characters of Oskar and Eli are now Owen and Abbey. The story and themes of the original still hold true in this one. Owen is twelve years old and is unmercifully teased and bullied at school. He is extremely lonely and dreams of one day getting his revenge. His parents are getting a divorce and he is often ignored. When Abbey moves in next door, Owen is immediately curious. They meet on a number of occasions in the apartment complexes jungle gym and develop rather sweet friendship. The book and the movies have always been about the relationship between these two. Even though they are so young, they are both extremely lonely and yearn for companionship. It also happens that Abbey is a vampire and needs blood to live. It's a very strong coming of age drama with a few creative twists.Owen is never turned off to the fact that Abbey is so different and the claims that "she is not a girl". He accepts her for who or what she is. With Abby's help and Owens new found self confidence he is able to take back his life and stand up to the bullies in his life. The DVD and Blu Ray releases include a commentary track from Matt Reeves and a few other special features. This is a no doubt buy it, especially if you're a fan of the book or the original film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful 're-imagining' of an already perfect film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of what I'm about to say has probably already been said a million times over but it is safe to say that 'Let Me In' is a brilliant re imagining of perfection. Currently I'm reading the novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist and have also seen the Swedish original. I'm glad to say that the actors and actresses captured their characters and tell the story well. Chloe Moretz is beautifully enchanting as Abby, the mysterious young girl who lives next door to social outcast, Owen (also played wonderfully by Kody Smit McPhee). Every scene she is in is eerily creepy yet has an air of sadness. Both young actors should be given high praise for their performances and I'm sure they already have. The violent scenes, which are scattered throughout, break up what could have been a very slow piece. Abby is literally a killing machine and it shows in the horrific crime scenes she leaves behind. The movie doesn't follow to traditional vampire stereotypes. There's no signs of garlic or crucifixes etc. Abby is shown as a contorting monster who only shows her true nature when desperate. Now for my own personal negatives. Obviously a movie cannot contain everything that is in the novel. BUT this remake has left out some scenes that were in the original that I thought were awesome. The main one I can think of was the 'Cat Scene'. If you've read the novel and seen the original, you'll remember how crazy weird that was. This wasn't included in the American rendition. Overall, 'Let Me In' is one of my favourite movies of all time. It's eery, scary, touching and sad. I, myself, would consider it on the same level as the original it's based upon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little boy makes friends with a new girl only to discover her terrifying secret. Now first of all, I personally did not find this frightening, rather 'thrilling' simply because I believe that Vampires have lost the 'creature of the night' reputation to becoming romantic archetypes, but this is done quite well as we see what the consequences of being a Vampire or associating with one can lead to.Kodi Smit-Mcphee and Chloe Moretz play off each other quite well, Kodi portrays a boy who has been pushed too far by school bullies, a mother who neglects her child and an absent father. The scene when he is in his room with the knife quite disturbing. Chloe Moretz plays the weak Vampire brilliantly, you feel sad for her but at the same time on the edge of your seat, but I truly loved the setting of the film a remote town were nothing ever happens, or so it would seem. Brilliant drama although I now desperately want to see the original as I believe the original is always better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I registered to this site with the sole purpose of writing this review. I will take care to not have any spoilers in my review."Let Me In" is ambitious, genre busting film, that is a really good youth romance/ coming of age tale disguised as a vampire film.There are definitely acts of brutal savagery, but the are done out of necessity rather then malicious. This adds a unique complexity to the story. On the one hand you have Abby, a very dangerous person/creature,on the other hand Abby has the emotional frailty of a young girl. Her counterpoint ,Owen, is a boy of the same age who is bullied at school. Both Abby and Owen share the difficulty of growing up in a setting that views them as outcasts (although for very different reasons). This shared difficulty serves as the catalyst for a very unique and close bond. As the story unfolds, the challenges faced by the youthful friends increases, making the story more compelling, and asks the question if the acts of savagery committed by Abby out of necessity are more or less evil then the acts committed to Owen out of hatred by the bullies of his school.This is a great movie from beginning to end. It will give you a balls to the wall horror film seamlessly combined with a coming of age tale.</fullReview>

An intelligent horror film on the brilliantly scripted lines of 1408 and conjuring.

An uncertain romance ensues that opens up a trail of blood-lust into his life.I say: amazing story. Brilliant direction. Amazingggg performances. Brilliant sound and music. Totally blew away my mind unexpectedly! I love the way the parasitic romance of a vampire is explored with human senses in the movie. The sacrificial nature of love and the nature of habit balanced in a story that's supposed to scare you - but ends up making you feel the characters and their flurry of emotions. The little twists aided by the spectacular performances by all actors keep you gripped to the seat all throughout. When 100 twilights are made, one such movie rises and redeems the little respect that the vampire genre has. Truly magnificent. A must add to your DVD collection.</fullReview>

After evil saved the boys life in the swimming pool, he accepts it and will nourish this horror for the rest of his life. (Something like Putin is doing in the Ukraine. Pulling it into the life of Russia.) The poor brother did evil's bidding by murdering people for their blood. Now the boy will do the same in time. This one of best horror movies I have ever seen.

It does have a bit of gore in it, but even if you were not into that, this is a must see film. CGM may have turned in the best child's performance EVER in this film. The only rival to that category would be, Natalie Portman in The Professional, and/or Freddie Bartholomew in Captain's Courageous or one of CGM's own, Hick (If you haven't already, see that just for her ).Let Me In was the first I had ever seen of CGM and she is worth it.

The socially awkward boy she fall for is played by kodi smit-McPhee who takes on his role brilliantly.With the genre of the movie being horror, you would not expect it to take on a romantic edge between two young characters.

		<fullReview>Twelve year old Owen lives with his mother in Los Alamos, New Mexico; he is a fairly quiet boy but is bullied by a group of boys in his class. His life starts to change though when Abby, a girl around his age moves in next door along with a man we assume to be her father. It quickly becomes apparent that there is something strange about them when the father murders somebody and attempts to drain his blood. When Owen first meets Abby she tells him they can never be friends but despite this they start spending more and more time together and a friendship develops. As their friendship develops Owen's self-confidence grows although he doesn't know what she really is despite her cryptic remark about not being a girl. When he does learn the truth about her he is remarkably sanguine.Having enjoyed the Swedish original, 'Let the Right One In', I was unsure whether or not I'd enjoy this; however I tried to put that to the back of my mind when I sat down to watch this? although the similarities make it difficult. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloë Grace Moretz put in solid performances as the two young protagonists giving them the right degree of vulnerability. These two carry the film but that doesn't mean the rest of the cast are weak; the boys playing the group of bullies make them believably unpleasant which leads to some rightly uncomfortable scenes. The concentration on the youngsters means we care less for some of the victims than we might.If you are a fan of the original this remake might seem unnecessary however there are enough differences to make it worth watching at least once. That said I do think the original is the better film; here we are explicitly shown Abby's vampiric side rather than the more subtle approach used in the original film. I also thought some of the dialogue was somewhat mumbled? although it is possible that this was also true of the original; with subtitles I wouldn't notice! As a horror film this isn't excessively scary but there are some well-handled disturbing moments. I cared about the characters and the story interesting. The icy setting gives the story a suitably cold feel.Overall I'd say this is well worth watching and if you enjoy this and haven't seen the original yet I'd recommend searching it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable remake but too many changes from the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a standalone film, it's not actually that bad; however it is not a standalone film - it's a remake of a wonderful film. I appreciate that not everyone wants to watch a film in Swedish with English subtitles, but that doesn't mean there's a necessity to start playing around with the original storyline. Why suddenly set it in America? Why do the characters have different names? Why do things happen in different locations than in the book / original film? Why the need to make it so American &amp; so sensationalist? The acting by the kids is pretty good, but the acting by the adults is pretty woeful, unfortunately. If you have never read the book, never seen the original, and have no intentions of doing either, then I'm sure you could class it as one of the best vampire films, but having done both, for me it is not a patch on either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant remake of a good original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This vampire movie is classic in a way. Here we do not see "daywalkers" that sparkle in the sunlight and live of tomato juice - Hammer Films knows it's roots and offer the real deal of an inhuman creature that dwells in the night. That being said this "creature" is easy to sympathize with: a small girl, seemingly innocent. Then again it is an ageless blood drinking monster - or isn't it? A psychological masterpiece.Chloe Grace Moretz plays this tricky character convincingly and makes this movie as awesome as it is.Most remakes seem to just rely on a good script, possibly a few good names and polished pictures. The result is a cold and bloodless piece of perfection. Not so this one - I'd even say it is the better version. Firstly C.G. Moretz is just awesome in this tricky role and secondly "Let Me In" adds details that show the true devotion of a maker that loves its creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away by this movie. First of all, let me take my hat off for the director: the picture is amazing. The shots are splendid and really add up to the tension of the intrigue. The snow, the blood, and that scene with the policemen putting his hand out and the boy closing the door! Bravo, bravo.There's such strong emotion coming out of the childish way of thinking and acting of the protagonists, and the things they have to do in order to live their story. I know this is a remake, and I unfortunately haven't seen the original, so I can't compare them - perhaps most of the good stuff come from the original, but heck, I loved this one, and I strongly recommend it.Personally, I'm not a huge fan of "tension" movies, but somehow I was hooked from the first scene on, and the tension never left me until the end of the credits. Yes, the credits. It's one of those movies where you sit and listen to the music through the credits while trying to stay in that different place the movie toke you to. I guess we all love certain style of movies, and hate others, but in each genre there's masterpieces that everyone agrees on. For me, this is one of them. Hesitated between 8 and 9/10 - maybe I'll put it back to 8 when the excitement has gone down, but at the moment it's a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In is a haunting film about evil, isolation, and love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is a haunting film about evil, isolation, and love. Set in the 1980's during the Reagan era, it follows the story of lonely 12 year old Owen. This was a time when communities were connected to faith and "evil" was considered something external, much like the Soviets. However, Owen is bullied at school and wrestles with his desire to seek revenge. He wonders if this makes him evil. He then meets a potential friend, a 12 year old girl who has just moved into the apartment next to his with a man who appears to be her father. She seems to be a kindred spirit and encourages Owen to stand up for himself, yet she never seems to feel cold despite the freezing temperatures of the New Mexico winter. Owen does not know the girl, Abby, is a vampire and her "father" is the one who supplies her with blood. The two pre-teens are drawn to each other. They seek comfort in one another, a reprieve from their isolation, and a tender romance begins to form. During this time, a detective begins investigating a string of murders occurring around town. Each victim has been drained of their blood. As Owen will soon discover, Abby is the key to this investigation. The film is carried by the talent of two young actors. Kodie Smit- McPhee, known for his role in 2009's The Road, plays Owen. Chloe Grace Moretz portrays Abby, a very different sort of role for her considering she is best known as Hit Girl from the movie Kick Ass. Despite the short list of credentials the pair has, they give an excellent performance. Their relationship seems very natural. They are supported by actors Richard Jenkins ("the father") and Elias Koteas (the detective). Combined, the actors tell viewers the story of Abby and Owen and bring us into their world. Director Matt Reeves does an excellent job conveying Owen's point of view. Viewers see what he sees through the subjective camera angle and it is a bit voyeuristic for us. However, many scenes are shot with anamorphic widescreen. It is a way to visually distort the image. This is done so we can't quite see the face of Owen's mother when they are speaking and this drives home the point that he doesn't really connect with her. Owen feels very isolated. This type of cinematography is a visual representation of a major theme in the movie (Hurst, 2010). The writer/director Matt Reeves has done a wonderful job representing all major themes, isolation, evil and even love in all aspects of the film. It starts with a horribly burned man being admitted to a hospital while on the television Ronald Reagan is delivering his "Evil Empire" speech. This is an ironic juxtaposition of image and sound. Reagan is delivering a serious speech and denouncing communism as "evil", yet we are seeing a man being cared for in a hospital which is a place generally associated with "good" or "humanity". This is effective because it grabs viewers' attention and draws them in (Reeves, 2010). The scene titled "letting her in" shows Abby entering Owen's apartment without the proper invitation. While it is a gory scene, it is also a very tender scene that shows the budding romance between the two characters. It starts with a knock on the door. Owen answers and steps back to give Abby room to enter. She says, "You have to invite me. "What if I don't? Can't you just come in?" asks Owen. Abby walks through the threshold and moves to the center of the room. All is quiet except for the ambient noise of the television in the background. Abby begins to tremble and blood starts to pour down her face. We are now meant to focus on Abby's face as she bleeds. The frame gets tighter and we are staring at her. As suggested by the authors of The Art of Watching Films, Boggs and Petrie, the apparent movement of the camera (closing in on her face) and the musical score (the increasing volume and intensity of the music) determine the rhythm for this sequence in the film (Reeves, 2010). An effects team member from Dive and Method studios who worked on the film stated, "Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood. But in this case, the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn't have allowed us enough control" (Hurst, 2010). Abby trembles more violently then the camera cuts to Owen so we can see his reaction. All senses are being heightened. Owen gasps and the music swells for effect. He shouts "No, no, no you can come in!" He rushes towards Abby and hugs her. The music dies down and the two share a quiet exchange. Owen asks; "What if I didn't say anything? Would you have kept bleeding? Would you have died?" Abby replies, "I knew you wouldn't let me". All of the thought behind the filming of this scene is extremely beneficial because we as viewers see smooth transitions which enable us to connect emotionally with the content. At the end of this scene, we see the love Owen has for Abby. Even though the two clearly have affection for each other, there is definitely evil in Abby. She is manipulative in the way she gets "Father" to procure blood for her and she is no stranger to killing. She is a woman wise beyond her years trapped in a 12 year old body. Yet on the other hand, she is a lonely girl. The conception of the Abby character reminds us that there is evil in all of us. Just like Owen, and just like all of us at times, she feels isolated and struggles to find the balance between evil and humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Souls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that some have boycotted this movie (and continue to boycott it) because it's a remake of a Swedish film - and apparently a very faithful remake. That strikes me as rather snobbish, to be honest. So it's a remake. Who really cares? My only concern is whether it's a good movie. I can't compare it to the Swedish original - because I haven't seen the Swedish original. But I can say that this movie, standing on its own in my eyes, was really a very beautiful and sensitive movie.How would one categorize it? It's not really a horror movie - although it has horror elements. It's not really a romance (the main characters being too young for me to really see them in that way) - but it has elements of a romance. It's not a thriller - although, yes, it has some of those elements, as well. It's a movie about lost souls, really. Those who don't fit in. Those who are lonely, hurting - truly lost. This comes out even in the less central characters. The school bullies. Bullies are bullies for a reason. It's a way of creating an image of oneself as tough and in control. And my experience of school bullies (thinking back that far!) is that bullies are really frightened cowards, trying to establish themselves as tough by picking on those they're pretty certain won't fight back - and almost always acting in packs. Never one on one. Because one on one would be too frightening for them. Lost souls. And then there was Abby's "father" - stuck in this relationship, with no real escape. Doing things that you sense he would rather not do, but with no real alternative. Lost soul. Even Owen's mom. Her marriage broken up, turning to some sort of extreme-seeming religious experience, trying to find her way through. Lost soul. Lost souls all.But the movie really revolves around Abby and Owen. Owen is the target of the school bullies - a small kid, intimidated by them, not willing to fight back, fearful every day of what they're going to do to him. A broken home; a dad who's absent and a mom who seems to care but is too broken herself to show it very much. And Abby. The saddest of the lost souls in the movie. Twelve years old - for how long? It's never really established. She's a vampire. How she became a vampire is never explained or alluded to. She just is. The character reminded me a bit of the character of Claudia from "Interview With The Vampire" - another 12 year old vampire who never grows up and just has to deal with this never-ending and very sad and lonely existence. Abby's "father" seems to have been a 12 year old boy she befriended years before. He grew up - she doesn't grow up. He finds her "food" for her; takes care of her and protects her. And then, having moved, she meets young Owen. It's a cautious relationship at first. She tells him that they can't be friends. But, both being lost souls, they bond and become very attached to each other. Even when her "secret" comes out - it doesn't change that.Abby was played by Chloe Grace Moretz and Owen was played by Kodi Smit- McPhee. Both would have been young teenagers when this movie was made (13-14). Can you speak of "chemistry" between such young actors? In a sense the word doesn't seem to fit, and yet - what else would you call it? They worked together. They worked brilliantly together. There was a tenderness and a sensitivity to their scenes that went far beyond what you would have expected 13 and 14 year olds to be able to pull off. Both pulled off the "lost soul" persona perfectly. And so their relationship was believable. Of course they were drawn to each other. How could they not have been?"Let Me In" has its share of blood and gore. It has its horror elements. But it's a surprisingly tender and sensitive movie, extremely well put together by director Matt Reeves. The only other piece of work I've seen from him is "Cloverfield," which I also enjoyed - although this, I thought, was better. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not normally one for vampire films but this film was amazing. I was gripped from the start. The main draw for me was the child actors. Both performed perfectly and were extremely believable. It is a very dark film but you often realise you have a silly grin on your face at points.The soundtrack was also fabulous with some classics playing at exactly the right time to tug at your emotions. The plot was clear and you become engrossed in the feelings of the main characters.The film has one of the best endings i've ever seen, you are torn between feelings of sympathy for the characters. I literally could not look away from this film the first time I watched it. The other win for me about this film was that there was no sloppy, soppy, boring love story that you would normally see in a film like this.I have watched this film so many times now and it is definitely in my top ten. I highly recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing film... And I enjoyed it even more on DVD than at the cinema, so have raised it's rating accordingly. It's all about two misfits who find each other, one a lonely bullied boy called Owen whose divorcing parents are worst than useless, and the other is a girl vampire by the name of Abby who must kill to survive and is doomed to be stuck at the age of 12 forever. Together, they make an unconventional but somehow ideal couple, as they confront a world that doesn't understand them and avoid discovery in their dingy little housing complex, but Abby must have blood...A bleak atmosphere pervades the entire film... You get the feeling that most of the people featured here are destined to lead dead-end lives, so perhaps death could only come as a blessed relief to them. Especially Owen, he would probably grow up to be a downbeat, manic-depressant doormat if Abby hadn't come along. It's just a shame it takes one of the bloodiest massacres I've seen for him to find true purpose in his life. There's cruel beauty everywhere, and it's sick and disturbing to watch... but also mesmerisingly beautiful. A true gem. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very dark and dreamlike. It's perfect for movie lovers who are tired of standard blockbuster movies or non-unique movies in general. The fact that Owen is horribly bullied adds so much meaning and depth to his friendship with Abby. Speaking of Abby, Chloe Grace portrays her beautifully and really creates a great character. The word "vampire" is only mentioned once throughout the film. The vampirism adds an element of darkness to the film but it's used sparingly enough to keep it from becoming too focused on vampires. The soundtrack is amazing. It really elevates the scenes and makes most of them very memorable and unique. I'm constantly looking for dark, unique movies with great soundtracks and characters. Let Me In completely fulfilled those criteria and I'm pretty shocked it only has 7.2/10 on IMDb. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watching this film but I did not think I would enjoy it as much as I did. If I can ask viewers one thing, it would be to not read anything about this and watch it with no knowledge of the storyline. Don't read another review and JUST WATCH! As horrors go this is not very scary but would be more haunting than anything else. It does have some gruesome scenes with great make up fx, but the depth of the storyline keeps it being your average graphic horror movie. It is pervasively touching and is extremely beautiful while still keeping the story dark enough to hold it's genre. From beginning to end I was in a trance and really felt the characters were believable. Superb acting from the two youngest stars who carry their lead role with ease. Over all a very good watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a boy loves a vampire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let Me In" is a Hollywood remake of "L?t den Rätte Komma In", a Norwegian film from 2008 based on a novel of the same title. While being slightly different in an "American" way and style, it remains very loyal to the screenplay and script of the original.One of the more obvious changes in the American version is the way Abby appeared in the scenes where she feeds. The "vampiric" eyes, change of voice and swift movement were not in the original, and were a good addition.The story is beautiful, touching and heart warming. As an audience, we find ourselves sympathetic and empathetic towards a vampire, who isn't presented as en evil creature of the night - but as a victim of its own existence, merely trying to survive. Alone, isolated and in need of affection, understanding and acceptance - she finds a boy, tormented by bullies at school and his parents' divorce, who yearns for the same things she does. The bond between them is beautiful.And then - there are the victims. Mostly innocent people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and for that - died. Isn't that evil?Let Me In might not be a scary film, and is not your usual Horror film. But it makes you think, wonder, question, and above all - feel. Very highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let Me In is a brilliant remake of the 2008 Swedish film, "Let the Right One In." This is a horror film per se, but it's more about a film about bonding, family, and love. When I mean vampire love, this story has nothing to do with the Twilight series at all. This film should satisfy both drama and horror fans alike.This film is about how a bullied boy and his mother have mysterious new neighbors move in next door. The boy starts up a friendship with the new girl next door, but she is not the normal new girl.....The acting is very good. Chloe Grace Moretz is a fine young actress with a great road ahead of her. Kodi Smit-McPhee holds his own very well in this film.Overall, this is a great example of a remake done properly. Not all remakes will be bad as this film proves. Let Me In is sufficient in showing gore and violence, but it also has a big heart. This film also plays very well with the average human's emotions. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes are not always necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it can even be an improvement over the original, due to an higher budget or more and better experienced people involved, both in front and behind the cameras. But there are also certain remakes that don't try to be bigger and better than the original movie and mostly simply rely on the original material, that was good enough as it was already. This is one of those remakes. You could perhaps say that it's playing things simply safe by trying to remain loyal to the original or you could also say it's being respectful toward its original material and makes the movie and story simply more accessible and available to a broader audience. I certainly didn't mind the movie taking this kind of approach and it's still different enough with little things and nuances to allow this movie to coexist, alongside the original and to also consider this a watchable and good movie, even if you're already familiar with the original one.Some people claim this is simply being a shot-by-shot remake of the 2008 Swedish movie "L?t den rätte komma in" but people probably only say this because both movies have a very similar visual style and some sequences and pieces of dialog are being exactly the same. But really, there is still plenty of difference between the two movies. Not just minor story changes but some characters are simply completely left out or added into the movie.Then the unavoidable question of which movie is the better one? Well, both are in some ways better than the other. For instance, in the original the whole relationship and friendship between the two main characters worked out far better and more convincing, while in this movie there are less distractions and it really mainly focuses on its main plot line and 2 main characters. In other words; both movies are good in their own way, despite them being the same, in a lot of ways.The foremost thing I like about this movie is that it's a kid's movie but a very dark one. It's horror but not kid's horror that got done in a very fluffy or exaggerated way, in order to be more safe and considerate toward children and their 'tender, unspoiled' souls. It's really not holding back with anything and basically the movie got done like any other horror production. It takes its young audience more serious in that regard and this really pays off.Because it's a serious and very straightforward done film, it's also very good to watch for adults as well. Really, people of all ages should be able to appreciate the drama, horror and mystery of this movie and everybody will get something (different) out of it.It's a well done and subtle told movie, that isn't necessarily fast paced but yet never boring. It always remains a humble film, that mostly just sticks to its two main characters, giving this movie also a somewhat more realistic feeling, despite its fantasy concept. Its dark and moody atmosphere strengthens the movie its themes and characters and besides ensures that the movie has good look to it, all throughout.A movie worth seeing for everyone, even if you have already seen the original.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnificent remake from a prestigious Sweden film dealing with Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) , a bullied 12-year old, dreams of revenge . He falls in love with Abby, a peculiar girl . Owen's parents are in the process of a nasty divorce, and he lives with his mummy (Cara Buono , whose face is never shown throughout the entire film). One evening, he notices a girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) about his age and her father (Richard Jenkins) moving into the apartment next door to his . Despite being asked twice by Owen , Abby never reveals her true age. She can't stand the sun or food and to come into a room she needs to be invited . Owen spies on his neighbors Jack and Virginia from his telescope, his neighbor who exercises at home, Abby and the father from the cracked door, Abby while she is changing clothes, the policeman from the peephole in Abby's apartment, and Kenny on several occasions, including when he is harassed by his brother in front of his friends . Abby gives Owen the strength to hit back but when he realizes that Abby needs to drink other people's blood to live he's faced with a choice. How much can love forgive? . Meanwhile a police detective (Elias Koteas, who plays , also provides the voice of Owen's father) investigates some strange murders .This is an interesting story about early adolescence, vengeance, and vampires . Marvelously sad and melancholic tale about loneliness and longing for love and starred by two phenomenal kid actors. The picture details in elegant and deliberate style the bizarre misadventures of a pair of pre-teen star crossed lovers, one of whom is an androgynous vampire . Production value and set design are stellar , with all technical aspects , lighting , soundtrack , and photography , blending in perfect synchronization to produce a Hitchockian tale that somehow brings love and life into what could have been the darkest drama imaginable . It is poetic , sensible , artistic , and in many manners a pretty profound film delving the nature of evilness and goodness . The title of the original Swedish novel, and the film based on it, was ¨Let the Right One In¨ by Tomas Alfredson , which was successful around the world . Extraordinary performance of Grace Moretz , in the scenes where Abby is barefoot in the snow, Chloë was really barefoot , during filming the crew had to heat up her feet in between takes so she didn't get too cold . Equally sensational is Kodi Smit as a shy kid who is harassed on as usual by three older boys . Very good cinematography by Greig Fraser , filmed on location in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Los Alamos, New Mexico , where is colorfully set the action . Thrilling and emotive musical score by Michael Giacchino , J.J. Abrams's usual .The motion picture well produced by a reborn Hammer Company was stunningly directed by Matt Reeves (Coverfield , Palbearer) ; he explained why a deleted scene, showing Abby being attacked as a human, was cut , contrary to the belief that the scene, depicting her being changed to a vampire and entering Owen's mind, would be too intense for the viewers, Reeves stated that he felt the scene would have disturbed the flow of the film . Rating : Better than average , essential and indispensable seeing .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me in is a remake of the Swedish film, Let the right one in, which is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. It is so good that there is no reason for another version. That being said, Hollywood has managed to make a fairly decent version for those of you who are too lazy to read subtitles. The plot is basically the same as the original with a twelve year old boy being constantly picked on by classmates at school. He befriends a girl, Abby, a next door neighbor and fellow loner. Chloe Grace Moretz is a good choice as the little outcast. The reason for her isolated status, is her need for blood to survive, she is a vampire of an unknown age. Her father Thomas(Richard Jenkins, Oscar nominated for The Visitor), is an enabler, he kills in order to supply his daughter with blood. After Thomas dies, Abby tells her friend Owen her secret which he accepts as they help each other against all enemies. The ending is fine, and although not as good as the original, Let Me In is good enough to watch for an entertaining and well made scare flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only giving it a three because the main actress was hot. Otherwise, this movie is an incomprehensible mess.What I found is that the Swedish method of storytelling is often disjointed and non-linear. The plot meanders all over the place.Short version, a young girl is infected with a disease that makes her a vampire. She survives by stealing blood, but avoids killing at all costs. She starts an affair with the child of a childhood friend, who manipulates her into killing her friend with some really powerful headtrip. In the course of a fight, she maims him, and then out of remorse, resurrects him as a vampire. The film begins with the incredibly surreal and yet profoundly impressive scenes in which a Christ-like figure encounters grotesque situations and bizarre religious imagery... This is only a very vague description of the beginning of "Let Me In", but describing it adequately simply isn't possible - and if it was, it would not be desirable to do so, as this film is a unique work of art which all that are even slightly interested in cinema MUST experience for themselves. Beatles legend Ringo Starr was reportedly so impressed by "Let Me In Right Away", that he convinced manager Tobin Armbrust to finance this film. The obvious higher budget allowed Matt Reeves to build up incredible settings for "Let Me In". Matt Reeves's masterpiece is overwhelming in all aspects imaginable - be it the brilliantly grotesque imagery, the ingeniously bizarre plot that is impossible to properly describe, or the countless sequences and subplots in which the film spoofs all kinds if institutions such as governments, the church, or modern artistic pretentiousness alike. The film sarcastically points out the corruption, hypocrisy and brutality of the world in a most brilliant manner that is both shocking and ironic to a point that is sometimes hilarious. All that is presented in a unique, purely Matt Reevesesque atmosphere, accompanied by an insanely brilliant score. Reeves never used famous actors in his films (except for "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory " which I haven't seen), in fact many of the actors in his films never participated anywhere else, but it is obvious that all those involved were absolutely committed to Reeves and the brilliance of his work. Reeves himself, once again, directs the film, some call him 'The Alchemist', a title which, once again, cannot properly be described in words. Reeves's trademark casting of people with handicaps and deformities in supporting roles (which was also the case in "Campfire Tales" and "Future Shock") sometimes reminds me of Tod Browning's 1932 masterpiece "Freaks", and, as it is the case in Browning's milestone, it can never possibly be misinterpreted as voyeurism. On the contrary, these people are shown in an incomparably more positive light than most of the others, and then again, it is hard to determine whether or not anyone in the film is really meant to appear as 'positive'. On could possibly go on puzzling about what the film is supposed to mean, and never come to a conclusion, even after watching it ten times and philosophizing about it after each viewing. It is, however, without any doubt that this is an absolute must-see for every lover of film. The first twenty minutes alone are among the most unforgettable cinematic experiences one can have, and there is a lot more to come. My review of "Let Me In" may not even vaguely point out what an overwhelming experience this is, but, if it encourages anyone to see the film, I will be more than satisfied. In short: "Let Me In" is Reeves's most brilliant film and one of the greatest cinematic experiences one can have. 10 out of 10, and if it was possible, I'd even reward it with a higher rating! I'm sure that there will be an American remake of this film in a few years, and that one might actually make sense. Don't expect the rerun of the original in terms of substance of the script and quality film-making in general, because that's not gonna happen, at least not in this movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids who can act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow what a pleasant surprise this was. I was expecting the film to be OK but is was great. This is mainly down to the 2 young actors in the lead roles who are simply fantastic. They prove that you can act without the histrionics of a Dakota Fanning or Hoel Haley Osmond. I expected Chloe from Kickass to be good but the boy as well. Simply amazing. I don't think I have ever seen and probably never will see a film where two such young people provide such a thoughtful and convincing romantic performance without feeling wrong or uncomfortable. It also proves that you can make an excellent horror film without a load of torture porn and gore. Create a amazingly believable story and well drawn characters who are amazingly portrayed by the two young leads and you achieve an innovative movie. It just feels like a couple of kids running away and they are having a normal conversation at the end. Ther is no need to see the obvious trail of destruction left behind or a wailing mother. It just feels so perfect for them to be together for time immemorial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A faithful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American movie makers don't have an especially impressive track record when it comes to adapting hit foreign films for stateside audiences (who generally avoid like the plague anything with subtitles). But with "Let Me In," a remake of the highly acclaimed Swedish film "Let the Right One In," Hollywood finally gets one right. This somber and chilling tale of a friendless, put-upon 12-year-old boy who becomes romantically (albeit platonically) involved with the vampire-girl next door emerges as a sort of antidote to the far more crowd-pleasing and commercially successful "Twilight" series, providing a more subdued and thoughtful variation on the same theme.Transferring its setting from Scandinavia to an equally frigid and snowbound Los Alamos, New Mexico, the remake remains true to the core elements that made the original such a quality film in the first place: its artful tone, its unsensationalistic approach to its material, and its incisive look at what it means to be a misfit in a world in which conformity is prized above all else ? and never more so than during adolescence. For Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) are both outcasts from society, Abby quite literally since her condition makes it impossible for her to interact with others in any kind of meaningful way (except to devour their blood). But Owen is no less of an outsider, since his diminutiveness, shyness and dreamy nature make him an easy and perpetual target for the town's bullies. It's no surprise, then, that Owen and Abby eventually reach out to one another for love and acceptance, despite the seeming impossibility of their relationship.As a horror film, "Let Me In" doesn't hold back from showing us the requisite gore and grue that comes with the genre, but director Matt Reeve's script is far more concerned with the interaction among characters and the exploration of theme than it is with piling up easily achievable gross-out moments. For instance, the gruesome task of securing victims that Abby and others close to her are forced to do to assure her continued survival help to make this a profoundly sad and emotionally unsettling story.Smit-McPhee and Moretz are both superb as the inter-species Romeo and Juliet, and there's a fine supporting cast to boot.In this case at least, "Let Me In" is a command well worth obeying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent but unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Independently from the utility, relevance and quality from this remake, I will say something: I felt a chill all over my body when I saw the words "A Hammer Films Production" in the screen. I could not avoid it; the films from that British studio substantially contributed to the obsession with horror cinema I developed during my childhood. And now, various decades later, I liked to see that name associated again with my favorite genre (even though it was only a distributor, and even though it never disappeared actually). End of the nerd's speech. Now, let's move on the subject which concerns us: the film Let Me In, a competent but unnecessary remake of the brilliant Swedish film Let the Right One In.I would put Let Me In at the same level of Quarantine or Dark Water: North American remakes which have a certain level of intrinsic quality despite the questionable reasons which motivated their making. In other words, I think Let Me In is a solid horror movie on its own merit, with a good atmosphere, some well achieved moments of suspense and excellent performances from Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee (who had both already left me astonished in Kick-Ass and The Road, respectively). On the other side of the coin, I have to mention a few scenes which try to startle us with bad special effects and cheap thrills.In conclusion, Let Me In is a good movie (but if I have to talk about recommendations, my absolute suggestion would be for you to watch the original film), but which suffers from the "Hollywood Syndrome", supposing that the spectators are idiots, and that because of that, it has to explain everything and leave nothing to the imagination, because otherwise we would not understand it (for example: instead of letting the spectator to deduct that the film is set during the 80's, the screenplay feels obliged to say that from the beginning and, just in case we did not understand it, it fills various scenes with relics from that decade, including Ms. Pac-Man, Ronald Reagan, Culture Club and the song Turning Japanese; and if it does that with the historical context, which is not very relevant, imagine what it does with more relevant stuff, like the relationship between one of the main characters and her "father"; wow, what a long parenthesis). So, Let Me In is not a bad movie, and I moderately enjoyed it while I was watching it; however, that does not avoid me from considering it unnecessary: why trying to fix something which is not broken?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe that this was filmed in New Mexico, but after visiting Los Alamos this winter, it made sense. I live in Albuquerque. Hollywood can alter reality as much as possible. This is beautiful work from Matt Reeves. It is also interesting what vampires really are and why there is so much fascination nowadays but that is another topic.The actors are excellent specially the young actors and yes this is an excellent love story. Matt Reeves just changed the bar for Vampire-Romance movies.On a technical sense, the filming is really excellent. I think in New Mexico even in the winter we get good light and I think this is really advantageous. It really adds warmth in a subtle way. I lived in Sweden for a year or so and it will be interesting to compare the tone of the film itself based on the cinematography. I also like that in some ways the film is almost monochromatic.My only last comment is that own is in many ways effed even after the film, because he will be the next guardian and that is a very hard situation that he will be in for the rest of his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best American horror films i've have ever seen....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw Let Me In at the cinema in November last year, and i had the chance to buy the DVD last week. I'm going to say that it has to be the most amazing horror film i've seen in perhaps the last 10 years or even longer. The acting in the movie was absolutely superb. I thought that (Chloe Grace Moretz) who played the part of the girl Abby in the film was one of the very best actresses i have ever seen on film for a girl of her age. The scenery in the film was absolutely wonderful especially all the snowflakes coming down from the sky. The film is about a boy called Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who lives with his mother. One day he happens to meet this 12 year old girl called Abby, who has recently just moved into the apartment next door to him. they soon become good friends after Owen becomes bullied by some of the pupils at his school. I also thought that the actor who played Owen was so brilliant as well for someone so young. i would absolutely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys watching excellent horror films: 9/10</fullReview>

The characters and environment and does not try to play into those other mainstream vampire movies, it's more of an early coming of age (My Girl) meets Stephen King type horror flick(The It). Of course, Chloe is rising star to watch out for she was brilliant in Kick-Ass, almost stoled the movie for me and again she delivers those believable childlike character trait yet so mature put together with her expression or acting...she's go skillz.

		<shortDescription>"Let The Right One In" is better, but this version is still pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film would have had a impact if I seen it before seeing "Let The Right One In" which is a 2008 romantic horror flick from Sweden. The movie does has it's elements to make it is own movie, although it's very slight in that department. The atmosphere and the vampire girl was just better in the 2008 version. The make up and special effects is better in this version and some parts of the cinematography is also better. Lina Leandersson who played Eli the vampire girl in the 2008 version was better, but Chloë Grace Moretz did a decent job. I usually try not to compare a film with another film, but it's difficult in this case because after finishing this movie I started to feel like the movie was pointless. Since most parts of this movie has been done in the 2008 version, except this time it's in English. And besides it probably going to get more wider audiences there is little difference between the two movies. I personally liked Owen in this movie over the uber wussy Oskar, I just found Oskar highly irritating to watch in the 2008 version while Owen on the other hand isn't really annoying to watch. Some add ins in this version I enjoyed, one of them is how the pedo guy who brings the vampire girl blood is more explored and more in depth with. There is also more use of CGI in this which is fine because it makes the vampire girl seem more like a vampire, the fire scene is done better in this version as well. This movie is still pretty good but I would still recommend the 2008 version over this one since it's just more powerful and leaves a bigger impact.7.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let me out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a Swedish film, so the rating is provisional until I get a chance to watch the original (if ever). That said, this is a good film. On the surface it's a vampire horror movie, but actually it's borderline art-house, with little action taking place in a leisurely and apathetic fashion (very un-cinematic).The plot centers around a boy who is being bullied at school, while being neglected by his divorced mother (who is religious and hates men). The boy is a passive character who just takes the abuse, with all the expected effects in his psychology. His alter-ego is a vampire girl, an aggressive character who is practically being served by a father-like figure. For all intents and purposes, the two characters are mirror images of each other. The vampire girl is the boy's violent desires visualized.This film is more similar (and actually better) to Gus Van Sant's "Elephant", rather than to any rendition of "Dracula" (or any of the neo-glam vampire films of late).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The Book....And The Swedish Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching "Let Me In", I went out and picked up the Swedish film and the original book to do a little compare &amp; contrast.First, I read the book after seeing this film because I wanted to understand what Matt Reeves Meant in the commentary when he stated that the Richard Jenkins character was so different than what the author had originally created.To be quite honest, I'm extremely glad that Matt Reeves made the changes that he made. The book(Let The Right One In)was in my opinion, poorly written and way over the top. I thought the author's so-called plot twist were a bit too disturbing. Overkill is the best word I can think of to describe the book.Second, I got a hold of the Swedish film(Let The Right One In)which I thought was alright, but it tried entirely too hard to be like the book instead of standing out on its own the way "Let Me In" has done.There is a such thing as too much information, like in the director's cut of the classic film "Cinema Paradiso" and the special edition of Copland with Sylvester Stallone. I believe the abbreviation is TMI, and both the book and Swedish film had a ton of TMI all over the place.Now this film on the other hand, was about as flawless as flawless can get. Perfect casting, perfect performances, great effects and cinematography, all brilliantly directed by Matt Reeves.Matt Reeves is a crafter, sculptor, molder of films and is a masterful story teller. Kodi Smit-McPhee was already one of my favorite child actors after seeing his wonderful performance in "The Road", and Chloe Grace Moretz couldn't be bad at acting if she tried. My Prediction Chloe Grace Moretz is gonna win an Oscar before she turns eighteen. Anybody want to take a bet with me on that? Didn't think so...Hehehehehe...I hope they actually make a sequel out of this film, perhaps even a television series for HBO or Showtime (preferably Showtime)Because if any movie deserves a chance to captivate everyone again and again, it's certainly this one, And that's all there is too it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In is a solid remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Do you think there's such a thing as evil? ¨ Many viewers might consider Let Me In as one of the best films of the year because it is such a great horror-romantic film, but that's only because they probably haven't seen the original Swedish version entitled Lat den ratte Komma (Let the Right One In) directed by Tomas Alfredson back in 2008. Both these films are based on the novel of the same name written by Ajvide Lindqvist. The original Swedish film is just breathtaking and an absolutely brilliant film which I didn't think needed to be remade. It is one of the best horror movies of the decade and without a doubt the best vampire film. When I heard it was going to be remade I was a little disappointed, but I still wanted to see how they went about it. Let Me In is actually a decent remake, but not nearly as great as the original. If you haven't seen either of these films then I recommend you watching the original one, but if you don't like having to read subtitles then I guess the American version is worth your time. The story is so powerful that it works in both these films, but of course I already knew what was going to happen so I wasn't all that blown away by this film as I had been with the original one. Lindqvist actually collaborated with the screenplay of the original film while Matt Reeves adapted the screenplay for the American version. Matt Reeves (known for his direction and collaboration with J.J. Abrams in Cloverfield) directs this film by trying to stay as true as possible to the original film. Many of the scenes are similar in both films and the storyline is pretty much the same with a few minor changes.As for the plot goes the names of the main characters have been changed. Eli is now Abby (played by Chloe Moretz) and Oskar is Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The story which took place in a Swedish suburb now takes place in New Mexico. Owen is a twelve year old kid who spends a lot of time alone in his house due to the fact that his parents are getting a divorce. He talks to himself a lot and dreams of getting revenge on the kids who bully him at school (who instead of tormenting him to squeal like a pig like they did in the original film, in Let Me In they torment him with telling him to cry like a girl). Owen plays with his knife imagining he is fighting off Kenny (Dylan Minnette), the bully from school, by stabbing a tree and repeating the words cry like a girl. One night in his quiet neighborhood a twelve year old girl moves in to the apartment next door along with who seems to be his father. The girl is Abby (Chloe Moretz) and the guardian's name is never mentioned (played by Richard Jenkins). We soon find out that Abby is not your normal girl, her guardian actually is a serial killer who drains the blood of his victims in order to feed Abby. The problem is that Jenkins's character is getting old and sloppy and he is a bit unsuccessful in his few tries. The police officer who is investigating the murders is played by Elias Koteas. We aren't given his name either, because the central theme of the film revolves around Owen and Abby's friendship. They somehow discover that they need each other despite their differences.This film works because it stays true to the original story and central theme of the novel dealing with the bond that Owen and Abby form. It is such a powerful story that raises questions about love, friendship, and morality. Owen loves Abby, but is she evil? That is a question he will have to find an answer to himself. I loved the two kid actors in the Swedish version, and the two American actors are equally as good. Chloe Moretz is just fantastic as Abby. She makes us fall in love with her despite the fact that she is a bloodsucking vampire. There seems to be a sadness and innocence in her face that also captivates Owen. It has been a great year for Chloe as an actress. She was also so good in Kick-Ass one of the most entertaining films of the year. These two roles are very different from each other and Chloe Moretz has proved she belongs in Hollywood. What I really didn't enjoy as much as the original film was the cinematography. The Swedish film was beautifully shot by Hoyte Van Hoytema (who recently worked in The Fighter) and the scenery was just spectacular. I remember being awed by the white snow contrasting with the dark red blood, especially in the first murder scene. In Let Me In the cinematography (Greg Fraser) just wasn't as breathtaking. I still think this is a decent remake, but I have to stick with the original. The story just moved and shocked me at the same time, but I already knew what I was getting into in this film so it wasn't as surprising. If you haven't seen any of these two movies, see the original Swedish film first, but if you don't like subtitles Let Me In isn't a bad choice either.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last some decent vampire movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent times the vampires has being abused. They have become young men with sparkling skin and the type who fall in love with human women. And every lady out there now wishes that any good looking man by the name of Edward is a hot vampire.Keeping this common garbage aside, there are still good vampire movies exists in Hollywood. Which truly speaks of the hardcore nature of a set of creatures who cannot live without drinking human blood and will do anything bizarre to the human eye to possess it. These creatures are treacherous curs upon human kind and shows no mercy when the scent of blood lures them in. And that's what the true fan and viewer would expect from a vampire movie.'Let me in' is a not a joy ride. And it's not a total horror movie either. It speaks of real life, daunting experiences and most of all emotions which you cannot run away from even though you wish to. Kids appear in thrillers and horrors are not something new. But when kids appear in them and run the whole script from themselves is mostly seeing only in children's movies and seldom in a horror. That's where 'Let me in' does its wonder.The story occurs in a remote town covered in snow back in 1983. A 12 year old skinny kid Owen (Cody Smit Mc-Phee- The Road) who is going through a tough time at home with his parents' divorce and mothers addiction to alcohol has no friends and habitually roams around his apartment all alone eating candy. Maybe the only getaway in his life is his telescope which he uses to innocently spy on the neighbors. Meanwhile he is brutally bullied in school by a gang of kids and in deep he wishes that he should fight back but never does. On a usual lonely night he finds himself getting friendly with the newly moved next door neighbors daughter Abby (Chloe Morezt- Kick Ass) in the same age and discovers that she is not normal. Day by day when there are tragic murders happen around the neighborhood and police and people go vigilant, Owen realize that his new best friend is a vampire. While trying to fight his fears and stand up against them Owen emotionally creates a deep bond towards Abby which turns a new chapter in his life.'Let me in' is a true drama. Even though there are painfully scary scene or two time to time it's far from being a total horror movie. There are moments where you truly feel sorry and sad for the boy. Feel like you have to help him but your too far away. The vampire girl has her own reasons to be angry and behave the way she does. But it seems like she is having a cycle of life and you feel what's going to be the end of it. Once you are trapped in eternal life and have to kill to survive the worlds suddenly seems like a strange place.Some of the scenes are quite disturbing and unexpected. The cinematography precisely creates them and its mind blowing. Every dark corner, shadow and light is a mere reflection of emotions. The sets are made with detailed objects and shapes which put the viewer in to a dark corner. There are hardly few scenes in the day time. The rest are totally under the lights and behind shadows. Tough work for the crew and the director but no complaints.And there is a big deal of credit goes to the little actors. They portray much wanted talent throughout the movie and you may at one point forget that you are dealing with adults stuff from a kids point of view. Strong performance.'Let me in' is a true work of cinema. And true work of mythology and its representation. Which eventually makes you feel like the real fears are out there in the dark and we live like it never exists. When you brilliantly mix up a mystery with real life situations and people it's obvious that the viewer will be moved by it. You don't need a gang of vampires or a whole council of them to make a point. Just one 12 year old kid is all that it takes.Read my reviews at www.flickshout.blogspot.com</fullReview>

This release is really worth watching, even if it's a remake(not to say a very faithful copy) after the recent Swedish production Let The Right One In 2008. It is worth because it's a different vampire movie, an original idea, a beautiful and emotional story. But, the largest credits are going to the two young actors who had an outstanding performance. And, for those who didn't went to this movie...you lost one of the best vampire movies ever.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, an American remake that doesn't suck.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not that I didn't have the opportunity to watch the original 'Let the Right One In' first, but lately I've noticed that some American remakes of good foreign films are getting the shaft critically(almost as if some haven't even been given a chance - like this one). I went in without seeing the original and without reading the book. I understand the stigma... films like 'Vanilla Sky', 'Funny Games', and 'Point of No Return' HAVE BEEN inferior remakes, but I went in with a clear mind and conscious, holding no bias or comparison sheet for 'Let Me In'.Great Movie. Just the thought of the IMDb rating holding the original to a higher standard has me on board the next time I head to the video store, but this 'remake' scores. I'll give the original it's day in the sun later this week, but something in the back of my mind tells me it won't be any better than this - except for the fact that it is the original theatrical production of this story. And if it is better - I'll be back on here eating crow and writing another review.There are many great aspects to this film.The first is a depiction of Vampire life that is far more realistic/believable than most films in this genre. It stays true to the aspects of Vampire lore, but doesn't embellish anything or add many new aspects(other than being 'asked' to come inside).In many of these types of films the lead vampire is this cold person who has let his/her predicament turn them into an unlikable character - even with a solid performance. The lead here gives us a great performance, and despite knowing very little about her background or how she became a vampire - I cared far more for her vampire character than any other ever depicted in this genre. All the performances here are first rate, and the dialogue while minimal is effective and straight to the point.The second thing that I really loved about this movie was the questions it asked about how/if vampires can befriend/live with humans without turning them into a vampire. The two lead performances enhance this aspect of the film.This isn't a shocking film about vampires. It's a slower paced film shot with style, and chock full of interesting characters and believable situations. You can nearly count the kills on one hand, but on the other hand, the kills are tastefully done(*chuckle*).Highly recommended! 82/100 A vampire film with compassion, great performances, and no need for a sequel. How novel.Late EDIT - now that I've seen them both - I'd say they're about equal..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Story Ever Told (although you may not have realized it yet)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this appears to be a simple horror movie or romance, it is neither. It is however the greatest story ever told on film. The essence of the movie is that the crux of female nature is to say and do anything to trick males into falling in love with them for the entirety of their lives in order for females to protect themselves and exploit men all without men being aware of the process. It is this controversial subject matter that Let Me In explores. The movie opens with a scene from the middle of the film of a man in agonizing pain being rushed to a hospital in Los Alamos, birth place of the atomic bomb, selected to set the background for something that is meant to be equally, secretive, powerful and pernicious: the destruction of the male soul (the atom) through the courtship process (the energy to split the atom).The victim's face has been burned off and his name is never known. This man is faceless and nameless because he is a representation of all manhood. At the hospital we meet the film's protagonist, a policeman charged with the job of finding and keeping the soul of a young boy, safe from female nature. Shortly after arriving the burned man is found dead in what appears to be a suicide. The policeman exits the building and through the window we see the reflection of a female slowly stalking behind him setting the theme of the rest of the movie.The story goes back two weeks as an explanation for the man's death is sought. A young boy, Owen, is sitting alone on the bottom rung of a jungle gym. Throughout the movie he is always on the bottom wrung, as the jungle gym is a metaphor for something greater. He is being called by his mother to dinner, in what is actually a call for possession of his soul by female nature which is quickly countered by a telephone call from Owen's father informing his mother he is seeking custody of the boy. Neither parent's face is shown nor name revealed, again to show ubiquity. Although the boy stays with his mother, the father does (in essence) set out for possession of his son in the form of the policeman, which is eluded to as the actor who plays the role of the officer also does the telephone voice of the father.After the argument Owen retreats to his room where he looks out a telescope into the housing complex, an act that shows he is interested in learning about the world. This is significant, as the people Owen encounters are all going through various phases of the courtship process. Soon he spies Abby, a young girl (who he is immediately bewitched by), who is moving into his apartment building. Abby leads the way carrying a very superior look on her face while a man, presumably her father, slavishly carries a trunk inside the building.The movie moves to a scene of Owen getting bullied in school. While he is frequently the recipient of bullying the writer's intent is not to make Owen an anomaly. As we later see, the head bully is bullied by yet a bigger bully. We realize that this is a representation of the male world; competitive and brutal for all men, not just Owen. As Abby and Owen's relationship grows we understand that Owen (males) finds solace from this violence and constant competition with Abby (females). But for that solace there is a price to be paid.We soon discover that Abby is a vampire (a metaphor) and her "father" has been murdering people for her. We also find out that her "father" is not her father, but was once a boy like Owen who fell in love with Abby and became older looking while Abby never aged. Abby's real age is left out of the movie to create the idea that that she has been using men for essentially as long as there have been men. In a symbolic act Abby's "father" wears a garbage bag over his head when he commits these murders. He has become trash to her and when he tells her that he is getting tired of serving her, Abby begins her courtship of Owen to find a replacement.As she courts him most conversations take place on the jungle gym (a square with many squares inside it) which is a representation of the Rubik's Cube Owen is trying to figure out, but cannot. He gives it to Abby and she is able to figure it out almost immediately. The Rubik's Cube is supposed to be a puzzle that reveals the other gender's nature. It is significant that Abby can understand Owen's nature, but Owen cannot figure out Abby's nature. Abby is always positioned above him on jungle gym indicating the female advantage in the courtship situation is having knowledge over the nature of the male. At the end of the movie several significant parental events take place. 1) The dead man in the hospital turns out to be Abby's "father" whom she killed which now leaves her alone. 2) Abby puts on Owen's mother's dress indicating that she will assume the new role of his mother. 3) Owen's father figure, the policeman is unable to reach Owen in time to save him. The two are now free to be their own keepers. But who is keeping whom? Finally Owen elopes with Abby on a train. She is hidden inside the trunk. Owen eats candy and looks out the window and sings "eat some now, save some for later" the slogan for a taffy called "Now and Later". The implication is that although candy is good (females) now, they will consume you later and that Owen will turn out exactly like his predecessor, the destroyed "father" from the first scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique vampire horror gem with a solid story and acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let Me In" follows a boy named Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who is a outcast and gets bullied on a regular basis at school. To make matters worse, Owen lives a pretty depressing life at home with his mother (Cara Buono) who is constantly arguing with her ex-husband over the phone. One night, Owen notices a new family moving into the complex and wonders who they are. The following night while sitting in the park, Owen is greeted by Abby (Chloë Grace Moretz) who begins to talk to him for the first time. The two of them instantly form a bond and become close friends. The only issue is that Abby is not human but rather a vampire who needs to feed off humans in order to survive. An interesting and well made vampire flick ensues...I have to point out right away that I have not seen the original Swedish film. I do realize that I should have before watching the remake but fear not, I have it at home and will watch it very soon. With that being said, I didn't know what to think of "Let Me In" before I watched it. I wanted to see it just because Chloe Moretz from "Kick-Ass" was in it but other than that it didn't make my must-see movie list. The reason why is probably because I am not a big fan of horror films as a whole because they are usually clichéd and stupid. I am also a little sick and tired of recent vampire films. This film, however, received solid reviews and intrigued me enough to see it. It's not everyday that a horror film gets solid reviews so I knew this had to be somewhat decent. Sadly, "Let Me In" didn't really do well in the theaters (no surprise there) so I had to rent it in order to see it.Over the past few years, vampire films have become a dime a dozen. Luckily, "Let Me In" is one that truly stands out. Its nice to see that Matt Reeves actually took the time to create a solid horror film about vampires. What stood out the most about "Let Me In" was that it's focus was on the "old" version of vampires. You know the ones seen before "Twilight" and "True Blood" flooded the market. Abby is not your typical vampire and that also adds to it. The character itself is very likable and you as a viewer feel bad that this poor girl has become a vampire. The bond that she shares with Owen is genuine and sincere BUT is also extremely believable. I think that was another key element of this film. In a lot of films, you see characters that don't really fit with one another but Owen and Abby seemed to be a perfect fit for one another.The scares in "Let Me In" were not the typical horror clichés that one may expect when watching a film like this. Matt Reeves relied heavily on the cinematography and scene set up to create the overall mood for the film. The movie was very dark and gloomy but that fit the film's theme. By doing using these elements wise, Reeves set the mood for the film therefore making the scares work to the best of his advantage. The story also had several story-lines going on at once, which I felt kept the viewer always interested in and questioning what was going to happen next. The multiple story-lines included Abby and her guardian, Owen and the bullies, Abby and Owen's relationship, and of course Owen's home life. I also loved how the film's story felt like a horror retelling of "Romeo and Juliet." The screenplay was well written with solid character development. Any film junkie knows that a screenplay is only as good as the actors you pick to play the role and if they have chemistry. There are really only two main stars in this film those being Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloë Grace Moretz. Both of them shine in their roles and I am going to put this out there right now that Moretz is going to be a huge actress in the next couple of years. She is already skilled as an actress at a very young age. There were a few smaller supporting roles in this film including Richard Jenkins and the three kids who played the bullies. All of which played their part and played it well. I think in terms of acting for a horror movie, this was some of the best I seen. I know that isn't saying much but everyone really nailed the role they played."Let Me In" is a breathe of fresh air for the horror genre and more specifically in the vampire sub-genre. I can't really say how loyal this version is to the original but based on my research for the film, it is extremely similar with a few scenes being almost identical. I think "Let Me In" will end up being a cult classic for those who appreciate it as a well made vampire flick. I don't think "Let Me In" will be loved by all because it is very dark, gloomy and a deeper than your typical horror flick. Those who like the "True Blood" take on vampires may or may not enjoy it. As a whole the film is not what you would expect from your average horror film but more or less what you would expect from a independent one. Its basically a character study focusing on a troubled boy who shares a special bond with a girl who happens to be a vampire. While its not for everyone, I know that as a film lover I thought this film was a great staple in the horror film library and will be a Blu Ray I will be adding to my collection.MovieManMenzel's final rating for a solid 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the point of the remake? It's so obvious...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing this movie I was faced with a mighty question: what mark should I give it? It's an '8, 9, or even 10' rated movie there's no doubt about that.But the two main problems I have with it are: A) Why remake an almost carbon copy of the Swedish original (Let The Right One In) barely months after its release? And secondly, how on this earth can the 'screenwriters' for Let Me In even get a credit, when clearly the movie isn't an interpretation of the book, BUT A 95% COPY OF THE ORIGINAL FILM? Almost scene by scene, and word by word.That is so darn weird.Of course, we know the answer to the first question. The guys remade the film because they recognised it was a brilliant ORIGINAL movie, and wanted to cash in on it. But this time, it would be 'their movie'. And any references to the original can be conveniently brushed under the carpet.There's no point giving you a synopsis, because that's not what my review is about. My problem is the mark. I recognise the film is a great achievement. But what kind of an achievement? The achievement is how all involved managed to rip-off an original and sell it very successfully as their own, even down to giving themselves writing credits.Now that sucks. For that reason, I have no alternative but to give this movie a '5'. Harsh maybe, but it only escaped getting a '1' because I was charmed by the two young actors in the central roles, who are brilliant in it.The rest involved in this movie should hang their heads in shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let the Right One In was my favorite movie a couple of years ago (along with Goodbye, Solo). So I was both eager and hesitant to see Let Me In, but more eager after I read the positive reviews. I found them to be justified. I propose that when we see something, and then later a variation on it, we nearly always prefer the first, a psychological thing. And I definitely prefer the Swedish film, and for some other reasons. Let Me In is good and a very worthy remake, but it is a remake of the Swedish film almost scene for scene, despite mentioning only the novel in the credits. Not much is added, and a number of less sophisticated devices (music growing in volume at climactic points, for example)are negatives. I did find one thing to be interesting about Let Me In. I do not recall (from two year's distance) that the Swedish movie radiated any sexual feeling (which one might expect from a vampire film, and which I found to be a good thing), but the new American remake includes sexual feelings, especially of the boy, at a number of times and in, for the most part, good, subtle ways. I find that natural, since he's 12 years old. I liked Let Me In, but see little need for such a literal remake, except for those who dislike seeing movies in non-English languages or those who liked the original and are simply curious, as I was, about how it would compare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a watchable film, despite not being on the same playing field as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is a 2010 drama film, directed by Matt Reeves. Based on the novel Lat den Rätte Komma in, and taking inspiration from the 2008 film of the same name, Let Me In tells the story of friendship and love between two young leads. In this case, the leads are played by Kodi Smit-Mcphee and Chloe Moretz as Owen and Abby respectively. At the beginning of the film, Owen is told the pair can never be friends, but this ends up being subverted later, as the two gradually become closer to one another.Seeing as how the film appears to be distancing itself from the original Swedish film, I'm going to attempt to do the same, and judge it completely based on if it stands up on its own. In short, it does a decent job at telling more or less the same story. The story is basically left in its entirety, with only the subplots switched around. If anything, the already basic story became even more basic, likely in hopes of not alienating the target audience. In this regard, I don't see it succeeding.Having actually gone to the theatre to see this, it's important, in my eyes anyway, to see how the audience reacted to the film. In Let Me In's case, the audience did not respond all that well. Whether through being uncomfortable with the subject matter, or just finding many scenes hilarious, the audience actually ended up laughing at parts that were supposed to be morbid, or even touching. This is a problem. Seeing as how the story is already simplified for the North American audience, seeing the crowd react like they did to it leaves me feeling a bit sad.The audience laughed the most whenever the two leads got close to one another. In this retelling of the story, Abby's gender is left alone. She is clearly a girl. However, many of the same lines hinting that she isn't were left intact. You can still interpret them that she is trying to tell Owen that she is a vampire, but to be honest, it doesn't really end up working that way. It seemed like they were trying to force those lines in, and without an at-the-time ambiguous gender of Abby, they didn't fit. However, when the characters were not trying to bring in forced lines, they actually were fairly convincing.First mention definitely has to go to Chloe Moretz, who does as good a job as anyone in bring the character of Abby to life. Now, before the movie came out, the director said that he asked both leads to not watch the original film. Somehow, I don't believe Chloe took his advice. She plays Abby almost exactly how I expected her to be played, and was just about as scary as the original. Seriously, we probably have one of the most promising young stars at the moment in this film, and she does not disappoint. Kodi Smit-Mcphee on the other hand is less impressive. He isn't bad necessarily bad in his role, but he's nothing to write home about either. He's a bullied kid, but doesn't usually show how it is affecting him. I feel with a little better direction, his feelings could have been brought across on-screen better.In fact, the directing may end up being one of the bigger problems the film has. The aforementioned scenes where the audience laughed could have easily been omitted, or edited to fit more with the tone Reeves was going for. His movie is definitely bloodier than the original, but the CGI that was used really took away from the experience. Whether Abby was climbing a building, or feeding on a person, it just looked off somehow. The jerky movements of the character made it quite apparent that it wasn't real. The story also felt kind of disjointed. It didn't have a real flow to it, and events seemed to just take place, as opposed to flowing naturally.That's really all there is to say without directly comparing Let Me In to Let the Right One In. The story is more or less the same, and so is the general feel of the films. The acting is still quite good, with big props going to Chloe Moretz as Abby. The problems come mostly from the way the film was put together. The CGI used looked fake for the most part, and took away from the atmosphere of the film, while the events of the story didn't really feel connected. The fact that the story was overly simplified also didn't seem like it did its job. At the theatre I went to, the majority of the audience laughed in parts that they definitely should not have. Still, it's worth watching, especially if you aren't able to find the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. I saw it last night. I saw the original before i saw this one and i actually like this one better then the original. Chloë Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee do an amazing job in it. In the scene at the end i thought she wasn't gonna come back to save him but she did. Thats one of my favorite parts. I also really liked the ending scene where he's on the train and he has Abby with him but she's in a big trunk and he is tapping on the box talking with her in morse code. I do wonder where they are going though. I also enjoyed this remake better because it is in English instead of Swedish. I don't mind subtitles but i found it much easer to watch this one and pay attention to it since it was in English.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened to watch Let Me In because Netflix recommended it for me. I adore Chloë Grace Moretz, and I actually didn't know she was in Let Me In. But whatever I was expecting from this film, I wasn't disappointed!The story of Let Me In is very tragic and unhappy, but it has such heart-warming, cute little moments my heart was about to break. Of course Moretz' character is a brutal vampire, but she plays that innocent little girl so well.The soundtrack of this movie is absolutely enchanting. It has the strengths of horror and some kind of child-like fantasy.The story of this film is brilliant. It's simple, yet it isn't. There are so many ways the viewer can interpret different scenes and plot points, thus stories like this are way more interesting to the audience. Especially when you can read different theories and watch the movie again to see how well those match up.There's a lot of blood and such in this film, but it isn't horror in the way that it just suddenly scares you. It is way subtler, quieter. The film isn't scary, it's more like... disturbing. But all the beautiful scenes make up for that, and the viewer doesn't feel the usual horrible feeling that usually lingers after a horror movie. Finally the writer doesn't just ignore the classic vampire features. Sure, maybe Abby didn't turn into a bat here - at least we didn't see that, but who knows? - but there still were so many classic details of vampires, for instance how vampires have to be invited or allowed inside.I warmly recommend Let Me In, even if you aren't interested in horror genre. This film is more like dark fantasy drama than horror. It has amazing story and such brilliant cast. It's a beautiful film, definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let Me In (2010): Dir: Matt Reeves / Cast: Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloe Moretz, Richard Jenkins, Elias Koteas, Cara Buono: Independent horror film about friendship. Kodi Smit-McPhee is bullied at school and his parents are on the verge of divorce. His alcoholic mother is little seen but he makes friends with the newly arrived Abby. She is a vampire and there with a father figure whom is responsible for several murders for blood. Directed by Matt Reeves who previously made Cloverfield. He seems inspired by the original foreign version and rightfully shoots this in independent form where it gains greater conviction. Where he lacks in budget, he makes up in camera angles as when Abby is about to take flight we never see her transform but we hear the transformation. Smit-McPhee is ideal as the secluded kid who relates to the unlikely. He cannot connect with his parents, and school is a constant nightmare. Chloe Moretz plays a juvenile vampire hindered by her desire to kill. They will form a friendship that leaves the future very bleak. Richard Jenkins plays her father figure whose killer instincts aren't what they use to be. He is clumsy and ends up a burn victim in the film's opening hospital segment. Elias Koteas plays a cop investigating the murders. It is a fine performance but his investigation will lead to grave consequences. Cara Buono plays Smit-McPhee's mother whose on the verge of becoming single. Very well made psychological vampire horror flick with more thought than many of its kind. Intriguing friendship can only allow audiences a permit. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel of the same name that is not really a remake but more of a new adaptation of Lindqvist's novel Let The Right One In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who don't know about Let Me In this film is a new adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel Let The Right One In and not a remake of the 2008 Swedish original. I recently finished reading the book and watched the Tomas Alfredson adaptation first before watching Matt Reeves's version. At one point some people call this a remake to the Swedish original, for me it is more of a new adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel with a lot of significant changes from the book to this film. I wouldn't normally call this a remake since there are only a few changes in this film from the novel. Just remember David Fincher's 2011 adaptation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and you'll get the idea. But unlike Fincher's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo where he makes the movie stay true to the book but stays in the same setting and have the characters speak English instead of the Swedish language. Let Me In is very different for all the right reasons. The reason why its different because of its changes and execution. First of all the setting was changed from Blackberg in Sweden to New Mexico. Second Matt Reeves is trying to make this movie as faithful to the novel as possible even though it has a few changes like the names of the main characters, back story and relationship with other characters in the film plus he also reduced the screen time of several characters from the book and some of them were replaced with new ones. Third, this film only has a few scenes that were remade and last but not least Matt Reeves tries to make this film as his own version and not remaking or insulting the Swedish film. I also noticed that since the original had only a few effects and not too much gore and was focused more on tension, suspense while keeping romance between the two characters in a good direction. This version relies on the same thing but the big difference is that there's a lot of CGI and more gore effects used in this film other than balancing it with suspense, tension and scares so lately both films have a lot of differences. But I love both movies for different reasons. I love Let The Right One In because it stays true to the source of the novel while combining suspense, atmosphere and tension at the same time. Let Me In on the other hand uses the same formula and not focused heavily on making a shot for shot remake which is by the way what Psycho did when it was remade in the 1990's and it worked really well as much as how the Swedish film worked well. I love both movies so far and both films are different for all the right reasons. Let The Right One In is a beautiful Horror movie that also combines the romantic elements in one movie while Let Me In is a dark violent love story that is gritty, and very suspenseful at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i was a child, i was captured by the vampire concept, i always wished i would meet a girl that was a vampire and could turn me into one and we would live forever. Yup child mind... lol In this movie, we meet that bullied little kid who realize his new cute little neighbour is actually a vampire. They still develop a love relationship and the movie follow these two characters mostly as there story progress.As an adult i can't relate as much to the characters as when i was younger, but i still could appreciate the story. The best part is certainly some gritty feels of the cinematography. The snow scenes when they meet for the first time for example has a kinda enchanted vibe.So overall its a good movie but you must realize its very... very... slow paced. Longer than your usual 90 minutes movie, i feel the movie would had benefit of being at least 20 minutes shorter.Yet i would say its definitely worth a rental, the story kept me interest during the movie, i just wish it would had moved a bit faster in some parts.Still a solid 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent, if unnecessary, remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is a movie which really need not exist. It's a remake of Swedish film Let the Right One In. And that original film stands perfectly well on its own merits, there was no need for an English-language version unless you're someone completely horrified by the idea of reading subtitles. And the Swedish setting also works much better for this sort of story. The remake unfolds in New Mexico. Sweden seemed much more ominous. Colder, darker, bleaker. The New Mexico setting is rather mundane compared to the otherworldly feel in Sweden. And otherworldly is appropriate for this story. Because we're talking about a vampire.As anyone who saw the original film will know the vampire in question here is a young girl. Or at least appears to be a young girl. Trapped in this young girl's body is someone who has lived a lifetime, maybe many lifetimes. A tormented soul who is mature way beyond the years her physical appearance suggests. That requires a very mature performance from a young actress and here Chloë Grace Moretz delivers. There's a lot of nuance to this part, a young girl who's not actually a young girl, yearning for a life and a love she can never have. And a young girl who, when the need arises, must be a ferocious, cold-blooded killer. That's a lot for Moretz to handle but she is definitely up to the task. The other key character is the meek, bullied young boy our vampire befriends. Kodi Smit-McPhee plays the part here and crucially he works very well with Moretz. They have a chemistry which works very well in drawing their characters closer together which in turn draws the audience into the story.That story unfolds pretty much exactly as it did in the original film. Really the only significant change is that it is now a cop investigating the strange goings-on whereas in the original film it was an ordinary guy poking his nose into things. Other than that this is a note-for-note, line-for-line, scene-for-scene remake. So if you saw the first film there's nothing here to provoke even mild surprise, much less genuine shock. So with that in mind it's to be expected that this film seems just a touch less satisfying than the original. The new film has its merits. But in every department the original is just a little bit better. The first film had a better setting, better frights and, for as good as Moretz and Smit-McPhee are, probably slightly better performances. Lina Leandersson, the star of the original film, always had that odd, otherworldly quality to her. Moretz, for all her talents, is a bit too familiar. You can see her as an ordinary American girl. This is a story perhaps best suited for unknowns, that was probably a big part of the appeal of Let the Right One In. That film had a bit of a magical quality which Let Me In lacks. That does not mean this remake is a bad film. Far from it. But this film was always going to be judged against the original. And in that comparison it falls just a little bit short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly lovable horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Chloë Grace Moretz (her acting totally ruined the Carrie remake in 2013). But this is the one role she acted in that was really amazing. Let Me In is a strange but at times beautiful little horror movie, and if you haven't seen the original Swedish version this is as close to it as you could get when it takes place in the States.Owen is a twelve-year-old boy living in an apartment complex with his mom. He's having a rough time in life; his parents are getting a divorce, kids constantly beat him up and call him a girl at school and his only friend is a strange and quiet girl his age named Abby, new to the building - but she says they can never truly be friends.Nevertheless, Owen begins falling for Abby after a trip to the local mall to play Pac-Man and buy candy together. But Owen does not know exactly who - what - Abby is. Why is her father so reclusive? Why is there always yelling coming from the walls? And Abby herself is starting to get closer to Owen, despite the fact that she's probably the most dangerous thing in his life.This isn't what I'd call a "scary movie". It's more of an adventure thriller. But I loved it all the same. The acting was great, the soundtrack had a sad sort of theme to it, the characters were complex and original and it sure beats that Twilight garbage! I think it deserves 10/10 stars, and I highly recommend it. Still, check out the original from 2008 first if you can find it, because it does beat this one overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me in is a dark, dark fairytale. I don't see this as a scary horror movie, even tho there is some gore in it. It is melancholic and dark. The atmosphere and setting is completely right, the protagonists are heartwarming and so is this beautiful story. I haven't read the book yet, or seen the Swedish (it was Swedish right?) version but I really am going to do it. It is not a movie you watch with 5 noisy friends on Friday night with drinks, the story develops itself too slow for that. This is a movie you watch alone or with fellow movie lovers that can shut up and let this story get them. And if it does get to you, it is a movie you will never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me awhile to figure this one out. Never seen a vampire movie with such a young one. I guess they don't age once they turn?? Anyway Abby is an apparently perpetually teenage vampire. Her guardian procures the blood for her by draining bodies he has taken. Until that is he wrecks a car and douses himself with acid. I guess to destroy his features from the authorities. But he is not dead and gets taken to a hospital. She visits him in the hospital and sucks his blood before he plunges to his death out of the window. I don't know about you but I don't know of any hospitals that have upper story windows that open. Owen is an outcast schoolboy who befriends the little vampire. After she kills her guardian she goes to Owen's and climbs into bed with, I guess naked since Owen says so plus she id cold. Gee I guess she is of the undead. Of course since this is school there are the bullies and Owen is their target. They go to a frozen pond to play hockey, the bullies try and confront poor old Owen and he takes a metal pole and smacks the major bully upside the head. Cutting his thumb to form a pact with her she goes down to suck the blood off the floor. She goes totally vampire but runs from Owen. She does attack a woman out walking her dog. Owen sees the attack. He goes to her apartment and asks her point blank if she is a vampire. Her answer is that she needs blood. He also asks her how old she is and she says she is 12 but has been for a long time. There is a cop who is on the case and seems to be closing in. The bitten woman is in the hospital, wakes up and starts chewing on her own arm for blood. A nurse comes in and opens the curtains which causes the woman to burst in to flames. There is a rather strange relationship that forms between Owen and the little vampire. She takes off but leaves a note for Owen, the cop has finally tracked the address down and, apparently, without a warrant, breaks the door down, finds her, opens a curtain for light which wakes her up and she attacks and kills him. Owen sees all this. He is standing in the apartment when she comes up to him, covered in the cop's blood and hugs him. She then kisses him and tells him she has to go away. She leaves in a taxi. Poor old Owen his heart broken. The bullies try to strike one last time. They set a fire in a dumpster to get rid of the coach. Then grab Owen, throw him in the pool and tell him to hold his breath for three minutes or get cut. Turns out SHE has been watching over him and slaughters the four bullies. I guess you could call it poetic justice. The movie ends with Owen running away with the vampire in a trunk to protect her from sunlight I guess. This is definitely not the typical vampire movie. It actually has some pathos to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going into details, but regardless of which movie genre you enjoy, you need to give this movie a try. It is a genre of it's own. The acting is perfect, as is it's direction and storyline. This qualified as a movie of the year. All of the actors, including Moretz, did a fine job as usual. Like other movies I enjoyed, I hated to see it end. Watch this movie, but before you do, let go of any preconceptions that may deter you from enjoying this working of art. It is in a class of its own, and deserves to be treated as such. I'd enjoy seeing more movies like this, movies that forget social norms and act on their own. Unfortunately, that's not what today's world is about. If you would like to see a film unlike any other film that you have seen before, then take the time to watch this one. You will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I begin, I must admit I may seem a little bias. This is because I have already seen the original 2008 Swedish movie 'Let the Right One In'. I felt that the original was one of the best horror movies I have seen and I would describe it as 'beautifully moving' and 'smart'. I was unable to feel that same way towards this remake. Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible movie. It's not even a bad movie, really. If you haven't already seen the original, you will likely find this a very refreshing and 'new' movie entered into the horror genre. Unfortunately, moments from the original that made my hairs stand on end with delight, achieved little in the version. The acting is very good in this film, and I must give credit to that. However, I felt that they made the character of Owen (Oskar in the original), a bit too whiny and cowardly. This is a shame, as this is one of the moments that let me down the most in the movie. The cinematography is well done, too. However, much of it has been shot- for-shot remade.In conclusion, If you haven't already seen the original, you likely will find this a fun and memorable movie. However, if you have already seen the 2008 version, this may not move you as much as, and will feel like a step down from the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie presents us a newer take on the older mythologies about, and also a newer take on the mystery of, vampires. But this time, the developed story went beyond having the mysterious killings where the victims' blood is sucked out dry. Let Me In instead focuses more on the relationship between a vampire and a human. The more interesting condition is that the vampire of our focus here is not some older men or women, or some young adult with a forced out love story, but instead a twelve year-old girl. The pace being built is nicely stable all the entire movie, not being lagged out horror or a speedy thriller. This is good in tandem with the all gloomy winter time frame. The acting by the focus character pair is also good. I see now why this movie kind of catapulted Chloe Grace Moretz into recognition later on. A strong 7 out of 10 score is from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I previously 'reviewed' this without seeing the film because of my outrage at the original being remade so soon, but I knew that was unfair, I'm glad that I have seen 'Let Me In' now. For one thing I think the title is better than 'Let The Right One In' which is a straight lift from the book. 'Let Me In' has the same muted palate as the original film and looks just as atmospherically grimy and dark. For me Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee are not quite as engaging as Lina Leandersson and Kare Hedebrant in the lead roles. It's easy to see why Smit-McPhee's character would be picked on and is called 'little girl' by the bullies because of his androgynous quality, but I think that quality is unnecessary for the story.In terms of the setting, on the one hand it is to director Matt Reeves' credit that the feel is not overtly American. Other than some of the accents there is none of the flag waving, none of the trappings of the US of A (notwithstanding the Pledge of Allegiance, which didn't jar for me), and Elias Koteas presence plus Ritchie Coaster's Slavic(?) gym teacher as central characters at least provide some link to the European original.It's clear that 'Let Me In' benefits from the 'advantage' of a bigger budget, but the occasional CGI almost acts as a barrier between the audience and the film. The car crash is a positive inclusion, very effectively done and quite a jump when it happens, then again the underpass scene is inferior, less convincing than the original for me.Ultimately it's a different film, more of a horror story and less of the fairy tale that the original is, and to me that says that Matt Reeves has, either deliberately or through misunderstanding the original, taken a different path, despite many of the scenes being lifted directly from Tomas Alfredsson's film. To be kinder you could say they are lifted from the original screenplay, to the extent that John Ajvide Lindqvist is credited prominently. I find it quite objectionable that the credit is 'written for the screen by Matt Reeves' because the vast majority of the work was done by Tomas Alfredson and John Ajvide Lindqvist before him, and there is very little that is new, it is clearly a remake of the film and not a new adaptation of the book.For all that I did enjoy 'Let Me In', the performances of Chloe Moretz, Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas are excellent, and the central relationship between Owen and Abby is well handled and nicely played, in the end I think 'Let Me In' succeeds because of the utterly engaging original story and brilliant source material, and only serves to remind me how good the original film is. If you haven't seen either film, treat yourself to 'Let The Right One In' first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vampire for teenage , can be joke like that (though many gore and death scene in the film). Not many deep meanings, not many scary illusions, Let me in is a chain of circumstance to other circumstance about a peculiar friendship: human and vampire ... It would be simple and boring if the director did not find a mysterious opening, and settle after each episode more and more answers, paving the way for the next circumstance . However, in general, the affection and the emotions of the youth sometimes depleted on the horror factor. Sometimes I smiled wondering whether this was the teen version of The twilight ... One of most special meaning the movie bring is the question: Was it a circle for the life of Owen as well as the life of Abby's old man... Probably so ... Acting is fairly. Filming and computerized technique is good. Only the most annoying at the horror movie is that doing sound too loud for fearing scene ... although as mentioned before, it's not such a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In Already!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Original idea is hard to come by in the movie world these days. It seems that everything is a sequel, prequel, re-imaging, or remake. The film Let Me In falls under the remake umbrella. The original film came to us from Sweden and had a slightly different title of Let the Right One In. The original movie was a dark, haunting masterpiece. It was a slow building character study, about the relationship of a young boy and a vampire girl who was actually several decades old. Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) chose to attempt to make a film that feels the same way. It has many of the same scenes and has the same basic plot of the Swedish version. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a lonely young boy. He is bullied at school as a daily routine by a large boy. Owen has an alcoholic mother that we do not see too often. Every day for Owen seems like only a build up to the next day of torment and sadness. Then one day in the cold of a snowy night a young girl and what seems like her father move into the apartment next door. Abby played by the very talented Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass) is a vampire. Her father figure is actually her keeper. The man (Richard Jenkins) is responsible for protecting her while she is sleeping during the day, and helping her find food during the night. Abby is an odd girl who very slowly becomes friends with Owen. One of the nice touches that the director kept was the breathing effect of the two leads when they are outside. While we can see Owens's breath in front of his face when he talks we cannot see Abby's. It shows with that settle little detail that Owen and Abby can never be the same. Abby becomes attached to Owen; she even protects him from the bully at school. Abby's keeper is getting old and he will need to be replaced soon. I think this brings up an interesting question. Did Abby only become friends with Owen to one day use him as a replacement? He is a loner that lives in a home that he basically blends into the wallpaper. No one would miss or even notice him if he was gone. I like to think that Abby was not use to having someone be nice to her for no reason. I think she actually does care for Owen.This film is not as good as the original. I did like that the sexual overtones were turned down a bit. Nothing is creeper that a thirteen year old vampire girl implying sexual urges. This film however does move at a slightly faster pace. American movie goers want gore and jump out of your seat scares in their horror movies. This one makes you feel like something foreboding is coming. You won't look over your shoulder when you watching the movie. You will however be jolted awake if you hear something outside your window at night. It is good that this movie was remade for English speaking audiences. This is a vampire movie that is treated with respect. It does not try to be glamorous or cute. It does not have vampires with perfect lives. Abby is as tragic as Owen. The vampire is treated like a dangerous creature that has lost touch with how it felt to be human. This film is how a Gothic film should be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally involving tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer / director Matt Reeves ("Cloverfield") clearly has nothing but the utmost respect for the Swedish novel and film "Let the Right One In", and his faithful adaptation is a reflection of that. This is a very affecting combination of horror and drama that doesn't skimp on the horror, and also works extremely well at portraying a somewhat unconventional, but heartfelt, friendship. It won't hold any surprises for those who have seen the Swedish film, but it's fundamentally a good, meaty story that is well told. Taking place in 1983 (with song choices ranging from David Bowie to Blue Oyster Cult to Greg Kihn to remind us of the era), it charts the evolution of this friendship, as meek, bullied Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) meets a strange 12 year old girl, Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) whom he only sees at night, and who travels with a much older guardian (Richard Jenkins). Exceptionally well shot by Greig Fraser in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, this begins on a truly atmospheric note, and makes the most of the setting, as the setting is New Mexico during the winter. Reeves comes up with some interesting ways to stage scenes, such as filming a car crash from the interior of a car, and a climactic scene in a pool. It's sometimes effectively gory, although never gratuitously so; it also delivers a hell of a kick in a hospital room scene. Sometimes digital effects are utilized for scenes where Abby is in attack mode, and considering the low key nature of the rest of the film, they do take one out of the film a little too much. The characters are well rounded individuals in whom we can easily take an interest and follow for the duration of the film. The two juvenile leads are impressive, delivering sensitive and mature performances; Smit-McPhee and Moretz look to have solid careers ahead of them. Elias Koteas co-stars as the detective on the case; he and Jenkins are solid as always and the latter has some really great scenes with young Moretz. Key to the success of the film is how engrossing the story telling is. For a movie running just a little under two hours long, it never feels that lengthy and in fact moves along quite well. The ending falls short of complete satisfaction (it would have done well to tie up its loose ends), but overall this is an intelligent film with a heart and soul; the music score by Michael Giacchino adds to the emotional impact. Highly recommended to lovers of horror looking for a break from the usual run of Hollywood genre product. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the new one in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Americanized remake of a successful foreign film, Let Me In is heavily influenced by Sweden's Let the Right One In, which is by my reckoning the best vampire film ever made. Hollywood can sometimes botch good ideas, but Let Me In is not a bad translation. It just doesn't add much to what the original gave us.Instead of mimicking everything Let the Right One In does, Let Me In offers some variation, such as starting with the ambulance taking the Renfield character to a hospital after an acid burn, and changing the bullies from calling the boy a pig to calling him a girl. The hospital scene is seen from a police officer's view. It would be wrong to criticize this film for being different. These changes aren't bad, but they're not an improvement on the original. To go on, what was added by the boy hearing through the apartment walls? What was added by the Renfield character complaining he's tired instead of apologizing to his vampire master? One change I didn't quite like was the vampire girl's face changing during attacks. That was scarier on Buffy the Vampire Slayer than here.The vampire girl, called Abby in this version, is played by Chloë Grace Moretz, our future Carrie who I was previously familiar with only on 30 Rock. She plays the character as soft-spoken and kind of shy, and I would have liked to see more of her aggressive side. What does this version do right? In my opinion, shortening the title to something less awkward and more eerie was a good step. Also on the positive side, Let Me In looks fine on Blu-ray. More importantly, it's hard to find good vampire movies. Let Me In handles a good story well enough to make it one of the better vampire films to come out of North America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the exceptional success of CLOVERFIELD (2008), Matt Reeves' sophomore contact is the US remake of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (2008), the smashing Tomas Alfredson's grim Nordic vampire fairytale in the modern world, which catches a a 9/10 in my rating system. The remake sets its location at New Mexico, while the storyline is chiefly adapted from the original hit. With two genius child thespians in the leading roles, it is unable to surpass its prototype notwithstanding, the film indeed manages to keep the narrative intriguing, as a second step for Reeves, his potential is literally palpable.One main feature of the film's more overt vicious bully circle, in a way it implies a resemblance of the immortal vampire circle, which is more subtle in Tomas' version; the gore and brute force is literally shown in a more explicit manner which is a common schlock trick in Hollywood horror-fest. Luckily the cast has somewhat saved the film in to an abyss of the utter shadow cast over by its archetype, Kodi Smit-McPhee (from THE ROAD 2009) and Chloë Grace Moretz (from KICK-ASS 2010) are distinctly more earthly than two leads in the Swedish version, their chemistry is both ample and controlled at the same time, which is a significant outlet for the sympathizing ending, it's a point-of-no-return journey, a neglected child with a broken soul takes on an uneven deal with a demon under the veil of puppy love, it's too heartbroken to even think about it. Considering Chloë's upcoming projects, a remake of CARRIE (1976) and MAGGIE (another zombie-horror), her stereotyped constraint may hamper her stardom as we all know it, it is never easy to break the curse of a child star. Also the supporting roles are primarily sidelined, boy's father is only on voice-over and his mother although has more screen time but has no facial shot at all (poor Cara Buono, a cypher presence). One complaint is the CGI effect of the sun-blazing scene in the hospital and the slash-flick makeup of Richard Jenkin's disfigured face, both are shoddy and surrealistically fake, being the man behind CLOVERFIELD, Reeves is inexcusable for the hiccup. Fortunately the final swimming pool massacre is a blessing, the blankness leaves much for one's imagination. Maybe the film's occurrence is too near its original masterpiece, that's why the inexorable comparison cannot be eschewed, and if one could take it as an individual work, the film is able to make you tremble and make you dumbfounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampire Du Jour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved vampires ever since I was a child. I would watch with my mother the Gothic soap opera "Dark Shadows". Vampires became my favorite horror villain obsession. From the sanitized Twilight to the gory 30 Days and 30 Nights, I loved them in all their incarnations. However, there are a few that are just stand-outs from the classic 1922 silent "Nosferatu", 1931 "Dracula" with Bela Lugosi, 1958 Christopher Lee's Horror of Dracula, 1992's Bram Stoker's Dracula, and 1994's Interview with a Vampire. Those are the films I could watch over and over and now I have a new one, "Let me In". The two main leads the human child and the vampire are stand-outs. Kodi Smit-Mcphee and Chloe Grace Moretz are mesmerizing as the human and vampire, it is a younger version of Twilight with better acting and storyline. No offense to Twilight fans, but this is such a different film it has the same old vampire canons but they are addressed through a child's eyes. My only problem with the film was the human child whose parents were almost non-existent in the movie. I was not that thrilled with the pseudo-romance that was developing between these two, maybe because they seemed to young for me. Other than those two issues I quite enjoyed this flick. You could understand Owen's isolation and loneliness as well as Chloe Grace Moretz's character, Abby, with no one to really associate with but an older man who you presume to be her father who keeps her fed. You can understand why they are drawn to each other. There are a few bloody scenes but no more than usual in a horror flick, it does not glorify vampires, as Owen ask his father, is there real evil in the world, it is frightening to Owen who realizes the girl he has befriended is no normal human being. The film follows Owen's existence in a town in New Mexico in winter, from his loneliness to being bullied by boys in school, we root for Owen that he will overcome his diversities. Abby has problems of her own if her substitute father is unable to murder some random stranger, to feed Abby, Abby becomes very upset and has to pillage for someone to feed off of for her nutrition. It is an amazing little film that packs a wallop especially almost at the end when the bullies at school corner Owen at the pool. A very good film, worth watching if you want a subdued horror flick or love vampire movies such as I and want a very thought provoking good time with a vampire movie. It is certainly my Du Jour of a vampire film in the nearly past 20 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interestingly, this is a movie about kids but is not for kids. It is too dark, gruesome and violent to serve that purpose. Based upon the novel, 'L?t den rätte komma in' and screenplay of John Ajvide Lindqvist , this movie is a remake of the Swedish film, 'L?t den rätte komma in (Let the right one in), which tells the story of a bullied kid with no friends who comes across this little girl. They begin to develop a friendship that only becomes more profound as the story moves along. The girl, however, is a vampire who needs fresh human blood to survive. Now I haven't seen the Swedish version that was released in 2008, but this movie is worth watching alone for the fact that how wonderfully these kids have played these characters without losing the touch of that stinging horror in their prospective tales. Chloë Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee have done a commendable job along with Richard Jenkins.This movie stays true to the traits of a vampire and thrills successfully every bit of you as you watch hopefully in the darkness. I'd say go for it for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vampire anomaly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The topic of vampires have become an overly exhausted plot device in the later half of this decade but make no mistake, Let Me In drops all previous conventions that you have been exposed of with the Twilight Series, True Blood, Underworld, and Blade. The role of vampires come secondary to this intriguing story of friendship between two children. Finding it difficult to adapt to their surroundings, the story of these two kids take subtle yet interesting twists to our conceptions that have been placed by vampire pop culture. As a result, the horror genre does not accurately fit this film, more closely associating it to a bizarre drama. Taking the viewer in slow steps of exposure to the vampire culture, there isn't much to miss for those looking for what adaptations of the vampire idea the creators have taken for this film. Relying mostly on character development as the main engine to progress the story, this film sits at the opposite spectrum of the Transformers installments in its sole reliance on visual stimulation. You wont find any long-standing societal rivalry between vampires and werewolves. Let Me In searches for an emotional response from its audience in forms of sympathy. In a way, it is as though it was purposefully catered to win our hearts by playing our emotions in this heart-wrenching drama. Unlike any other vampire film, Let Me In strongly places human-like qualities in its vampire rendition that appears more than any other film. In addition, the choice to cast children as the main subjects of the story was genius. Taking out the adult element of a human-like relationship subtracts all the sexual motive of the characters. But it isn't as though innocent curiosity becomes the main subject either. Both characters have the similar attribute of having been alone all their lives. All their actions could be simplified to the basic desire that they did not want to be alone in this world. Their relationship is so psychologically messed-up its almost beautiful. All in all, it wont be the frightful images of vampire predation that becomes ingrained in memory but the almost-human emotional attachments the characters leave you. In the end, you don't find yourself wrapped up in questions about the unfamiliar vampire world. You contemplate like any other human would, similar to that of these children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the American remake of a Swedish film entitled Let the Right One In. I haven't seen the original and I don't see why Hollywood felt the need to rename it. This version was written and directed by Matt Reeves, who also directed Cloverfield. At least with this one, I didn't need to take Dramamine before viewing. The movie starts out in a mysterious frenzy -- Who is this burned man? Why is he a criminal? Who came to visit him? What happened when the detective left the room? All good questions and they all get answered as soon as the movie fades to "Two Weeks Earlier".Owen (Smit-McPhee) is pretty much all alone. His mother (Buono) and father (Browning) are getting a divorce and argue nonstop. He has no real friends at school, which causes another boy, Kenny (Minnette), to constantly harass and bully him. After peeping on some neighbors, he spies Abby (Moretz) and what appears to be her father (Jenkins) moving in next door. The next night, Abby comes across Owen in the courtyard's playground. It's apparent that Abby doesn't want to get close to Owen, but at the same time, she can't help herself from becoming more and more enamored with him. It gets to the point where they are hanging out quite a bit, but Abby's got a secret and Owen just may be too curious for his own good. It all culminates into a very touching, very sweet vampire story. It's what Twilight should be like. See, that was my first mistake about this movie. I thought it was going to be very scary and plenty of blood and guts. What I got, though, was a sweet story about two kids from different worlds and each one needing something different to go one with their lives. They literally exist to save each other's lives. They need each other. So, no...no scares, no jumps or frights. There are a few gory scenes, but nothing too crazy, just a lot of blood and some flesh-eating acid. I didn't need the phony frights or cheesy "got-ya's" to enjoy this film. All I needed was the performances of Moretz and Smit-McPhee and the ongoing mystery of how it will all turn out in the end.Yes, the film does move at a slower pace than I intended, but I wasn't thrown off or bored by it in any way. The actors are captivating enough to keep you interested and I loved the idea of pure innocence and concentrated evil getting together. It was giddy and devious all at the same time, it just makes me want to view the original even more. This is the reason why remakes are made. It gets an entire nation to take notice about someone or a certain movie that they would have never even thought about before, had it not been done.

		<shortDescription>Young Innocent Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never expected the movie to be so beautiful, the acting was top class both the actors Owen and Abby are superb and its so hard to believe that they are so young and are such fine actors, when the movie started i thought it would be another vampire movie but as the movie progressed it turned out completely different, the innocent love story between the two was so touching, i was feeling sorry for the young boy because of the dilemma that he was facing between good and evil, the emotions that were displayed by Abby were just so beautiful and innocent that i wished i was Owen, its a good clean movie but some scenes may be scary for small kids but Its a must watch movie 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Has no Boundaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this movie and said I have to see this. I was right. This is not your typical vampire movie and it is not "Twilight" It is in a nutshell the story of two 12 year olds who learn to care for each other despite one of them being a vampire.One of the questions you have wile watching this film is who is the man Abby is with? When it is revealed that it is for lack of a better word her boyfriend (Renenber vampires do not age)it all comes together. You never really find out how old she really is except in a very short scene in the deleted scenes on the DVD it looks like the middle ages.The boy Owen who's parents are going through a divorce feels unloved and maybe blames himself for this happening is drawn to Abby for love or affection. The seting of the early 80's makes sense for the ending of this movie. Then seeing a 12 year old boy on a train alone would not raise questions.(alone with a small trunk).Then a missing children,s data base did not exist.and you know then he is Abby's new "boyfriend".See this film! You will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary Remake of the Swedish Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this very much, but I do hope everyone that raved about this version will make an effort to see the original Swedish version. Chloe Moretz shows all the right moves in this as well as Kick Ass. She shows the same early potential that Natalie Portman promised in The Professional.... She is superb. The original was so strong that it would have been an effort to fail with a remake, but several things did bother me about the new version. First, if you have Richard Jenkins, why obscure his face to the point that one might first identify the voice before reading the credits? And, did Owen's mother have a face? Did we ever see her? Also, in the original there were several very nice low budget scenes of the girl scaling the apartment building and the hospital that given the closely adapted direction is left to, "I flew".... All and all, the remake did not make a substantial improvement on the original and redoing it in English may broaden the market, but did not overshadow the better original. Watch the original as well, please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I really am not into horror moving I just had to see this one after reading a lot of the reviews. I have to say that it didn't disappoint. The movie builds slowly and really pulls you into the sad, but ultimately satisfying relationship between this neglected boy and not so human girl (who may not be a girl at all). I did have a little trouble with the adults in this movie who seem oblivious to the goings on of these two children. Only the girls'supposed father (later on he is proved to be someone else) seems to notice that these two are out late at night together. The movie was tense but it was not as scary as I thought it would be. I think that is because I try had to make the girl a sympathetic character and thus makes the boy and the audience want to see everything work out okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stays true to the book for the most part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those that are looking for a really scary horror movie, this probably isn't for you. For those of you looking for the new vampire romance "twilight-esque" story, this isn't for you. Let Me In is a very unique and different kind of vampire story all in itself. It actually tells a very touching story about a blossoming friendship. Granted that it does have its share of bloody, grisly and horrific moments, but the story doesn't rely on them. I myself prefer the really bloody, nasty, scary vampires over the shiny, glittering, pretty boy ones. I read the book (Let the Right One In) and loved it and was extremely excited to see this movie. I wasn't disappointed. The pace, the feel, the suspense all matched the book. Some may have found the movie progressing too slowly,but I think you'd understand it better upon reading it. My only complaint was that they left out some important plot points AND scary parts from the book. Overall though, this was a very well done book to movie adaption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many, I haven't read or seen anything previous than this movie. Although, I knew that seeing the trailer made me want to wait for it. See it. Because somehow I knew this was gonna be something to watch. I must say, while still captivated from just seeing the movie, it has been worth the anticipation.Matt Reeves takes us on a journey that makes any vampire movie or show, scratch their ears and contemplate about rebooting. The combination of having a very strong cast, makes this a gem that will stick with me as a cherished favorite.Chloë Moretz has always been a young talent to watch, but she has outdone herself on this one. Young Kodi Smit-McPhee also delivers a character that a lot of former kid-loners can relate to. The two carry the movie into a sad, yet romantic display of a bond being forged. While Elias Koteas has a small role, it is a very important one, without spoiling the story, he adds more meaning to Moretz and Smit-McPhee aforementioned bond. But the part Richard Dale Jenkins plays, might be one the simplest, yet very strong. Without having said many words, you understand where he's coming from, what he goes through, and more importantly, he shows what is to come. I think that's the strength of the movie. By keeping it simple, this dark love story comes alive and really sucks you in. In a good way.'Let Me In', is by far one of the best vampire movies I've seen in a long time. Exciting, heart drenching, blood drenching, emotional, disturbing, sweet, violent, and most importantly very, very good.9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

The acting is fantastic, The two leads showing that even with their young age they are going to be huge in the acting world. The direction is good. The changes made to the location do not detract from the overall film. The characters are well crafted and well rounded.It is not as good as "Let the Right One in" but that may be because the original is so good. It is still a good film in it's own right.This film is a great return for Hammer Horror and I look forward to the films they bring out in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i learned there was gonna be a Hollywood remake of Let The Right One In I was up for it. This film , however, disappoints.Its not a bad film, it's actually a very good film , but it's unnecessary and a little bit worse than the original.I would have preferred an all out blockbuster with S.W.A.T teams and vampire hunters, cheerleaders and anything else they could'a done to jazz up the plot, but what we have instead is the same pace of film with the same exact locations and with almost the same ...well.. everything.Am I alone in thinking that Swedish is actually one of the charms of the original films? maybe they could'a done it again in Swedish, maybe that would'a worked.The disappointing thing is that the few changes they made actually impact the story negatively. A small side story concerning a woman was disappointingly stunted, which is a shame because it brought a lot of depth and a wider angle to the original film. Instead the story focuses in on the two main characters ( who do a brilliant job ) and a third detective character who doesn't really pose as much threat as his equivalent character in the original because he's clueless and doesn't know what he's dealing with at all.The last negative thing is probably the most important. There is a 'connect the dots' kinda thing the original made you do concerning the motivation of one of the characters , but in this one they sorta hold your hands through the process.Aside from all that it's a great film , and if I came fresh to it I would give it an 8, but i didn't so 6.</fullReview>

As it turns out, bare feet are only the tip of her bloodthirsty iceberg.An admirable Americanization of the Swedish vampire film, Let The Right One In, Let Me In is a morose mixture of European romance and Western elucidation and obligatory gore.Moreover, police should use these little vampire girls to catch predators.

		<fullReview>I don't remember when it was I saw this, but it was in an old movie theater 30 minutes from where I lived. Just the start of the night was eerie. A couple of my buddies wanted to go see this movie, I knew nothing about it but never turn down a movie trip. After paying for the ticket and passing the booth, the lobby was empty.. completely silent, no one walking around, no noise. The only break in the dead silence was the Wall-e promotion that talked as you walked by, except it was gurgling more or less. We enter the actual movie theater, with 5 minutes to spare before start of the movie.. no one.. not a single person in any of the seats. It remained this way for the entire movie, no late comers, not even an usher to look around. With such freedom, we picked top row and I found a bucket of popcorn nearly full. Snatched the f (because the f word is apparently banned from IMDb) out of that and enjoyed free 10 dollar popcorn. The intro started and we relaxed to what we thought was gonna be at least a C level movie.Now that I've bored you with a needless story, let me preface by saying that is the extent of the good times i had watching the movie (not to mention the only parts I remember of that portion of the night). That short story about someone you don't care about and have zero interest reading about was how Let Me In's plot played out. It is a carbon copy of generic horror movies of it's time. Now, even if this came out before the likes of The Ring and The Grudge and so forth and so forth.. It was still terrible. The cgi was unnecessary, the character development was nonexistent, the twist was as creative as witch costumes on Halloween, and jump out scary parts were laughable at best. I rolled on the floor laughing when I saw the vampire cgi baby dialing on the cellphone, it nearly put me in tears, and I'm the kind of person who is scared very easily by jumpy kinda movies. To this day I still state "vampire baby dialing a phone" when ever it comes up in conversation.In general, I blocked this monstrosity of a movie from my mind. I literally don't remember any specific scenes other than that.Would I recommend this movie? For laughs, yes, maybe to some people I don't like, never to anyone I cared about or loved. This movie was stupid, boring, a joke of a horror movie, even worse than just about every crappy low budget horror films. I can honestly say I'd rather gouge my eyes out with cow dung and a dull, rusty spoon than watch this movie again. There are very few movies in my mind that I can say that about, a hypothetical action that was thought up while watching Epic Movie, the trash of a movie that was.Leaving the theater was like a breath of fresh air, and life. People were gathered around the theater that was previously abandoned, as well as employees actually maintaining upkeep. It was a completely different setting, I think the Wall-e promotion actually talked too. Leaving the once empty building, one of my buddy's phone began to ring. He looked down at it, and as soon as he did it stopped. The message Let Me In shone proudly and brightly across his screen. We all looked at each other and laughed into the cool, breezy darkness.See, I can write a better horror than Let Me In without even trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating vampire movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LET ME IN is possibly setting a new standard for vampire movies. Based on the novel by John Ajvide Lindquist and leaps and bounds more captivating than the first big screen adaptation LET THE RIGHT ONE IN(2008). Special effects used moderately, but very crafty. A 12 yr old Owen(Kodi Smit-McPhee)is a misfit that is daily the victim of vicious bullying at school. The lonely lad befriends a new neighbor to the housing complex. Abby(Chloe Moretz)is a bit mysterious; usually barefoot in the frigid snow; she seems ageless and compassionate. Abby's secretive life requires a caretaker(Richard Jenkins), who disappears after a series of violent murders. Owen thinks he is in love with his evasive friend, but at the same time he tries to put together the clues of her admission she is not a girl. Ms. Moretz has that ability to mesmerize. You can't help but like this flick, because you have a developing concern for the characters...and you stay ready to be frightened. Kudos to director Matt Reeves. The cast also includes: Elias Koteas, Sasha Barrese, Cara Buono, Dylan Minneete and Ritchie Coaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the book and seen the original film and I'm sorry to say it .... but the book/story is much better then original film, but this version is more true to the book i think because its more detailed and more scary and better acted. This movie keeps you on edge and has vibe over it that is just a little unnerving, its not a "normal" vampire movie ... its so much more. It is quite emotional and hard to watch some scenes (the bullying). I think the original film is lame ... and does not do any justice to the book at all! I can understand why they wanted to do a better and more international version of it ! I think the acting and cinematography in this version was superb, but in the original film it was just over the top and ridiculous and .... well amateurish. All the fuss about the other original film... i can not understand the hype ? And why some people was/are upset about this version getting made ?? And making daft and foolish remarks about Americans don't want to read subtitles, thats why they made this version (thats just lame, they just wanted to reach a much larger audience .... and well there are only 9.4 million people who speak Swedish and there are about 365-372 million people who speak English (Australia, Ireland, Canada, New Zeeland, United Kingdom, United states of America etc)(Official language in 115 countries) If you wanna see a good and true portrait of the book/story you will go and see this version! There is so much more to say/write about this movie but that will give away to much of the plot and i don't wanna spoil it!I gave it 8 out 10 because i thought the movie was a bit short and a little bit rushed but other then that its very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as good and affective as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to see this film turn out the way it did. The remakes rarely surpass the originals, especially when the original films are new films themselves. But there are some cases where it does. Films like The Grudge and The Ring were good remakes, but those films didn't have the depth of Let Me In. This remake matches the original not only in scares, and suspense, but in acting, atmosphere and direction as well.A few things that Let Me In does better is the action. This remake is gorier and has more CGI in it. And the CGI is pretty good too. I also liked some things like the car stunts, and of course, the higher budget helped make this film stand out a bit more than the original. However ,that doesn't mean it's better than Let The Right One In. The 1st film was paced better, and the characters had more to say. And so this also doesn't mean this new version is inferior to the original either. They each have their own merits and flaws.Some other things worth mentioning is the soundtrack. Micheal Giacchino is a real genius. This is one of the best horror scores I've heard in a long time. Absolutely brilliant. And I must say, the acting in Let Me In is a bit better, the main characters are also more sympathetic than in the 1st film. Especially Abbey (Eli). In this film, she is cursed, and in the 1st film she was more sinister. Abbey lets you know she's killing to survive, while Eli did it because it's simply her nature. The result is a different feeling for the character and in my opinion, prefer Abbey's character.I rated both films an 8, don't miss this one regardless of whether your fan of the original or not. The screenplays are similar and it's very well written. It's more than another vampire film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the 1980's in Swedish Mexico we had androgynous children bullying each other, a dictator named Reagan ruling through the television, really bad lighting, and one pre-pubescent vampire running amuck. Strangely enough this coming-of-age story reminded me of my upbringing in Finland before my French mother and Chinese father moved us to Lima, Peru so they could study with a shaman in the Andes Mountains.But I digress. The girl from "Kick-Ass" makes a decent little vampire, while the kid from "The Road" gets all emo when he befriends her. I've heard he was recently cast to star in the live-action version of the age-old kid's drawing "Stick Boy." Anywhooooo...oh, those bullies! And that hair! And the music! And all that tomato sauce in the swimming pool in the end! Where was the spaghetti?

Even in scenes where the girl is in woods, it was still graphics? Why? Woods are everywhere they could have just find a park or something, but no it's the fake background. The story line was poor, very poor. No proper plot or background to the story and did not really make a logical connection to previous films. Because I thought the the vampires are bad, but no, half of the film they are good and half of the film they are bad again. Overall, my advice, do not waste your time and watch something (anything) else instead.I think this movie ranks no.1 in Horror genre of Hollywood(at least at present when there were very few Horror movies).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent if somewhat un-needed remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's sad is that this film would not exist without the Swedish original that was made just 2 years ago, if only American and British audiences would watch a film with subtitles this would never have been made. However in it's own rights it is still an excellent film, though ultimately offers nothing new to the original story.Yet it does have it's positives, some minor improvements to the story. SPOILERS: The hunting by The Father / Caretaker is more believable than the original as his downfall is more down to bad luck (than a very stupid mistake of putting himself in a corner that is too amateurish from an experience killer) even though in this remake his "tiredness" of his lot in life is more pointed and more expected. Also Abby's rumbling stomach demonstrates her restraint that was not as obvious in the the original such a subtle but effective thing, and The Policeman hunting her is more appropriate than the grieving drunk in the original. Yet these are minor differences and the overall story is the same.The story itself is quite layered and full of ambiguity. On the surface it's almost a Shakespearian love story (something that's hinted at by references to Romeo + Juliet like the same way Donnie Darko had parallels to the book Watership Down which was mentioned in the film) about 2 twelve year olds. One a 200 years vampire stuck in a pre-adolescents body, and the other a relentlessly bullied and neglected young boy. The casting is excellent, and the relationship between the 2 lead characters is beautifully portrayed. There's an awful lot left open to interpretation, in both the film and the nature of their relationship, which is what makes this such a good film as the viewer takers away their own beliefs. Is her love for Owen (and her Father / Caretaker before him) genuine, or is it purely manipulation, or more likely something in between.Even the title itself has dual meaning, do we take it literally about the need of vampires to be invited in, or do we take it more figuratively about inviting her into your heart?I've seen comparisons to Twilight, which is quite frankly laughable, as the two films have almost nothing in common. In recent cinema Vampires have been portrayed as thrill-seeking party-animals in Lost Boys, ultra-cool super-hero's in Blade and Underworld, pathetic brooding teens in Twilight, and glamorous killers in Interview With The Vampire. Here we see a side to vampires that is original and refreshing (something that was hinted at in Anne Rice's stories) the ultimate tragicness of being immortal. Abby is not glamorous or cool, she's almost pathetically lonely, her only companion an old man who acts as her caretaker, and when the vampire in her is revealed it's more animal than human, a curse that she's a slave to.MORE Spoilers: In the end you're left with mixed emotions, initially elation as the two leads seem to rescue each other both physically and metaphorically, yet sadness as you realise that it's ultimately a doomed relationship, and instead of being rescued Owen will become her most brutalised victim as the realisation of what the future must hold for him becomes apparent. It's a beautifully told story, that's part love-story and part horror, that works on several levels so can be enjoyed as either or both, that is open to interpretation that will leave viewers with plenty to discuss and debate after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the Scandinavian original of which this is a Hollywood remake, so I am judging this entirely on its own merits.Loner Owen is bullied at school, so he is pleased to meet a soulmate in new neighbour Abby. When savage murders start taking place in the neighbourhood, we know it's vampire Abby feeding, but Owen is a bit slow on the uptake. Meanwhile, bullying continues, Owen's parents are getting a divorce, the police are searching for the murderer, Abby's Dad goes off the rails....This film is a bit of a mess. It's bitty, leisurely when it should get a move on, rapid fire when it should be taking a bit more time, far too happy to leave unexplained things which need explaining, explicit when it should be a little more circumspect, and not explicit enough when the audience wants it to be.But it has a weird and unusual atmosphere of its own, a genuine and touching relationship at its heart, and another excellent performance from Chloe (Kick-Ass) Moretz, all of which are good reasons to go and catch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I looked to see what other people thought of "Kick-Ass", I clicked on miss ninja to see what other films she's been in. Man, she is quite the killer here too! The first portion of the film annoyed me since I had no subtitles and all the characters were in quiet mode, except for the occasional loud noise that blared the speakers. This film was not that bad, it had a very independent film feel to its pace, but I was not one of those who's disappointed when there are no surprises. I saw from the moment he drained the corpse and failed to bring a full jug of blood home that the girl and him had been what would become her and Owen; however, I nonetheless wanted to see the journey. I cannot make a logical argument why my gut wanted him to go against his loneliness and attraction to Abby and open the windows on her, other than the fact that she embodied evil incarnate, of course. I guess I'm beginning to see the problem with today's media constantly blurring the line between right and wrong, pushing our culture towards moral ambiguity on all fronts. Even though I know deep in my bones that I should not be so enraptured by shows like Dexter or True Blood that make the beast out as the protagonist, I still succumb to the entertainment value of such shows and watch away. I suppose the best way to convey my frustration can be found in the words of Randy Marsh, "Dang you, internet!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared to the European original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Let Me In" first, and just now watched "Let the Right One In", after seeing many write about how it is better in every way than the American remake. I have to say that I completely and 100% disagree. Chloe Moretz and Kodi McPhee outwork their European counterparts throughout the entire film. "Let Me In" also adds a bit to the story to explain some parts that would have otherwise left me feeling like there was a piece of the story left untold. The overall look and feel of the movie is also superior to "Let the Right One In". I honestly cannot see how the European original is better than the remake. It was a good, solid story, that Matt Reeves fine tuned and perfected into a cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting and touching vampire film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this at the cinema and i liked what i saw. Let me in is in my opinion an excellent vampire film. I have not seen the original but i do intend to. I have read the book though which is a good read.Any way Owen meets Abby when she moves in with a mysterious older man to the flat next door ,as you find out ,there is something a little different about her. As the film goes on you see their friendship bloom.This does have a few vampire scenes in it which are done affectively not like Twilight. Abby is a vicious killer when she attacks. The bullying scenes are quite hard to watch as well with Owen and when he gets revenge,you feel happy for him. (Well i did anyway) Some people might not like this as its not full of killing but i think the horror parts were scary and the friendship was nice to watch.The two central young parts are played very well. I definitely recommend Let me in. Its not your average vampire film but its very good. At times some of the scenes may seem abit pointless but they are all important to the story.Id give this an 8.5 out of 10. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched the DVD + extras. I know the Swedish original well but loved this US version but don't understand why it was made or why the Director didn't acknowledge the original movie in the DVD extras. Not one word was uttered about the original 2008 Swedish film. Reeves just said he read the book and phoned the author who said "great idea for you to make a movie". The US version is pretty much identical to the original Swedish movie. I guess it's just about English for a US audience. Watch the original, then watch this version and Reeves interview on the extras and wonder why he pretended that every scene was an original idea. Surely he watched the Swedish original. I wonder what the Swedish filmmakers had to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake from a Swiss novel has all of the elements of a solid vampire story with a lot of the usual CGI tricks &amp; gore. Bullied Owen slowly befriends a girl next door with a terrible secret. All the while, there are unexplained deaths occurring in the community being investigated by an unsteady detective. Pay close attention to the timimg of scene sequences &amp; the ever-present darkness befallen the town. With time &amp; events to follow, the two friends walk a path of uneasiness &amp; discovery. Owen, with divorcing parents &amp; life as a school-yard punching bag, and Abby, a lonely &amp; standoffish vamp, develop a beautiful but tragic friendship. The innocence &amp; realism of the relationship between Owen &amp; Abby is well acted &amp; more than appropriate for pre-pubescent kids. Don't miss this one, for it trumps films like "Twilight" and the like. "Let Me In" shines out of the darkness!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ill start first by saying that i really admire the courage of young Chloe Moretz who is only 14 i might add and has taken on a whole slew of roles that some adult actors might stay clear from especially her performance in Kickass with the language!! In this she once again doesn't shy away from portraying a 12 year old vampire who befriends another 12 year old outcast in the form of Owen who constantly runs from a school bully everyday. Owen accidentally runs into Abby in one of many nights as she sits barefoot in the snow in the complex's park that they live in. As Owen finds it some what odd that she is going barefoot in this type of weather he soons finds out in nasty ways that Abby is in fact a very young member of the children of the night. This film is a true vampire flick in many ways even down to the true vampire legacy of not being able to enter a domicile until being invited to do so and actually burning up if coming into contact with any form of sunlight (No sparkling vampires here) I think that director Matt Reeves put out a pretty good lil flick here for those of you that are in fact a fan of the genre!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have watched the original movie 'Let the right one in' then do not watch this one. Not because its bad or anything but the original is the one to keep you want to remember. The remake will only dilute what you loved about the original.If you want to learn a few things about film making then its fine. This is a pretty good remake but the relationship between Abby and Owen is not given enough time to grow early on and the dialogues are rushed into. Abby's relationship with her guardian seemed empty, a closer relationship should have been shown. And what's with not showing the face of the mom may be to justify the ending but it didn't needed to be so. I don't think that the two weeks later thing works. The audience need to follow the story straight in this movie and not putting the parts together.Now, for those who have not watched the original version and are not planning to watch it then do not miss this. It's a remake of a brilliant movie and it retains some of the brilliance of the original. Do not go by the average rating because I think most of the raters have watched the original version and expected a lot from this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that for the most part, these last two decades have been terrible and churn out terrible movies, especially horror movies. If you're like me and you watch them anyway, you go in with a certain set of goggles on.You'll want to not be in that state of mind when you go to see this picture. It is actually good, really good. Beyond just "horror movie good", and if you're big into horror movies then you know what I mean by that.I won't go into spoilers, but this is the best thing that I've seen all year. The interaction between the lead characters doesn't feel forced, it isn't a hokey "boy meets girl" cheese fest either. In fact at times it is quite sad. The violence is brutal, but there's a tasteful kind of back-off to it; It doesn't have to rely on buckets and buckets of blood to get the point across, and it very much does get the point across.The only negative I can think of is that I can't buy one character who is too pretty for what he is doing. Secondly, if you have issues with certain types of animation it may spoil a scene or two for you, but I thought those sequences were well played.In my opinion the best way to go into this movie is knowing as little about it as possible.If all you have read about the movie is this review, and this review sounds at all good to you, then stop reading and go see it. Knowing what is happening will detract from any viewing in my personal opinion. This includes reading the box, even just looking at the front cover of the box will kind of blow some of the intent of telling the story if you think about it much.</fullReview>

It was easier for me to see Let Me In so I saw it first. I was enthralled by the film in all of its aspects. The actors were great, the attention to detail fantastic, the music incredible. I had seen Chloe Moretz in Kick Ass and I think she does a great job in this movie. She seems so wise for her age with, it seems, an uncanny awareness of her characters. All the other actors were also very good.I have to say that I love foreign movies and subtitles are always fine with me so I looked forward to seeing Let the Right One In. I was very disappointed. Compared to Let Me In it seemed like a B movie. The characters were not as developed, there were many holes in the plot, the acting just not that great. I could go point by point comparison of the two movies but that is just a little too involved for what I want to say here.I hope you will watch both movies and make up your own mind as to the qualities of each. In my opinion this "Hollywood remake" is one of the best I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let 'em In (the Remades)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It comes as somewhat of a shock that Matt Reeves's remake of Sweden's own Let 'Em In is a smart, well-structured, hysterically funny family comedy with winning performances from the Lindsay Lohan of today: Chloë Sevigny.This is the question that most everyone had to be asking. I think Matt Reeves is a terrific director, but this was a terrible idea. It must have been a lot of fun to shoot and act in, but to foist this on the public is bogus. I mean, do you think I'm going to watch the two versions side by side to inspect the differences? If I want to watch a movie that looks like Let 'em In and has the same scenes as Let 'em In, I'll rent the original! Sheesh. OK, I'll get off of the stump now.Reeves channels classic screwball comedy by way of Howard Hawks in this sophisticated update of the Swede's tale. Everything is typically bright and sunny, but the script is warm, genuinely humorous, and full of charm. It's rare that family films come without the trappings of bathroom humor and dumbed-down slapstick, and Let 'em In is, cliché as it sounds, a film the whole family can enjoy. Just take my advice and skip this terrible remake of a horror classic!!!!!! God bless and enjoy the movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have to watch this movie. Because I don't want to. Basically because it's a copy of the original Swedish movie called "Let the right one in". I'll bet the director and the producer of this film didn't even ask to buy the rights for this movie... Good enough though, the original movie has got more votes that this one. Actually 10 out of 10.(If you don't believe me you can search it up!) But I just wanted people to know, because I don't think that there are so many people out there who actually knew this. "MTV at the movies" didn't know..or at least they didn't mentioned in when they mentioned this movie. I recommend people to see the Swedish one. To support the original script and the original movie. Why can't Hollywood and the Americans just leave the original movies alone? Especially Swedish ones, since they are also remaking the Swedish Millennium Thriology: "The Girl with the dragon tattoo" "The girl who played with fire" and the other one, which I of course forgot the English name of. Do Hollywod actually think that Americans are that stupid? That they are not be able to read English subtitles? That they HAVE TO make an American version, to get Americans, British and non Nordic audience to see the movie? Stupid! Just plain stupid!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember when vampires played by the rules? When they only came out at night and actually bit necks? Judging by today's glowering daywalkers, respect for that mythology has been all but Eclipsed. Ahem.Maybe that was the fear with this remake of "Let the Right One In." Hollywood had essentially defanged the vampire, and many?myself included?poo-pooed the notion that an American remake of a brilliant foreign film could be anything but fast-food imitation. Fortunately, we were dead wrong; Matt Reeves' "Let Me In" is the rare sequel worthy of its original.Still, it's peculiar timing. Tomas Alfredson's 2008 Swedish version is barely in the ground, less than two years old, and its English-language retelling is already in western theaters. And it appears mainstream westerners still aren't interested; even sans subtitles, opening weekend box office returns were abysmal, evidence at least that they didn't gratuitously sex it up.Sexuality has been intimately linked with vampire myths for hundreds of years, but part of what made "Let the Right One In" so fascinating was the way it turned all that on its head. Seduction and lust had long been the vampire's tool and victim's vice, respectively; conversely, the film?based on a novel by Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist?illustrated an uncommonly innocent, romantic vampiric relationship. It's the heart of the story, and a brilliant creative stroke that survives its Americanization unscathed.That success is due in no small part to an equally talented young couple in the lead, this time Chloe Moretz?who, between "Let Me In" and her turn as Hit-Girl in "Kick-Ass," has had one hell of a year?and Kodi Smit-McPhee, who impressively costarred alongside Viggo Mortensen in the 2009 adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's "The Road." Films about kids can be a risky proposal, but Moretz and Smit-McPhee subtly convey their ability to create authentic young characters.The evolution of Moretz is particularly impressive. Many so-called 'child-stars' burn out hot and fast because they allow themselves to be typecast as a child. Moretz, on the other hand, seems to have futureproofed her career by never committing to a specific genre, and by never shying away from more adult fare. Though she always plays a child, most of her characters are not childish; we have no trouble seeing her already as a young woman?Or a centuries- old vampiress, as the case may be.Beyond the performances, Reeves' version is as solidly constructed as Alfredson's. The pacing is deliberately slow, which can make either feel disengaging at times, but only if you're already well acquainted with the plot of the other. Likewise, I found myself roundly less enthralled by "Let Me In," if only slightly, because of my familiarity with the Swedish film. Neither is perfect, but despite a slight edge to the original in the subtlety department, the two films are practically interchangeable. "Let Me In" is like a good cover or acoustic version of an already great song.Both films are alike in their minimalistic framing, and to air one minor gripe the two share, they both feature ugly CG effects that mar certain moments. In "Let Me In" Reeves pulls back during action sequences to showcase just how fast his vampire moves, but instead of being disturbing, it comes across cartoony. The style juxtaposes the atmosphere of restraint he builds elsewhere uncomfortably. In a film this slow, he really has to nail the spikes, and he isn't always successful.Nevertheless, "Let Me In" is still a firm reminder of what the genre is capable of when treated maturely. It's a shame that vampires have become popular as such silly caricatures of their former selves?the resounding thud of this film tanking will likely ensure it stays that way.As it turns out, it's hard to win when you're the only one playing by the rules.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While being constantly bullied in his small hometown, a young teen learns to fight back after befriending a strange girl who lives in the town who might be responsible for a series of brutal murders due to her unique nature.Despite the original being so overrated and being so completely underwhelming, this one is better only through completely marginal means. So much of the time is spent with the bullying concept that it runs into overkill, as the group is portrayed to purposefully go after and torment him merely to make their comeuppance all the more satisfying, never once staying realistic and descending into cliché so easily there's no connection to the events due to their overwrought nature. Mix this together with an incredibly drawn-out and overlong romance angle that just feels forced and this one has some big problems. There is some pluses in the fact that there's some pretty decent gore scenes here and there for her attacks on the village residents come off as far more intense and bloody than they should've been and the final massacre in the hospital is pretty fun. It even manages a nice bit of action as well with the chases through the snow-covered village and a pretty decent car crash sequence thrown in as well, but it still can't overcome it's flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie, and I usually detest child actors. But, when you have a young vampire and that vamp is the young superhero from Kick Ass, you know you're watching a movie you might just watch again in a few years. Chloë Moretz (Abby) shines in the dark in her role as a girl of twelve and a vampire of indeterminate age. As I'm sure we're aware, vampires are powerful creatures, but with impeccable manners; insisting that we invite them in for a nice cup of tea. There are no spoilers to be found here. Vampire experts already know that the smart ones acquire a vulnerable mortal loner as a trusted guardian. A guardian prepared to kill and die for the girl he cared for his entire natural life. It is an amazing story with a perfect musical score, moments of extreme and shocking violence given a a biting edge by the helplessness of a sweet and vulnerable blonde killing machine. This movie surprised me. It has what it takes to be shown at the most original motion pictures in history exposition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the good fortune to see the original film about a year ago, and I was mesmerized by its originality. The story is a masterwork---it approaches vampires unlike any movie or story seen before. It treated vampirism as a handicap.....a terrible illness that literally sucks the life out of mortals around the vampire, the victims and the caretakers. The new film is superb---getting much more into the supernatural horror of vampirism, but staying so very real at the same time, due to an extraordinary cast.Chloe is, indeed, like Dakota Fanning, and actress beyond her years, and I was very impressed by her fatalism, and the drive to live that she projected. She was a little girl, and a lethal monster living barefoot in the northern winter.....stunning performance.The actor playing the boy, name escapes me, has a face the camera eats up.....and he was very very good in the role. Dylan Minnette is an actor I've seen before, and he, too, is well beyond his years in wisdom, emotion and professionalism. He was truly on fire in this film--full of hate and fear....veteran Elias Koteas was frosting on the cake.The larger budget on make-up and CGI really brought this story forward--this is a true creepfest.....a dark, but lovely story of perpetual young love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers in this review, in my opinion you would be best served knowing as little as possible going into this one. The important thing is that you know it is one of the best movies made in 20 years. They do not make movies like this anymore, not this good, and if they did... one would have to dig very deep to find it. This film is a breath of fresh air to me sort of like District 9 was upon it's release. Let Me In is beautiful, dark, horrific, and never wavers from brilliance. I was unaware this was a remake or a book or any of that. I was not expecting to be so pleasantly surprised. I knew none of the actors, there was no Robert De Niro or Renee Zellwhatever scrunching up their faces into frowny smiles making me forget about the story at hand (thankfully). There was no 30 year old high cheek boned throwaway playing a 20 year old studmuffin (thank you thank you!!!). None of that, just a great story with a great look.I wish I had seen this when I was 10, I think it would have been my favorite movie of all time. The acting is fantastic, everyone is perfect in this one and very believable. Look at the other reviews here at IMDb, everyone liked this movie and I can see why. Please make more movies like this, a movie I do not feel I was cheated out of my money on. Please check this one out and enjoy the intense and wonderful film. Twilight fans steer clear, of the movie and of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything that can be said about it has probably already been written in the reviews before, but I'll give you my summary/opinion anyway. It was not bad, and it surprised me, as American remakes often is. However it's a pity they had to simplify and overdo it. I saw that quite a lot of people thought it was good they added things, like the background of the protector. Same with a few other things mentioned before, in other reviews. But I think the ambiguity and subtleness was one of the things that made the original great! And for the CGI.. Didn't add a thing. On the contrary. It lost some of the beauty and poetic pace from the original. But as I said, not bad, but I prefer the original over this one any day of the week. I do feel sorry for the kid actors in the original though. For not being native English-speaking or Americans or whatever. Seeing how "everyone" predict the actors from this one, being bound to be stars and all that. Considering the actors from the original being as good, if not better. They would, with that logic, also be superstars to be.. If you're going to watch one of these and don't mind subs, watch the original! Or just watch both and get your own opinion =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>yet another vampire romance movie...beats twilight drivel by miles though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The average grade given to this movie was caused by wrong expectations of what this movie was really about...mostly due to the trailer I saw a couple months ago... Was expecting a decent vampire horror movie with a little vampire girl having a feeding frenzy at the local school, and eating all the kids, with the hero kid finding out about her and killing her in dramatic showdown style. Sadly it wasn't the case, its a sort of vampire romance movie... only this time its about a lonely kid that befriends a little vampire girl. That being said, its thousands of miles ahead of the soapy uninteresting drivel that is the Twilight trilogy. The plot is well written, the actors play their parts very well and these kids are well on their way to become stars in their own right. The friendship between the kids is cute and you feel for the characters and their lonely existence. The movie doesn't have much pace, even dozed off a few times at the start of the movie, yet it is interesting watching the story unfold and it helps to have a few gory vampire scenes that are very well done, thrown in the mix. All in all, if you want to watch a late night horror movie, steer clear of this one. On the other hand, if you want to watch a calm well written story with little action, and you are tanked up on caffeine, then this movie is for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let Me In (2010)*** (out of 4)Remake of the Swedish film LET THE RIGHT ON IN tells pretty much the same story. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a kid constantly being tormented by the kids around him but he soon finds a friend in Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), a strange girl who just happens to be a vampire. When LET ME IN was announced it was hit with quite a bit of hatred because fans of the original film wasn't sure why a remake was even needed. Sadly, most people in America aren't interested in watching a movie with subtitles so the makers of this thing wanted to bring the film to America. We could debate this until the end of time but the remake is here and it turned out to be a pretty good and faithful film. If you're familiar with the Swedish version then there's really not going to be anything here that you're not going to see coming. The story structure and many plot points are the same here so those familiar with the original aren't going to have many new things thrown their way. What I was pleasantly surprised about is how faithful the movie was. You'd think that they'd dumb down the subject matter for American audiences or that they'd try and make a faster paced film but that's not the case. Much like the original movie, the impact of this film comes from the two lead characters who grow closer to one another as the movie goes along. As with that film, the two of them go through many violent episodes but thankfully the film doesn't try to sugar coat them or present them in a cleaner fashion. Another version strong aspect are the two lead performances. Both Smith-McPhee and Moretz are very good in their parts and you really do forget that you're watching actors. Both kids are so believable in their parts that you really do feel as if you're seeing real troubled souls connected to one another. The actors certainly deliver some of the strongest performances of the year. Jenkins isn't given as much to do but when he's on screen he's quite good. Again, this remake really doesn't change too much in terms of the story but I do think there are some effective moments here. Just take a look at the first sequence where the "father" goes out to kill for the girl. The sequence with him in the back of the car is quite effective. Overall, I'd say that the original film is slightly better but this here just goes to show that not all remakes are evil. Was the film necessary? Well, that's up for debate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, but not unexpected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching, "Let Me In," and while I felt it was probably a better acted and a faster paced film than that the Swedish version, it still has the same inherit problems found in that adaptation. If you happen to read the book then you'll find that this is not too surprising considering the source. Characterization was simply very weak, as was the storytelling, and while it improved it some areas, it lacked in others; the film was just way too under developed in those areas and did nothing to improve on the Swedish version or the book. The only improvements I saw were a faster paced film, better acting from the Owen/Oskar character and better music.One of the main issues I had with "Let Me In," was the relationship between Abby and Owen. They become fast friends, but the film doesn't really give us a compelling reason for what's feeding their relationship. Sure, real kids meet randomly all the time and become instant buddies without any additional motivation, but then they're not making a film about those kids. In the book, we're shown a very lonely Oskar/Owen and an emotionally stunted and distant Eli, so we kind of understand why they might be attracted to each other, but in "Let Me In," these concepts are never really explored. Instead we're left to assume they're drawn to each simply by natural circumstances.Another problem I had was that the most interesting character (Abby aka little vampire girl) is really only explored thru Owen's rather spartan viewpoint. We never see the world thru her eyes the few times she's on screen, and consequently her character comes off very flimsy and one dimensional. The character of Owen, who feels very much like a glorified supporting character than a main lead, really doesn't have the type of character development you would need in order for him to carry entire the weight of his relationship with Abby and the plot. This was one of the reasons why I never found their friendship all that engaging or believable.Outside of the characterization I found the storytelling to be somewhat lacking in direction. There doesn't seem to a sense of where the film is headed, and there is virtually no suspense whatsoever, nor is there any no buildup towards any kind of big climax; this problem is also present in the Swedish version. The detective in the film has barely anything to do, and the audience is given absolutely no urgency to feel like he's getting close to solving the recent killings of two people, thereby uncovering the mystery of Abby.I watched this film hoping for a more polished version of the foreign adaptation, but the filmmakers continued to make the same mistakes found in both the book and the Swedish film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>let me in is not your typical vampire movie, its much more than that. its also a love story mixed with pure rich drama, suspense, and weird romance. let me in is about 2 neighbors movie in a quiet town we don't know the characters till the movie's middle however if your looking for stab blood blood stab then your watching the wrong movie. this movie is really about two individual kids befriending each other despite the fact that the girl is well been 12 for a while, and a shy boy who's a loner. together they make the perfect couple in spite they're age and is able to make grown up decisions somewhat.Now the performances: Kodi-smit mcphee gives an Oscar worthy performance as the shy kid and often bullied by teens. i think he bring caricature to his role and he's one of the best young actors in this decade. mcphee previously play in (the road) which in my opinion his performance in let me in tops his performance in the road. i think he will be the next jimmy Bennett. Chloë Grace Moretz from (Kick-ass) gives another strong and Oscar worthy performance as the girl who normal by day and vampire by night. what really made the movie is the 2 lead who were believable from the start of the movie till the movie's closing. thats why I'm giving this an 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from The Magnificent Seven (Seven Samurai), Three Men and a Baby (Trois Hommes Et Un Couffin) and The Departed (Infernal Affairs and its sequels), I can't think of many good English version remakes of foreign films, but I was willing to chance this one, remaking the Swedish horror Let the Right One In, from director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield). Basically Los Alamos, New Mexico, twelve year old outcast Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is lonely and being badly bullied at school by Kenny (Dylan Minnette) and two schoolmates, but things are to change when he meets new neighbour, twelve year old Abby (Kick Ass's Chloë Grace Moretz). Despite her saying she can't be friends with him, he introduces her to the Rubik's cube and they do form a close friendship where they meet every night. Abby's father Thomas (Richard Jenkins) meanwhile is a wanted serial killer who collects victims blood in order to give it to his daughter, but of course his carelessness with a body one night will soon cause trouble. Abby is of course a vampire who needs to feed off victims' blood to stay alive, and when her father has a bad car accident, all he can do is pour hydrochloric acid on his face to stop identification, and let his daughter suck his blood before plunging out the hospital window. Slowly Owen comes to realise there is something suspicious about his young female friend, and eventually he does find out her dark secret seeing her reaction to blood, and at one point not inviting her in like a vampire needs to be. While Owen hit back at the bullies like Abby advised him to, she is in danger of being when The Policeman (Elias Koteas) is investigating the recent murders, and a woman turned into a vampire because draining wasn't finished and she burns to death due to sun exposure. In the end Abby is forced to move away with the net closing in around her, but she returns to kill the bullies who try to drown Owen, and the final scene sees him travelling somewhere with Abby inside the large trunk, and they communicate with Morse Code. Also starring Cara Buono as Owen's Mother, Sasha Barrese as Virginia, Dylan Kenin as Larry and Chris Browning as Jack and Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak as Mark. The two young stars do reasonably well, Moretz is obviously the one who goes on to bigger things, deservedly, it is exactly the same story with all the same elements and particularly memorable moments, but with some subtle difference, including an impressive car crash seen inside the vehicle, it is an okay Americanised remake fantasy horror. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't understand...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's probably me, but there are several things I don't understand.The original was crap. Utter rubbish without direction, without logic, without character development. Maybe it was an emo's dream but that's quite a small demographic for giving the original a top 250 IMDb rating.But stranger things have happened and I know myself well enough to know that pretty much anything the original had, wasn't really good enough to make it in my book. I rather watch someone in a jammed wheel chair trying to win a marathon.But enough about the original. I was hoping that in this case the international remake would actually be better than the original. And actually it is! The original got a 1 rating from me, this here got a 2 rating. But why? Not because it's more logical, or has better character development, or because the story is somehow more gripping? No it's entirely the same tripe as it was before, which is surprising. Because until I saw this I could honestly not believe that someone could make a carbon copy of something truly horrible without by accident making it better. But there is one tiny detail that made me give this movie a two point rating. The original has a paedophilic moment where the original director shows the crotch of the little girl. And in this remake it's cut out. And if it's not cut out then I missed it and I'm just as glad about that! Actually, maybe I should give this movie a 5 for not showing that shot but that would be pushing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as good as the original, but still a well done remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is extremely hard to even consider discussing Let Me In without making comparisons to its Swedish original, Let the Right One In. Both are very different films, but both have the same story at its core ? a lonely young boy (Owen in this version, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) befriends a mysterious young girl (Abby in this version, played by Chloe Moretz), who he later figures out is actually a vampire. It does not sound like much, and is definitely unlike any American film made about vampires over the past few years.Let the Right One In is an unadulterated masterpiece that will leave you reeling from its simplicity and quiet subtleness. It played itself out so slow, so calculating, and so unlike any vampire movie you would have ever seen. This is the movie that should have invigorated the genre, not those pesky Twilight franchise. So when they announced the American remake, it was obvious that a lot of people would be disheartened. Why remake something that was so well done in the first place (looking at you now too Girl with the Dragon Tattoo)? Have we not come far enough as a film-going audience that we can now sit through subtitles with ease? And this is where my initial simultaneous concern and praise stems from. Writer/director Matt Reeves (best known for his work in Cloverfield) has recreated Tomas Alfredson's film with such beauty and such grace, that it feels a bit too close to the original work. The story lines differ, but the snow covered look of the film and the silent subtlety of lost innocence is all too present in both films. I commend Reeves for maintaining the look, pacing and feel of the original film, and am even more impressed at how he did not allow the film to fall prey to becoming a cookie-cutter mainstream American thriller. But when he said that he was making the film his own, I did not think we would see identical shots from the original film recreated with new actors. Sure, he pushes a 1980s sensibility throughout the film (what, with multiple shots of Ronald Reagan and a gross overuse of David Bowie's "Let's Dance"), but it does not shield or allow anyone who seen the original film to think this film is an original and unique product we were initially promised it would be.What he also sadly maintains here are the absolutely atrocious special effects. While they were laughable at best in the original film, they still fit in with the film's charm and sensibilities. Here, they look even worse and look downright awful. While I can forgive some of them (especially because Reeves wisely cut a memorable scene involving cats), the majority are just downright inexcusably bad. I understand Abby is not a human, and can move in ways that no human can really recreate, but standard effects in 2010 can make some of these moves appear totally realistic, especially in a darkened setting (where the majority of the film takes place). So why do they look even less believable than effects from the early 1990s? It just looks very sloppy, and very unpolished. Each time Abby moved around, it took me right out of the movie, and right out of what was happening. And considering how scary some of these scenes should have been, it made for a few rather disappointing sequences. At least some time was put into making the makeup effects look significantly better.But Reeves does do a few things right. For one, he wisely amped up the role for the "Father" character (H?kan in the original), played here by Richard Jenkins. He is still an enigmatic and mysterious character, but he has much more depth than he had in the original. When some of the more emotional scenes hit, you actually feel for the character and understand its importance. Reeves even adds a whole layer of background to the character that was either hidden or merely poked at in the original film that makes his arch even more heartbreaking. He is such a small character in the grand scheme of things, but I could have only asked for more to be done with him. And having such an incredible talent as Jenkins in the role is an added blessing, as he brings an intensity to the role that you would have never thought possible for this character.Reeves also makes Owen and Abby's friendship less creepy and more into a budding love story. In both films, these two individuals come together because of their loneliness and society's rejection. Abby because she is a centuries-old vampire with only an elder "father" figure to keep her company, and Owen because he's bullied at school and has next to no relationship with his parents. In the original, their union is more creepy and unsettling than anything else, but still comes off as rather beautiful and innocent because of how young these two appear to be. Here, there is still something rather unsettling about their union, but their tale is a much more involving story of love. I found the reality of their relationship to be much more obvious to grasp here, and much more delicately beautiful. Adding the quiet innocence of the two young leads, Smit-McPhee and Moretz, only helps add to how beautiful their relationship slowly becomes.While it is nowhere near the masterpiece the original film was, Let Me In is still a well done remake. It follows a few elements a bit too close, but it adds and expands on other ones in ways the original never attempted. It could have easily been a better film, but for how low key and anti mainstream it is, the film just may have to contend with being good enough.7/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A shy boy (Smit-Mcphee) befriends the new girl (Moretz) and discovers a horrifying secret. After a lifetime of bullying Owen (Smit-Mcphee) meets a mysterious new girl named Abby (Moretz) who teaches him to stand up for himself. Having never seen the original (Let The Right One In) I went in expecting a vampire thriller. I had high hopes for this one but it was not what I expected. It wasn't terrible, just slow. I may not have paid attention as much as I should have but it seemed like there was no real plot. As far as I can tell it's a movie about a shy boy making friends with a vampire and trying to co-exist. This is one of those movies that is OK while watching it but almost instantly forgotten when it's over. Don't go in expecting the "Twilight" vampires. This is pretty graphic, with seemingly random killings. If vampires actually did exist this is what I imagine that they would be like, hidden and trying to fit in. I give it a C.Would I watch again? - No</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LET ME IN (Matt Reeves, 2010) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I liked the director's previous monster effort ? CLOVERFIELD (2008) ? well enough, I cannot say that I held much hope for the film under review (this, too, in spite of having been impressed with co-star Chloe Grace Moretz' scene-stealing turn in KICK-ASS [2010]). My reservation was two-fold: for one thing, I felt it to be an unnecessary Americanization of a near-masterpiece of the genre (especially since the Swedish original dated from just two years back) and, also, because it happened to inaugurate Hammer Films' long-promised resurgence (which 30 years ago had reached saturation point in view of the fact that the style the company had firmly established over the previous two decades suddenly found itself passé in the age of visceral horrors such as THE EXORCIST [1973] and THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE [1974])! However, I must say that my fears proved largely unfounded, being repaid instead not just with a surprisingly strong remake and another stunning performance from Moretz, but what certainly amounts to a prodigious start to the British House Of Horror's revitalized fortunes (which, hopefully, will be upheld by their upcoming productions).Inevitably, this review will from now on take the form of parallels between the remake and the original (though not the novel, since I am not familiar with it) ? or, if you, like the pros and cons of this new version vis-a'-vis the earlier adaptation (courtesy of the author himself). Essentially, the film rests once again on the central relationship between the lonely, bullied kid (ably played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) and the enigmatic but obviously knowing vampire girl ? which is just as persuasive, compelling and touching as the first go round: if anything, the two seem to bond even more here, as they go out and are shown listening to music together in their secret hide-out?though I doubt Abby (her name having been changed from the Eli of the book and Swedish film) would care to be up-to-date on such apparently 'mundane' matters! As has come to be expected of my inherently over-analytical nature (especially when it comes to my favorite genre), I found a good many negative aspects within the film that would seem to contradict the "Good" rating; so, I will just list these regardless, and people can make of them what they will! To begin with, I found the relocation to New Mexico pointless (since one usually associates the place with an arid desert atmosphere anyway, why not go all-out and set the whole against a totally conflicting backdrop?!). Elias Koteas' snooping cop is likewise redundant (not only is he made to repeat his actions along the way, but some of the original's 'local color' ? conveyed through the various characters ? is thus lost?and does it not have greater impact when it is a relative of one of the victims seeking revenge on the vampire rather than just a law-enforcement officer in the line of duty?!). The change of locale in the vampire protector/procurer's self-mutilation also does not work ? though the car-crash POV shot was an undeniably nice touch, I rather suspect that the fleshing-out of his depredations arose merely out of a need to justify giving the role to an Oscar-caliber actor as Richard Jenkins(!)?and, contrary to what I have read (and as was unequivocally the case with the first version), his death-leap looks like a suicide now! On the other hand, the fiery demise of the vampire-attack survivor (which seems to have been played up a bit here) is not self-induced this time around?plus I missed the scene with the character's newly-apprehensive cats! To get to the heart of the matter, however, the CGI effects were frankly crap: the demon-like appearance and jerky accelerated movements of the aroused Abby were not only unnecessary but seemed like concessions to ? or, worse, patronizing of ? apparently unsophisticated American audiences, as were the omission of the vampire's gender twist and its intermittent ageing (which, invariably, would have further confused the issues!). Having only watched the original early this year, I was quite familiar with the plot and I admit to actively longing for how its various highlights would play out (that said, the inspired economy displayed during the startlingly effective swimming-pool climax comes across as curiously muffled in this newer rendition!). Much has been made in reviews of Owen (formerly Oskar)'s 'transparent' mother, which I did not mind, but also of the fact that Abby only attacks people whom the boy has spied on with his telescope?yet, since the two never breach the subject of his being something of a peeping-tom, I hardly think this was intentional! Similarly, the much-touted snippets from telecasts of Ronald Reagan's 'Evil' tirades are sparsely used and subtly incorporated into the narrative?but I honestly do not think there was any overt attempt to parallel the vampire's activities with the 'rotten' state of the modern world.In the end, this is a very fine effort as modern horrors go ? even if it is little more than a carbon-copy of an even more impressive one (whose refreshingly dense texture and novel spin on a much-abused theme it sensibly retains).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most girls wear lipstick, but Abby wears blood on her lips. The tolls of being a pre-adolescent vampire have tragic effects on those around Abby, including her Guardian and new friend, Owen, a 12-year-old boy unsuspecting of what Abby really is. Let Me In is the English- language remake of foreign flick, Let The Right One In, and while I have not seen the original, I can say that Let Me In is an often uneven piece of movie-making that at times excels, and at other times lacks dramatic tension, but the movie is overall a fresh take on the vampire myth.Divorced parents and an almost always absent mother, young Owen is a pre-teen with violent tendencies. When he's playing at home, he's either spying on his neighbors with his telescope, or he has a knife and pretends to stab little girls, making him a perfect kinsmate for a vampire. At school, Owen tries to hide in solitude, but the school bullies rarely leave Owen alone, and we as an audience calculatedly wait for the moment in which Owen's violent tendencies lash out upon the boys bullying him. But things change for Owen when Abby moves into the apartment next door, and her and Owen embark in a puppy dog-vampire love.Let Me In redefines the standard vampire tale while remaining true to the core mythology of the vampire, but while so doing, teling a pre-adolescent love story at its core. Of course, this movie is not a romanticized look at the vampire, like Bela Lugosi's Dracula, but it is rather unromanticized. Being a vampire is almost portrayed as being a curse in this movie and not a blessing. We see these carnivorous, animalistic tendencies in Abby, and when she attacks it's like a lioness attacking a gazelle. Swift and violent. Bloody and gruesome. You actually pity Abby. A girl who can never enter into sunlight or she will spontaneously combust. A girl who will always be that, a girl who is immortal. A girl who has a Guardian in character actor Richard Jenkins, so that she does not have to stalk and hunt prey. Jenkins' character murders the people for Abby and just delivers her the blood in milk jugs, but of course there would be no dramatic tension if Abby never bit into somebody's neck at some point.There are three different story lines in this movie that all eventually converge into one, and it is here where the movie becomes uneven. There is the romance between Owen and Abby, there is the relationship between Abby and her Guardian, and there is the Detective (played by Elias Koteas) who is trying to uncover the source behind the body count that Abby and her Guardian leave in their wake. The first love, so to speak, between Abby and Owen is the most dramatically intriguing arc of the story, and the one in which the time is actually taken to develop and let live. I love how the director, Matt Reeves, really showed Owen's sudden yearning for the opposite sex in many different scenes, such as his attentiveness to watch the woman across the street undress through his telescope, and then he meets Abby and finds not just a friend, but someone to go"steady" with. Of course, I don't know if Owen was Abby's first love.It's alluded occasionally throughout the movie that Abby's Guardian has cared for her ever since he was Owen's age, but he has grown weary of this over time, problem is I never felt the character's desire to not have to kill and maim for Abby's blood anymore. Sure, Richard Jenkins says it at one point, and he is such a good actor, he clearly knows each step of how he got there, but this was a case where simply saying it wasn't enough and the filmmakers should have spent more time developing it. Then, there's the story of the Detective which lacks dramatic tension -- much like Richard Jenkins' arc -- primarily cause the story never allows the Detective any chance to be anything more than a stock movie detective. It sort of felt as if the Detective was merely there so that we could see the progress of the police getting closer to Abby in a ploy for suspense, but the suspense was flat. I never got that impending sense that the police were closing in, but rather felt the entire time that they were always clueless, even when their necks were being chomped upon.But guzzling blood can have its rewards when one is a vampire. The acting from the two leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz, are both magnificent, but it's Moretz that breaks away from the pack as Abby. I've followed Moretz's career ever since I first saw her in (500) Days of Summer, and then as Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass, but she really shows a depth in this role that makes me believe she could possibly make the transition from child to adult star. Moretz lives this character, she isn't acting like a 12-year-old girl, but acting like an adult trapped inside a child's body. The acting coupled with the eerie, yet oddly beautiful score from Michael Giacchino, make this movie worth watching.So can this movie survive the generations, like Abby, and continue to befriend moviegoers years from now? Even though Let Me In is an uneven examination of the vampire lore, it is a movie that has enough originality alongside some spectacular acting by its young stars, that makes this horror movie passable, but will it be a classic? Depends on who's doing the biting.I give Let Me In a C!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original...but that's faint praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the inexplicably successful 2008 Swedish horror film "Let the Right One In". Owen is a 12 year old boy who is mercilessly bullied by male classmates and has no friends. Mysterious 12 year old Abby moves next door to him. Owen is interested in her but he says they can never be friends at all. It seems she's a vampire whose father kills people and drains their blood to feed her. Despite herself Abby starts falling for Owen and he falls for her...but doesn't know she's a vampire.Part horror film, part DARK coming of age story. I'm no great fan of the original. I find it boring, badly acted, painfully slow and stupid. This one is just a little better. It's still far too slow and the bullying scenes are more than a little disturbing but I kept watching. It's better-acted, some of the attack scenes are vicious and frightening and it has the proper depressing mood. In some ways it's virtually a shot by shot redo of the original but makes the bullying angle more explicit. So I like it a little more than the original but it's still not a great, let alone good, horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, you did not get it. This is not a love story....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead, it is a story about enslavement, servitude, deception and corruption.Abby is a vampire, who knows how old. She is an evil and manipulative creature who needs blood to survive. She must kill in order to find nourishment. Since she cannot be exposed to daylight and do a lot of things humans can, she must have a manservant to take care of her needs.Owen is a naive, lonely and rather effeminate boy that has a pretty sad life. He is bullied, his parents are divorcing and his mother is an alcoholic. Having lost her manservant, Abby must find another one, as soon as possible so that she can continue living. To that end she approaches Owen and seduces him and this way she will have someone to provide her with her needs. So, there is no love in this story... There is no reciprocity. Abby uses the boy for her needs, and the boy has the illusion that he is loved....This is a really cool movie, and more interesting than the original one, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In is a faithful but average reworking of one of the best foreign films of 2008.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let Me In is the Hollywood remake of Tomas Alfredson's Let the Right One In (2008), the quite extraordinary Swedish horror-drama that was based on an original screenplay by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also wrote the novel of the same name. Here, Matt Reeves, the director of the hit monster movie Cloverfield (2008), uses Lindqvist's material, and delivers a very faithful adaptation, albeit in a way that probably would not raise any eyebrows. There is not much to fault in Let Me In story and character-wise, but there were a couple of decisions that Reeves made that left me wanting.The film is a bittersweet love story between two pubescent teenagers. Their names are Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz). Owen lives with her mother, who's getting a divorce, in a small town that nobody moves to in New Mexico. One winter night, Owen meets Abby, the new girl who just moved in. Nights later, they become close friends after some tender moments together with a Rubik's cube. Oblivious to Owen's knowledge, Abby is actually a vampire, thus needing human blood to survive, which is the reason for the town's recent slate of gruesome killings.As voyeuristic as James Stewart's character in Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954), Owen soon realizes that there is a link between the killings and the girl next door whom he is infatuated with. One misstep by Reeves is his treatment of the psychosexual tension between Owen and Abby, which is almost non-existent here, but was quite adequately fleshed out by Alfredson in Let the Right One In.In addition, while the violence is at times horrific, it seems to be Hollywoodized, which brings us to the director's second misstep ? the use of CGI to "enhance" Abby's vampirical features in scenes of bloodlust attacks. This artificialization of Abby's facial features, I feel, alienates the core appreciators of Alfredson's film who would see this as an attack on the original's unfantastical and humanistic elements.The acting, however, remains strong, in particular Moretz's, whose stock in Hollywood has risen tremendously after her butt-kicking role in Matthew Vaughn's Kick-Ass (2008). Her role as Abby (who is as violent, and blood-lusting a character as Hitgirl) is a different challenge altogether, demanding a more nuanced, dramatic approach as opposed to the all-action, I-am-Rambo attitude of the latter.The entire film is paced slowly, but Reeves' non-intrusive camera-work allows a sense of unease to build up, which explodes in a terrifying infliction of extreme violence by an individual on a group of antagonists in the film's climax (albeit let down by the intentional use of dim lighting that does not give a wide-eyed, surrealistic feel apparent in Let the Right One In). Let Me In is a faithful but average reworking of one of the best foreign films of 2008. This time, it tries too hard to please American fans of the traditional vampire-horror genre when the film itself is not exclusively categorized as such.GRADE: C+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superfluous but thankfully respectful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying that I don't really see the point of any English Language remake, especially when the new film in question is so close to the original that you sometimes even forget which one you're actually watching. Matt Reeves decided to play it safe, very safe if you ask me. In various interviews he's been claiming that he never really wanted to make a vampire story, but more of a story about friendship between two people who both happened to be outcast. Well, yes fine, fair enough. But all this was in the original movie too! There is absolutely nothing new in this film. No apparent reason to have a remake if not for the fact that people are just lazy and cannot be bothered to watch a subtitled film. So, let's encourage laziness and remake exactly the same film without those annoying subtitles! And while we are there, let's add a little bit more blood and gore, that green tint that nowadays seems to be the only colour of horror and let's add more music, filling up every single second of silence in the film (I thought there was just way too much music!!). I don't really want to rubbish this film. It was after all very well handled, and at least they didn't really make fools out of themselves. Let's face it, it could have been so much worse. Thankfully the director and producers decided to be quite reverential towards the original source (the Swedish film itself was drawn from a novel, which is also one of the sources from this US version) and in the end didn't really pee all over it. My criticism is probably a bit biased because it starts from the premises that there was just no reason to remake it, especially just a couple of years after the first one. So let me try for a moment to pretend this is no remake (almost shot by shot in a few cases!) and let's look at it as a piece of work by itself (it's hard but I'll try). To be honest, it's beautifully filmed. Every shot is carefully framed and composed, sometimes to the point that it becomes a bit too unreal. The idea of never showing the mother for example, seems a bit too forced in places? and let's face it. It's nothing new. Steven Spielberg had done it before in ET (and before that, Tom &amp; Jerry Cartoons or even Peanuts). The parallel with Spielberg is interesting, since apparently Director Matt Reeves did have a meeting with Spielberg before he started filming. Spielberg gave him various tips about directing children (things like "Do listen to what they have to say and don't force your idea about how they should do things), but also he was the one who suggested that both young actors should keep a diary in which they should write daily, in character. Whatever Spileberg's suggestions were, Matt Reeves did a really good job with the 2 kids. The performances from both Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloe Moretz are very very good indeed! Little Chloe is clearly destined to greatness, as she has already shown her capabilities in "Kick A$$", and after this one, we can probably even expect some nomination in the forthcoming award season. So, to wrap it all up. It's a competent film, without any single original idea in it. If you haven't seen the original you might like it (or probably think it's all a bit slow), but if, like me, you've seen and loved the original, then you'll be left with a slightly sour taste in your mouth, wondering "Why? Why? Why?". Well, probably because some American think it's easier to spend 29 million dollars than to tell people that they should spend a couple of hours reading a bunch of subtitles in a good film.For more, check my moviegeekblog</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that is worthy to sink your teeth into!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>News Flash! Hollywood didn't F-up the remake of the beloved Swedish horror drama, let The Right One In. Rejoice! OK, I'm not being mean here but, i have to given credit to where it's due. After much anticipation and worry of what will become in the hands of the money-maker in Tinseltown, sweat was wiped clean and a breath of relief over came as the celluloid flashed across my eyes. Let Me In, stood on its own, even though most of the tone was carried over from the original. The west- Europe suburban was an exact match to what was how the 80s felt and slipped smoothly into the dark malevolent setting. Faithfully sticking close to the predecessor, Matt Reeves (Cloverfield - which is a guilty pleasure of mine) weaved much of the action as it should be while adding his own touch. What the original lacked was the cinematography, fortunately Greig Fraser had the eye to bring this classic a step further with his quiet front, symmetrical framing and dread into the scene. One such case was the car crash scene which takes place from the view point in the interior back seat which made my jaw drop with its realistic composure. Even with much of the story being told when night falls, everything seemed much highlighted and was clear of how the film was painted to point the audience to the right direction. Skillfully scripted and directed, I'll have to admit, the choice of having the hospital scene as the opening really did stir up more intrigue, solidifying the mystery and suspense. Particularly noted was his choice of the view of the boy's mother which we never really see in full view. It always above screen or from a reflection or blocked. A perfect decision to show the view point of a child. Acting all around was remarkably worthy by all the cast. Even to the smallest role. Kodi Smit, playing the boy, last seen in The Road (which had me worried because of his lack of sadness in that film and many thought that he was miscast), stepped up to the game as the lonely bullied boy trying to live life in that forsaken town. And then there's Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl rules!), last seen in Kick Ass (*heart), has done it again fitting snugly into the role of Abby. Of cos last but not least, Richard Jenkins, playing the father who heartfully played the role pitch perfect. Even with all the praises, this standing ovation remake still has much to be compared in some areas but excelled in many others. What can i say, no one can remake that swimming pool massacre scene, which was more poetically haunting, like the Swedish. - www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Title: My Girlfriend Is A Vampire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew nothing about this film going in. I just knew that it was either a horror film or a thriller. The biggest draw was that Hitgirl from Kick-Ass was on here and I was really curious about her performance in other movies. I loved her performance in Kick-Ass and looked forward to seeing how she does with future projects.The film starts out interesting enough. We see an overhead shot of some police cars and ambulance going down a snowy road surrounded by trees. It is here where we get a brief glimpse to someone's deformed hand as this person is taken to a nearby hospital. The person is still alive, and a cop who looks strangely like my sixth grade Math Teacher, Mr. Bortles, questions him. Mr. Bortles gets a call, asks about some little girl, and a nurse screams.Then a title card says TWO WEEKS EARLIER and we see some little boy eating candy outside in the snow. This is where the film takes an odd turn for me. That whole setup in the beginning really sets the mood for a creepy film but instead, as my friend and I agreed, it was one depressing film.It really was. That outside where that kid hangs out with is lit with red. It has this depressing mood to it that reminds me of days when I had no friends and wanted to get away from my parents. Hitgirl doesn't make it much better. She has this monotone personality that just makes it more depressing. And the boy, well, not only does he act depressing, he is depressing.The boy gets picked on by these kids at the school. These kids harass this boy to no end and are probably the most vile group of kids ever put on film. They are the type of kids who deserve what they get back. Unfortunately, in real life, there are kids like them and the scared little boy would be the one in trouble if he deservingly sent them to the hospital. Dang adults! But the core of the movie is that Hitgirl is a vampire. Her and the boy has this bond together and they even become boyfriend and girlfriend. There's a scene where Hitgirl is lying next to him, telling him not to look, because her face is covered in blood. Very attractive. Then the next morning he wakes up and she's gone. It happens, kid.There were a few scenes in the film that bother me. Besides the depressing atmosphere, there were some special effects shots that were noticeably fake like how the vampire kills this guy in a drainage pipe and some fire effects. There's also a scene that makes no sense other than establish Hitgirl is a vampire where the boy cuts his finger to become blood brothers with her. Who does that? I mean, your boyfriend and girlfriend! Isn't that enough? But the film does have some great moments in it. One scene involves a guy in the back of the car waiting to kill somebody only to find out he gets another passenger. Another scene involves a cop lurking in Hitgirl's home. There's also a scene that strangely reminded me of the movie Omen 2.Let Me In isn't the greatest film I've seen but it's a better vampire film than say, TWILIGHT! I still think The Lost Boys is the greatest vampire film ever made and I'm not much of a vampire freak anyway. Would I recommend Let Me In? Only if you like vampires or Hitgirl. Otherwise, wait a couple months for DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In - a solid but inferior remake of Let The Right On In.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Owen is a lonely boy being bullied at school. He meets Abby when she moves into the building and a friendship grows between them. But as a series of murders occur, it becomes apparent that Abby is hiding a secret... she is a vampire.Of all the film reviews I've posted on the IMDb site, Let Me In is a film I never wanted to review. Not because it's a bad film, it isn't, but because of how I feel about Let The Right One In. In my opinion, Let The Right One In is the best film of the last ten years. When I heard of this new version, I was filled with anger at it being remade so soon, and dread as remakes of horror films have on the whole been pretty poor. I mean for example, The Wicker Man, The Ring, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Hitcher, When A Stranger Calls, Prom Night, Dark Water, and many others have all been terrible compared to the originals. But to confuse the matter more, was the fact that Let Me In was being produced by the resurrected film company Hammer. This was to be their first cinema film released for over thirty years. Hammer in it's original company, made some of the best horror, fantasy and science- fiction films ever made, and made my own favourite horror film of all time, Dracula.So were does Let Me In sit? Well lets start with the positives. The casting of Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz was inspired. Both of them are very good in the central roles of Owen and Abby. They are fast becoming two of the best child actors in Hollywood at the moment, and both are brilliant here, especially Kodi Smit-McPhee. The rest of the cast are pretty good too with the likes of Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas giving strong supporting performances.This version of the story, follows a similar pattern to the film version of the original novel more than the novel itself. As a result, like Let The Right One In film, it strips out a lot of back-story and subplots, to concentrate on the relationship between Owen and Abby, and when they are on screen, the film works very well indeed.But where the film goes wrong is in some decisions made by Matt Reeves as writer and director. For instance, changing the way the Jenkins character, known only as The Father, goes after victims. Reeves has decided to make the scenes almost like inserts from a different serial killer film, with the character hiding in the back of cars waiting to pounce on the victims. Also there is the strange decision to never show Owen's mothers face throughout. She is only seen in blurred image, or from the neck down or from behind. I'm not sure why Reeves wanted to do it this way but I don't think it fully works. As for Owen's father unlike the original book and film we never see him at all, instead reduced to a voice on the phone. This is a shame as I always felt that the visit to the father was a key scene in both book and film.The most disappointing thing overall though is the violence and bloodshed in the film. The attacks Abby carries out involve CGI which I was disappointed with. I suppose they were trying to show Abby as some kind of animal when attacking, but the CGI is poor indeed. As for the bloodshed and violence, there is more of it here than the original. To my mind this is only because the film-makers felt they needed it to grab the audiences attention, something the original never resorted to. In Let The Right One In, attacks were shown from a distance away from them, never in close up. It's a change I didn't feel was needed.A key change Reeves had made is in the decision to use a cop (Elias Koetas) investigating what is going on, instead of the group of friends from the book and original film. While this does keep things going, the friends in the story played a key part and are missed. It also means when the victims are attacked they are faceless unknowns, instead of characters you care about.I have to say also the music score is poor. It feels like a generic horror score, making it almost instantly forgettable and lacks the haunting quality of the music from Let The Right One In.I hate comparing Let Me In to Let The Right One In, but it is unavoidable for one simple reason : Reeves chooses to repeat certain scenes from Let The Right One In almost exactly the same. This means of course you end up comparing the versions, and sadly Let Me In isn't as good as Let The Right One In in this comparison. And note, this is not another version of the book as was claimed during the making of this film. It's another version of the film instead.Let Me In though is still a much better remake than most that have been made recently. And if you have not seen Let The Right One In, you may enjoy this film a lot more. But having seen the Swedish original film and having read the novel, I have to say it's not as good as the source novel and film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable adaptation of the novel, not as good as the Swedish film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is difficult to review without referring to its Swedish predecessor, Let the Right One In (in English), since most of it is a very direct remake. By comparison to the average cookie-cutter vampire film, it is at least more original and generally more interesting, so if somehow you can't handle the subtitles of the Swedish original or the so-so dubbing in the dubbed version turns you off (I highly recommend the subtitles, as he sound editing in the original is very effective), it might be worth seeing. On the other hand, it doesn't add very much to the Swedish version and loses more than it gains. There is one good scene early on which is entirely novel and well executed, but generally it's the same as the Swedish film only more rushed and less subtle, and oh yeah, with more boobs. I personally also found the atmospheric music in the soundtrack to be extremely grating and intrusive. When the director can't manage to make a scene touching enough, he literally piles on the violins - repeatedly, and drum beats are the code to let you know that there's supposed to be suspense. It seems to be part of a pattern of eliminating anything subtle - this is basically "Let the Right One In for Dummies." Most of the really effective frights in the original are either cut out entirely or so rushed and clumsy that they lose their effectiveness, so don't be expecting a lot on the horror front. I kind of got the impression that the director was so enamored of his one original sequence that he put all his minutes into that, and by the end he was just touching the bases with the rest of the scenes. One sequence near the end is jarringly absurd due to the fact that one character from the book was substituted into the actions of another with some rather inadequate patching. Let's just say that you should be prepared to assume that police detectives are morons and never follow standard police procedure. On the bright side for the producers, it looks like it was cheap enough to make that they won't have much trouble getting their money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me In: Why is everyone moving so slowly??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparisons to the original Swedish "Let The Right One In" are inevitable to those who have seen it. A fan myself, I was worried about the remake being an unnecessary clone. The trailers made me hope that Matt Reeves had done a decent job, and to the extent that he has, he succeeded in creating an atmospheric vampire film.But sadly, the original film does exist, and the comparisons do not hold up well: Tomas Alfredon's original far surpasses this remake's attempts on virtually all levels. From the visual palette to the mixed bag of visual effects to the plodding pacing, Reeves's vision often pales as a cheap copy of Alfredon's telling of the same story. The cast of actors here seem hamstrung by a director's choices, leading to a very forced, unnatural flow in character interactions. Chloe Moretz, in particular, is unable to capture the haunting coldness that Lina Leandersson tapped into so effortlessly. On the other hand, Kodi Smit-McPhee handles his part of a tortured student exceptionally well. His character seems poised to grow up into a tormented soul, potentially with serial killer tendencies (the mask is an eerie hint of a future Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees). His exposure to Abby seems to refocus his purpose in life, giving him meaning where little existed before. The rest of the cast is decent, although this film rests on the shoulders of these two young actors alone.And for the life of me, I do not understand why everyone talks and moves so slowly in this film. I assume they were aiming for atmosphere and slow-building suspense, but the result is actually boring. I swear, a good ten minutes could have been shaved off this film's running time had the actors run things at a normal pace. This fault seems to be a result of poor direction though, as the actors are all quite capable.Surprisingly, the visual effects work in "Let Me In" is lackluster, often unnecessary and artificial. While the badly-rendered (but hilarious) CGI cat attack from the original is missing, it is replaced with other poor CGI effects. One scene involving a vampire's exposure to sunlight is particularly obvious; done so well in the original, the remake replaces it with some awful computer effects. Abby's violent attacks become little more than ragdoll effects with gruesome sound design. This lack of realism pulls the viewer from the story, a crucial mistake that hinders the effectiveness of the film's eerie story.The music pales to the original, and Reeves's color palette of browns and yellows doesn't quite capture the chilly effectiveness of Alfredson's stark blue hues. On its own, "Let Me In" would probably have been a pretty effective, nasty gem of a horror film. But, at least for me, I was unable to disconnect my love of the original from my experience viewing this one. Hard as I tried, I could not seem to shake the powerful impact the original had and how little of an impact this remake has.** Updated 10-05-2010: Watched Let The Right One In again last night. Having seen both so closely together, there are some updates in the remake that make more dramatic sense but oddly enough lessen the dramatic pull of the story. The lack of parental figures in the remake gives the story a more melancholy feel but at the expense of limiting Owen's believability as a child. The bullying in the remake is harder, more violent and mean-spirited. This should make for a more satisfying conclusion, but instead makes the bullies into caricatures. The father/protector's role in the remake is more clearly defined, and his actions are more plausible, but the original performance by Per Ragnar is more poignant, a tragic mess of bad choices and regret whose sole purpose in life is to sustain Eli's existence. Sidenote: the one thing which I noticed more than anything is how Tomas Alfredson chose to focus on the characters' eyes and their observations of the world. Eli and Oskar's eyes are constantly in frame (especially true of Lina Leandersson, whose hauntingly big eyes portray so much sadness and a hard edge suggesting her character's true age). I don't know if this is what affected my enjoyment of the original over the remake, but it was something I definitely noticed.</fullReview>

Both were great movies and in both films both young actors were great I mean great. But for you fans out there who saw both I have something in the film I want to throw at you guys. Okay in let the right one in the boy oskar is with eli the young vampire and she walks in after he invites her in then suddenly she's doing something the suddenly blood comes out of her skin my god I said, then oskar says stop then eli says scared little girl that's the first words I heard you say inside. This was also done i let me in but with cg effects. I lost What was her purpose? If I was Oskar I would have fainted by then. Now in let me in there is also a scene in which abby covered in blood embraces Owen and says thank you. Now I don't know about you but the smell of her must be very interesting. But in my opinion Let the right one in was more believable specially that scene between oskar and eli my good it looked real specially when it's on blueray on my Plasma TV. Let me in was okay in fact it was a down right copy. How many people took notice in those two scenes in both movies?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book and watched the original movie, and I was quite excited to watch this remake, specially when Matt Reeves claimed he would in fact re-adapt the story from the book.Mr. Reeves had a wonderful cast, but his would-be-new-adaptation is a flat remake. His contribution to the story is making it superficial. The cinematography is great, but Mr. Reeves failed miserably as a storyteller. He would better use the script from the Swedish adaptation.He simply changed aspects of some characters and made the whole tale shallow, exactly the opposite from the book, where the characters are absolutely rich, and from the original movie, which was able to keep the depth and overall content even with the approximately same running time.Wanna know what you missed? Watch the original movie. Want more? Read the book. Now you can imagine the spectacular contribution Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee (and Richard Jenkins!!) could have done to this amazing story.Mr. Reeves was not unfair to the story only. His movie is unfair to the Cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the Right One Back In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hammer Film Productions' return to cinemas after more than thirty years was especially surprising and unnecessarily difficult. They chose to reintroduce the brand by remaking the great Swedish vampire film Let The Right One In. The choice, from a historical perspective, isn't unusual. Vampires have enjoyed a surge of popularity they haven't experienced since Hammer pumped out its own films its first life. What the company failed to do was realize the special fondness the original's fans have for it. Not since The Silence of the Lambs was there a horror film so recognized by film critics and those who saw it as capable of making a statement about what it means to be human. The film is a calculated discussion on why people (or former people) are lonely and what, if anything, they can do to find some company.A large part of the outrage surrounding the English-language adaptation of John Lindqvist's novel originates from the latent desire many horror fans feel about their genre not having the same respect as others. Lindqvist wrote the screenplay for the first movie, which means the film's tangential treatment of the novel's secondary characters is his manifestation of the translation from book to screen. There was no need for another film, or at least not one as insipidly similar to its parent as is Let Me In. Great films of other genres are rarely, if ever, remade. If Hammer were as respectful of the Swedish film as the interviews read, they would have purchased the rights to Lindqvist's other novels. He has a few that haven't been translated into English. Instead, they produced a new version of the same story that was filmed just two years ago.The story is relocated from Stockholm to New Mexico, where it's always snowy. The camera focuses on several iconography of U.S. culture: dollar bills, the pledge of allegiance, and flags. Just in case you forgot, this movie takes place in New Mexico, which is part of the United States. This is almost Hammer's admission that the film isn't mainstream enough to work for typical movie-goers.And it isn't. As the story unfolds, the little boy character Owen, meets and befriends a young vampire entity by the name of Abby and asks if they can "go steady." Abby appears to be feminine, although the character prefers to identify as genderless. Abby says, "Would you like me even if I wasn't a girl?" This struck the funny bones of several people at the screening I attended.Abby is still a vampire child that travels with a companion who provides her (his) meals. Abby meets Owen at an apartment complex playground and helps him overcome his anxiety about being bullied at school. Owen falls in love and continues to hang out with Abby even after he learns his (her) secret. The two skip town after Abby murders Owen's bullies.The success of the first movie was a culmination of several thematic techniques and careful direction. Even the title is a reference to the central idea of loneliness. The score is quite and foreboding at first. String instruments accompany piano arrangements to invoke isolated terror. As vampire and child come to terms with their affections for one another, only soft touches of the piano are heard. The film's later tenderness is manifest when the child is rescued by the vampire. His head is forced underwater by bullies. The camera is focused on his face. In the background, we hear the vampire approach and see a head sink behind the boy.The new version lacks these elements, which prevent it from being a great film. The score follows a typical tension-building setup and memorable shots like the underwater one aren't there. The vampire was made to look more violent than in the original. It isn't horrible but its goodness is entirely plagiarized.Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Alternative To 'Twilight'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're one of those savvy,with it,young folk who prefer more esoteric film fare to the dreck that pollutes the local cineplexes, then,by gum, 'Let One In' will scratch that itch for you. It's obvious that this film is being released in the U.S. to try &amp; attract the same crowd that is currently packing the cinemas for 'Twilight' (i.e. the giggly 12-year old girls who haven't gotten away from the cookie cutter mindset). 'Let One In',is a savvy new film rip off from Sweden that focuses on a lonely 12 year old boy,who is being bullied in the middle school that he attends. The lack of friends doesn't help matters either. He meets a mysterious young girl who has moved in next door with her strange Father,who is obviously up to no good at night. When he discovers that she is a Vampire,the friendship gets downright weird. Random murders happen,people are attacked by cats,and other strange things (I won't ruin it for you by detailing exactly what). Passed with an 'PG' rating by the MPAA, this film serves up some bloody violence (mostly off screen,as graphic violence is banned in Sweden---remember, this is the same country that outright banned 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial' in 1981 for it's (so called) "Romantic" depiction of violence),language &amp; brief nudity,which probably means that some cinemas that opt to screen this film will probably discourage anybody under 17,unless they bring a parent/older sibling/etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Expected, the American Version Lacks Subtlety</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let Me In" is the American version of an acclaimed Swedish film entitled "Let the Right One In." The setting is transported from Sweden to Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the characters all become Americans. The story is the same, of course. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a lonely 12- year old boy, is constantly picked on by bullies in school. He strikes a friendship with his similarly lonely new neighbor, a strange 12-year old girl named Abby (Chloe Moretz), who does not wear shoes in the snow and loves puzzles. As their friendship develops, a series of unexplained bloody murders were taking place in the neighborhood. To tell you more will be spoiling the story for those who have not seen the original film.As I have also seen the original Swedish version, I could not help but compare the two. All the salient points of the story are there. The suspenseful story-telling was still evident even if I already knew what was going to happen. The actors who played the two kids were very effective in essaying their parts in both movies. The main differences lie in the direction and treatment of the scenes and the characterization. The Swedish film was much colder and relentlessly bleak. The American version is predictably more noisy and garish in production value. While the Swedish film shows Oskar and Eli as friends, the American version pushes it further to budding romantic love between Owen and Abby. (This is not necessarily a bad thing, though). The American version uses some terrible CG effects to emphasize evil (you'll know what I mean when you see it), while things were simpler and suggestive (rather than blatant) in the Swedish version.I think you can watch either film if you want to see this unconventional story unfold. You now have a choice of either subtle or direct styles of exposition. Or like me, you can watch and enjoy both, as they are both watchable (if you enjoy this genre of film) in their own ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read another review about it being a "breath of fresh air" whereby the film didn't romanticize the vampire. I was looking forward to that, but what I got was a PG version of a horror film that even my 14 yr old thought was boring. With the facade of a little girl so wonderfully portrayed, they had an incredible opportunity for thrills and chills but what you got were watered down scenes and lackluster suspense. The character with the most depth was Dylan Minnette (bully Kenny) but the director completely ignored the conflict of this character and let him fade into the background. If Owen had had the same depth, then you might have had a fighting chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As subtle as a brick to the head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing Let Me In, I fell in love with Let the Right One In but went to the screening with an open mind. I think both kids in Let Me In did a very good job with the script they were given but, ultimately I didn't feel same bond and empathy with Abby and Owen as I did for Oskar and Eli. Because of the subtlety of the writing and directing, the actors in Let The Right One In were able to give, what I felt were, real and nuanced performances. The relationship in Let the Right One In was sweet whereas Let Me In tried to be but seemed more strained and creepy.The subtlety in question, or lack thereof, also carried over to both the Abby/Eli transformations as well as how they fed. Eli seemed remorseful that she needed to kill to live whereas Abby seemed unapologetically predatory and animalistic. It didn't help that Let Me In went with the more radical vampire transformation rather than, again, the subtlety of Let the Right One In. I suppose it's associated with Hammer so they felt they had to.If you are a fan of Let The Right One In I think you owe it to yourself to see the remake to compare for yourself. I would also recommend reading the book to see which of them appeared to capture the spirit of the relationship better. I, personally, believe Let the Right One In more closely displayed the love and connection in Oskar and Eli's relationship.I believe Let Me In is a good vampire movie but it is no where near the classic that Let The Right One In is primarily because its subtlety allows you to connect better with Eli and Oskar; not so much with Abby and Owen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though "Let Me In" is an enjoyably eerie little film made with some finesse, which causes it to border on art house fare, its problems with premise and plot are so severe that only a moment's thought, during or after viewing, is enough to expose the entire edifice as faulty from concept to execution. (To demonstrate this, however, requires giving the whole story away. So read no further if that isn't what you want.)Here we have a vampire girl, Abby, who has been twelve "for a very long time," living with her guardian, who we at first think is her father but later learn is her previous twelve-year-old boyfriend grown old. He is a non-vampire, tired of the nightly grind of killing for her, who finally fails in that task and is replaced by a new twelve-year-old boyfriend, the protagonist Owen.Although we primarily follow the troubles of schoolboy Owen, the product of a broken home, as he is too easily preyed upon by bullies and ultimately rescued by Abby, we don't find enough there to make us believe he has it within him to, in the end, run away from home and take up the life of a serial killer so as to keep his preteen crush, Abby, fed.And what did Abby's previous serial-killer feeder do for a living so the rent could be paid? What will twelve-year-old Owen do for a living as her new feeder and primary contact with the outside world? How many ordinary and socially-connected people can this pair of drifters murder and drain of blood, night after night, without ever getting caught? Even with a few missed meals, that's hundreds of victims per year. Does this girl really drink over a gallon of blood every night? If she's truly older than twelve, why isn't she more worldly wise? (Even watching one channel of nighttime television would give her more cultural literacy than she displays in this film.) Beyond getting her nightly feedings and playing with puzzles, what sort of life does such a recluse have that would make her want to go on living? And what sort of life does her feeder have--keeping the little monster satisfied--that would keep him at it? Finally, she is just too easy to kill: sunlight will burn her right up. Which means, during daylight, she's always at the complete mercy of the loyalty of her feeder, who at any time could rip open the window covers and roast her to cinders. So why was she abusive to her older feeder and why was he loyal to the end when he always had such an easy way out--especially for a guy grown so used to killing, and so weary of it? One could go on. But it should be clear that nothing in this film works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earnest, yet incredibly mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Let Me In was difficult, because I wanted to be as objective as possible about the film as it stands alone, yet the comparisons to the stellar Let The Right One In are inevitable. In every way I can think of, this film comes up short in that comparison. But that doesn't mean this film is necessarily bad. It is, however, not great.The thing about it that I really don't understand is why Matt Reeves wanted to remake it at all. I cannot think of what the audience for this film possibly is. People who are watching it simply because they liked LROI (where I fall) will be intrigued but likely disappointed, and people who responded to the completely misleading advertising for it will almost undoubtedly experience a range of emotion somewhere between disappointed and furious. The story is slow, its about loneliness and friendship and coming of age in a soft, touching, weird (and even violent) sort of way. It's really a simple character study and, at least in today's zeitgeist, is the antithesis of typical 'scary' movies like saw or Halloween. If I had to pick only one word to describe it, it would be 'subtle'. And Let Me In is anything but subtle, which is why it just completely doesn't work.One of the most atrocious examples of this lack of subtlety and what made me want to bang my head against the chair by the end of the film was the absolutely HORRIBLE score. Honestly, it alone was more than capable of making sure I would never watch this film again. Michael Giacchino apparently wrote the score for LOST which I rarely watched, though I've heard it was very fitting. Here, its like being hit over the head with a hammer while someone tells you its a wet noodle. To be completely fair, in some of its softer moments it feels appropriate but they are far and few between. Its ironic then that LROI barely had much of a score at all, which worked fantastically.The kids do alright here, in what are really pretty challenging roles. Chloe to me (especially at the start of the film) felt like she was forcing it a bit. I felt myself watching her act, instead of really believing her performance. Again, it really does illustrate just how fantastic the child actors were in LROI.The film looks great, some fairly cheesy CGI aside. The hospital scene also looked a bit more campy than anything, and the choice to really go all out with Abby's vampirism felt a little jarring and again not super appropriate to the story, but its a choice that really doesn't make much difference.Ultimately, while Matt Reeves obviously was trying to stay close to the tone and feel of the source material, and I commend this effort (less the awful score), this film was disappointing, and while I fully admit that I possess some biases that simply cannot be fully overcome, I would be surprised if the average film goer felt any different. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtlety is not in Reeves Vocabulary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just gotten back from viewing this movie. I, like many other fans of the amazing original let the right one in was not pleased with the news of the remake, less then three years after the original one came out. Did reeves do a good job in preserving the original? did he adapt the novel instead of the movie like he promised the author?...well no.the movie opens the Eli's (abby)caregiver (Haken) was sent to the hospital after pouring acid on his face. Over this, we hear a soundtrack sounded a little too familiar with the original soundtrack. the cop character that was in the book but not the original movie came in and quoted one line from the book...and thats about the only thing Reeves added in the movie from the book that wasn't in the original. the rest are either shot for shot images from the movie or scenes that aren't from either book or original. now of course just because it's not copying from both book or movie doesn't entirely mean it can be bad. but it takes a good director to make it good (carpenter the thing...) This is where the subtlety comes in. What i loved about the original movie and book was that there was no defining moment, it kept making you think, there was no distinction between good and evil. Osker (owen)'s tormentors were like any other bully we dealt with in school, these new kids are on borderline homicidal. in the movie, there was a line from romero and juliet, in this movie, we get the kids watching a scene from a movie of romero and juliet, osker is shown reading the book for school, and this is mentioned three other times. Eli attacking became hilarious in this. in the book and movie she attacked with little fighting involved. now we get a horrible cgi eli (we see cgi eli about 3 other times) climbing all over people like a freakin monkey. Eli's appearance is over the top too, in the movie and book, she changed slightly with brighter eyes and sunken cheeks. Now her eyes are giant, bright white, she has moles all over her face, and her teeth are rotten and voice becomes overly manly where it's just funny. Victoria's hospital death in this starts where shes drinking her own blood, the blood is everywhere but the nurse doesn't seem to notice and simply opens the blind where she and victoria are consumed by the flame. the pool scene is still shown underwater we see heads dropping into the water blood everywhere, eli literally flying over the surface, dragging two kids with her, the bodies drop in and it again becomes more funny then dramatic even the music is over the top. in the original movie, we had a simple soundtrack that set the mood nicely, now it's the equivalent of a techno junkie remixing a simple rock song and filled it with complicated keyboard sweeps and record scratching, only in hear we have a choir roaring into the microphones destroying what tension was building.this is obviously a fan rant, but even so the movie tried to be better then the original but used over the top methods that reminiscent Reeve's cloverfield. and all in all did not work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the point of this remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see the point of this film existing. The original Swedish movie is a masterpiece. This is average, and almost scene by scene the same. But, hold it.... would I be saying this if I had not seen the original? Interesting. I cant answer that perfectly, but I can give a rough answer. Well, in the original, the casting and acting was sublime and the characters were developed more all round, especially the secondary characters. In this remake two secondary characters are given any development - the detective and the father. In the original there is way more chemistry between the two main characters. The direction is better in the original, as is the cinematography. When I heard about a 'Hollywood remake' I thought "Ahh, we will now et to see what happens above the water while our protagonist is being bullied in the pool". I thought this because perhaps more money would be thrown at a Hollywood remake. But no, we see no flying beheading 12 year old vampire doing anything. So what was the point of this? All I can think of is that they needed an American accent version. Or perhaps they were jealous of the Swedish? Ahh, I get it now, they are trying to make some money! So of course, what mass of warm blooded Americans would be caught viewing a foreign accent film. Not so many. So, they needed to remake it for the USA audience. Well, fine plan, but the movie just ain't that great. Looks like they failed on all counts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the rising tide of vampire-mania these days it's easy to cash in, and easier to become irritated by those doing the cashing, but if you're like most people you just want to see a good and interesting movie and don't really care about whose vampire lore is more accurate. Let Me In is an American version of a Swedish movie, based on a book, and in some strange way it is an original story. It's about love, death and life and stands unique among other vampire stories of the same ilk. However, the problem I had with this is not the story, but the fact that the story has already been told. Remaking movies is no sin to me, but when I've seen and enjoyed the original made only two years ago, I'm helpless but to feel that I've read the same book twice, paraphrased on different paper and there is no new revelations to behold. Regardless of the intentions of those who remade this, it really wasn't necessary, and while I give it a 5/10 on its own merits, I can't help but realize that the original film highlights why I'm not especially into this one. There were a few unnecessary vulgarities in this version that made Owen seem far more warped and thus harder to sympathize with, Chloe Moretz is a competent actress but Abby's lapses between sickly and bored little girl to demon-possessed orangutan simply cannot compare to Lina Leandersson's versatility playing both a sweet girl and a desperate creature in the original. The special effects were very good, but while the Swedish version tempered the violence and gore with a cold atmosphere of sterility, the American version embraces it's penchant for slasher tones and it becomes even harder to feel anything for any of the characters. Whether or not you will enjoy this movie is really all about your bias, since everyone has one. If you like the original, there's a 50/50 chance you'll like this one too since there isn't too much different about it. If you're a fan of the horror genre you'll like it, if you're a Twilight fan you probably won't, and if you like anything vampire then you already know the answer. Give it a shot; it couldn't hurt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was a hauntingly beautiful film, has been remade as a trashy, junk-food movie for American audiences.It seems that 'Let Me In' (even the title was dumbed down for Hollywoodland), was made with neither heart nor soul, but with a calculator and an accountant. Everything feels forced and poorly imitated. There is no place in Americadisneyland that can even come close to the darkness of Northern Scandinavia.Those who see this watered-down lite version of 'Let the Right One In' are actually lucky - for they will still have the joy of discovering the original.A poor imitation of a masterpiece - kind of like a black and white photocopy of the Mona Lisa.Shame I can't give it zero stars.</fullReview>

Not that that's saying much, I've only seen like 20 movies that have been released in 2010, I really have only seen "the better" films this year, except this crap.The boy actor is just weird as hell, he looks weird, and he acts weird. Hell, there's a scene were he is stabbing a tree! Serial killer in training.But the reason he is crazy is because he is constantly bullied by average teenagers. They didn't even make an effort to make the bullies any different from every bully you've ever seen in a movie. It's like a kid being bullied by caricatures of bullies.But he meets this vampire chick who ultimately teaches him to stand up for himself. (Never seen that before)And after about three unneeded sexual scenes (by 12 year-old kids), the movie finally hits it's climax.The movie is only an hour and 56 minutes and feels like 3 hours. I could never watch this movie again.The only good part about it was the scenes were the vampire girl and her dad(?) go out and kill people for blood. And the ending. That was kick-ass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director said he was doing his take on the book and not do a remake of the movie. This movie looks like it was made by someone who just watched the original movie and wrote a script based on that. The more disturbing themes from the book that was toned down in the original movie( such as homosexuality and pedophilia) has been removed completely. The ending is an obvious misinterpretation of the original movie. Owen/Oskar was never meant to be a new Protector/H?kan. Abby/Eli never cared for him. He/She was just using him, like Dracula used Renfield.The Virgina-character has very little importance to the plot and unlike in the original we don't get a chance to care for her or her boyfriend Larry/Lacke. The almost complete removal of Larry/Lacke from the plot weakens the movie, in the the original he was a man who lost his best friend (who was not in this version at all) and lover to Abby/Eli. We can understand why he tries to kill Abby/Eli and he has the right to do so. This movie only makes Abby/Eli a victim, and when she kills the police officer we don't have the same mixed feelings we have in the original.Also, the removal of Virgina's death wish when realizing what she has become makes the movie even weaker. Most of the characters have been stolen of their importance and leaves big holes in the movie like a sinking ship. The change to make Abby/Eli a girl instead of a castrated boy is not a to big issue, but the movie douse not take the chance to use the original origin story from the book and uses an original( douse all American vampires come from the deep south?),Hollywood, stop stealing ideas from us Swedes and do remakes, why not stopping remaking everything! . You have taken Let the Right One In from us and you are working on The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. At least we still have The Seventh Seal.</fullReview>

The car looks like it could be a luxury car at first glance, because it has the individual pieces of luxury car parts. But then, you notice that it is only on the surface...you see that the car has chrome grills and trimmings and perhaps some important looking vents which presumably serve a serious function. Then you drive past the car and realize that the vents are just for decoration and serves no function, or the grills are kinda ugly and overdone...you realize that it's a Hyundai and not a real Lexus, Acura, BMW etc.This movie is like that. It was a big let down. It took a great story, masterfully executed original film and cut out all the stuff that made it great...choosing to leave only the obvious parts of the movie. The final effect is a movie which feels choppy, forced, predictably paced and where no characters really make you empathize with them.The original version leaves you feeling sorry for the Vampire and child. This one leaves you not really caring for anyone at all. In this regard, it was an utter failure. Too bad, because I am a fan of the main female star of the movie. She is a stellar actor and did a wonderful job in KickAss and she did quite well in this one too, but the chopped up script did not make full use of her talent here. I recommend you pass on this one. Stick with the original version. It is much more sublime and enjoyable to experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to go see Let Me In, I have to admit I was really excited, having seen Chloe Moretz in Kick-Ass earlier in the year, I was looking for outstanding performances. I know Let Me In is in a whole different genre; a horror thriller, well not so much horror but lots of tension...I will repeat LOTS of tension. Too much. From the very beginning with the shot of New Mexico in the snow we a get a very long look at the vistas across the mountains, I waiting for the next shot to come, eventually we get another then another, if this is trying to build up tension we are hardly ever relieved, it gets very boring and slow. The soundtrack is heavily used for tension, yes we get those annoying repetitive high pitched screechy sounds and thumping noises throughout especially when something scary is about to happen. *rolls eyes*The characters were all very dull, reserved and uninteresting for me to care, no characters hardly ever spoke! I was annoyed at how the preteen 12 year olds had enough angst to give Kurt Cobain a run for his money.The bullying scenes go a bit too far and I felt they were trying too hard to shock me when really I couldn't give a flying monkeys. And as for the whole set in the eighties theme, we get... pacman and guess what... a rubix cube!!!! How predictable, but what ruined this was plonking in Justin Beiber lookalike who played the main bully. Argh.Not enough vampire, too much angst, boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you have already seen Let the Right One In there is very little reason to endure this pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 2008 Swedish vampire film, Let the Right One In. This version is set in 1983 in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The film opens with a policeman (Elias Koteas) visiting a patient in a hospital who has been brought in with severe burns. The scene ends with the patient throwing themselves out of the window. The film backtracks to two weeks earlier where Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is being bullied and tormented at school. He is much younger and smaller than the other children and he is reluctant to fight back. He lives at in a snow-covered apartment block with his only his mother, as his parents have separated. When playing out in the snow one evening, he meets a mysterious girl named Abby (Chloe Moretz) who has moved in with her father (Richard Jenkins). Abby and her father's arrival coincide with a series of gruesome murders across the town. Owen finds Abby to be a curious girl, particular when she says it would be best if they weren't friends, but they gradually work towards a tentative friendship together. Let the Right One In (L?t den rätte komma in) was a mesmerising and quietly haunting film that benefited from a unique setting and a touching original story of friendship between two loners. Director Matt Reeves, whose last film was Cloverfield (2008), has competently placed the story into an American context but it offers few surprises for anyone who has seen the superior original film. There have been just a few scenes that have been slightly altered or omitted altogether and as such, the majority of the story is exactly the same. The new context brings little to the narrative besides some scarce 80s references and transparent contrasts between the vampires and the strict religious beliefs of Owens's mother. There are a few more instances where Abby's gender comes into question but it is handled in a far more obvious and less confronting manner than the first film. For those who have seen the original, the uncertainty and unpredictability has been lost here. For those who have not seen Tomas Alfredson's work, it will be far cheaper to rent than paying to see Let Me In. Although it covers much of the same territory, Let Me In is at least competently made in terms of aesthetics. The film is told with suitable intensity because of the persistently brooding score and the gloomy cinematography. Yet there is also regrettably more blood in this version, leading to some needlessly brutal and surprisingly upsetting deaths. While the film is effective in building the tension in the early scenes, it lacks the restraint and the transcendent beauty of the Swedish film. The original's sense of isolation, through its eerie silences and icy landscapes, is missing. The decision to show Abby's face as a vicious monster and have her snap the neck of her victim after she has collected the blood is a curious decision as well. It diminishes the rather poignant idea of finding humanity even in the most distant beings. In having to cater his film for a mainstream audience, Reeves has missed some of the most crucial essences of the original film. Easily the most pleasing asset of the film is the performance of Kodi Smit-McPhee. Although he is a very young performer he has shown great maturity already in films like The Road (2009). Here he is exceptional as the tormented Owen because he inhabits the film so naturally with his minor stature and his feel for his character's vulnerability amongst his peers. He is going to have an incredibly rich career ahead of him. Chloe Moretz is fine too. She holds a holds a quiet intensity as Abby, even if she is does not quite possess the ghost-like quality of her Swedish counterpart. It is surprising how obvious some of the visual effects used on her character are though, particular when running up a tree to escape. Disappointingly, the adult characters are underused here. Richard Jenkins has a creepy presence but he has minimal time on screen and very few lines too. Elias Koteas has a very standard role as a cop here, who isn't even given a name. It's a very superfluous addition that adds almost nothing to the story.If you have already seen Let the Right One In there is very little reason to endure this pointless remake. Not only has it been made too soon after the original, it offers very few new additions to the narrative as well, reducing the surprises and the spontaneity that were found in the original. Those who have not seen the Swedish version but are interested in this film should rent the original instead because it will be cheaper and because it is a magnificent film in its own right. This film is slickly made but it lacks the delicacy of Alfredson's work and it is certainly not for the squeamish. Kodi Smit-McPhee is very good here but even his fine performance still makes this a tough sell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bored Me To Tears. Where Are All These Great Reviews Coming From???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I headed to the theater to see this movie, I was actually excited. A friend of mine had described it to me, and I thought it sounded great. Boy, talk about a let-down! I sat there, thinking to myself, "when's it going to get interesting?" An hour and a half later, the movie was over and it NEVER GOT INTERESTING!!! When Abby attacked the jogger, and again when Virginia woke up in the hospital and it was revealed that she had been "turned", I thought to myself, "hey, now maybe it'll get going!" But no. Abby killed the man and that was the end of the "horror". They killed Virginia off within 5 minutes and went back to the whole "poor bullied boy, poor blood-sucking fiend girl" crap. Honestly, the entire movie was like pulling teeth. Granted, the performances by the kids were done reasonably well - they portrayed angst and loneliness quite competently, all things considered - but I was still bored out of my mind. If I wanted to watch love-struck teens, I would've stayed home and watched Romeo + Juliet. If I wanted to watch miserable, doomed-from-the-start vampire lovers, I would've stayed home and watched Twilight. Total waste of money, in my opinion.Oh, and the CGI!!! It was total CRAP. Like, from 10 years ago crap. Compare it to LOTR or Avatar - there IS no comparison.I gave the movie 2 stars, and that only for the sake of the kids' acting. The rest of it was a total bust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me Out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let Me In" is a very unique film in its genre and is not a typical horror movie. It is an American remake of the Swedish film, "Let the Right One In ("L?t Den Rätte Komma In")," that was released in 2008 and was based on the 2004 novel with the same name. The story revolves around the depiction of the depression of its main character Owen (Kodi Smith McPhee) and the constant abuse he takes from his classmates. He has very poor living conditions and lives in a broken home in which his parents are in the middle of getting divorced. He is a very mysterious, lost and misguided character who has nothing to look forward to on a daily basis except a small piece of candy here and there. His entire life changes when he meets the new girl in his building Abby (Chloë Grace Moretz) and her nameless father character (Richard Jenkins). A forbidden young love forms between the two that is tested by a secret Abby and her father figure have. The Good: This film rides on the performance of Cholë Grace Moretz ("500 Days of Summer", "Kick Ass", Diary of a Wimpy Kid) in her first leading role as an actress. A lot of times when a young actress decides to do a horror film it does not turn out very well and can ruin an actress's reputation. However, Moretz owns the role of Abby and proves that she has a stake in the future of Hollywood and the future of leading ladies. The acting of Kodi Smith McPhee is also above average and the character he creates is really creepy. Together they own the screen and try to save the dry plot of the film. Also, the film does not rely on making the audience jump in order to scare the audience. The horror is created through bloody moments and the creepiness of both of the main characters Owen (McPhee) and Abby (Moretz).The Bad: The film does not progress forward at all and seems to move backwards at times (sometimes literally even happens literally). This causes the plot to be very lackluster and boring. There are numerous plot holes in the film that do not make sense and do not fit together. This includes the development of certain scenes that seem really important and then are forgotten about in the whole scheme of the film. The film cannot be taken seriously because it fails to make the audience feel the depression that Owen is going through. Therefore, the audience is not able to sympathize with Owen. The film also wastes the acting talents of Richard Jenkins by having his character say very few sentences or even words. Any other actor could have played his character and he would have had the same effectiveness to the story. Also, beware of various awkward and disturbing scenes that even border on inappropriate images of children.Final Thought: "Let Me In" is a very forgettable film that lacks the continuity necessary to create a good overall story. The performances of the two young actors in the film are very good, but with a spicy and boring plot do not amount to anything except making the audience to think to themselves, "Let me out!" IF you want to avoid feeling this way I recommend skipping this movie, therefore Don't See It!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the scariest thing about this film is how HORRIBLE it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply cannot believe the positive reviews posted up here regarding this film. It is painfully discouraging to me regarding the average American film goer - that this film has passed as even watchable. I saw this film last night and found it almost impossible to sit through. Everything I loved about the original had been dumbed down to the point of laughable and stripped of all its beauty- in true Hollywood fashion. The fact that Matt Reeves was able to get such flatlined and boring performances out of two fairly talented young actors is really a feat in and of itself. Cue the heavy handed and relentless score to attempt to indicate what the actors should be showing sans any score at all - and I'm dying from boredom. Amazing.Reeves proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he missed the point of first film and the book entirely, attempting to play up Chloe Moretz as the new exorcist girl - which is just ridiculous and predictable and totally superfluous to what actually matters. Go for the effects, dumb it down, and spell it out. Pathetic. Disgusting. Matt Reeves manages to display pretty much everything that is wrong with Hollywood film making today in this tiny microcosm of a movie. Having now seen this I just can't wrap my head around this question: Why??? Why bother doing a remake if you are going to butcher the original so horrendously? If you can't make it better, or at least add to it, then don't make it at all - eh, Matt? Seriously, step aside and stay out of it. Thats your obligation to society now - as far as I see it. If you can't contribute then get out. Every choice made in this film was utterly predictable and disappointing. Beginning with the casting. The two kids from the original film simply cannot be touched - and you should have known that from the start. And knowing that, you could have tried to help your actors out a little bit but you didn't, you left them dangling out there in the breeze with nothing but their own asses on the line and then you abandoned them as director to let them hang themselves. This film was crime against art as compared to the first film. I'm sorry, but you should be ashamed or yourself, Mr. Reeves. Although, I'm sure you won't be because you'd have to understand it first, before you could be, which you obviously don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the cinematography was all right - the acting good enough - but the story was exceedingly boring and the pacing was whack. Everything's on delay - you sit there, looking at the door or whatever, knowing what's behind it and what will happen, more or less. You know everything that's gonna happen, just not the exact instant or how much gore they'll manage next time. So you just wish they'd get on with the thing.The only character development is the kiddies, and even with them, it's predictable and there's not much to write home about - and the bullies are cartoon character serial killers. Just a really stupid, boring movie, imo.</fullReview>
