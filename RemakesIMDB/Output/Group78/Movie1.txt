		<fullReview>One question that always pop in my mind whenever Hollywood tries to remake a foreign film that was successful is: Why? In most cases, the end result is disastrous; it never compares with the original movie and why spend money in something that has already been done, better.The movie in question here is the Argentine surprise film of last year, "9 Queens". In it, Fabian Belinsky, its director, was able to give us an original story, a caper, that was well executed and brilliantly acted; it was a pleasure to watch.Not to put this movie down, but it suffers in comparison. Gregory Jacobs, the director, has adapted the story to present day Los Angeles and the story hasn't changed at all. The memory of the other movie was still vivid in our minds, so there was no surprise with this one.The acting is good in general. John C. Reilly makes the con man Richard Gaddis perfectly slimy. Diego Luna brings a nice balance to his role, and Maggie Gillenhaal is excellent as the long suffering sister.If you haven't seen the original, this version works fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gem: John C. Reilly, Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal were never better together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lovers of the grifter genre - you will love this one most of all. It earns a 9 out of 10 from yours truly. Sincerely. Sure, I'm biased for the genre.But this one has the style of a low budget 'Sting' with a story line on par with Steve Martin's 'The Spanish Prisoner'. Grifter movies rely on competent, likable con men and women, gullible marks and a logical plot. The audience can be(come) the mark, as can the cons themselves. That's why this genre yanks me in ? and why it entertains so well. I am (you are) the detective. Figure out what's going on before they tell you: That's the ame. I'm a cynic by nature and I'm always equal to the task.Now this one - I couldn't figure it all out before they revealed it. What they reveal is worth the wait and meandering through the story. I doubt you'll piece it all together either. Therein lies how it earned its 9.The plot works. Oh . . . and "Cut to the chase' will never be the same after you see how "Criminal" cuts to it. It's brilliant and timed with perfection. It's something you'd expect from the likes of Spike Lee.Sorry to be oblique here; but if I tell you any more, the ending would be exposed. The last two minutes tell all - and the first 85 are every bit as entertaining and important. John C. Reilly, Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal are worth the admission price. Superb, all! See it. Tonight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK Americanization Into a Contemporary "The Sting"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Criminal" is an adequate Americanization of one of my favorite films of 2002, the delightfully twisty "Nine Queens (Nueve Reinas)." Adapter/debut director Gregory Jacobs doesn't quite make up for the extra tension that Argentina's financial chaos added as an urgent back drop. Some of the twists are too smoothly straightened out by focusing more on the older con man, here played by John C. Reilly, and his sister, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal without the original's sensuality, despite her low cut blouse. Diego Luna is a mite young, but he's cast to turn Reilly's character into more of a manipulative mentor and less an apparent partner.On its own, without comparison to the original, it's an amusing and workmanlike update of "The Sting" crossed with "The Grifters."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indelible -- a movie I shall never forget, and pleased not to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just went recently to the Austin Premiere of this flick (which is actually the second showing -- I guess the first premiere must have been in LA).I expected to see an "okay" film, but what I got to see was really something special! I don't know if I ever saw John G. Reilly as a lead character before (if you don't know his name, you will recognize him from many movies you have seen), and he was awesome! One of those guys who is so ugly that he is adorable. (How many guys can pull that one off?!) But what makes him adorable is not his looks; rather, his acting and flawless timing. This movie had me cracking up so many times from when Reilly delivered his lines straight-faced, playing Richard Gaddis, the "I-don't-give-a-rat's-ass-about-anybody-but-myself swindler" whose only redeeming virtue was his choice to do all his dirty dealings without any violence involved 99% of the time. I swear it made me embarrassed sometimes how loudly I found myself laughing in public when he delivered some of those priceless lines. I wish I could remember a funny one verbatim, but can't, so won't spoil it my misquoting. One funny line that didn't make me laugh out loud but I still remember as a great line was when asked by Diego Luna's character Rodrigo, "What's your sister like?" he responds with, "What's my sister like? She likes to give me s**t."What is Gaddis' sister like? Indeed. What a cool lady! So sexy, fascinating and unique. She has a walk that, as a woman myself, I'd give a million dollars to learn to imitate. I have to say she beat Mae West or any other screen star. I had not seen Maggie Gyllenhaal (Valeria Gaddis) in films before (sorry, I missed a lot of films in the past some years) but hear she has been around for a while. Now this is one sensual and mysterious mature woman who plays Gaddis' smart-as-a-whip sister who is very, very tired of her brother's B.S. (She is the Concierge at a very classy high-dollar hotel.)What can I say about Diego Luna? He had me at hello. Oh, to be young and in love. I can feel that way easily watching this very pretty and very excellent actor. I had not seen him before though he may have been well known to everyone but me. (Like I said, I haven't gotten out much, but I do consume hundreds of movies a year, I swear!) One line I remember where I really loved Diego's delivery was when Gaddis is telling someone they are conning that Rodrigo is Spanish. Rodrigo corrects him, "Mexican." The Moment was all there. What a jewel! And there are many, many jewels in this film. It is fast-moving, and if you like to think and figure out puzzles you will be a pig in mud; if you are like me, not so quick to figure it all out, it may take several viewings to catch on to every ruse, but that's so much of the fun of this movie -- and this movie is, indeed, FUN...!The first-time director, Gregory Jacobs, did a very fine job in my opinion. I personally would have enjoyed for the movie to go at a slower pace, but that's only because I'm a bit slow myself. (smile)The directing and acting were excellent, and I felt the chemistry was perfect for the story. This is a film I will enjoy seeing again and again. Great story, good acting -- and with actors that are so fun to look at. All three of the main characters (Reilly, Luna and Gyllenhaal) have faces one never gets tired of looking at.I'm giving it 9 stars only because it was too fast-paced to allow me to relax while enjoying this deeply enjoyable film. Highly recommended unless you are someone who just HAS to see gratuitous sex and violence in order to enjoy a film. For that you have to go elsewhere.WELL DONE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Bravo! for this California Transplant from Argentina!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of the many foreign film devotees who rank writer Fabián Bielinsky's 2000 film NUEVE REINAS from Argentina as one of the best caper films ever, I was completely satisfied with the 'American made version' CRIMINAL. Bielinsky co-wrote this screenplay with director Gregory Jacobs and the result is a terse, witty, fascinating, intelligent film that deserves 5 stars in every category.Transposing the story (which takes place in one day) to Los Angeles opens up even more avenues of social comment than the original. The use of the various areas of LA that span from the wealth of Beverly Hills to the grandeur of the downtown Biltmore Hotel to the scruffy East LA neighborhoods and other underbellies of Sun City truly match the flow of the story.Smarmy Richard Gaddis (John C. Reilly) is a small time crook who has experienced every aspect of con games. He dresses like a businessman, drives a Mercedes, and believes that if you're going to con the wealth out of money (which he does without conscience), you must look professional. He observes Rodrigo (Diego Luna) in a cafe doing some very minor con games and when Rodrigo is apparently 'caught', Richard acts the part of a vice officer and saves Rodrigo from being arrested. Here begins their partnership: Richard needs a sideman to assist in an important grifter scheme involving selling a valuable money bill (instead of the stamps with nine queens of the original); Rodrigo (who Richard re-names Brian to Anglicize him so he won't appear a Cholo) needs big money to pay off his father's gambling debt. Through a series of introductory can games they learn to 'trust' each other and the big game begins.The fast and furious process of the big grift flows with many incidents that are clever, convincingly intriguing, and introduces many characters in its path, each of whom plays a more major role than anyone would expect... Maggie Gylenhaal as Richard's sister Valerie (concierge at the Biltmore) is pulled in unwillingly only after she forces a 'truth session' involving Richard's cheating on their inheritance in front of their brother Michael (Jonathan Tucker), the original forger of the bill Ochoa (Zitto Kazaan), the hit who buys the bill Hannigan (Peter Muller), and all of the apparent bit people in the scheme are superb.Throughout the story Rodrigo/Brian is portrayed as warm, lovable smalltime beginner, though always ready with a clever intervention, and Richard is the know-it-all conflicted 'boss'. How this relationship mutates is just plain fine writing and acting and the ending of the film is a terrific surprise even to those who know NUEVE REINAS well! Reilly and Luna are perfect choices for these multifaceted roles. Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What's with the raped-virgin look?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Con-man Richard (John C. Reilly) enlists Mexican petty thief Rodrigo (Diego Luna) as his new temporary partner, and soon they are engaged in a huge scam involving counterfeit money, being helped along by Richard's skeptical sister Valerie (Maggie Gyllenhaal).In 'Criminal' you soon learn not to believe ANYTHING you see! It is an object lesson in distrust, but an engaging and wonderfully entertaining one. Who is going to f... whom over, that's what it is all about. Richard conned his two younger siblings out of their share of the inheritance after their mother, but he whines and bitches at every turn, and he proves himself to be both antisemitic and anti-black. When once again he has tried to cheat his new partner out of his cut, he exclaims, "What's with the raped-virgin look?". Richard is a terrible, terrible person, a thoroughly rotten apple who believes that "F...ing, that's when you're handcuffed on the pavement". Anything short of that he can deal with, squirming like a worm. Of his victims he says, "I don't feel anything for them. They're marks. Some of them are dumber than f ... pets!". John C. Reilly is very good in the part, although I found myself longing for just one other color on the palette, just some surprise, something not too predictable.He says to Rodrigo, "You got something that money and practice can't buy, you look like a nice guy", and Diego Luna (the 'other' guy from 'And You Mother Too', alongside Gabriel García Bernal) has a puppy-dog appeal that works like a charm. He has genuine, unforced charm and is cuddly at all times.Obviously, if you have watched 'The Sting' or films like the great French caper 'Les ripoux' ('My New Partner', 1984), 'Criminal' will offer you nothing new or sensational. It does have a really nice feel to it, though, taking its leisurely time to get rolling, enabling us to get to know these people. Or so we think ...7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Familiar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being quite fond of heist/sting/caper movies this looked like it was well worth a hire at the local DVD store when it came out.After about 5 minutes I was feeling very confused - I was sure had seen it before but it had only just been released. *light goes on over head* - This is very reminiscent of 9 Queens. Ten minutes later... *light goes on over head* - This is a Hollywood remake of 9 Queens. Maybe I'm the only person to watch the movie that didn't know it was remake.And that, as they say, is that. If you have already seen 9 Queens then this won't hold any surprises for you. The acting, directing etc. etc. are all fine but then again, it was all fine (if not excellent) in 9 Queens. If you haven't seen 9 Queens then watch that instead because it is better.It just makes me sad that when there are people struggling to get new interesting movies funded, that it is seen as more profitable to do a remake of a film that is only a few years old anyway. Of course we all know the reason for the remake; 9 Queens is not in English and requires that you read subtitles and the 15 to 25 year old American boys that are the prime target for this type of film can't read and chew popcorn at the same time.If this film had been an original I would be inclined to give it 7 or 8 stars but because the best part of it (the plot) is lifted (and in the final credits it acknowledges 9 Queens) and also because I am really annoyed by pointless remakes - (Don't even mention Nikita!!) I can only summon up 2 stars. What a pointless way to use a great cast and the film making talent that was evidently available for this piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really, really think that EVERYONE should see this film. It was one of the most entertaining films I've watched all year. In a world where only morbid/ depressing movies are considered excellent and plot less, big-budget films rule the box-office it is nice to see a smaller budget film that has fun with itself. The cast in this film is superb. Diego Luna especially gives a great performance. He is endearing, lovable, enthusiastic, and intelligent in his portrayal of "Brian." It was nice to see him in this context and I personally believe that he thrived in the part. He is an excellent actor and i have to admit that I am now a fan.I almost always guess the "surprise" ending in movies that claim to have one, but this film still has me wondering how i didn't get it. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!!!!!!!!!! I don't want to tell you the plot because I don't trust myself not to give anything away. If you enjoy caper/mystery/ entertaining movies go see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the film and loved it. The ending totally threw me. As I drove home I had to rethink the entire film. Every assumptions I had while watching it was wrong. It was a total surprize. Diego is soooo naturally talented; I hope the rest of the world discover him eventually. The rest of the cast was great too. I think the critics who didn't like it were wasting their times comparing it frame for frame with the original film. It would have been nice if they reviewed the film for the millions who've never heard of the original rather than for themselves. I have never seen Nine Queens and I'm glad I didn't because I probably would have been doing the same thing and ruined the experience. I didn't have any preconceived expectations and enjoyed it immensely. Can't wait to see what Diego does next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Worth Looking For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very nice film, devoted mainly to two central characters: Richard Gaddis (played by John C. Reilly) and Rodrigo (played by Diego Luna). The film traces a 24-hour period in which the two characters first meet, and subsequently have an opportunity to form partnership. Filmed on a shoestring budget, the movie had only limited released; however, I highly recommend viewing it on rental.Richard is a con-man in every sense of the word, he's not to be trusted; even his past partners have run the risk of being cheated by him. Rodrigo is a petty thief, and works the small con. Their paths converge when Rodrigo is caught trying to cheat waitresses out of change in a local casino in which Richard is also at. Richard, posing as a local police officer, steps in and takes Rodrigo under custody. Once outside the casino, Richard convinces Rodrigo into working with him.After a series of short cons, in an attempt to build trust and confidence in one another; Richard is contacted by his sister Valerie (played by Maggie Gyllenhaal) in regards to one of Richard's previous partners making contact with her (Valerie) at her job as concierge at the Biltmore Hotel. As it turns out, Richard and Rodrigo are placed into a situation with an opportunity to score the big con. It seems that Richard's former partner, Ochoa, was in the middle of a six-figured con when an impending heart attack struck him incapable of completing the transaction; he is no longer able to complete the deal. Furthermore, Ochoa's "pigeon" departs the U.S. in the next 24-hours due to his Visa expiration; therefore, Ochoa must rely on Richard to finish the con.What happens next are a sequence of events of "How not to orchestrate the big con", which includes losing the counterfeit item being used for the setup. Richard and Rodrigo are forced to rely on one another whole-heartedly in order to accomplish the final swindle, which included liquidating both their total assets to front the cash required for a duplicate counterfeit item.The film places you into mind to the con-man, and all the antics required to accomplish the long con. There are no high speed chases, or large scale pyrotechnic involved in this film; just plenty of dialogue and no stop conniving. With the added bonus of a plot twist ending, the film is quite entertaining.http://farisreel.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish crime-caper worth a look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After bearing witness to a lousy 'pull' in which wannabe con-artist Rodrigo (Diego Luna) gets busted trying to short-change a waitress, professional conman, Richard Gaddis (John C. Reilly) decides to give the boy a chance to work with an expert. Since his usual partner, 'the Jew', took off last week, Gaddis is in search of a new colleague, and agrees to give Rodrigo one day to hang out with him and see if the pairing works. Rodrigo is especially grateful for the opportunity, since he has been forced to become a criminal (temporarily, of course) to buy his father out of his gambling debts. After showing him a few impressive pulls, Gaddis summarizes that Rodrigo thinks too much, a quality that could work against him in a crisis situation. But just as Gaddis is about to cut Rodrigo off, he gets a call from his 'pain in the ass' sister, Valerie (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who tells him a man has showed up to the 4 star hotel where she works as concierge and demanded to see him. As it turns out this man, Ochoa (Zitto Kazann) has the perfect pull for Gaddis, involving a forged bank note and one very wealthy business man (Peter Mullan) who is willing to buy; but Ochoa needs the right man to make the six-figure deal. Now Gaddis needs Rodrigo to help him make this con, and also his sister who he is currently in a law-suit with?."Criminal" is a re-make of what I am told is a less than impressive Argentine film "Nine Queens". I haven't seen this original, but I can confirm that its remake, "Criminal" is an absolute gem. Following and keeping up with other con-man flicks such as "matchstick men" and "catch me if you can", "Criminal" is smart, sleek and classy. Director Gregory Jacobs has made a very clean, bold and stylish film; with some great cinematography and superb scene editing. John C. Reilly, who has primarily played supporting roles in some seriously prestigious films; Chicago, The Aviator, The Hours; finally gets a chance to show that he is leading-man material, and more than capable of holding his own. He can be powerful, funny and is extremely engaging. Diego Luna, who has so far had more success with his Spanish films such as the highly acclaimed "Y tu mamá también", and little success breaking into the American market with such duds as "Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights", "Open Range" and "The Terminal"; really finds his feet in 'Criminal'. He is funny, energetic and darn sexy in a role which really suits and that he makes the most of. Maggie Gyllenhaal, forever diverse, holds her own against the talented and impressive Reilly and Luna; playing a tough but cool character.All in all, 'Criminal' is a stylized crime-caper, which is refreshingly witty, fast-paced and jazzily filmed. A definite must-see. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as i thought...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before giving any kind of review, it might help to point out a few things about the film:1) This is the only lead role i've ever seen John C. Reilly in2) It was produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney - the 'Oceans Eleven' comparisons are endless3) This is a directorial debut by Gregory Jacobs, who's previously worked with the above and others such as the Coen Brothers4) The film is a remake of a 2000 Argentinian film called 'Nueve Reinas' (Nine Queens)There are some things about this film that were guaranteed before hand; a razor-sharp script, cool soundtrack and stylish look. However, before attending an advanced showing of the film last night, i checked out the IMDb comments and was not expecting too much. I was, however, pleasantly surprised.The thing to remember is that the film is not only a remake, but YET ANOTHER addition to an already exhausted Hollywood genre ('The Sting', 'Oceans Eleven' and recently 'Matchstick Men'), and so any originality was going to be hard-earned. But the script is excellent. In the early stages of the film, you feel like Reilly is being a bit heavy-handed with the mannerisms of his intentionally caricatured conman (especially for those familiar with his awesome and similarly heavy-handed and clumsy cop in 'Magnolia', it takes a bit of time to adjust!), but the character definitely grows on him. It is, if nothing else, refreshing to see an actor of his ability given the chance to dominate every scene, and on the whole he takes his chance well.The real star though, as mentioned elsewhere, is Diego Luna. He plays a fresh-faced and naive rookie-crook who's taken on by Reilly, and throughout the film the interplay between them is a highlight. No questions asked, he steals the show. This was a surprise to me, as i haven't seen him on screen before, but a bit of research shows he was in 'Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights', so this could be some breakthrough! Maggie Gylenhaal was slightly disappointing, as she's been particularly memorable in everything else i've seen from her, but in general the supporting cast is solid.Where the film really succeeds though, is how it knows and appreciates its audience. From the outset, 'Criminal' appears as a clichéd gag-fest revolving around the two con-men, and you are continually guessing who's going to be screwing who, and the characters often refer to just this. But the plot is complicated (or maybe uncomplicated) enough to maintain the audiences attention, and you'd be kidding yourself if you said you saw the final twist coming.Very watchable, very cool, very funny, but perhaps in the end a little unsatisfying. Well worth checking out though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone needs to tell Reilly to hire a new agent. I thought he was above this kind of crap. I begrudgingly sit through 1.5 hours of this only to find out he was being set up by all the but players all along. So we're presupposed to the fact that this was all a master rouse from the start and that John's character just "happens" to find the kid in the cascino as his unwitting accomplice? Give me a freaking break.I'm all for the suspension of disbelief when watching movies, but this was too much to ask the viewer. There are a dozen other ways to have contrived an justifiable plot without putting the viewers through the ordeal and offering the surprise at the end. This just sucked. I was angry that I had spent my time to watch it- I highly advise that you save yours and pass on this lump of dirt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Since When Do Get-Rich-Quick Schemes Work?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before setting forth reading my review of Criminal, you must take into account that it's apart of a genre that I cannot get enough of. Even if I finally have gotten out of an obsessive heist/ con phase that lasted almost half a decade, I still glow with infinite enthusiasm when I see one. I've seen Criminal about eight times now. Not as many times as I've seen Ocean's Eleven and Twelve, The Good Thief, Bound, Heist, or Gambit, but considering the amount of time that spans from the present and the time when I first saw it, eight is a big number.Considering the point of view of someone who is not as enthusiastic about heist and con movies, I would have to say this movie is a forgettable piece of channel-flipping entertainment. It's a very well-written, well-acted movie, but you have to be at least a little bit of a fan of the genre, because there's nothing else you can consider it to be. It has the subtlest elements of comedy, drama, and thriller. It couldn't be ruled out as one of the three, because they each blend in so elusively into the film's atmosphere. If you are a fan of the genre, you are in for a more than satisfying treat, almost an orgasm. If you are not, I suppose you can like it well enough, mainly for John C. Reilly's fantastically sleazy performance.It's a great con story with truly surprising twists all through the film, beginning with a series of wonderfully clever short cons that are surely not repeated from any other con films (and believe me, even the most obscure con film you can think of I've probably seen). It's a brain- buster but very relaxing to watch, an easy recliner of a movie, possibly thanks to the very plain, simplistic film-making, almost like an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. John C. Reilly adds loads to the level of enjoyment one gets out of this movie, very clearly enjoying his genuinely nasty, arrogant, greedy character. He steals every scene, among other things, and makes for one of the most entertaining grifters in the movies, loud and care-free rather than the usual introverted yet unrealistically suave stoic that we usually see as the thief or con artist in these movies. His level of crassness and immorality, which he blatantly cares nothing about, is sometimes laugh-out-loud hilarious in that low-brow way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conned...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Character actor John C. Reilly, owner of a homely face familiar to everyone and a name familiar to none, takes centre stage in this slick and clever con film. He plays the part of Richard Gaddis, professional grifter with a heart of stone and zero scruples who saves novice conman Rodrigo (Diego Luna) from arrest in a casino and takes him under his wing. As Gaddis shows Rodrigo the ropes, a major league sting comes there way that requires both men to throw in everything they possess if they are to pull it off.It appears that it's obligatory these days for any film about grifters to have a twist ending ? even when, as in this case, the twist causes irreparable damage to the movie as a whole. It's not the fact that there is a twist here that's the problem so much as its very nature ? it just refuses to be believable. Some films, the twist slaps you square in the face and you experience a moment or two of denial before you realise that, yeah, it works: the makers fooled you and provided an improbable ? but plausible ? outcome. But with Criminal, no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't accept the ending.The film is very much of its time ? i.e. the dog-eat-dog 21st century, a period of excess and greed unparalleled in history ? and offers us a group of amoral thieves and conmen to root for in the absence of any true heroes. Young Rodrigo is the notional hero because he is ostensibly an altruistic conman, hustling casinos waitresses for 50 bucks a shakedown in order to help his diabetic father pay off the $70,000 gambling debt he owes a Russian gangster. Gaddis has no redeeming features whatsoever, and yet grows increasingly sympathetic ? or at least less unlikeable ? as the film progresses. The elaborate con in which the duo become embroiled ? an attempt to sell a fake rare hundred dollar note to a business tycoon ? involves the participation of a large cast, all of whom add to the seriously convoluted plot as it follows fresh ? and occasionally, it has to be said, unlikely ? twists and turns every five minutes or so. Sit and think about it for more than a couple of minutes and the whole thing falls apart, but then you're not supposed to think too hard about a film like this: it's supposed to be more of a visceral experience, a film for the moment, and in that respect it shares the same characteristics as the cons it portrays. It doesn't care if you're wise after the fact because by then its job is complete and it's moved on?The performances are all of a high calibre, especially from the two principals and Maggie Gyllenhaal in a too-small role as Gaddis's sister, a concierge at the ritzy hotel in which the sting takes place. As I mentioned earlier, you know from the off that there's going to be a twist, and half the fun is trying to figure out who's going to get stung but, sadly, it's you the viewer who ends up feeling cheated. Had the ending been stronger ? or even believable ? Criminal might have received top marks but, as it is, it only earns an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I didn't know better, I'd have said this was a vanity vehicle for John Reilly, he is that good here. But CRIMINAL is in fact an American remake of a popular South American flick from a year ago. Reilly is surrounded by a terrific supporting cast, including Maggie Gyllenhall as his long suffering sister, but CRIMINAL is Reilly's show all the way. He plays a con man who with a new junior partner in tow takes on the con of a lifetime, the sale of a counterfeit collectible Treasury bill, only to have everything go wrong that can possibly go wrong. Astute viewers may spot similarities between CRIMINAL and 2003's MATCHSTICK MEN with Nic Cage in a similar role and in a similar predicament. Both have equally devastating and impossible-to-guess twist endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Implausible Ending Ruins a Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like movies that center around the "con." It is like watching a complicated puzzle being put together. You pay attention to everything. Moreover, as each little event happens, you analyze the potential hidden importance of it. In"Criminal", you follow Reilly's character as he comes up with various ways to scam people. His character is a somewhat heartless individual that stoppedhaving a conscience sometime ago. Still, there is something to him that gives you empathy for the character. Needing a new partner, he recruits a youngconfidence man (Luna). Right after recruiting this new partner (in a somewhat random way), the two of them plot a major con. This con is elaborate and rather clever. It is the kind of con that would take months to develop and countless hours of rehearsal. Hence the problem. (SPOILER ALERT).This movie has the inevitable big twist at the end. The switch is that thecharacter played by Luna, is actually scamming Reilly's character. As I watched the first 80 minutes of this film, I really enjoyed it. However, the last two minutes killed it. Why? Because the implausible ending made the whole rest of the film insane. There is no way this elaborate scheme could have been run. After all, it was Reilly that sought out Luna, not the other way. The elaborate set of events that were set up for the big sting were all designed to take place that day. How? How could these relations have been developed? They could not have been.Great performances, but the ending was just stupid! I know that this movie is a re-do of an Argentinian film, this does not bother me. However, if the Argentinian film had the same implausible ending as this one, it should not have beencopied at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remake "Nine Queens"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After sitting through the world premiere of "Criminal", I spent the whole movie trying to remember where I had seen this script before, and then the credits mention that it was adapted from the script of a great British film called "Nine Queens", which was out only a few years ago.Except for exchanging a postage stamp for a rare currency bill, there is no originality in this adapted screenplay. Similar to the remake of "Psycho", if you are going to film a scene-for-scene remake, then why do it?I can only hope that this movie causes people to seek out the original "Nine Queens", so that it gets the recognition it deserves in America.It's truly sad that the first film from someone who has worked for years as an assistant director couldn't be something more innovative, original, or unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film adapted from the 2000 release of an Argentine film called "Nine Queens" or "Nueve Reinas". I won't go into too much detail about the plot of the film, because it's hard to do without spoiling it. What I will say is that if you enjoy films of this genre it's well worth devoting an hour and half to. This a well-paced film that wastes no time in delving right into the meat of it's plot line and doesn't let the viewer lose interest by cluttering things up with unnecessary characters or dialog. John C. Reilly plays the part of a con-man to perfection, though maybe not quite as endearing as Ricardo Darin in the original version, he more than compensates for his lack of likability in this film with his tremendous skill as a dramatic actor. Diego Luna, Reilly's younger, baby-faced accomplice in this film is also very enjoyable. His youthful appearance and polite demeanor were perfect for this role which made his performance as a con-man that much more impressive. The story sticks closely to that of the original, yet somehow lacks the intangible "it" that Nine Queens was able to convey. That in no way means that I didn't still enjoy this film. But, if you do like what you see here, make sure you also check out Nine Queens. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was going to give this a 7, but by the time I got to the end, I automatically gave it one point up, just for being so clever. The film is a classic con-artist flick, and those are awesome to watch. They make you think, and they're fun.John C. Reilly, although he was good as usual, just didn't make a good leading man. It's not only that he doesn't have the right face for it, but it's everything else about him too. Not the right voice, personality and charisma that another actor might. He's a terrific character actor, and perhaps that's why they gave him this role, because it is a character driven part, but, the difference is, that he's carrying the movie basically on his own, and for him, it just didn't work really well. His co-star was excellent, and cute to boot. I saw him in one another film. 'The Terminal' with Tom Hanks, but that's the only other film I've ever seen him in. There is some Spanish in it, too which made the film a little more interesting, and the directing was just artsy enough to give it a little bit of flavor. However, there were times when the film was a little dry and could of used a bit of seasoning, if you catch my drift.Maggie Gyllanhaal was great, and well casted for this part. I think she is a very overlooked actress and in a way follows Johnny Depp's paths, as a somewhat newcomer to Hollywood, picking films that are more interesting than cliché or stereotypical Hollywood, so to speak.The film itself though, was well-written, and other than the mistake of John C. Reilly as I said before in the lead, it was well-casted also. There is, other than some foul language from time to time, nothing to be offended by, no sexual content, no nudity, and no violence. With that, I will say it's one of the better interesting films I've seen in a long time, and will keep it in mind for recommending it to people that I see. And, I recommend it, in fact, right now, to you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short but sweet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film develops it's story at a cracking rate. There were no slack sections at all. The script was sharp, snappy and well written. Although the running time is pretty short a lot of plot and dialogue got covered. If only more films were made this way. Although the con-artist subject matter is not so original, when I watched it I did not get a 'seen it all before' feeling. The strength of the story telling and character development made sure that it remained utterly engrossing.The acting from all parties is superb and Diego Luna definitely shows that he is ready for the mainstream. I can see why some people are saying that he steals the film. Although previously having seen Y Tu Mama Tambien I still did not twig that this was the same actor. He did seem strangely familiar but looks so different now without the puppy-fat. Let's hope he gets some more good roles off the back of this performance.Although I did not recognise the songs on the soundtrack they worked very well and created a stylish mood. I shall be looking out for it in the shops.It is hard to criticise this film, but I guess the ending raises a lot of questions. It certainly leaves you with many possible ideas of what actually happened. It could have been a bit tidier in this respect but maybe that was the intention of the film-makers. It is still a good ending.I guess this is the first film that John C. Reilly has taken the lead role and am glad that it has worked out so well. He's a great actor that deserves all the success he gets. I highly recommend Criminal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I haven't seen it, I believe this is a sequel to a film called 9 Queens, upon which book it is based. It is a nicely crafted piece of work by Gregory Jacobs (who had a hand in excellent films such as Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich, Ocean's 11 to name a few).It's hard to comment on the plot without spoiling so I'll just say it's a con job with a cracker of an ending and leave it at that. John C Reilly has a lightness of touch which is rare today, and he doesn't put a foot wrong in my book. He times his character's evolution with such perfection that you really want to watch it again to see where the seams are.Diago Luna is a delight to watch and I hope we will see a lot more of him soon.This film gives one the feeling that the complete cast has been made comfortable with each other and with the direction. It has that greased and finished feel that you recognise instantly in Ocean's 11. (Not 12, actually.) In short, a film I wanted to own as soon as I had rented it, with 2 central performances and many clever actors in the smaller parts. (Peter Mullan as Hannigan is particularly memorable)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather tough to swallow, but Reilly's performance makes it fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American remake of the 2000 Argentinian film "Nine Queens" features John C. Reilly in a superlative performance as a sometimes-successful Los Angeles con-man who partners with a Spanish grifter he meets one morning trying to swindle waitresses in a casino; they become involved in a scheme to dupe an Irish billionaire out of 750 Gs with a rare (and counterfeit) bill of foreign currency. Director Gregory Jacobs, who also co-wrote the script with Sam Lowry (the pen name of Steven Soderbergh), wisely allows Reilly lots of room to go into his maniacal arias, which is a good thing since little else in "Criminal" quite measures up to him (certainly not that generic title!). Although the colorful supporting cast is excellent, Reilly is the spark plug to the entire picture--a fact which makes the final curtain something of a let-down. Since this house-of-cards scenario is filled with cross and double-cross, it's difficult to fault the general plotting (it's a writer's conceit, after all); however, the impetus of this story--how it all gets set into motion--is questionable by the denouement. Still, an engrossing and enjoyable film with a high-wire acting job from Reilly, which might have received a great deal more acclaim had the overall results been stronger. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grifter takes on a new partner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crime is a 2003 film based on a foreign one, Nueve Reinas.Rodrigo (Diego Luna) is a young Mexican male who, while in a casino, tries the old screwing up the waitress so she gives the wrong change con, when he's spotted by Richard (John C. Reilly). He gets Richard out of the casino by claiming to be a cop.Richard no longer has a partner, so he offers to take on Rodrigo. Rodrigo has a little money but he needs more to pay his father's gambling debts.Richard has his own problems, namely, his sister (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whom Richard cheated, along with their brother, out of their part of their mother's estate. She's suing him.Richard is contacted by a businessman, once an associate of his, who wants help selling a forged treasury note to someone who needs to leave the country the next day due to his visa expiring. Another man intrudes on the deal, and Richard needs more money and asks Rodrigo to use his savings. John C. Reilly is a wonderful actor. Here, playing a crook through and through, a racist, an anti-Semite, a man who cons his own family, he's excellent, actually bringing humor to a character who is reprehensible. He was actually cast as Stanley Kowalski in the Natalie Richardson "Streetcar Named Desire," a casting I'll never understand, although I'm sure he was excellent, if the wrong type.Diego Luna is sweet and unassuming as Richard's partner, who seems out of his depth.I felt this film moved a little slowly and also, I have to admit that I'm tired of this type of plot. I saw it coming a mile away. It was somewhat fresh 40 years ago. No more.I love suspense, mystery, crime drama, etc., so I wonder how many of this type of movie I'll have to sit through over the next 30 years.However, it has entertainment value and good performances, and if you don't watch these films as much as I do, you may love it. Hope so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Hollywood making remakes they shouldn't. While the original film Nueve Reinas is excellent in every way, especially the performance of Darin and the original script, this is just a fine copy of something great in which they didn't add any extra value. Remakes are supposed to be better than the original, otherwise, don't do it at all!!I only give it a 4 because the Argentinian film is a 10. Don't watch this if you haven't, watch the original, and if you already had, please download Nueve Reinas and erase this from your brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Enjoyable Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Criminal. Almost a lot. This is a good film about the art of the con. Not a great film, but a good one. The Grifters, The House of Games, and, of course, The Sting, are great films about the con. Criminal is a peg below them, but still very enjoyable. The film stars two standard bearers, John C. Reilly and Maggie Gyllenhaal, and an actor I had not previously known, Diego Luna. Reilly plays Richard Gaddis, a professional con man who thinks he is something special. Gyllenhaal plays his sister, Valerie, a concierge at a swanky hotel in Los Angeles, who is more cunning than she lets on. Luna portrays Rodrigo, Gaddis' seemingly compliant understudy. All three give solid performances.The film is well crafted in every respect. I understand now that the film is basically a remake of a foreign film, Nine Queens, which I didn't see. Maybe if I had seen that film I wouldn't have enjoyed this one as much. Since I didn't see it, I don't really know. But since you probably haven't seen that film either, I recommend you see Criminal.I have yet to see a film yet in which Reilly puts in a bad performance, so I wasn't surprised that he did well in Criminal. As a good con man, and as an accomplished actor, he doesn't tip his hand, he's polished, and he is credible. Actually, that goes for the other cast members as well. Unlike The Sting, where you know who is getting stung, and by whom, and even why, in Criminal you think you do, but you don't. It's more like The House of Games, where you don't know what you think you know. Suffice it to say, I didn't see the curve coming. One thing I didn't like about the film is its title. Its bluntness undermines the skill of subtlety with which this film was made. So enjoy this film and find out what you know. And what you don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honor among thieves? *I don't think so!* Well-dressed and well-spoken grifter, Richard (John C. Reilly), rescues inexperienced, young Spanish con artist, Rodrigo (Diego Luna) from an arrest, taking the supposedly-inexperienced youngster under his wing, at first for small cons, and then for a giant con that suddenly falls into his lap.Ah yes, but who is conning who? Well directed by Gregory Jacobs ? or misdirected, as the case may be ? from an Argentine movie, NINE QUEENS (Fabián Bielinsky's NUEVE REINAS, 2000), produced by George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh (no strangers to confusing audiences ? to wit: OCEAN'S 11/12/13), CRIMINAL is rife with scams within cons within plays.All very satisfactory, I might add, due in large part to the utmost conviction in all the exceptional performances. Twists in con movies tend to come at you with a groan, whereas the twisty storyline in CRIMINAL comes at you via a night-stick to the back of the knees.Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Reilly's sister, of whom he asks a morally-wretched favor, and Peter Mullan is a rich investor whom Reilly tries to sell a counterfeit bank note. All while trying to con Diego's life savings from his little illegal immigrant pockets.With the deceptive dance twirling to the last frame, you discover something about yourself when you watch these types of movies ? whether you are sharp enough to see the reveal coming, or whether you LIKE being a blind bitch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with all con films, you know you can never be sure who is conning who and what the final twist will be. In this, Richard is a cold-blooded con man who has lost his partner. He spots Rodrigo trying to con waitresses and helps him out. He then tells him he wants to try him out as a partner. So, for the rest of the day Richard and Rodrigo run scams together. The first one involves scamming an old lady, something that Richard has no remorse over.Later in the day, Richard hears from his sister Valerie. She says an associate of his is at her hotel. So he goes over there to learn that the guy has a scam he is trying to pull off but needs help. Richard eventually accepts it since it could net well over 6 figures. So, he and Rodrigo go around town setting up the scam.And you know you can never believe what anyone says and there will be a final twist. The twist here "SPOILERS" is that Rodrigo and Val were scamming Richard because Richard stole the inheritance that Val and their other brother was going to receive from their mother's estate.What I didn't get was when did Rodrigo first know Val. Did Val get Rodrigo to do it the first time they went to the hotel and the film just didn't show them talking on screen? Or was this a plan that had been planned weeks in advance? Because I don't get how that would be possible because it was Richard that initiated the relationship with Rodrigo. How could Val know that Richard would pick Rodrigo? FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was fun, like most con films are. It's fun to guess the final twist. I recommend it.</fullReview>

I was lucky (or not) to have missed the original, so that I could enjoy the turns and twists of the story, and there are plenty of those. John C. Reilly and Diego Luna are two one-time partners trying a tricky plot around some fake collectors bill. Acting is low-tone but credible, and you get to know the characters by the mid of the film, and expect the next trick, although you never know what this would really be. Only Maggie Gyllenhaal exceeds the level of the cast, but she is such a good actress that her talent seems almost wasted here. No big ambitions for this film, just good entertainment, and the viewer gets it. Which is not to be dis-considered, quite the contrary. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All stereotypes fulfilled - the average movie about conmen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Criminal is a movie about conmen. There are a number of stereotypes and clichés that any movie of this genre will follow, and Criminal does so religiously.The story setup: A young trick thief is taken under the wing of an experienced, successful conman. Together, they stumble across an opportunity for a huge con, and the rest of the movie is about all the little obstacles that get in their way.To be fair, the main attraction about this movie is the cast list. One would expect a movie starring John C Reilly and Maggie Gyllenhaal to be something special and brilliant, slightly indie and probably quirky enough for a British audience to embrace it much more than an American audience would. Unfortunately, the film is actually quite disappointing (if one has high expectations to begin with).First of all, whenever a conversation is shown, and you just see one talking head, you get the impression that the other actor isn't even in the room. Maybe I'm wrong there, but somehow, subconsciously, it kept bothering me. As a result, all the acting chemistry goes out of the window - if I'm not convinced that both people are in the room, how could the emotional undercurrent of any conversation convince me? To give them credit, the actors did a brilliant job whenever they weren't in "talking heads" style conversations, with subtle and convincing performances. Especially in the second half of the film.The second problem is the predictability of the movie. Maybe I've seen too many films by now, but I had a very clear suspicion of what the resolution would be from fairly early on, and it was fulfilled entirely, much to my disappointment.And finally, there's the issue of John C Reilly as evil character. On the one hand, he's ideal for the role of a conman. They have to be charming and innocent-looking to be convincing in their work. On the other, there's that problem of audience expectation - at least in my case. I spent quite a while, looking for "Mr Cellophane" moments, after seeing him play too many nice roles. It took hours for me to accept him as evil character, and then just the briefest flicker of a moment to destroy all that and replenish sympathy.On the whole, it is a fairly acceptable film. I expected more, but it did what it says on the tin.PS: One item of background knowledge that might come in handy for non-American audiences: If someone has been convicted twice, and commits a third crime, they get an automatic life sentence in some states. It's called the "Three Strikes Law", I believe. So when characters put so much emphasis on the "twice" or two strikes, this is what they are implying: If they get caught, it's life imprisonment they're heading for.</fullReview>

There was virtually no chemistry between the two leads, Reilly and Luna. Sad sack Reilly, despite a decent performance, was miscast as the professional con man and Gyllenhaal was wasted in a minor role as Reilly's sister. Luna gave the best performance in the film as the young protégé. Scottish actor Peter Mullan played the "mark," a streetsmart "Irish" billionaire whose accent slipped from Scot to Irish every other line! By the time the surprise ending rolled around I didn't care who were the good guys, who were bad guys nor the motivations of either. The screenplay, although illogical and far-fetched, included a few good lines but I don't know if they were translated from the original film or written especially for this remake.

Never have I seen so many people walk out of a cinema early. Maggie Gyllenhaal, usually so good (Donnie Darko, Mona Lisa Smile) was wooden and her character lacked any credibility; John C. Reilly is atrocious, partly at least due to a pitiful script whose only goal seemed to be to pad out the minutes before the film got to its end; Diego Luna was likable and moderately adept, but couldn't make a difference to the film on his own.This is the worst film I've seen since Antz... and that was animated!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this movie is superb. Though I never saw the movie it is a remake of, I loved the plot with all its twists and turns. And you are hypnotized by keeping up with "who's scamming who", and what could possibly happen next. The acting is brilliant!! John C. Reilly, Diego Luna, and Maggie Guillenhal are absolutely fantastic. I've always been a fan of Diego Luna, since "Y Tu Mama Tambien", and he doesn't disappoint here, as a young grifter type. As the Richard Gaddis (Reilly) character says, Luna's character just looks like a nice guy, but you never quite know for sure where he's at. It's his little looks and expressions - and Luna handles it brilliantly. And John C. Reilly provides a fascinating characterization of a self-centered, yet somehow "down and out", grifter - who you never quite trust. Highly recommended movie!!! It pulls you in from the start, and takes you on a ride. Full of surprises, delivered with ease and perfection. I SOOO loved this movie. Don't miss it!!! (I just know that when it's out on DVD, I'll be buying a copy to keep.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I debated about watching this or Nine Queens first. I'm glad I chose this one. And I chose it first because of the very familiar cast and, I guess, the English language.WOW! This movie right away sucks you in and gets you involved. You love the characters, the plot twists, and can't wait (or guess) what happens next! This is a heist movie with lots of "grifts" or swindles done throughout. I love this stuff! Reminds me of Sneakers and Grifters.John C Reilly is always great, of course. Diego Luna steps up well to a starring role, and English-speaking, at that. Maggie Gyllenhaal is sexy as ever. This movie is just so much fun! And yes, I have NOW seen Nine Queens (or Nueve reinas) and it's good- 8 stars- but not quite THIS good.Walt D in LV. 8/24/2005</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a movie about criminals. So; you can't trust 'em.In a pretty formulaic buddy match-up; an experienced world-weary cynical grifter finds himself an amateurish young trainee. Richard (the elder) is played by J C Reilly, who is blessed with the sort of unmemorable features that make him ill-fitted as a movie lead, yet perhaps ideally-suited for the profession his character represents. He's not quite the criminal big-wheel he fancies himself to be. Rodrigo, the ill-fitting Hispanic rookie is played by Diego Cumo. He's a punk, a loser. Or so it seems.As the movie progresses, we gain some insight into the ruthless mentality of Richard, both by his actions and his confessions. He's not particularly likable. But then neither is Rodrigo, who is evidently smarter than he looks.You can see that this is gonna be a twist-in-the-tail story. The question is, simply: how? In fact, there are several little twists that develop in a rapidly tightening plot. Eventually, I was left wondering - was this gonna be a bloody-awful-shock type ending, or an ironic, humorous morality tail. You can find out for yourselves.Most of what you see has been done before. 'Grifters' is the ultimate hard-edged bloody-awful-shocker, whereas 'The Sting' is probably the most memorable tongue-in-cheek morality scenario. In between there are others - 'Ocean's' several, 'The Score' and of course, this.Don't buy into the detractors too heavily; they may be selling you short. The technical issues of camera-work and sound score, editing etc, are all up to snuff. The players give good turns and the script is more-or-less believable. Watch it without a wallet filled with expectations and you shouldn't come away feeling fleeced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest complaint I have with movies about intricate, complicated cons is that everyone says exactly the right thing at the right time. In real life even the best con man can't count on that level of predictability.Take, for example, the first scene, where Rodrigo is conning the casino waitress. Who's to say that Richard will automatically jump in and save him? An experienced con man would more likely just sit and smile to himself, watching the inexperienced kid; at most he might try to intervene on the kid's behalf, but to assume the identity of a police officer? Not believable. And for the casino security guard to just back off like that is implausible too.Or take the scene where Richard presses the call buttons looking for an old lady and finally finds one. He pretends to be the woman's grandson. How can he be so sure the woman even has a grandson and if she does, wouldn't she know the boy's voice and know that she wasn't talking to the right person? What lonely old lady would spend 10 minutes talking to someone over an intercom without once saying, "Come to the house and visit with me"? John C. Reilly must have studied "House of Games" for his character because at times he sounded just like Joe Mantegna, but that's where the similarity ends.I agree with the person who said that the movie should have ended with Rodrigo/Brian meeting with Valerie. Why can't filmmakers give their audiences a little credit for common sense? Don't they think we could have figured out that it was a double-cross from a simple scene like that? No, they have to spoon-feed us by showing all the various other characters gathered around a table (once again, just like in "House of Games").As for the part where the "mark" pays for the forged note with a check, I can't believe that any con man worth his salt would allow someone else, even his sister, to take the briefcase and have sole control over it and then patiently wait several hours for the results and then accept that it took the mark eight hours to get a certified check and not cash.And if that wasn't enough, what idiot goes into a bank where he is not known, with a check for $750,000, and ask that it be cashed on the spot? A true con man would know to open an account with a nominal amount, deposit the check, let it clear, and then draw against it the next day.I haven't seen "Nine Queens", but for a better con double-cross I would recommend "House of Games".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Criminal wasn't at all what I have expected it to be. This film is actually full of clichés, both the characters and the plot are very pale, especially in the part of the movie when everything gets "complicated" in such manner that we don't have a clear idea who is doing what, when and where. I was also a bit disappointed in Diego Luna, I thought he would be better in this movie especially after I saw his good performance in Tu mama tambien. What annoyed me the most was the end that came too abruptly and without any logical explanation....maybe the script needed some further elaboration. I would recommend it to you if you are absolutely bored and without any idea what to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so grifter flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Criminal" sticks Reilly front and center as an unlikeable con artist who takes on a young Hispanic protégé and together they fall into a scam involving the most valuable bill ever minted by the US Treasury Dept. An enjoyable but only par flick about scamming, the film becomes so convoluted and loaded up with sundry characters that it's a bit of a mess with a plethora of possible endings. It's impossible to tell who's scamming who and almost as impossible to care about any of the poorly developed characters. Nonetheless, for those interested in grifting flicks, "Criminal" should be worth a look. Don't expect to see much of Maggie Gyllenhaal who has a comparatively small part in the film. Other grifting flicks include: "The Grifters", "The House of Games", "The Spanish Prisoner", "Nine Queens", "The Prime Gig", and "Confidence". (B-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for Diego Luna--love that boy! I also like movies about con artists, and I think that this one stacks up well against things like The Grifters, Body Heat, House of Games and even The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz. I think the film made a great point with the disconnect in the con artist mind--on the hand Geddis sees himself as just another businessman trying to make a living, but on the other hand he clearly sees himself as above and apart from the rest of society and its rules. To a leser extent, Rodrigo has the same disconnect--he is devoted to family, but has few other principles. Nothing in it lagged for me--I was engaged at every moment. I have to agree that the inconsistency of Hannigan's accent bothered me as well, but this is a minor detail. Good guys versus bad guys? I think part of the point of the film was that there really weren't any good guys(with the possible exception of brother Michael). I got to see this as part of a special promotion, but would have been happy to pay $9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much longer is this stuff going to provide alleged entertainment value?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I scan the many laudatory reviews of this movie posted above, I find myself asking myself just what kind of movies from the past 30 or 40 years these reviewers have been watching, or indeed if they've watched any. No genre ages more quickly and more badly than the "big con" movie, since the whole satisfaction of the viewer hinges on the big final scene - which we know from every "con artist" movie from "The Sting" to Mamet's "House of Games" and which, inevitably, recurs in every familiar detail as the big closing scene of "Criminal" - in which all the characters who have been presented to us throughout the film as having no connection with one another - street-robbers, cops, "mark"s etc. - are revealed - gasp!! - to have secretly been part of some big coordinated scam after all. In a sense, that scene has been "used up" and dramaturgically useless since "The Sting", and all the subsequent "big con" movies of the 80's and 90's, have had to add some very special extra ingredient - such as Mamet's plumbing of the sexual and psychological abysses beneath the "con/mark" relation - in order to be movies of any even limited note. "Criminal" offers no such special angle or special depth and tries to trade on nothing but the - by now hopelessly threadbare - fascination of lives led according to the principle of the double-double-cross and the "nothing is what it seems". Precisely that, however, is the film's psychological downfall in the face of an audience which is - or which one would have assumed ought to be - as familiar by now with the conventions of this genre as it is with those of the mafia movie. The cinema MUST surely have taught us all enough about the lives and work of conmen by now for us to find it ludicrously improbable that either of the two main characters would be willing to expose thousands of dollars of money already "in hand" in order to secure the alleged "sure thing" of a deal that is to net them many thousands more (after all, it is the endemic idiocy of such greed and of the general greed-driven tendency to forget the "bird in the bush" principle that is the very basis of a conman's livelihood). Around this central crying improbability there cluster a dozen others, hardly less egregious: The John C. Reilly character would really have agreed in twenty seconds to the offer of the currency expert not to reveal that the note was a fake in return for a share of the money? Hardly, since it is hard to imagine a simpler way for the mark to find out that the note he was buying WAS indeed a fake than to send the currency expert along with just such an offer? Would he really have permitted any arrangement which might even possibly result in his parting with the note and having in hand, in return, only a CHECK which needed to be taken to a bank and cashed? The idea is ridiculous, since it would clearly involve running the risk of there happening what actually does happen at the bank in the penultimate scene. It seems that filmgoers and DVD-viewers are so desperate for that ever-more-elusive "wow-I-didn't-see-THAT-coming!" kick that large numbers of them are willing, these days, to bring their own willing paralysis of basic cogitative capacities to that "walking dead" genre, the "grifter movie". Well, at least I'll be spared hours of head-shaking incomprehension when I read on here in a couple of months rave review after rave review of a new mafia movie which features a scene in which the rat receives with relief and unconditional enthusiasm the message from the boss: "Sure, I know you helped set up the hit on my kid brother, and I'm not too happy about it. But I really need someone to help me watch out for the arrival of a drugs shipment down at the docks at 3 am tonight, so I'm willing to say: 'let bygones be bygones'. But remember to bring a couple of bags of cement so we both have something to sit on."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all the acting was okay, the screenplay and the idea for the story was completely unoriginal. The main character walks into a bar, rescue's a criminal and ask's him to be his partner, fair enough with his story about how his other partner is somewhere else la-de-da, but throughout the movie it seems the whole deal is going on for one day or so, I mean they never go home take a shower, whatever and already it seems they're living a life long marriage. Also another thing about him hiring this obviously from a one look point of view amateur, he obviously didn't do a good job the first time around, so why be so desperate to hire him? to be honest if I were a con artist, I would at least be careful as to who I chose. It's not exactly a matter of who puts their hand up first kinda thing. Now I compared this movie to another one, Matchstick Men. Mainly because it had the same idea, one man was being conned by the person he was teaching kind of thing, and after watching that movie. This one seemed highly obvious. A good movie is one which keeps you guessing no matter how many more there are like it. A good movie is unpredictable, suspenseful and leaves you wandering what the heck is going on. Now as soon as the amateur said something along the lines of "YOUR CONNING ME!" I immediately knew he had something to hide. It doesn't take a genius to figure this out. With matchstick men, now there's an original idea, his kid comes into the picture and everything is all ladeda, and he finds out he's being hit on the head with his own hammer. But the thing that got me interested in this movie is the personality, he had some mental disorders and we got to see that, the movie let us get captivated by the characters and their very different lives. This movie Criminal, I learned nothing about the main man apart from that him and his sister didn't get along, that's the only thing I remembered. and to be honest he was a jerk and I wasn't disappointed once when he got arrested. basically at the end of the movie the only thing I was disappointed at was that I spent $1.00 hiring it out, and $1 isn't even that much where I live. Some clever bits here and there, but not enough for me to give it more than a four. I enjoyed Mary Poppins a lot better...</fullReview>

John C. Riley makes a great con artist in this film where he and Diego Luna as another con artist team up to con a rare counterfeit bill for a huge amount of money. Along the way they have to pull several small cons together. It all pulls together in the end with an awesome twist comparable to "Usual Suspects" and "Murder on the orient express"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, I watched this movie to see Diego Luna's acting, and I think it was okay but at the end of this film, it was incredibly interesting!! I could not notice any clue of a big reversal in the end. Wow... it was totally great. I think I'm quite capable of noticing that trick of movies but this time, I completely failed. It is quite interesting to see Jake Gyllenhaal's sister and also interesting tricks of "criminal." This movie is just so great! :D It is just a little bit sad that there are not that many people who know this movie's existence. Give it a try! this movie is really good!!Richard is a cold blooded slicker, and his sister and brother have suffered from his immoral behaviors. And this bears the start of this movie. I will not spoil the main content of the story. Just his interesting and a kind of fabulous tricks turn out to be a blade of a sword threatening him later. And what I am wondering after watching this film is that where Rodrigo learned the tricks to make believe Richard that he is such a capable slicker as much as Richard is. If you watch this movie, you would also be wondering about that part.In my opinion, this movie is one of the best films of Diego Luna(I know that "terminal,the" was good enough too but Diego did not take the main role in that movie as you may know). ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I haven't seen "Nine Queens" I don't know how "Criminal" stacks up next to the source. On its own merits, however, it makes for a compact little caper.As is often the case, conning is the name of the game with two small-league criminals (the excellent John C. Reilly and Diego Luna) attempting to hoodwink another one, but with nothing being what it seems, etc., etc. It's not the most extraordinary tale of its kind, but unlike another caper movie involving producers George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh, the wildly overrated "Ocean's Eleven," this story doesn't give itself over to how stylish it thinks it is, devoting itself more to its characters. It's not exactly exciting, but at least it holds the attention and doesn't last a moment longer than it has to.As for the acting, in another departure from the "Ocean's Eleven" trope it's fine (no need for stars here), although one wishes that Maggie Gyllenhaal could have been put to more and better use. The movie may be about a con job, but it's unlikely to rip off the viewer.A short and to the point review for a short and to the point movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CRIMINAL (2004) **1/2 John C. Reilly, Diego Luna, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Peter Mullan, Jonathan Tucker, Zitto Kazann, Enrico Colantoni. (Dir: Gregory Jacobs) Based on the foreign film 'Nine Queens' ? an Argentinean export that I must admit I didn't see ? this remake produced by Steven Soderbergh (who co-wrote the adapted screenplay with the film's director, veteran cinematographer Jacobs who has helmed many of Soderbergh's films including 'Ocean's Eleven', and George Clooney ? the film has a high pedigree of talent behind-the-scenes as well as for its eclectic cast. Headed by venerable character actor Reilly as a penny ante con-man named Richard Gaddis who in the opening scene sets the pace for the storyline as he poses as a plain-clothes vice cop in a casino where he busts a young hustler named Rodrigo (Luna late of 'Y Tu Mama Tambien') by enlisting him as a new partner for a high-stakes gig involving counterfeit silver engravings.Rodrigo who owes his good graces to Gaddis for not turning him in learns by-the-seat-of-his pants the art of the con in a memorable day of quick money and vast scheming to get to a Holy Grail by filching a multi-millionaire media owner named William Hannigan ('Trainspotting's Mullan) out of a small fortune that'll turn Gaddis' life around and satisfy Rodrigo's quest to settle his up-to-his-eyes in debt gambling father's tab.Also in the mix is Gaddis' volatile sister, Valerie (the always welcome Gyllenhaal) whose curt demeanor masks an even as-the-plot-thickens harboring of resentment due to familial restraints and hidden secrets that eventually unravel by the film's heady climax.While Reilly gets his acting chops a nice work-out to make a slimy character somewhat amiable the convoluted plot can be foreseen a mile away with its O. Henry outcome yet the interplay between the ace and the novice baby-faced Luna is a nice transition into the seamy underbelly of Los Angeles (superbly photographed by Chris Menges).Jacobs acquits himself in letting his gifted cast glide along but hinders himself in allowing the knotty double crosses and genre's trademarks get a tad sloppy.In the end the con itself is a real McGuffin that ultimately feels like warmed over version of 'The Grifters'.</fullReview>

(spoilers) We know either/or both of the main leads are double-crossing - and since we know this, the movie loses any kind of appeal. The writing and story are the 2 main culprits for this, but the acting barely makes satisfactory in most cases. So there becomes no real emotional impact or buy-in - as we can perceive it all as trickery or at least suspect so. Without any honesty in the movie given the subject matter it becomes a waiting game for ending. The whole point of twists are that they need to be subtle enough to startle - this was as subtle as a Jet-Airplane Engine. If want to watch a better con movie, check out The Game or Matchstick Men.</fullReview>

All of the actors give a star studded performance! The twist and turns of this movie create suspense and humor with a "BLow me away" ending. I can wait for Diego Luna to come out with more films {and the other actors too} because he is the best actor ever! i give this movie a 10.5 out of 10!! Go see it even if you have to go to some independent film theater, it is worth the extra few bucks promise you will love it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criminal is a clumsy, amateurish indie film working over the heist/con-artist genre without anything new to bring to the table. John C. Reilly is miscast as the grifter at the center of the movie. The script presumes that we will slowly grow to detest him over the course of the film, but Reilly's sad-sack persona makes him too sympathetic to play the part. At the same time he utterly lacks the devilish charisma that would make the movie fun to watch. The result feels like a long road trip in the middle of winter with an awkward relative who has bad breath. Diego Luna's performance as Rodrigo is one of the few bright spots in the movie, but his character ultimately is just a stereotype of Mexican-American immigrants in Los Angeles. When the film posits that, although living in LA, he's never been to Westwood or Beverly Hills, you can only groan. Maggie Gyllenhaal is repulsive as Reilly's sister. Whether this was intentional or another case of miscasting is in doubt. Finally, without giving anything away, the ending of the movie is just plain dumb. Of all the delectable possibilities the filmmakers chose the most obvious, simplistic and heavy-handed conclusion available.All in all a forgettable, unsatisfying movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It should be made clear that it's a copy/ adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented "Criminal" when I briefly read the description of the plot. When I started to see it, I realized that it was a remake of the Argentinian "9 Queens". What a disappointment! I believe any remake should make it clear that it's a copy/ adaptation of another (foreign or local) film. I am not against remakes, I just feel that I am entitled to know this detail, specially if they completely change the name/title. By the way, in my opinion "9 Queens" is way superior to "Criminal". First, both lead actors are more authentic in "9 Queens", and they are very representative of a period of Argentinian reality. Diego Luna's average Mexican immigrant looks and accent made him a complete miscast, and Gyllenhaal just imitated the Argentinian leading lady.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminal vs Nueve Reinas(original version)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Criminal is a good movie to see if you didn't see the original Nueve Reinas. The main problem with Criminal is not the acting (very good), is the intention to transplant a crown city stereotype to a 'open wide town' like Los Angeles. This movie belongs to cities like New York or the original in Buenos Aires. The problem is about cultural references that people that live in oldest big cities known and do not exist in open spaces. A con man on foot, like the one in the original is proper of immigrant cultures that need to 'invent' some tricks to get money when there are not work to take. Some people use this tricks as a life medium. In the original film the main character is a whole SoB, in this movie that position is not clear. In the original movie the main character never find out that he was tricky and lost all his money, in this movie he receive an invalid check, so he was clearly framed. If this movie would be made in New York or other crow city a on foot con man that 'make his day' could be credible, a con man on car, traveling Los Angeles is not credible. Next time adapting movies please think on 'cultural references'. The movie is good, but not credible, instead the original Nueve Reinas represent cultural values from a city of immigrants like Buenos Aires</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminal, a bad copy of the Argentinian film Nine Queens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this movie at all. But i'm writing this comments just to make sure that tiger user (the one that left a message before me) don't make the mistake again of telling people that NINE QUEENS was a British movie. Nine Queens was a great Argentinian film, and then there were, of course, remakes of this first movie because of it big success. But all the credits are Argentinian's. I'm proud to said this and i don't want people to think that is from a hole other country. Well, that's all. I don't have anything else to say, except: You have to see the original one. That was a hit. There are some things you may not understand, because are local people codes, but everything in the Nine Queens movie is excellent, from the scrip to the finish song and the titles; everything.PS: Sorry about my English. I hope i'd understood what i said.</fullReview>
