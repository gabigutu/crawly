		<shortDescription>Truly a film (and affair!) to remember!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolutely beautiful flim, with two beautiful, shining stars. Deborah Kerr, always the epitome of British lady-like reserve... that dainty face and that curled red hair... always bringing a grace to the roles she plays (except for Karen Holmes in "From Here To Eternity"... but that's another story). She's breathtakingly grand as Terry McKay, the class-act who falls in love with a playboy (Grant), though she is engaged to another. And Cary ... the most gorgeous person to EVER grace this earth! He's absolutely marvelous as playboy Nickie Ferrante, who finds himself falling quickly in love with someone other than his fiancee. I have never seen chemistry on screen like this! Although the movie may be classified as "sap" or "a love story"... it's got it's funny moments ("Do you think it will ever take the place of night baseball?", "Top of the mornin' to ya!"--"And the rest of the day to you!"). But there are some scenes that just absolutely take your breath away... like when they are visiting Nickie's grandmother (in my opinion, the point that they realize their deep love for each other). Also, when they meet their fiancees in New York and while Terry's hugging Ken, Nickie gently kisses his fingertips and places them on her glove, and then she holds her glove to her cheek. Truly divine. However, the defining moment of this film (believe me, you better have some hankies handy!) is at the end... the look on Grant's face whenever he sees the portrait is PRICELESS. And of course, Kerr's voice trembling at the words "Darling, don't look at me like that." I give this movie a definite 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Treasure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason why "An Affair to Remember" has remained a classic over the years. It contains all the elements the audience is looking for in an entertaining film. It has two marvelous stars, a timeless plot, and it transports the audience to a different world. I think it is almost impossible for a movie with Cary Grant in it to be anything other than first rate entertainment. Not only is he handsome, charming, and sophisticated, but he also knows how to grab the viewers' attention and manage to keep. Each time we see his movies,connects with us in a way that fascinates us, and yet it is comforting and familiar. Deborah Kerr is a lady who knows how to capture the audience's heart. She can always manage to get us rooting for her.I love "An Affair to Remember" because it showcases the incomparable talents of my two favorite stars at their best. I know some people say that this movie is too sentimental and corny, but part of its allure is that it is not too realistic. It gives us an escape into the ideal world where everyone is good looking and charming. Nowadays, movies like to play on the realism of life. This movie is for all the romantics out there who are looking for a film to fall in love with!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely, Lilting Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What one has to consider about the Deborah Kerr/Cary Grant characters is that they are both "kept" individuals: Kerr by a wealthy Texan named Ken (-doll, played by Richard Denning), Grant a gigolo engaged to an heiress (Neva Patterson). They meet on an ocean cruise, with this some cute and also silly comedy thrown in. Kerr &amp; Grant are British and speak the accents yet their characters are from the U.S.; a not too distracting error, however. An unusually touching scene is when they de-bark in Italy and visit Grant's 82-year-old grandmother (Cathleen Nesbitt). It's a beautiful setting with wonderful music and pathos. Back in the states the couple agree to meet atop the Empire State Building in 6 months. One wonders why Kerr won't marry the handsome Denning, athletic, wealthy and kind (in real-life the actor was married to the British-raised actress Evelyn Ankers, a beauty in the Kerr-mold). Much of the second half is infused with un-necessary scenes of singing children but this all leads up the the final, long scene, beautifully acted and directed (by Leo McCarey). A mystery is very slowly unraveled in layers until the peak of the scene, scored by the emotional title theme song. This scene "gets" one every time, that's how effective it is. Beautiful costumes, scenery, clever photography (note the scene where the open patio door reveals the Empire State Building in its reflection), great cast make this an enduring, never-forgotten golden classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie, not at all annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again due to its sweet nature and its refreshing look at how the world used to be. It is quaint yet still touching to those of us viewing it 50 years later. It is still relevant and it is still wonderful to watch the chemistry between the charismatic Cary Grant and the beautiful Deborah Kerr. The movie is a reminder of how simple things could make you laugh back in days when comedy was not sarcasm or needing negativity to be funny. "An Affair to Remember" is a wonderfully beautiful movie that creates a wonderful sense of how romance should be. It's lasting quality can be seen in other movies that have followed by deriving inspiration from the use of the Empire State Building as an iconic tower representing romance and this is a testament to the importance and relevance of this movie decades later. Plus, Cary Grant is still a cinematic icon 50 years later. This is a beautiful movie than spans time and still touches hearts this many years later. And it will continue to touch hearts for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Deep and Rich as It Is Stylish and Romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"An Affair to Remember" is an almost perfect film. It is as deep and rich as it is stylish and romantic.And if someone tells you it is just a soap opera -- that person would be very, very wrong.Yes, the film has style to burn. Deborah Kerr was never more beautiful. Her skin looks like cream; her pert, pinched nose like a blossom. She's never been more appealing than she is here. The scene where she smiles from a boat at her fiancé on shore alone is worth the price of admission.Cary Grant seems to sleep in tuxedos. He is a walking model of male perfection.Less observant viewers come away from this movie thinking that nothing happened, that nothing was ever at stake, that nothing was risked or gained. How wrong they are.Kerr's amazing dresses -- how about the one with the pumpkin colored ribbons woven through the front? -- Grant's suavity, and the south of France settings are not just there to pose for the camera.All of the beauty of this film is there to do very hard work -- to tell a less than beautiful story.And, no, this is not a movie where nothing happens. Something is happening in every scene -- you just have to be paying attention, and you just have to be mature enough, or have your antenna up high enough, to catch the subtle messages the film is sending, and to feel in your own solar plexus, the resonances of loves, dreams, and selves risked and gained, or lost.Nicki and Terry are both gambling much here. They are wounded people in a world of high glamor; they speak in arch codes, even as their hearts are bleeding, or their breath is caught against the cage of dreams.Grant's character, Nicki Ferrante, is a lazy gigolo. "Gigolo" is a pretty word for an ugly situation. Ferrante is a talented artist, but he knows that he can market something else he does -- seduce women -- far more easily, and for a higher price, than he can get for his paintings.Kerr's character, Terry McKay, as she says, had to grow up very fast, and fight off a boss who -- well -- she faced some bad stuff in her life. When a steady, but less than thrilling, man offered to set her up, she, no fool, took the offer.These are two beautiful people swanning through life over some very ugly circumstances. They have both sold their best selves for easy money.And, then, completely by chance, on shipboard, they meet their soul mates. This meeting doesn't just present them with an opportunity for a one night stand. It demands that they face their own fears, and become their best selves.I'm one of those cynical people who doesn't believe in love, never mind soul mates, but this movie carries it all off so well, it makes me believe.Grant and Kerr begin with the lightest, and subtlest, of exchanges. they say things to each other -- example: "I'd be surprised if you were surprised" -- that, if you are not paying attention and that if you don't know a lot about life -- would just go over your head.Slowly but surely their effervescent, and yet irresistible, attraction becomes truly heavy. The scene with Grandmere Janou (Cathleen Nesbit) is amazing for all it says, without actually saying anything.I could see a naive film-goer taking in that scene and then asking, "What was the point of that scene?" You really have to have your eyes on the screen, and have a sensitivity to human interactions. Who is looking at whom; whose face is suddenly hidden and why; who is saying what without actually saying it; and why does the sound of that boat whistle bring tears -- you have to be willing to pay attention, and to have a sense of life and human relationships, and, yes, an openness to the possibility of there being a God to understand that scene.Here you have a man and a woman who have, basically, sold themselves to the highest bidder, and who, at that point, are perilously close to cheating. What happens? Their love is blessed by the Virgin Mary. Heavy stuff."We changed our course today." Truer words were never spoken.I've got to hand it to Leo McCarey, who wrote and directed this film as well as the Academy Award winning "Going My Way." He so wonderfully brings the best, and most complex, aspects of Catholicism to the screen here. Catholicism is associated with the romance languages -- French, Italian -- and it also is friendly to this kind of romance -- a romance where fallen beauties are blindsided by the kind of tortuous, redemptive, overwhelming, fated love that demands, and gets, everything, after which, you are never the same.If you haven't seen the movie, or "Sleepless in Seattle," I won't reveal the ending to you. I'll just say that merely thinking about the ending can make me cry such tears as, really, very few films I've ever seen can make me cry. These tears are their own species.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do people hate this movie so much? It is a wonderful film , Cary Grant is so handsome and sexy,in my opinion -the sexiest man to ever have walked this earth.. and Deborah Carr is terrific as the love interest. The shipboard fun and the kiss on the stairs , i know if Cary had kissed me i would have gone crazy. The beautiful scenes in France and the shipboard romance were terrific. I do admit that the musical numbers involving the children were very unnecessary and somewhat annoying adding too much extra time to the film but they needed to show her life after the accident I guess. A shame that Deborah Kerr did not sing ,her voice was dubbed in this movie as well as in the King and I by Marnie Nixon but she was the leading lady and they needed a singing voice for her . That last scene where Cary sees the painting and the truth hits him , he is so overwhelmed with emotion that he wants to almost cry. I love that scene , I could watch it over and over again . go watch with your favorite sweetheart and a good cuddly sofa. 4 out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When nostalgic for old-fashioned movies, this is it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think you cannot stand another headline about people trying to blow up airplanes with shoe bombs, when you are on the verge of depression because the world is so hard and immoral and unkind, when you want to return to the Good Old Days of the 1950's, then plop this video into your player and watch two film STARS give lovely sweet performances in a GROWN UP, sensitive film called "An Affair To Remember". Ok, ok, so the Catholic touches go a bit overboard (Kerr in the chapel praying to the Virgin like a good Catholic, while she is a kept woman and playing around on her fiance with Grant, the little kids singing about hell and the devil, etc.) but other than that this film is romantic and enjoyable, nostalgic and fun. The two main characters grow emotionally and spiritually during the course of the film. That does not happen too often in modern films. And you don't forget this film once you have seen it. It stays with you, it haunts your consciousness and your memories. How many modern films can you say that about? I forget their plots 10 minutes after I am out of the theater. Not this film. You don't want this film to end: you want to see the couple get married, have children, see them successful in their careers, grow old together (and you know they do).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has to be probably the best romantic film I've ever seen, even above Gone With The Wind, but on the same level as The English Patient (my favorite film of all time). I got intrigued by this film back in high school when my sister dragged me to see Sleepless in Seattle. I caught the references to this film that Meg Ryan made throughout that film and thought that I'd like to rent this film (Affair to Remember) to see what the commotion was about. Needless to say, with the whole "shipboard romance" aspect of it, and the promise to meet again in six months atop the Empire State Building of all places, I quickly became hooked. The scene on the French Riviera with Nickie's grandmother playing the piano, oh God is it beautiful! Cary Grant is so debonair and suave and Deborah Kerr is so ravishing and stunningly beautiful, that it always demands repeated viewing from me (at least three times a year). Seeing this film always makes me wonder if something like the kind of relationship that Nickie had with Terry in the film would really be possible. Would and could someone actually leave the person they were engaged to to marry a complete and total stranger that they just met days ago? I'd like to think that it could, but then I am nothing but a hopeless romantic. The final scene always tears my heart out, no matter how many times I've seen it, I'm always sobbing. Watching this film around Valentine's Day (even if you are single) is always a treat. It allows our fantasies to take flight so that we may think that we are actually the one meeting our beloved atop the Empire State Building in a thunderstorm. Watch with a box of Kleenex nearby. My rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not difficult to see why AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER has endured for so many decades as a romantic drama, consistently rated as one of the most romantic films of all time. The first half of the film was rather slow, as it introduced us to characters and established their backgrounds and links. It wasn't so much the script as the interaction between Nicky (Cary Grant) and Terry (Deborah Kerr) that was intriguing--the little stolen moments, the careful words, and even that tiny, indirect farewell kiss Nicky bestows on Terry's hand as they part company when coming off the steamer. It all builds up to a terrific denouement, and I have to admit to being thrilled when Nicky turns up at Terry's door, and increasingly horrified as he baits her about missing their meeting atop the Empire State building. Cary Grant is charming as always, and, at age 53, still able to get a girl's heart to stop dead in its tracks. Who *wouldn't* have been too busy thinking about him to get into a devastating car accident? Deborah Kerr is lovely as well, and the direction of the film is excellent. We don't get soundtracks like this anymore, either--soft, romantically lush, with children serenading the audience as much as they do Terry.If this movie had been made today, I would probably be cynical and think of it as emotionally exploitative. But, with its impeccable cast playing each line sincerely and truthfully, it works. The set-up is simple; the heart of it is unforgettable: this is true of both Nicky and Terry's relationship, as well as the film as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuine Romance; a Thoughtful and Very Moving Two-Person Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the film's notoriety as a love story, please. Forget that Leo McCarey the author was the creator of "Going My Way", a beautifully-thought-out but pro-religious film. Forget that Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are a wonderfully-right pair of casting decisions with delightfully just-off synergy as a troubled romantic duo. When one thinks about the very popular romance "An Affair to Remember", the story needs to be viewed as a feature film idea, and as a completed entity in its own right. And on these terms, it is as refreshing, I suggest, as a Mediterranean breeze in the springtime. McCarey's direction is as straightforward and competent as is his script. There could have been more characters; but the fundamental situation, involving famous playboy Grant with amused and interested singer Kerr in a shipboard romance that simply succeeds in spite of all the fishbowl-paparazzi-interfering passenger setbacks is unfolded for the viewer like a rose warming to a springtime sun's rays. Every aspect of the film, technical and artistic, works to increase its honest emotional impact. The famous the song, music by Hugo Friedhofer, songs by Harold Adamson and McCarey, settings and art direction, costumes and lighting, cinematography by veteran Milton Krasner--all contribute to the final glowing effect...The acting in this picture, by Richard Denning, Grant, Cathleen Nesbit as Grant's grandmother, emcee Robert Q. Lewis as himself and skilled character veteran Fortunio Bonanova and the choir children and shipboard guests is always above-average; also, Deborah Kerr (singing dubbed by Marn Nixon) is at her best in her multi-layered role, which is very good indeed; frankly, her charisma and skill had to help Grant's underwritten part if the film were to succeed. How well she did her work is attested by the film's wide acceptance with critics and audience alike. The term "romance" I suggest needs to refer to:" a personal and potential partnership between two persons capable of 'mature' or lasting admiration-based-love and worthiness of being watched as they work within the context of their ethical values to create the terms, emotional readiness and acceptable conditions for their 'union' of exclusivity together (and against the world's people and agents of frustrations or tyrannies if need be)". The attractive (for once) over thirty-five importance of both characters, and the difficulties they face in earning the right to become such a romantic union--in the objectivist sense of romance just defined--are aided in the plot and retarded in personal terms by the problems they face: the difficulty of Grant's becoming a working artist in whatever marketplace exists, Kerr's conflicting schedule, the death of his grandmother, a lengthy enforced absence and her later accident all work against them. But the climax of the film is an honest triumph of romantic comedy writing, and Grant's best scene in the film. This is a very rewarding, positive and worldly film, despite bows toward religious trappings. It is McCarey's masterpiece; and a deservedly popular film for lovers everywhere, secular or otherwise. A bit lengthy, but a rare adult Hollywood comedic near-masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Got Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dawn of such technical advances as heightened Technicolor usage, widescreen effects and stereophonic sound prompted many studios in the 1950's to re-hash their most successful stories and "pump up" the glamour in a bid to compete with television.So, "The Women" (1939) became "The Opposite Sex" (1956); "The Philadelphia Story" (1940) became "High Society" (1956); "My Man Godfrey" (1936) was disastrously remade under the same title in 1957; and, in one of the more successful attempts, "Love Story" (1939) morphed into "An Affair to Remember" (1957).The classic original film starred Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer as the ill-fated lovers; the update didn't skimp on star power, and reeled in heavyweights Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.Grant, of course, was already a legend, and if a few missteps in the early 1950's put him in a mild slump, he scored a tremendous success in 1955 with Hitchcock's "To catch a Thief." Kerr, on the other hand, was enjoying huge acclaim as a result of her performance in "The King and I" (which itself was a super-deluxe, musical retelling of "Anna and the King of Siam," 1948, also starring Dunne).All the elements seemed to be in "An Affair to Remember"'s favor: popular, charismatic stars; lavish production values; and even the same director as the 1939 original, Leo McCary. Unfortunately, some of the sparkle seems to have gotten smothered beneath the Technicolor trappings, hackeneyed melodrama cliches, and the swelling, swooning theme song.Everything starts out perfectly fine: Grant, a notorious international playboy, meets Kerr, a sensible nightclub singer, while onboard a luxurious cruise ship. Although both are spoken for (Grant's engagement is humorously reported upon at the film's start), there is an immediate spark, and the banter is quite charming and witty. The film is handled with a light, comic touch, and it seems as if, for once, a 1950's remake is going to at least be on a par with its predecessor, if not exactly surpassing it.Unfortunately, things begin to fall apart as soon as the star-crossed pair hit dry land. Except for a surprisingly touching (if calculated) scene where Kerr and Grant visit his frail Italian grandmother (the always-wonderful Cathleen Nesbitt), the remainder of the picture veers sharply into pure 1950's soap. **(SPOILERS TO FOLLOW)** Grant and Kerr promise each other to dump their respective fiance(e)s, and meet atop the Empire State Building to reaffirm their love and get married. On her way to the meeting, Kerr gets near-killed crossing a street (no doubt Vic Damone belting that damn song distracted her) and Grant, not knowing of the accident, believes that she's had a change of heart.Kerr is now confined to a wheelchair; Grant follows his life's dream to become a painter; Kerr buys one of his paintings; Grant tracks her down; Grant learns of her accident by opening her bedroom door and finding a wheelchair in the darkened room, hit by a spotlight. (Groan.) Together at last, Kerr and Grant dissolve into happy tears, with Kerr uttering perhaps the most cringe-worthy line in big budget soap opera history: "If you can paint, I can walk!"In trying to combine the screwball romantic comedy elements of the 1930's with a tackier, 1950's-era "Love is a Many Splendored Thing"-type mentality creates a very schizophrenic film. The first half is very enjoyable, fast-paced, and charming. The second half is mawkish and shrill; still entertaining, but a disappointment after the relative excellence of the first half. (There's even a horrid musical sequence with Kerr and a disadvantaged children's chorus--a crude and obvious nod to her previous "King and I" success.)You could do a lot worse than "An Affair to Remember" when it comes to lowbrow melodrama gussied up in deluxe trappings; after all, nothing with Cary Grant is completely without merit. But it's also a sad reminder of the film it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slow, dull, weak dialogue, painful to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no Ebert, but I'm honestly baffled why this movie is considered a classic. The pacing is truly glacial, the dialogue isn't snappy or clever like you'd expect in a Cary Grant vehicle, and the female lead just doesn't work as an irresistible lure. Super disappointing. It felt like a rehearsal -- I kind of expected the director to step in at any minute and say "yo, this scene is really sucking, is there any way to make it more interesting? like maybe try talking faster?"Love CG's other movies generally speaking, but this one is just bad. Katharine Hepburn's sassy, strong characters are a much better match for Cary Grant. It's not Deb Kerr's fault her lines are lousy in this film, but well, they are. Sappy, over-earnest, put-upon... annoying throughout. On top of that, her character is quite an ingrate to poor Ken, who is unfailingly nice and sweet.This movie just does not work, and life's too short to watch bad movies, so do yourself a favor and skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This dog has so many fleas it should join a circus! Endless, dull and stagey with a soupy soundtrack and even the added insult of "cute" singing children. Kerr's character gets to play the martyr, but not to worry, we're informed early on that she'll walk again, just as soon as she takes Grant on wee guilt trip. Kerr's her usual bland 50's movie star sleepwalker, but the real crime is the casting of Grant, a comic genius, in a role that any big-jawed actor of the time could have rotary-phoned in. She's so brave! He's such a big old meanie! But they're both very pretty, and the scenery's okay, if that's what you watch movies for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grant and Kerr fall in love on a sea-voyage and all sentimental hell breaks loose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie occasionally approaches "The Sound of Music" in its campness. No, there is no Austria and no war, but there are some kids, some songs, and plenty of awfully exaggerated romantic nonsense. It starts off as a leisurely romantic comedy when Grant meets Kerr on a luxury ship. Grant is an infamous playboy who is about to marry a super-rich young woman (who isn't bad-looking either). Yet Grant is ready to sacrifice all that and to start working for the first time in his life so that six months later he may meet Kerr on top of the Empire State Building - hence be worthy of her love. Kerr, on Grant's suggestion that their meeting-place be the Empire State Building, comments rather pathetically: "That's as close to Heaven as you can get in NY!". By the way, Kerr's character grew up in Boston, then moved to NY - but somehow kept that pure British accent intact. And while the two of them are having their well-remembered affair, all the other passengers and even crew-members giggle about incessantly, starring and pointing at the glamour couple as if they were witnessing live sex between a naked Lady Di and one of her stable boys. Naturally, everyone else on the ship is old and unattractive (just like in "Ryan's Daughter" except that there it pertains to a village, not a ship). Did I mention that the world-famous playboy Grant is an artistic soul who is a good painter? Well, then I also ought to mention that Kerr eventually gets a job as a teacher in a lowly NY school for non-rich kids, where she inspires kids to have high hopes, and dreams, and to fight for their ideals perhaps, and, and... aaahhhh... But the highlight of absurdity and force-tragedy-down-your-throat plot-device-making is Kerr having a traffic accident just as she is heading toward the Empire S.B.! How very old Hollywood school! And it doesn't end there: Kerr even keeps the accident a secret from Grant so that he won't feel sorry for her, won't have to support her, or whatever other garbage reason the writer of this film thought up. In the end, a predictable accidental meeting between Kerr and Grant eventually leads to them finally resuming that all-too well-remembered affair - after a full year! The movie is rescued by the cast (although I've seen them both better in other - better - movies) and by that 50s Technicolor charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch this twice on account of I fell asleep the first time. So I went and looked at the reviews and it's good, they said, so I gave it another go. I wish, I really wish I hadn't bothered. First of all those ghastly kids. I hate kids in movies, whether they are the Dead- End variety in Angels with Dirty Faces, or (as here) when they are all wiped clean, polished and given songs to sing. In fact I hate that kind the most. Truly emetic.And then there's the improbable plot, the oh so nice grannie, and the pretense that Cary Grant's paintings are any good (they looked like the sort of cheap prints you buy in Woolworth's to me).No, just sentimental rubbish. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Affair To Remember" is a film to remember. It is beautiful and romantic. Its sky is lit with bright stars, its air filled with brilliant music. Very good cinematography, and even better score. However the main characteristic of this film remains its being passionate to the extent of breaking the heart. Some would say a formula-one tear-jerker. It happens that "An Affair To Remember" has something more to offer than tears. To borrow a sci-fi cliché, this one has the force with it. This film alone has star power far exceeding that of a planet-full of today's motion pictures.No wonder it is considered one of the best romantic dramas of all times. When American film Institue made their "100 years, 100 Passions" list, "An Affair To Remember" was at a fifth place, with only "Casablanca", "Gone With The Wind", "West Side Story", and "Roman Hoiday" ahead.Some of film's glorious moments leave indelible impression. Cary Grant waiting on th 102 nd. floor for Deborah Kerr to appear is one such scene. This is part of the movie's charm that it has inspired generations of film-lovers. To the extent that some film-makers have actually used it as a super-plot. By inter-wining their own stories with this classic tale of love, by downloading some of its atmospheres in their stories, formula film-makers have tried lending some more depth and charm to their otherwise mundane plots. One such movie, "Sleepless in Seattle" was considered so good , it ended up making the same AFI list.Thus, it can be surmised that at least part of this movie transcended the boundary of the medium itself. Not a small feast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leo McCarey ("Going My Way," "The Awful Truth," etc.,) directed "Love Affair," with Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. Cary Grant saw the movie and fell in love with it. He persuaded McCarey to direct him and Deborah Kerr in a remake, using the original screenplay almost word-for-word. Color and wide-screen were added. It isn't their fault if Grant and Kerr aren't quite Boyer and Dunne; still they create their own compelling screen chemistry. The script is a knockout, old-fashioned romance and witty, adult dialogue. Both movies are well worth the viewing, with the prize going to the earlier version only by a little bit. Oh, except that the songs in the second version are something cringe-making. But watch out for that last scene, it's a killer in both movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grandma, Glances, Gestures the key...to this great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grandma and her words/gestures and (dare I say) prayers...are the key to change in this movie. Note to film makers on gestures &amp; glances. When you've watched this film more than twice, you see how much is communicated silently with glances and gestures. Grandma, Grant and Kerr, in particular. Wonderful. I accept the film as both timeless and timebound. Yes, the great dresses, mannerisms, and more oblique references to sexuality are of the 50's.So for all you who want to see every wart &amp; freckle, &amp; hear every grunt, sorry. I enjoy seeing the more structured 50's and a true courtship.(I am structure deprived since I grew to adolescence in the selfish 60's and unstructured 70's where the rules of courtship were thrown out the window---to our culture's great &amp; deep loss). *Possible spoiler, tho slightly disguised* What a great view of love --love thru bad times &amp; good, with the possibility of beer versus champagne, and sickness versus health...and the hint of children...Love that scene where Kerr breaks up with her paramour to the tune of a TV baby commercial.But...Will Nicky &amp; Terry be able to renounce their plush lifestyles, live apart for a while to work &amp; save,and not party, and wait (chastely) for each other?"Life will present a bill to Nicky" as Grandma says to Terry.When the "bill" is presented to this couple, will spoiled Nicky or pampered Terry both be able to stand it? And...are both truly changed from their former parasitic views of love &amp; life?Even if one appears to be untrue, will the other renounce the ethical life &amp; go back to the party life???I want my daughter to have a clue as to what courtship was (or could be). Maybe she won't wear lovely shirtwaist dresses &amp; hats &amp; gloves like Grandma did, but she should know that love, vows, and character (and dare I say trust in God) all go together...at least for love that lasts when the party, youth, health &amp; money are long over &amp; gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for ages. People, women mostly, always rave about it saying that it's the most romantic movie, it's so sad, etc. I totally disagree. The dialogue is corny. There was a lot of overacting going on. The scene where she meets the old lady, I can't remember who exactly she is, is strange, awkward, uninteresting, and slightly irrelevent. The 2nd half of the movie, particularly the last scene, is extremely annoying. For people that have seen it, it's just frustrating that she just doesn't tell him what happened, not sad at all. Who cares about pride? I wasn't anywhere near tears in any moment of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I didn't mind the movie that much until the 2nd half. Also, I'm not the only girl in the whole world not to love this movie, even though there aren't many. This is a movie that you'll either love, or find really irritating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, consider me surprised and very impressed. After delivering two considerable disappointments in 'Duck Soup (1933)' and 'The Awful Truth (1937),' director Leo McCarey well-and-truly redeems himself with one of the finest romances I've ever seen, one of the few pictures with enough emotional depth to challenge 'City Lights (1931),' 'The Apartment (1960),' or even 'Casablanca (1942).' Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr illuminate the screen as two strangers who meet on an trans-Atlantic luxury cruise and finds themselves falling in love, only to be faced with their own impending marriages to other people. Funny, sensitive and extremely touching, 'An Affair to Remember (1957)' rarely puts a foot wrong in its stirring exploration of mature romance, with both stars delivering rich and authentic performances that complement the pleasant, bittersweet tone of the film. Milton R. Krasner's cinematography, captured using DeLuxe colour, gives the film ? particularly the scenes set in New York City ? a cold, wintry feel, making the ending even more poignant as the two lovers come together for a warm embrace.'An Affair to Remember' was a remake of McCarey's own 1939 film, 'Love Affair,' which starred Irenne Dunne and Charles Boyer. Then-acting veteran Cary Grant, who received his big break in the director's 'The Awful Truth,' plays Nickie Ferrante, a witty and debonair social playboy/failed artist, who, in the wedding event of the year, is due to marry wealthy socialite Lois Clark (Neva Patterson). On his luxury cruise to greet his would-be bride in New York, Nickie meets Terry McKay (a lovely Deborah Kerr), who is initially too proud and sensible to have anything to do with the notoriously charming Nickie, but nonetheless slowly falls for him. The pair attempt to hide their budding romance, to the amusement of their nosey fellow passengers, but soon they realise that their situation is simply inescapable. They plan a rendezvous in six months' time, on the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building, giving each other the opportunity to repair their uncertain lives and decide if they truly are in love with each other.What impressed me the most about McCarey's direction is how seamlessly he was able to blend together comedy, romance and drama. The first half of the film is very much a light-hearted romantic comedy, but the pair's departure from the ship proves an important turning-point in the tone of the story, and the audience is left gripping their seats, wondering anxiously "will they ever get together again?" The film's single misstep lies with the inclusion of two children's choir musical numbers, performed by a group of freckle-faced urchins under Terry's instruction. These songs have absolutely nothing to do with the story, and I suspect that their inclusion was purely a matter of extending the running time. Conversely, Kerr's musical numbers {her vocals dubbed by Marni Nixon} are touching and beautiful, fuelled with intense emotion, and lovely to listen to. The film's most tender sequence undoubtedly takes place at the the residence of Nickie's grandmother (Cathleen Nesbitt), who plays the piano as Terry begins the sing, the defining moment when we realise that Nickie and Terry are destined to fall in love.</fullReview>

As a result, she is wheel chair bound and will not allow herself to be seen by Grant in this condition.Naturally, by Hollywood standards, Grant finds her through a painting she has purchased.Love endures despite tragedy is the central theme to well made film.

		<shortDescription>"There is nothing wrong with Nicolo that a good woman couldn't make right."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"An Affair To Remember" might be a good name for the story, but as a movie, it's one I'll likely soon forget. With no disrespect to the principals, it's nothing I was expecting with Cary Grant in the cast. No stranger to romantic comedies, Grant was a blast in "The Philadelphia Story" (1940) and "His Girl Friday" from the same year; he even managed great comedic timing in the adventure story, "Gunga Din" (1939). So I'll have to assume that director Leo McCarey consciously stayed away from a more lively and spirited presentation. The result came off (for me at least) as a humorless relationship in which Nick Ferrante (Grant) and Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr) didn't seem to be having any fun at all. In fact, neither seemed to be having any fun in the romances they swap for their new one; and what was with that golf ball size knot on Grant's forehead at the beginning of the story?I say all this in retrospect, as I had some hope for the film as Nickie and Terry debarked from their cruise in Italy to visit with Grandmother Janou (Cathleen Nesbit). The locale of the Mediterranean home was nothing short of gorgeous, and Janou's response to Terry on wishing she could live there was deeply introspective - Terry was too young and would have to live long enough to create her own memories. That was probably my best takeaway from the film.The accident disrupting the Empire State Building rendezvous was indeed tragic, but I felt the aftermath played out in less than a realistic manner. Would a real person hide from their lover because of a tragedy like that, or would one seek them out to explain and hopefully continue a relationship? Terry couldn't locate Nick, (the most famous eligible bachelor it seemed in the world at the time), but didn't have any trouble sending a letter half way around the world to Grandmother. When Nick unexpectedly shows up at Terry's apartment, wouldn't one's impulse be to gesture upwards even if they couldn't walk? Instead, Kerr's character remains as lifeless as she had for the earlier part of the film. I don't know, maybe I'm being too critical, but the reactions of these two people didn't seem to be based in real life.So, "An Affair To Remember"? Sorry hopeless romantics, I think not.</fullReview>

They make a date to meet at the Empire State Building in 6 months but tragedy strikes...Pretty lousy--I love Grant and Kerr but they're at their worst here. The dialogue is clumsy and the script is truly unbearable. It also has people doing totally stupid things (like Kerr at the end) that make you despise all the characters. But worst of all are the kids. Kerr is a teacher and we have to sit through two truly horrendous "songs" the children are screeching out. It's seriously enough to make you cut your ears off so you can't hear them! After the first song Kerr is shown crying--she probably realized how hopeless the movie was. I thought after the first song we wouldn't be subjected to any more. To my utter horror we WERE! For the second song Kerr is lying in bed and they surround it. Good choice--the urchins singing would make anyone keel over. Also the lyrics are unintelligible (this is probably a good thing). What exactly was the point of having these kids sing in the first place? It adds nothing to the hackneyed plot or characters.It all ends with a scene that's supposed to make you cry. I was gagging! Just dreadful. I can't believe they keep referencing this film as a classic in "Sleepless in Seattle"--now THAT'S a good film! I caught this in a theatre that showed a restored print in beautiful color. It didn't help. People were openly smirking at the dialogue and I heard gasps (of horror) when the kids were trotted out. A total must-miss. I'm giving this a 1--wish I could go lower!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cheap sentimentality. Mawkish religiousity. Exploitation of children. An offensive racist scene. Patronizingly pious grandmother. Annoyingly fabricated on a sound stage -- and that distracting knot in the middle of Grant's forehead.Aside from that, its passable, lowbrow soap opera. Here's the story:Celebrity gigolo is engaged to ultrawealthy heiress but weasels out by 'falling' for another of his serial conquests. He is never turned down, so when she stands him up, his life is ruined (he becomes an unsuccessful painter). That is, until he discovers that she really didn't MEAN to stand him up and still finds him irresistible.Meanwhile, she is a lowclass broad who is a 'kept lady' of five years for a rich businessman who pays for some social polishing. She was clearly never in love with him, simply going along for the money and attention. When she runs across a professional seducer, she runs from her situation with her sugar daddy.A pious grandmother (his) works through prayer from both sides of the grave to influence a priest (hers) to support and encourage her to eventually come to him.This is what 50's America called a love story. No wonder the fifties invented the sixties.I do admit to admiring Grant's comic timing. What many call suaveness was his cool winking at the audience while playing a character -- a common stage technique. But it is charming and opened the door for Brando to reinvent film acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two people (Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr) meet and fall in love on a cruise, despite both being involved with other people. They agree to get all their ducks in a row and meet in six months at the top of the Empire State Building. But a terrible accident changes things for both of them. Leo McCarey's color remake of his own classic Love Affair doesn't quite match up to that film but is still very good on its own. That's due in large part to the chemistry and appeal of its two stars. It's a soaper, and it goes on way too long for one, but if you're inclined to like such films you'll probably love this one. It's got some flaws but also some strong points, such as the fine music score and the light, fun romantic comedy in the first half before things get heavy. This movie played a big part in Sleepless in Seattle, which brought it to the attention of a lot of viewers that might not normally watch older films. Hopefully most of them liked it. Love Affair would be remade again in 1994, a boring version that doesn't hold a candle to either of the first two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stately, heartwrenching, delicately beautiful, over-the-top romance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Affair to Remember (1957)Romance doesn't get any higher than this, and you don't get better than Cary Grant, here matched well with Deborah Kerr. Throw in an increasingly refined (not show-offy) widescreen color production (with the great Milton Krasner at the camera), and a generally opulent production, and you have a classic.A classic made more classic by the equally romantic "Sleepless in Seattle" and with echoes in the pair of Hawke/Delpy romances, "Before Sunrise," "Before Sunset." It makes you want to fall in love forever, because this is all about that extended moment where two people meet and something really clicks, quickly. And in the dizzy realization, sometimes at awkward times in their lives, the movies (all of them, in different ways) soar. Of course, the first source of all of these is "Love Affair," the 1939 movie directed by the same director, Leo McCarey. (There is also a miserable 1994 Warren Beatty version of "Love Affair.")The reason for all these similar movies is that main hook of the plot--two lovers meet and find true love, but must go separate ways, so they agree to meet six months later after taking care of other things. And, then, well, not everything is what you want in life, and there all the twists and tears begin. If you have any romantic drippiness in you at all, you'll love the idea, and love the movie. Grant and Kerr are both beautiful in a kind of stately way, and are a good match, even if you don't quite feel the chemistry you should. Indeed, the entire movie is stately (this is a product still of the new widescreen format, which often had cameramen making perfect but stable compositions that really worked the horizontal movement but left the camera less physical, less unpredictable).Which is fine. It's a romance with dignity, not wild passions. It's beautiful in every sense, and designed from the ground up to be classic. I actually prefer the 1939 version for the honesty of the romance, the feel of it, but it's hard to get a crystal clear copy of that one now that it's in the public domaine. This 1957 version is enshrined for other reasons, and as much as it's now dated, too, it's still technically clean and modern in other ways.What kills the movie in certain key parts (and it's painful to see how avoidable this was) is a series of inserted songs, especially some sung by children in the second half. It's worse than mere filler, it's clumsy distraction, and not well done, and not pertinent to the main plot. McCarey, for all his brilliance, has always had a sentimental side that tips into schmaltz and cornball antics (see The Bells of St. Mary's for examples of both). Here it clashes with what works so well.And what works so well works amazingly well, making the movie, despite its flaws, a repeatable, lovable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As light and fluffy as a Powder Puff dipped in one's favorite perfume - this affair is worth remembering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director, Leo McCarey's "An Affair to Remember" is a marvelous update to his own "Love Affair" ? made lush and lovely through Technicolor and Cinemascope for the post war generation. Cary Grant is Nicky Ferranti, a big time 'dame' hunter who is all set to marry an heiress when he falls, but hard, for Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr), the park avenue play-thing of a wealthy New York financier. As in the original, McKay and Ferranti discover that love may not be enough to keep their dreams alive, particularly after one of them suffers a tragic accident that alters the course for both their futures.This is the sort of 'bigger than life' melodrama that thrived in cinemas during the fifties. But McCarey's direction ? though solid - is slightly marred by the injection of several musical numbers; a shame since they are neither visually appealing, nor do they advance the story line. In fact, they bog it down. Regardless, there must be something to attribute the staying power of this movie - still a tear jerker after forty-five years.THE TRANSFER: When Fox Home Video first issued this movie on DVD it was widescreen but not enhanced for 16X9 televisions. There was a considerable amount of film and digital grit and colors, though dated throughout, seemed excessively garish and at times slightly mis-registered. There was also some slight edge enhancement and aliasing detected. I am happy to say that most of these anomalies have been corrected on the new "studio series" reissue, providing a much smoother, color consistent transfer that is a marked improvement over the previous DVD. This new version is also anamorphic.While fine film grain and dirt and scratches in the original print are still present, this time around, they are not obtrusive on the eye. The soundtrack is virtually identical to the previously released DVD. At times it has a nice spread. But this is the very same Dolby Surround mix that was imported from Fox's original laser disc, instead of being remastered to a 5.1 Dolby Digital. *Aside: almost all Cinemascope movies were originally recorded in six track magnetic stereo, so a revamped soundtrack for this movie should have been reconsidered.EXTRAS: an all too short documentary on the making of this movie that spends much of its time dishing dirt on Cary Grant, his medicinal use of LSD and a thwarted affair with Sophia Loren. Honestly, did I really need another American icon humiliated in this "tell-all" way? There are also some stills and a theatrical trailer. Overall, the extras are disappointing but hey, at roughly twenty dollars a pop - depending on where you buy this movie, I suppose the customer gets what he or she has paid for.BOTTOM LINE: Worthwhile.</fullReview>

The characters, scenes, humor, ad infinitum, are very special and beautiful. Cruise ship, villas and city sites were well pictured and made the story line come more alive. Cary Grant plays the love bachelor in his own special and unique way, and who could ask for a better counterpart than Deborah Kerr. Oh how I wish I had been Deborah Kerr in this movie. Love every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for every generation. Keep a box of Kleenex close!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do respect the opinions of others, but I'm hard pressed to sympathize with some critics of this movie. Bogey and Bergman were magic in Casablanca, as were other dynamic screen duos. For instance, Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn were incredible in Roman Holiday. I don't understand why Roman Holiday (or any other romantic feature) must be compared to Casablanca. I understand that in many ways Casablanca is the standard. But to compare An Affair to Remember with Casablance is like comparing apples to oranges. They are entirely different movies, made for different purposes--and unfortunately some folks just don't seem to appreciate that. Remember, Bogey and Grant brought different auras to the big screen. Casablanca and An Affair to Remember run in that same vein. To not appreciate both movies--for what each was intended to do--is somewhat of an injustice. Yes, religion and musical numbers are a bit overdone. And, if a sub plot is missing, Grant and Kerr squash that premise. They are brilliant. The movie is brilliant. Let's all remember that each movie is different. If we dislike a movie, let's not get caught in the trap of making nonsensical comparisons of one cinematic masterpiece to another. Good deal!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works Pretty Well After a Slow Start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a surprisingly slow start, "An Affair to Remember" picks up steam and ends up being a worthwhile, if somewhat uneven, movie with a few particularly good moments. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr work well in the lead roles. Once the script gives them a chance, they make the most out of the material, and the last part has some memorable scenes that are deservedly well-remembered.The first few scenes just aren't very good, and the main story could have probably have been set up in a number of better ways. Neither of the main characters is just very interesting in these opening scenes. In the earlier 1939 Charles Boyer/Irene Dunne version, the first part was also the weaker part of the movie, but for whatever reason, it seems even slower in this remake.The scene when the two leads visit Grant's grandmother (Cathleen Nesbitt) injects life and interest into the story, and it becomes not only watchable but worthwhile. The grandmother character is believable and sympathetic, and her interactions with the two main characters finally give you a reason to care about them. This scene's impact on the plot is only moderate, but it changes the tone of the movie as a whole. The well-known scenes later on would not have had so much impact without a welcome change in the film's atmosphere. Grant and Kerr can then take it from there.Overall, it ends up working pretty well. It's too uneven to be considered among the best films of its kind, but it does have some very good scenes, and it has more than enough good material to make it worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I watched this movie and enjoyed it very much. The coincidences in the movie were far fetched but made for a good story. The detour off the ship to visit Nikki's grandmother was important in order to develop the characters of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Cary Grant gives a great performance and maintains a consistency in the portrayal of his character. Deborah Kerr also played her part very well. Performances by supporting roles all do their job well. The performances by the children were well done and heart warming. I especially enjoyed the way that Grant and Kerr reunite. The accident gives the movie a sad note and the ending doesn't answer all questions but overall it was very enjoyable. I give it two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Tear Jerkers of Them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can one say about An Affair To Remember? Sure, it's a little long in playing time, a little hokey, so don't watch this movie unless you're a complete romantic like I am, because this is the greatest tear jerkers of them all. You think the ending to this movie is silly? Well-l-l-l you should see what the ending of Snow White and Bambi still does to me when I watch these movies over and over and over! Yip! Niagra Falls in my living room, so if you're going to watch this movie and have never seen it before, if you're a romantic, you'd better have a box of Kleenex by your side, because you know something is about to happen when Vic Damone starts singing the title song for the movie when the credits are being shown!Everyone knows the story line, so we won't go into it, but here's a few facts that some people don't know. When Deborah Kerr made "The King and I", part of the singing she did, and part of the singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon who went on to fame by dubbing 100% for Natalie Wood in West Side Story and partial dubbing for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady, and Nixon even got a chance to sing for herself as one of the Nuns in the movie version of The Sound of Music. There are many stories about The King and I and the dubbing. One time Deborah Kerr was on a T.V. talk show and she stated that Nixon helped her out with only the high notes, but if you listen carefully to the soundtrack album, the dubbing is done so well that it's very difficult to make out who's singing and who isn't. In "Shall I Tell You What I Think of You" it's easy to distinguish when it's Deborah Kerr and when it's Marnie Nixon if you listen very close. "Shall We Dance" is all Deborah Kerr herself. In "Getting to Know You" the beginning is Deborah Kerr, but then Nixon takes over, or does she? And, of course, "Hello Young Lovers" is all Nixon, but let's go on with "An Affair To Remember": Guess who sings for Deborah Kerr in an An Affair to Remember? You got it! Marni Nixon strikes again! I love the song An Affair to Remember, but the one I particuarly like from the film is "Tommorrowland" as sung by Nixon! So, all your romantics out there, if you've never seen the previous versions of this film, you're not aware what you're in for, and the last scene is very tense and very emotional. So, get out the Kleenex, because I've seen this movie many, many times, and everytime I see it, I say to myself, "I know what these lunatics that produced this movie are up to, and THIS TIME I'm not going to get caught up in this ending as before and I won't need any Kleenex", and then that last scene comes up; Cary Grant knows somethings wrong because Debbie Girl hasn't made one move off that couch; he goes into the bedroom and sees the painting and the wheelchair, walks back into the living room and sees Deborah Kerr still on the couch but this time crying:KERR: Please don't look at me like that! GRANT: If it had to be one of us, why couldn't it have been me? KERR: It was no ones fault. I was looking up at heaven! Oh, Nicky, if you can learn to paint; I can learn to walk again! You think?And he wipes her tears off her face, they embrace and the last lines of An Affair to Remember are sung romantically by the studio chorus as the camera looks out the window with the snow falling, and I feel like a damn fool because:THEY DID IT TO ME AGAIN!And if you think this movie puts you on a crying jag, try watching "Imitation of Life" with Lana Turner, and a little known movie "The Gift of Love" with Lauren Bacall. Put all three of these moves back to back and you'll become an emotional lunatic that doesn't know why by this time that the little men in their white coats haven't come out from behind the furniture and dropped their nets on you and taken you off to the funny farm because of all that emotional blubbering you're doing!Lord! I just love those smoochy, insane emotional endings; don't you? Where's my box of Kleenex?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie you watch to get away from reality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Affair to Remember is one of those movies that you can sit at home and watch when you want to escape from the realities of life and stare at gorgeous Cary Grant and his way of delivering a line.The movie is about a rich man (Cary Grant) who is to marry a woman back in America. He must take a boat back to America to get there. On the trip he meets another woman(Deborah Kerr) and is interested in her. They meet in secret, trying to hide their affection for one another. He takes her to France when the ship is at a stop and she meets his grandma. I love this part because the song of the movie "Love Affair" is sung. Most beautiful sounding love song. They both do fall in love, but they decide to test their love by not having any interaction for 6 months. Grant's character decides to change his rich ways and not marry the woman he was supposed to and Kerr's character gets a job.They are to meet at the empire state building but something goes very wrong. I won't say the rest but you find yourself rooting for them all the way.Its a chick flick, any girl that watches it is bound to love it. It's one of those movies that really does leave you with a good feeling at the end...and sometimes we need that good feeling in our lives. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Affair to Remember" is always associated with the words 'cheesy,' 'unreal,' and the ubiquitous statement, 'That movie's a chick flick!' However, I think it's a great movie. People always think of the end, which some pass off as sappy. I, on the other hand, think it's beautiful. The looks Cary Grant gets on his face say more than words ever could. And people: there's a great movie before the end! It's a movie filled with romance, and believe it or not, tons of comedy! After all, it's a Leo McCarey movie...the man behind "Duck Soup" and "The Awful Truth." In my opinion, this is one of Cary Grant's greatest performances. He's his usual debonair self, but in this, his heart gets broken. His acting is superb! And Deborah Kerr is radiant, as always. This is a movie that should be appreciated by everyone (yes, including men!) Sure, maybe it's not for everyone. But see it before you make harsh judgments against it. :)</fullReview>

He and she meet on a cruise, hit it off, fall for each other, then arrive in NYC where their intendeds wait for them. They agree to meet in 6 months, July 1st, on the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building. That will give both of them time to break off engagements, and get jobs, she again as a singer, he as a painter (artist). As he waits on July 1st, she is hit by a car, he doesn't find out until Christmas why she didn't show up. He brings her his deceased French grandmother's shawl, learns the true story, she says, "If you can paint, then I can walk again." Good story, well-acted by both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic despite...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies which seem perfect throughout -- that is, they don't have dull spots, distracting or superfluous sub-plots or lapses, and every aspect adds to the storyline and the viewers' enjoyment. The classics "Casablanca," "Citizen Kane," "Five Easy Pieces," and even, say, the lighter "Pillow Talk" are examples.However, many films, including some like this one - also deserving of being designated "classic," aren't successful in this regard.First, neither Deborah Kerr, nor the kids for whom she was music instructor, could sing for sour apples. The kids were more annoying than cute, and their songs likewise. Cary Grant sometimes looked as if he were simply delivering lines as he modeled countless changes of clothes, on behalf of some major clothier. And their activities together on shipboard, in the early portion of the film, often went over the thin line -- from cute or funny, to silly and annoying. I know that in the 50's, romantic scenes and situations were forbidden which would be acceptable on daytime t.v. today. But surely there could have been at least a hint of passion between these two engaging, attractive personalities.Cary Grant has been gone for a number of years, and Deborah Kerr is now in her mid-80's. And despite the shortcomings, this film now provides a nostalgic view of these two handsome, likable people 50 years ago -- and schmaltzy can be entertaining and heartfelt.I just wish they'd have cut the annoying singing sessions, added a bit more zest to their romance, and shown a little more detail than the few clichés they delivered to one another at the film's climax.A 9* presentation nonetheless. Could have been one of those which you's give 10* and wish the scale went a lot higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To me this remains Cary Grant's best film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is there to "Remember?" For one, this version begins with a haunting title tune sung by Vic Damone as gentle snowflakes daintily descend on what we presume is New York's Central Park. Wide screen and De Luxe color are added and the new title (from the older, simpler "Love Affair") signifies something more promising and alluring. Aside from this, the plot remains essentially the same with legendary director Leo McCarey again at the helm. The thing I remember most, however, is 53-year-old Cary Grant never looking better playing the carefree playboy, traveling on luxury liners and getting engaged to beautiful women he has no intention of ever marrying. Grant by now had been on Hollywood's A-list for over 20 years and, perhaps more so than any other older star, was concerned about his long-established image. Thus a tried-and-true remake with a director he'd worked with thrice before made for familiar territory.Essentially a comedy in the first half, the film shifts into serious mode when the girl he meets and discovers he truly loves and wants to marry is also engaged to be married. Deborah Kerr shines at her loveliest and the two plan to meet six months later to see if they are still serious about each other. But fate intervenes and when Grant thinks his girl has jilted him, he turns to drink and painting to overcome his pain. But surprisingly his pain turns into profit when his paintings begin to really sell as never before. In addition, he ends his playboy ways and becomes a human being! Thus we get to see this affair is certainly worth remembering with such wonders to behold.But getting back Debbie is another thing. Although still unmarried, to her eyes her eligibility has been damaged due to landing in a wheel chair from an accident. But when he arrives at her apartment to bring her a shawl his late granny has bequeathed her, he doesn't notice her disability. Debbie, you see, feared he'd want her only out of pity and her pride couldn't allow that. But we already know that Cary has had to swallow his own damaged pride...so why can't she? Well...love thieves are finally conquered and they are united despite her damaged state. "If it had to happen to one of us, why did it have to be you?" Cary asks her when he realizes the truth. "If you can paint. I can walk," Debbie says all misty-eyed...and by this time we are all kinda the same. He truly loves her more than ever, she finds out, and miracles do happen.This film gave new life to Grant's career and for another decade he would enjoy, and so would we, hit after hit, more than holding his own against younger actors. His charm proved endless and the screens of today could use this. Miracles can happen off screen as well as on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Affair To Remember" is a classic Hollywood movie that got a boost from the movie "Sleepless In Seattle." You could understand what the characters in "Seattle" felt while watching the movie.Nickie (Ever-suave Cary Grant)meets Terry on a cruise and fall deeply in love, despite the fact that both of them are engaged to other people. So, a pact is made: that within 6 months, they would meet each other on the top of the Empire State Building. Of course, in typical Hollywood fashion, Terry doesn't make it (She's hit by a car) and Nickie, feeling like he was abandoned, is deeply hurt. Will he ever see her again? And if so, what would his reaction be when he sees her in her current state? When he finally does find out, in one of the most memorable scenes, it breaks the heart. You can see his reaction when he discovers the truth, a mix of emotions that just tears at the heart and get the tear ducts flowing. Classic Hollywood moment! When you watch it, have the Kleenex ready!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can paint, I can walk!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with a poster who suggested the Zucker brothers rise to the challenge of remaking "An Affair to Remember". The lines are hilarious! It reminds me of the 1973 remake of Lost Horizon, another turkey. However, I give this 3 stars, because Cary Grant is, well, Cary Grant. He is smart and beautiful and always stands apart from the dialogue, although he is of course, a good actor as well. I also agree that Grant and Deborah Kerr had no chemistry. She reminded me (as someone once said of Julie Andrews),of having "all the sex appeal of a very efficient dietitian." Yes, there were elements of this movie that reminded me of the Sound of Music. Perhaps it was the cinematography. I think this film would have been better had it remained on the boat. That part, although silly, was light and funny. The transformation of the suave, handsome Cary Grant to a billboard painter in overalls is worthy again of the Zucker touch. come to think of it, the Zuckers couldn't top that!When Deborah Kerr walked in front of whatever hit her, it reminded me of the scene from Plan 9 from Outer Space. That work has Bela Lugosi leaving his front lawn only to be instantly hit by a car off camera. That was hilarious in and of itself, but the same scene with Deborah Kerr flouncing and singing her way to the Empire State Building and thus being mowed down by a taxi, was a close second.The movie was not logical, if she loves a man why did she not let him know what happened? And if he could paint she could walk, wouldn't the reverse be true? If she could walk, he could paint! Therefore, following the logic of this movie, all he had to do at the beginning was watch her walk around and he would have become a great painter. Oh yes, and by the way, the little intercity cherubs that she taught from her perch reminded me of the children in Lost Horizon. I don't mind chick flicks,being a chick myself or at least an old hen; I don't mind sentimental movies, &amp; I certainly don't mind Cary Grant, but I do mind scenes, characters and dialogue crafted to manipulate the audience. Come to think of it I should rate this a 2.Nah, I really like the beautiful well written scenes with the grandmother. Wait... come to think of it, one of the worst scenes in this movie occurred during that segment. It was the chapel scene when Deborah got down on her knees and prayed, and Cary Grant watched her with growing awareness that this was the gal for him; he also prayed and I think even crossed himself. OMG no I think I'll rate this flick a 1.</fullReview>

Nicky is traveling to meet his fiancée, the inheritor of one of the greatest fortunes in USA, and Terry is returning to the arms of her supportive boy-friend. They schedule a meeting on the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building six months later to decide whether they should marry each other, but Terry has an accident and she is not able to reunite with him."An Affair to Remember" is one of my favorite romances ever, certainly one of the most beautiful love stories of the cinema industry. Beginning with the amazing chemistry between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, the nostalgic and unforgettable story has romance, drama, funny situations, being witty and very delightful. The music score and the cinematography and costumes are also very beautiful and Oscar winners. Yesterday I have probably watched this movie for the fourth or fifth time, and I still become very touched with such lovely romance.

		<fullReview>An Affair to Remember is a movie which begins with great promise. Unfortunately that promise ends up being well and truly squandered. Cary Grant plays Nickie Ferrante, a well-known playboy-type sailing from Europe to New York. Waiting for him in New York is his exceedingly wealthy fiancée. Their wedding is huge news, the famous ladies' man settling down. Reporters can't wait to get a piece of Nickie when he gets to New York. But on the ship there are complications. Those complications come in the form of Terry McKay, played by Deborah Kerr. Terry, much like Nickie, has a lover waiting for her in America. But, despite a seeming initial distaste for one another upon first meeting, Nickie and Terry fall in love. Theirs is a very chaste affair, this is a film made in 1957 after all, but there is no doubt that by the time they get to New York Nickie and Terry desperately want to be with one another. So then what? Well sadly then the movie falls apart.Grant and Kerr have an easy, appealing chemistry as their characters fall in love aboard the ship. Their efforts to keep their newfound relationship hidden away from the prying eyes of their shipmates are amusing. When the ship docks briefly in France a visit by the couple to Nickie's wonderfully sweet grandmother warms the heart. It is during this visit that they realize their true feelings for one another. Back on the ship they go and there is no longer any pretense: they're in love. But their being in love will cause all kinds of problems. Nickie is about to be married and, with no income of his own, marriage to a very wealthy woman can be quite useful. Meanwhile Terry's boyfriend seems to have marriage on the brain too. Can Nickie and Terry extricate themselves from their respective relationships? Should they? Toss away these long-standing relationships to be with someone you just met? Nickie and Terry come up with a plan. They'll take some time apart, sort things out and reconnect months later. The best laid plans...So, things don't really go according to plan. The movie contrives a way to keep Nickie and Terry apart. And thus does the movie fall to pieces. Whatever charm the movie had with Grant and Kerr working together is completely lost when they're apart. The second half of the film is a boring slog. Quite a drag. Then a bunch of kids show up out of nowhere for a couple of truly excruciating musical numbers. By this point the movie is a total disaster. It would be bad enough if there was at least a reason to keep Nickie and Terry away from one another. But there isn't, there's just one character being so stubborn and stupid that it's mind-boggling. It's a false way to try to create drama and it fails miserably. The movie just goes on and on, going on for so long that you forget why you were ever interested in the first place. The great promise shown in the first half of the movie comes to nothing. And then after boring you to tears for the better part of an hour the film rushes through a climax which is absurdly jarring and abrupt. Add it all up and this becomes a movie to forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...especially if that man is being played by Cary Grant! I'm not going to spoil it for you by repeating WHAT Grant's character says that sounds ridiculous, I'll let you watch and find out. I'd just like to know what kind of bucks the studio held out to Grant to get him to speak some of these lines, which are mainly the lines every woman wants to hear from a man who looks and moves like Cary Grant.The idea behind this film is that two people on the threshold of middle age - at least in the 1950's - meet on a long cruise and fall in love. So far, so good. But there are complications, or else there would be no movie. Both are involved with wealthy members of the opposite sex and have no money or real skills of their own. They agree to try to make a go of it independently, having no contact with the other, and to meet at the top of the Empire State Building six months from the day of landing in New York if all works out. Complications ensue.You are obviously setting yourself up for disaster or at least miscommunication and bitterness if you say things like "if one of us doesn't show up, no questions". No grudge maybe, but no questions, no bothering to find out what went wrong? Wouldn't it just eat at you not knowing during the six months if the other person just forgot all about this plan in the first place and you are eking out a living for nothing? I shall now prepare to be pelted by eggs, tomatoes, and tear stained handkerchiefs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RARELY do I rate any film above "8". This wonderful Grant/Kerr film is a 9. Great eye candy also for those who love well-done 1950s film and costuming! And...being 1950s, the sexual stuff is subtle...No need to quickly change the scene if Junior walks through the room! From the initial posting, you can get the plot gist. On board one of those ocean crossing shiplines of the 1950s, Famous gigolo,(Cary Grant) about to marry a beautiful millionaire, does not HESITATE to pounce on beautiful kept woman (Deborah Kerr). She, experienced in brushing off men, suggests they just have fun doing -only- the public shipboard activities (Note that unlike airplanes, ships might take a few weeks to cross...and some...like this ship...might make a few port stops...) Both live off their stunning looks...neither truly loves (i.e. would sacrifice, protect, cherish, stay faithful to...) the one(s) they are currently with.Enter...GRANDMA. At one of the few-hour ship port stops, Teri McKay encounters Nicky's Grandma. Here the plot turns! This wonderful lady blends sophistication and spirituality...and sums up grandson Nicky Ferrante and friend Teri McKay quite well. She subtly directs them back to God, and they experience a spiritual and romantic love awakening.Two transformed people reboard the ship back to NYC...There, they vow...to separate, work and save money, and then meet in 6 months at the top observation deck of the Empire State Building. How wise...as they are not used to sexual and emotional faithfulness! But...trouble happens. Will both stay faithful...to God and to each other? Will Nicky succumb to his former rich fiancé's call to come back? You know how it will end, but the joy of this film is in the journey!...All who come out of a life of sexual, emotional damage and chaos should take heart. There truly is a way back for any of us...!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch this movie superficially or impatiently, you might write it off as yet another trite Hollywood melodrama. If, however, you are willing to watch more carefully and suspend your disbelief, you can't help admiring the workman-like perfection at display here: great, legendary actors; assured direction (by the veteran of Hollywood comedies, going back to the 1930s, Leo McCarey); smart, witty screenplay and dialogues (by McCarey and another indisputable Hollywood master Delmer Daves -- the screenplay is so good, in fact, that it has already spawned 3 remakes over 7 decades); excellent score and original songs, created specifically for this remake (_An Affair to Remember_ being itself a remake of McCarey's own _Love Affair_ from 1939); sumptuous costumes (showcased mainly by Deborah Kerr), settings, and French Riviera backdrops (connecting this movie, via Cary Grant, with Hitchcock's milieu for _To Catch a Thief_ from 2 years before) presented in scintillating early-color photography.The plot itself is wildly implausible and unrealistic; and I find it hard to believe the mutual attraction between Grant's and Kerr's character, especially from Grant's side, as evinced from the very start of this movie.Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are fantastic actors, and there are many occasions and small moments in _An Affair to Remember_ to admire their supreme acting skills; still, I thought as if they were admirable more as separate persons and actors, rather than as a pair here.The weird age relations of the characters might have something to do with it; Cary Grant does seem slightly too old for the role of a desirable bachelor; Deborah Kerr is also anything but a teenager, and on the brink of being too old for her role as well (notwithstanding their mutual admission of having "missed the spring of our lives"); and the much-maligned grandmother might much more realistically be Grant's mother instead of grandmother.Speaking of the grandmother, I found that perhaps the strongest sequence of the movie; some viewers complain that it is too long -- but that's *precisely* what I liked about the sequence; it's *not* meant to be a "side-show", an off-the-cuff episode inserted in the middle of an oceanic voyage. Nope, the encounter with the grandmother is supposed to be of *central* importance to the characters' development, and their mutual relationship; and it is just that. The old lady plays the piano, giving a little concerto, accompanied by Deborah Kerr's (dubbed) singing, but what we're really looking at in those minutes (in the luscious French Riviera surroundings), is a concerto of three brilliant actors, because Cathleen Nesbitt is every bit as admirable and believable in these scenes as Grant and Kerr.The scene at the chapel with the couple hesitantly (especially in Grant's case) praying is wonderful. Then you can forgive the director for inserting the "positive Catholic" overtones into the movie perhaps a little bit heavy-handedly (the chapel as a safe haven; the good-natured pastor; all the Christmas songs).One might similarly argue about the singing kids; we again find people complaining about those sequences being too long -- but that's exactly what I appreciated about them; I did not really enjoy the singing, the music, or the kids themselves; rather, I appreciated the *idea* of inserting such long, seemingly irrelevant sequences into a movie whose focus is elsewhere; you can see here the director/screenwriter Leo McCarey willing to go "against the grain", to do the unexpected, to jar the viewers' expectations a bit, and such courage is always something positive.Also, while one might at first hastily condemn the 2 leading characters as shallow, superficial people, as "higher-ups" disconnected from real life and its challenges, this is most certainly not true; even during the sea voyage, when everything still seems to be going well, so well that the only thing these 2 people seem to be concerned about, is flirting -- even in those moments, there are serious overtones behind and beneath all the banter; the dialogues are smart enough to let you sense that what we're really watching is 2 people struggling to find meaning and fulfilment in their lives; they're lost, but grasping for straws; isn't that the topic of all great and serious art? In the movie's second half, both of them need to find and pursue regular people's jobs, and their disconnectedness from "regular people" therefore dissolves into thin air.To sum up, a "Hollywood romantic comedy" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a legitimate and important genre within the art of film-making. _An Affair to Remember_ delivers a fine specimen and will no doubt be perceived by many as representative for the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I preface this by saying this movie was one of my mothers all time favorites, and she and her girlfriend watched it so many times that they actually spoke the dialog as it occurred.In my own view, it has two very apt stars in the main roles and it builds the story nicely. A couple meet and fall in love but are separated after making a pact to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months. Of course fate steps in and she has an accident rushing to meet him, but like all good Romances Love finds a way through.A good judge of any movie is the way it is imitated or referred to by other movies and this one fares well in that regard.One of the top 100 movies to see before the Appocalypse</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real old-fashioned weepie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of very few movies that are referenced extensively in another film (Sleepless in Seattle). If you have seen that film you will already know the plot of this one. It is surprising to note the late date of this film - 1957. A lot was about to change forever in the world of movies, but this film retains all the grandeur and melancholy of a bygone age. The movie has numerous weaknesses, not least of which is the ridiculous laughter and general archness of the other passengers aboard the ship. Also the dialogue between Grant and Kerr is not as clever nor as funny as it seems. Kerr is forced to play it in an unrealistic, high style which is at odds with her natural inclination. The intrusion of a children's choir adds pathos at a crucial moment, but some see it as an over-the-top irrelevance (but I do like the songs).Now for the good stuff. Deborah Kerr is luminous throughout the film. She should certainly have won an Oscar for her portrayal of a woman forced by a terrible accident to forgo the love of her life. Cary Grant plays his part admirably, though he can never be anybody other than himself. The interlude in his grandmother's villa is a little melodramatic masterpiece. Overall the movie has a sweetness which most people will find it hard to resist. It is widely regarded as one of the great romantic Hollywood productions, and rightly so. Indeed, an affair to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot add anything to the other excellent reviews here,except to heartily agree with them. However,I thought you might like a small piece of trivia? Leo McCarey,the director of "An Affair to Remember" made a previous version (called Love Affair) in 1939. It starred Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer.I think it was in black and white,and might explain why he made another version in colour in 1957. Sadly,I have never seen the 1939 version,but would like to.It appears to have the same plot as the 1957 version,it would be very interesting to compare the two.Of course I am so used to the 1957 Grant/Kerr version that I might be biased. It is available on DVD. BTW,did you know that Cathleen Nesbit(The Grandmother) was the fiancé of the poet Rupert Brooke,until he died in WW1?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I watched this on my OnDemand station again this morning and, once again, cried like a baby at the end. I marvelat how palpable the pain of their separation and subsequent end of the intense affair truly was.I don't know why it evokes such emotion, but surely, it does. Much as I LOVE this movie, I do agree with the review that initially drew my attention to the IMDb website as I was curious as to see what the negative was to which it referred. I felt somewhat proud of myself for picking up exactly the same take from the movie, i.e., the children's parts in the movie. Even the scene with the little boy on the ship who somehow gets himself 'stuck' on the railing is weak and strange and, if my perception is correct, I detect Cary Grant's lips moving in sync with the child's lines! It seemed almost painful for Grant himself! But the scene that was so painful to watch that upon my 2nd time watching I had the privilege of OnDemand fast/forwarding is when Deborah Kerr is teaching the children their song. Good grief, these have to be actual children from some 50s orphanage that somehow got wind of a casting opportunity. It might have been semi-entertaining if, forgive me for saying, if they had actual talent. Other than this scene, and even the children's visitation to the bedroom scene which was also equally clumsy, I know I will be remembering this movie (no pun intended) for a very long time! One can only surmise the "happy ending" to be that Cary Grant wanted her, even in her handicapped state! At least, that's the end of the story for me and being a hopeless romantic who met and married my husband within 3 months of meeting him (30 years now) I am riding it until the wheels fall off!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This marvelous romance transports us back to a different time, when passions were just as they are now, but repressed, if with difficulty.Deborah Kerr is magnificent, keeping her control, yet radiating her inner feelings in unmistakable glances, pauses and such. Cary Grant, yes, who could possibly imagine themselves as Cary Grant, not even himself.It is a proper romantic comedy, but it is set in the time of Elvis, Little Richard, Fats Domino and Bill Haley. "An Affair to Remember" teeters precariously on the brink of sentiment and soapsuds, yet pulls back from those traps every time.We will never know why a ship sailing from England to New York City stops at the French Riviera. Perhaps to view the films for that year at Cannes. "Friendly Persuasion" takes the Palme d'or, but the jury prizes are shared by Andrzej Wajda's gritty "Kanal" and Ingmar Bergman's classic, "The Seventh Seal." It is as if we are crossing from a time of then to a time of now."An Affair" was one of the last of its mannered kind, a film that could both hold belief and hold off the coarser, more open world that had already claimed its foothold.</fullReview>

Of course it has its weaknesses: some of it is a bit dated (though some aspects could be favourably judged nowadays, like the fact that a garment could be a deeply personal gift then, before the pr?t-?-porter revolution), and the secondary characters are quite sketchy.But Grant and Kerr deserve tremendously to be the sole focus of attention, disguising all that with a perennial joint performance.

		<fullReview>MOVIE TITLE: An Affair to Remember COUNTRY: USA YEAR: 1957 RATING: 7/10I'm writing this review after watching back-to-back this and Warren Beatty's "Love Affair" (1994) which, in my opinion, is a direct remake of "An Affair to Remember" rather than "Love Affair" (1939), starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. The 1957 picture starts rather strongly with all those exchanges between Kerr and Grant in the ocean-liner, culminating with their visit to Janou, after which they realize they cannot escape each other anymore. This "crescendo" is very well done. The dialog is nice, Grant and Kerr have chemistry and the Janou episode has the necessary impact. On the other hand, "Love Affair", surely trying to give a more contemporary feeling, opts to create a plot involving a rather turbulent plane trip in way to get the characters into the boat which will lead them to the "old lady" scene. For someone who does not know the plot this can seem almost a mess, but comes to work fairly, not more. Up to this point, "An Affair to Remember" is more interesting than "Love Affair". However, as soon the 1994 film gets to the scene with Ginny (wonderful Katharine Hepburn) it gets a 360 degrees turn, truly becoming a great romantic story. And it's precisely at this moment that the movie reviewed here starts to loose its charm. The second half of the film has much more strength on the Beatty/Bening version. In the 1957 picture everything becomes more tame, even Terry's accident, much more meaningful in 1994. The same for the concert hall scene. Warren Beatty and Annette Bening outdo Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in most of the scenes. In this second half, the writing is also clearly more interesting in "Love Affair". Both movies end with the exact same scene. Although I have a slight preference for the 1957 version, I find both male actors could have been a little better in this particular moment. They don't fail to deliver, it's just both Kerr and Bening appear more at home here. All in all, "An Affair to Remember" is a rather good romantic movie let down by a slightly inferior second half. Maybe it was the shooting, maybe the writing. It just doesn't work as well for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER (Leo McCarey, 1957) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romantic tearjerkers were never a preferred subgenre of mine (even when they were laced with sophisticated comedy touches, as here) ? which is why I had never watched this popular title until now, despite being aware of its reputation, its having repeatedly turned up on TV (including a local channel) and the fact that it starred my favorite Hollywood star, Cary Grant; I relented now in view of the latter's recent 110th birthday and its inclusion in a couple of all-time best films polls. That said, I did catch the even more renowned LOVE AFFAIR (1939) ? of which this is a remake (by the same director, no less!)?but, then, I have no interest in checking out the 1994 version (despite the presence of Warren Beatty and Katharine Hepburn). Incidentally, this marks yet another example in a curious trend prevalent around this time among veteran Hollywood directors (like Frank Capra, John Ford, Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock) ? that of 'upgrading' their own earlier successes!Anyway, this is a glossy Fox effort in color and Cinemascope, given added commercial appeal by its title tune (sung by Vic Damone): the central casting, however, is really what makes it work ? Grant, Deborah Kerr and Cathleen Nesbitt standing in for Charles Boyer, Irene Dunne and Maria Ouspenskaya. As always, Grant is basically playing himself here, that is to say, the epitome of a ladies' man; indeed, his impending marriage to a prominent society woman is seen making the news the world over in the very opening scene! He meets and falls for Kerr (who has promised to tie the knot with her own boyfriend) during an ocean voyage. Despite their attempts to keep a low-profile on board ship, the couple cannot fool the nosy crew and passengers. They decide to pull their hair down on the last day of the trip, knowing they must part soon after. To this end, they opt to have a go at the life awaiting them in New York but, if it fails, they are to meet in six months' time atop the Empire State Building. So far, the film maintains a light mood, albeit punctuated by nostalgia (their visit to Grant's French grandmother, who takes an instant liking to Kerr) and melancholy.The second half does go overboard with contrivances: the heroine meets with an accident on the day she is to be reunited with Grant; oblivious to this, he believes he has been stood up and grows bitter. Eventually, he attends a theatrical performance with his former intended, only to run into Kerr and her own ex-flame (now devoted to taking care of the crippled woman). In the meantime, the narrative grows even more saccharine with Kerr's taking charge of a children's choir (for the record, we are treated to numerous songs throughout the film?since the leading lady also unconvincingly takes up work temporarily as a chanteuse, the actress' voice dubbed ? as had been the case with THE KING AND I {1956} ? by Marni Nixon)! Anyway, Grant (who has similarly reprised his once-promising painting career to support himself) finally decides to confront her on Christmas Day: it takes him a long time to realize the state she is in, however, though the moment is movingly depicted ? when he tells Kerr that his picture of her (wearing the shawl his grandmother had wished the woman to have) was purchased by a disabled lady, only to find it in his beloved's bedroom!The copy of the film I own is culled from the SE DVD issued as part of Fox's esteemed "Studio Classics" line (subsequent releases, featured even more supplements!) ? though I chose not to listen to the Audio Commentary at this juncture (being especially wary of its considerable 115-minute length), the stills gallery did not work on my player, while the 24-minute "Making Of" documentary will be dealt with separately.</fullReview>

Reworking of Leo McCarey's "Love Affair" from 1939, again directed by McCarey who also co-adapted the script with Delmer Daves to better suit the talents of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. The mood is jovial and bouncy for the film's first part, melodramatic for the second, and maudlin by its third act--however, if you're attuned to the softly glazed narrative and manipulative changing of moods, you might be moved by the contrived plotting. Grant is debonair and reserved, not a hair or expression out of place; he's a potentially good match for Kerr, though the actor is unable to make this character humble or vulnerable. He certainly looks good and is well-cast, but the plastic coating is so glossy and thick, he and Kerr are swallowed up by the sumptuous production. This is a big, classy romantic weeper, yet a distinctly mechanical one with preconceived heartbreak. Story reworked again in 1994 with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening as "Love Affair". ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicky Ferrante is what you would call a man of the world, whilst on a European tour he meets gorgeous singer Terry McKay. Despite the fact that both Nicky &amp; Terry are very much in love with other parties, they fall madly in love with each other. Finding themselves bent out of shape with their situation, they decide to cool down for six months and agree to meet up at the top of the Empire State Building to then see if the burning flame of love still burns bright.Even before watching this film for a first viewing i felt like i had seen it a hundred times, such is the legendary status it has gained thru numerous imitations and word of mouth romanticism. Here director Leo McCarey remakes his own 1939 film Love Affair with two bona fide leading stars. Cary Grant &amp; Deborah Kerr take the reins and lift above average, what is nothing more than a melodramatic fluffy romantic tale asking the question that if one is in love with someone, can you still fall in love with another?. Grant &amp; Kerr do just fine playing off each other with a believable sense of puzzlement to their plight, yet it's only when fate deals a rather nasty twist do we see the best of both actors. An Affair To Remember feels in texture very much of its time. But of course the boundless joys and troubles that come with love will forever make a good story to make a film out of, but as great as the longevity of a love story has, An Affair To Remember is to me a film that can only totally impact the very first time. But that's not to say it should not be revisited, it's just a film that dims on appeal with each subsequent viewing.So for first time viewers only, open the wine, get the Kleenex ready, and enjoy with the one you love, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love In a Time of Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I lived through every minute of the 1950's. Our middle class lives had iron hoops of restraint, decorum, and sublimation that exploded in the 1960's. "An Affair to Remember" did nothing to disrupt those conventions.Rather, it celebrated an escape from the merely comfortable. The central characters set their plush but routine lives aside to actively embrace love's uncertain adventure. They did so within boundaries that suburban households would have recognized and honored.Two of the most accomplished actors ever to touch the giant screen took front and center. Their highly stylized, glamorously stylish portrayals presented enduring truths within a dramatic setting as ritualized as a classical Japanese Noh play. The truths came through the fully realized performances, not the formal devices used to frame them.Don't look for the raw-edged 50's neo-realism of "La Strada" (Fellini, 1954, Italy), "Los Olvidados" (Bunuel, 1950, Mexico), "Roshomon" (Kurosawa, 1950, Japan), or "Pather Panchali" (Ray, 1954, India). Those films offered the illusion of naked life thrust at you in stark black and white. "On the Waterfront" (Kazan, 1954), "From Here To Eternity" (Zinnemann, 1953), and "Baby Doll" (Kazan, 1956) tried to capture that unguarded quality in more traditional Hollywood dramas."An Affair to Remember" has a look as alien to that approach to movie making as the filmed ballets of Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. In this aspect it certainly remains rooted to its time. John Ford's "The Searchers" (1956), Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" (1958), and the musical "Oklahoma!" (1955) all partook of the same wide-screen, non-realistically-colored, highly-coded representation of existence which you find in "Affair".If you must compare this studio-bound confection to film-making outside the Hollywood box, try the soulful Technicolor meditation Jean Renoir offered in "The River" (1951). There you have a French master going to India to recreate its look and heady spiritual atmosphere in his own image and likeness. We don't see the subcontinent of Satyajit Ray, but rather a cinema Impressionist's personal canvas.The full title, "Leo McCarey's An Affair to Remember", reminds us that you truly see McCarey's film, McCarey's vision, McCarey's world. Here the director put romance, sex, verbal wit, temptation, physical humor, responsibility, grace under pressure, destiny, and adult responses to life's caprices into the context of his own "Belle of the Nineties" (1934), "The Awful Truth" (1937), and "Going My Way" (1944).He populated this pocket universe with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, icons who shared his perspective and could incarnate his values. Watch these masters of screencraft play knowingly with the lines and situations, much as Dame Margot and Nureyev invest staidly conventional choreography with their own vivacity.A year later Grant strayed frivolously at Ingrid Bergman's side in "Indiscreet", while earthy lust had bedeviled Kerr throughout "The Black Narcissus" (1946). Take those movies as bracketing context and measure the differences. McCarey may have used a light touch, but he approached his material with deep seriousness.In "Affair" Grant made a lover's sensitive responsiveness to a woman on her own terms feel right, proper, and manfully debonair. Kerr gave romantic attraction the priority it has for Jane Austen--not impassioned lunacy, but a well-grounded woman's due. Neither could tell what would come from actively committing to their love for each other.Both knew the lives they'd led with other partners. In his case, he'd enjoyed quite a lot of exotic women. In hers, she had bonded with a good, stable man. Each set those prior ways aside in favor of crossing economic as well as emotional frontiers.The next decade offered us "Never On Sunday" (1960) and "Tom Jones" (1963), "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (1966) and "Hud" (1963), all hugely influential pictures which abandoned Hollywood formulas about the sexes and helped revolutionize the 60's. In "Affair" we can see the conformities that partly defined Dwight Eisenhower's era supporting the idea that yes, you can free yourself from the predictable to love--really love--responsibly, but totally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of months ago I was watching "Sleepless In Seattle", and one of the main things in this movie was the similarity and constant talking about the 50's classic "An Affair To Remember". So I told myself to go see it. A couple months later I saw it. I wasn't that surprised over the fact that it was really good: I always knew on some level... My first Cary Grant movie was, I think, one of the funniest and most romantic movies of the old 50's, and he was actually really good, considering this is a "light" movie, so to speak. And Deborah Kerr (I had only first heard of her when I was watching "Sleepless") was truly wonderful and charming. She could hide that accent of hers great, although when she was singing you could hear the Scottish accent a bit better. It's OK. It only made the song better! The plot wasn't the simple "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy girl get married...", this was different: Boy meets girl, girl sets an appointment for six months later, girl gets in an accident and finally: boy gets girl, and perhaps marry! The whole way to "boy, girl get married" was different and I liked that. The music was really good (it had a lot music considering it wasn't a musical). Kerr had a great and calm voice, so she made the soundtrack and the songs better than they already were. So, the acting was great, the plot was great, the music was great... This is a great movie! But the reason why I'm giving it a 9 instead of a 10 was because of the ending. I kinda liked it, it was different, but at the same time it felt a bit empty. But that is no reason not to watch it, you might love the ending!Aida</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've had this DVD in my collection for several years now, having picked it up cheap at a Black Friday sale. Deborah Kerr's unfortunate passing finally got me to pull it out. Should have went with my first choice, Black Narcissus, instead. An Affair to Remember starts off fine, with Cary Grant and Kerr, both engaged to be married, meeting on a voyage across the Atlantic. The first half of the film follows them as they try to avoid each other, but end up falling in love anyway. As they are about to part ways, they agree to meet each other in six months at the top of the Empire State building. So far, it's lovely. Unfortunately, there's an hour left, and, where the first half was a lovely romantic comedy, the second half is all dull melodrama. When Cary and Kerr are apart, the sizzle between them burns out pretty much instantly. And then the film inserts a bunch of precocious children, whom Kerr teaches to sing. There were a couple of fine child actors in classic Hollywood, but the vast majority of them seem like they are being fed lines two seconds before the camera comes on, and then they just repeat it out of rote. If there's a Hell, I'll be surrounded by kids who appeared in classic movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is the wheelchair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies. My one critic of the production is that at the end she is left on a sofa without a wheelchair in site. Left there without any means of transportation. Any paralyzed person would be frantic if the wheelchair were not there right be their side.They have made remakes of the movie and in fact an affair to remember was a remake of a previous movie made I believe in the 40's. Whenever I watch this movie I am amazed at the wonderful filming for that period.With the handicap of people being made aware to the general public today I am sure the wheelchair would be in sight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No man admits liking "chick flicks"...we are supposed to be brought to them kicking and screaming and only put up with them in order to reap the dividends from the women we're with at the time. But I am man enough to admit this movie is the exception. Maybe it's because I imagine in my own way what Cary Grant's life would have been like if he had found a really solid woman like Deborah Kerr instead of all the many women he tried, the drugs, and on and on. Maybe that's why Sophia Loren wouldn't marry him because she sensed he didn't have the solidity of the short, fat and ugly Carlo Ponti.Or maybe it's because this movie has something for everyone. Charm and class and charisma and comic timing. Color and culture. It is the perfect romance set in a perfect frame and the irony of how painful life and love can be makes it bittersweet yet tasty. Just like the song.The reason I believe "Sleepless in Seattle" was such a hit was that it was as if Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were the children of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, walking where their parents had walked, loving as their parents had loved and finding in a new generation that true love really does conquer all the world, the flesh and the devil can throw at us.Maybe it's because I still pray, in my quiet manly way, as Grant does while watching Kerr in the chapel, to find such a love. But to think of such things while watching such a movie is another guilty pleasure.So if you get your man to watch this movie with you, ladies, don't mind if he snarls at it or squawks or teases. Inside, he is Cary Grant (or wishing he were) and he is hoping that you and he will have such an affair, and a love, to remember. That will be his guilty pleasure he may not share with you but which he's feeling just the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A StreetKerr Named Mild Interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far there are 99 comments on this movie and for all I know they are ALL ecstatic so maybe it won't do any harm to feature another point of view. I had seen it before, long ago, before Sleepless In Seattle revitalised it and a ho-hum French entry used one of its corniest lines - the nearest thing to heaven - for a Catherine Deneuve vehicle and I remembered it as fairly polished and competent. BUT, I've always had a problem with Deborah Kerr, no matter what she does or how raunchy she tries to be she always comes across to me, at least, as about as desirable as Mother Teresa. Okay, I know that Peter Viertel, as red-blooded as they come, left his wife to marry her but what can I tell you. Elsewhere arch-Catholic Leo McCarey slips in the usual propaganda for the church, having Kerr, the mistress of one man, Richard Denning and rapidly falling in love with another, Grant, praying for, presumably, forgiveness in a conveniently 'private' chapel at the home of Grant's grandmother; cognizant that a group of singing kids did no harm at all to his Going My Way McCarey throws in a group of pinch-hitters that have little to do with the story other than overload it with saccharine whilst, for reasons best known to himself, he has Kerr, established as a sophisticated cabaret singer, perform a number in a cod Irish accent in a Boston nightclub. Now, for the pluses: Cary Grant. Oozing charm and style from every pore he takes the mawkish plot by the scruff of the neck and makes it work. Cathleen Nesbit is also in fine form in what is arguably the best sequence in the entire film. Has there EVER been a more ludicrously dire line that Kerr's 'If you can paint, I can walk'. I doubt it ... and yet in spite of oneself the tears do start to flow. Powerful stuff cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Affair to Remember is Un-Toppable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh this movie! There-to me-will NEVER be another so classically and stunningly acted film as this! This movie was SO wonderful, SO romantic, SO breathtaking--it's a movie that all movies could TRY to be, but they would blessedly fall short! Cary Grant is my all-time FAVORITE male lead! With the repertoire of many WONDERFULLY acted films to his credit, he absolutely RADIATES class and sex-appeal in this movie as Nickie Ferrante. You are immediately taken aback by his cheekiness and smug exterior--just to be reeled in by his wit and his little boy-like innocence. It's as if he's been a naughty child who needs reprimanding--and he knows it. His playboy charm, his charisma, his classic look and gentleman-ly qualities EXUDE perfection! Even his trademarked "unusually-cadenced and accented" voice is tops! He is also a complete stitch--with his "spot-on" humor, his comedic timing can't be beat! His interaction(s) with Deborah Kerr are so poignant and wonderful, you just WISH you could be the proverbial "fly on the wall" while they work off each other. (EX: The dining room scene--oh how you can feel the stares!) Deborah Kerr is absolutely EXQUISITE as Terry McKay! You feel her jubilation at her meeting Nickie, her deep respect and adoration for Nickie's Grandmother, her great indecisiveness once the ship comes to port, her great yearning to live her life on her own, and her utter heartbreak as she has to say goodbye-again (Or does she?) And their first KISS! OH! It just further proves that skin is DOES NOT HAVE TO BE in when you have such a wonderful plot, dialogue, characters, scenery and TRUE ACTING! NO fillers of lewd love scenes, explosions, death, or awful obscenity-laced dialogue are necessary (if it's in the first 10 minutes, you're gonna be wasting the next 2 HOURS!)--this film is TRULY a work of art! This film makes you wish you were alive back then, just so you could've experienced all of the people, places and feelings that they--the characters so BRILLIANTLY show you--like when they used to paint billboards, when department stores had people who ACTUALLY helped you (and knew what they were selling), when women wore hats and gloves EVERYWHERE--don't forget the handkerchief, when going to the theater meant furs and jewels and tuxes with boutonni?res, when letters were written on paper and when a man would rather DIE than betray the word he gave a woman--even if it meant his own unyielding unhappiness. OH HOW I LOVE THIS MOVIE! The transitional phases that the characters go through are so moving that you can't help but laugh, cry, bristle in anger and root for the couple you just KNOW are gonna make it! (They just HAVE to!) As many times as I've seen this film, I still cry at the end--the look on Cary Grant's face when he sees--for once--what had been right in front of him, all along. You're just saying to yourself, "NOW'S THE TIME NICKIE! GO FOR IT!" (HANKIE ALERT!) It, yet again, proves that a look is worth a million clever words--and that Cary Grant is an EXCEPTIONAL dramatic actor! Many movies have tried and failed to completely encompass the pure magic of this film--and for good reason. Even the biggest tough guy you know will turn to you and say--"It was alright" when they see this film! My favorite line in this film is at the end--I wouldn't DREAM of spoiling it for you--but when you hear it (if you're not uncontrollably sobbing) you'll see why! It's an absolute MUST see--don't deprive yourself of one of the most beautiful films of ALL time--you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5 people produced the screen play to this film and their imprint is seen by the way the script takes abrupt turns. Romance and comedy are replaced by disappointment and bitterness. But the bitterness is due to ignorance of Kerr's position and that she is too proud to tell the man she loves and wants to be with of her circumstances. That 's what makes this film great a combination of a comedy director from Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy working with a romantic script that plays to his experience and then throws in a challenge. This film is legendary and regarded as one of the best ever made. I just enjoyed how it promises to be a romantic comedy but heads down avenues unexpected to give th eaudience a new view on relationships. Although it could do with more on th esense of guilt and arguments about breaking up relationships and two-timing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, 'An Affair to Remember' is one truly worth viewing. I normally wouldn't be a fan of romantic type movies because a lot of them weren't as realistic and came out really cheesy. But because I happen to love the presence of Cary Grant, this one is truly a masterpiece. The idea of being alone on a cruise ship and meeting that one special person is such a beautiful thing. I don't think you can help with who you fall in love with, it just happens, like in the movie. Over the last couple of years I found that I don't watch movies the same way I used to. You really have to understand the perspective the director was looking for in the performance of his actors and understand the characters and their situations. This movie needs to be seen not in bits and pieces but in full for it will really make you cry,that is when you need one.</fullReview>

Even though they both are apparently happy, each one in a established relationship, they feel there must be something else. And they find it!They notice how compatible they are just after that scene with Nickie´s grandma, Jalou (I hope this name is well spelled), in her idyllic house facing the Mediterranean.So you can understand how discouraged is Nickie when things don't go the "right way".Besides all that, I think Cary Grant is THE leading man, always forever.

And to those of us who care about such things, the small offering of singing in the film is good. So if you're a romantic at heart, see it. You will have a smile on your face in the first half.

Yes, it drags a little when Kerr is teaching the children to sing, but the entire first half on the cruise ship makes up for most of that and the last scene more than takes care of the rest. I can't even describe this movie to other people without crying (just thinking about the final scene right now is making me misty!). Grant and Kerr have unbelievable chemistry, and their characters are written and portrayed in such a way that you see that their love is based on understanding and friendship in addition to physical attraction. The dialog is wonderful-always with at least two or three meanings, especially during Grant's tv interview upon their return home. This movie definitely realizes that less is more, and although the characters never have a passionate "I love you" scene, they are undeniably, deeply in love. This is the most love-affirming movie I've ever seen, and a must for any woman and any guy who wants to be in love with a woman someday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiler here-be warned! I hate this film ** 1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the challenge when discussing this film is deciding just which scene is the worst. The film goes from somewhat dull to disgustingly cheesy, to overripe melodrama in its overlong two hour running time, and never fails to get you totally peeved off. On the other hand, I can never help but weep at the end. Perhaps it's something to do with self-hatred, but I love hating this film.Deborah Kerr plays a young woman engaged to be married to a wealthy New York businessman, who is thwarted in love on an ocean liner traveling from Europe to the Big Apple when she meets world-class playboy Cary Grant. They fall in love, partly because Kerr is the only woman who doesn't fall flat on her back when she sees Grant, which to him I suppose signifies challenge. Unfortunately, Grant is too famous, and so their romance must be kept a secret so that neither of their fiancees find out.Eventually they reach harbour and decide to meet after six months, to see if they really do want to be together. They even pick a romantic meeting spot: the top of the Empire State Building (those of you who are thinking, Wow that's just like Sleepless In Seattle, well you're right, but backwards). But lo and behold it is not to be, for Debs doesn't notice the taxi cab coming straight at her the day of the great rendezvous and she gets pummeled to the ground. This is where it really gets bad.Now she's a handicapped teacher for underprivileged children in the inner city, and Grant is a penniless painter. There's a scene where they see each other at the ballet and don't say much. Then there's a sappy, pat happy ending that is all Hollywood and makes me want to throw up (after I dry my eyes).That it's a remake of Love Affair is one thing, but that it was remade by the same director is quite astonishing to me. His intent was to not only remake the film in colour (disgusting, overly bright colour which was the fashion for CinemaScope romances in those days), but to extend the film in length as well. All his extensions are unnecessary, from a longer waving sequence on the cruise ship when the stars have landed in New York, to a horribly dull musical number involving Kerr's students (the part where the only two African-American children in the class break out dancing always makes me want to scream). There's also a scene where Kerr sings the title song (dubbed by Marni Nixon, who the year before had filled in for Kerr's singing voice in The King and I.The only part that I really adore (and which is my favourite aspect of any version of this story), is when Grant takes Kerr on a trip to the coast of France to visit his widowed grandmother (Cathleen Nesbitt-Maria Ouspenskaya in the original 1939 version, Katharine Hepburn in the 1994 version where the scene took place on a South sea island instead of France). In this sequence the sentiment is pliable, tender and very touching, partly because it involves Kerr. It's a testament to her profound powers as an actress that she can take a character who could potentially be a complete ninny and make her a vibrant and passionate woman who maintains her stately poise without compromising the fire within her. I love this about her in every film I've seen her in (and consequently have had the pleasure of falling in love with her time and time again). The ting with the scarf never fails to get me choking.All in all it's a film so purple it's scary, but it seems to deserve its status as the most famous romance film from its time. It has all the trappings it needs: tragic story, beautiful actors, full-throated monologues, and not a hint of believability. If you have the patience, grab a Kleenex box and dive on in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An emotional movie, quite unlike today's movies. A bit slow. I would have probably enjoyed it more in a cinema theatre. On video, one tends to be distracted. Anyway, it's a different kind of love story. Nickie (Cary Grant) and Terry (Deborah Kerr) meet while going on a cruise. That Nickie likes Terry instantly is obvious. Knowing that he is a Casanova, one wonders if this is just another of his escapades. Probably Terry also likes Nickie but since she already has a steady boyfriend, she tries to keep a safe distance from him, in vain. Nickie takes her to visit his grandmother and I think that is the time when both realize that they have fallen in love.SPOILER .They decide to meet after six months. But as fate would have it, Terry has an accident and breaks her leg. I won't tell you what happened after that, watch the movie. But rest assured, love triumphs.A couple of scenes that touched my heart ? when grandmom Janou says, ` I hate to hear the ship bells' and the cute little kids singing `Tomorrowland'. Deborah Kerr is beautiful and Cary Grant suits the role. I guess you would enjoy it if in the right mood and with the right person sitting beside you. But then, isn't that true with any movie ?

Love Affair, they show love for each other, of course it shows, they are together in real life too. All kinds of sex a peel going on between them and it shows on screen. They are so much better. I am glad Warren Beatty made this version or we would be stuck with the horrible lasting picture with Deborah Kerr.

		<fullReview>It's a classic and an icon, but unfortunately it's also a dreadfully boring love story between two great actors who happen to have no chemistry together. The central conceit, in which Deborah Kerr's character goes into hiding from her lover (Cary Grant) in order to hide a serious injury from him, simply doesn't feel believable. But worse than that, it robs the movie of its momentum: the pair was lively and full of banter at the beginning, a mode Grant built his career on, but when the mood shifts to slow and weepy it never regains its stride. Grant's character's relationship with his grandmother is interesting (how would a sharp firecracker like her, a believable foremother for a man like Grant, have handled sudden immobility in her prime?), but it is really a minor element in service of the main plot, which needs all the adornment it can get. Grant and Kerr burst with charisma, but in other films that feature better writing and better pairings. Kerr can be seen excelling as Robert Mitchum's better half in "The Sundowners" (1960), while Grant matches Audrey Hepburn's cool in "Charade" (1963).</fullReview>

The two involving singing children add NOTHING to the movie. If the viewer doesn't like Kerr's character by that point in the movie, adding some orphans is not going to help.That said, Grant, Kerr and Denning all handle their parts well, and they should evoke positive responses from the viewer.</fullReview>

Everything was in CinemaScope, but few directors knew how to do anything interesting with it, so the camera is most often just planted in the middle of a vast set and frames actors from the knees up, leaving the rest of the screen to be filmed with blank walls or tacky decor. Once in a while there will be an edit so that we at least get to see the actors from a different angle, but the camera itself never moves and we never get a closeup. The lighting is all of the same fluorescent brightness so that scenes taking place at night are as brightly lit as those taking place during the day, and everything looks flat and two dimensional.Then there's the plot itself of this romantic melodrama that inexplicably has been responsible for reducing generation after generation of women to tears. What plot there is (which isn't much) doesn't make any real sense if you think about it, and it's sluggishly dragged out over a 119 minute running time.The thing that kept me watching was Deborah Kerr, who is the epitome of feminine elegance and grace. She's the primary reason I didn't fall asleep.And the next day, I could not get that warbly Vic Damone song out of my head. Egad!! Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Flame To Burn Through Eternity"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do love this film so and one thing it has that the original Love Affair did not have was that great title song, sung over the credits by Vic Damone. It was composed by Harry Warren and Harold Adamson and it's one of the great movie themes of all time. Guaranteed to put you in the mood for romance and tears.This version with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr sticks pretty close to the original with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. Two people, each engaged to others, meet on shipboard and fall in love. It's one of those chemical things that no one can help.Grant's a playboy who candidly admits he's never worked a day in his life and Kerr wants a bit more security than that. They agree to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in exactly six months to see if the sparks are still there. But something is always interrupting the course of history and romance. Can't say much more than that, but as Kerr reminds Grant if they don't meet it will be for a darn good reason and if you see the film you'll agree she had one.This was the second of three films that Grant and Kerr made together and this is easily the best of them. I don't think Cary Grant was ever more romantic on the screen and that is saying something.Cathleen Nesbitt though old enough to be his mother, plays Cary's grandmother in grand old world style. Her part had previously been played by Maria Ouspenskaya and later on in the Warren Beatty-Annette Bening remake was done by Katharine Hepburn.If your taste run to screen romances, this is THE film you do not dare miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Affair To Remember: A Timeless Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Personally, An Affair to Remember is my favorite love story of all time. It is a story of deep sacrifice and passion that deals with two star-crossed lovers. The first half is very funny and witty and the second half is very touching. If you really look at who these two characters are and what they have to go through in their search for true love and happiness, it's quite beautiful. Take Terry McKay(Deborah Kerr)for example. She was poor. She worked at a night club. She wasn't in the best conditions, and then, all of a sudden, this rich, handsom man shows up and wisks her away to a better life on Park Avenue. She just wants to feel secure. Then, all of a sudden, she meets Nickie Ferrente(Cary Grant), a swave and debonair playboy, who is also engaged. When they first meet, he persues her and she refuses. She doesn't want him to disrupt her life and she dosen't want Ken, her fiancee, to be hurt. However, as the trip progresses, she realizes that she has fallen in love with Nickie and she experiences true passion for the first time in her life. She is being torn apart by the guilt she feels for hurting Ken, her obligations to him, and the life she desires, but she just can't walk away from this love she experiences with Nickie. Then, Nickie and Terry agree to separate for six months so they can get their lives in order and they decide to reunite with eachother on the top of the Empire State Building.I have heard all the bad arguments for this movie. And I understand where they come from. People focus on the details that can be misinterpreted, instead of looking past all of that and seeing what the story really is about. Regarding Terry hiding the accident from Nickie, many people see that as ridiculous and dramatic, but its not. She doesn't want any handouts. He loved her as she was. She doesn't want to go back to him "broken". She knows he doesn't have a lot of money and he may blow the situation out of proportion. It's a question of pride and besides she already knows that she hurt him so deeply by what happened and she can't just come out and tell the man she loves and hasn't seen for months that she was in an terrible accident. She wanted to tell him but she knew that she couldn't.I think the acting is wonderful in this movie. The chemistry between Grant and Kerr is unmistakeable. The last scene is so heart-warming and you can really see the longing and anger between these two people. I have seen the other two versions of this story, and both are missing something that is present in this movie. Each interpretation of the story has it's own good and bad points. But I feel this movie is the most well-rounded out of the three. And if this version was SO terrible, then why was it number five on AFI's list of the 100 Greatest Love Stories of all time? The original version wasn't even on the list. Therefore, how can this movie be so awful and melodramtic? You have to watch it with an open mind. You can't pick it apart. The language may be a little outdated, I mean, it was made in the 50's, but you can't look at this movie and compare it with the love stories of today. They are two different things. This style of romance may not be everyone's favorite, and I respect that, but that does not make this movie terrible. No. If you understand the story and really look at all the hardships the characters go through, and the sacrifices they make for true love, then you will realize what a heart-warming and touching movie it is. But if you go into it questioning the character's motives and picking apart all the outdated details, then no wonder you won't enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suds...suds...and more suds...old-fashioned corn...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of this fuss over a middling soap opera with two unbelievable characters played--unfortunately-- by two of my favorite stars--Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Even director Leo McCarey admitted that he much preferred the original LOVE AFFAIR ('39) with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne over this newer version.This is surprising because the screenplay is almost a line-by-line repeat of the original version--which downplayed some of the smothering sentimentality. The hospital bed sequence where kids gather around Kerr is the most excruciating demonstration of Hollywood schmaltz I've ever seen. It reaches its zenith during this sequence and the overly sentimental scene where the couple visit his loving grandmother in her handsome mansion overlooking the Mediterranean. Ouch!!! Again, what seems like an artificial touch of eloquence elevated to the nth degree.A major weakness in story credibility is Deborah Kerr's failure to notify Nicky of her accident in the first place, something that is never plausibly explained. Then, of course, there would be no story. But just how superficial did she think his love was that he would abandon his true love if she offered him an explanation of her whereabouts? A totally artificial confection, the kind of glamorous tear-jerker popular in the 1950s--lush and foolish, without even some much needed bits of humor to relieve the sappy moments. Other such romantic dramas usually manage to balance the bittersweet bathos with moments of genuine humor and clever bits of business by supporting players or directorial touches that lighten the mood. For example, what Mitch Leisen did so admirably with TO EACH HIS OWN ('46).Only bright note: Vic Damone does a nice job on the title ballad over the opening credits before the suds begin to mount.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People hate each other in this story, so what do they do? They fall in love, of course. Sappy? That ain't the word for it.Included in this sappy story are horrible songs that are dubbed for Deborah Kerr, who couldn't sing. We also are "treated" to a bunch of nerdy school kids singing - around her bed. Pass the barf bag! While you are doing that, remind me again why music was in this movie in the first place.This is one of the ultimate, sickening soaps of the '50s that seem to last forever. It's excruciating to sit through two hours and 20 minutes. Women love these kind of romances, hence the title "chick flick" that came years later, and men (husbands or boyfriends) were forced to watch with them at the theater as a favor to the females. It's boring movies like this, frankly. that helped propel television to the forefront by the late '50s. It might have helped if this story had moved faster in the first half hour but it so tedious that trying to finish watching this was a monumental chore.Speaking of females, did Kerr have a personality? As for males, what happened to Cary Grant's "charisma?" He certainly lost it in this film, looking almost mechanical at times although he was far more interesting than Kerr's character, who made one stupid decision after another to the point where it got really annoying. Recommended only for hard-core soap opera fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Affair to RememberYou should always wear steel-toed boots when dating a woman in a wheelchair.Unfortunately, the suitor in this romance isn't aware of his lover's toe-crushing abilities. Terry (Deborah Kerr) is in a committed relationship, but it is tested when she encounters American playboy Nickie (Cary Grant) on her ship home from Europe. Before they part, the pair promise to meet at the Empire State Building in six-months. While on her way there Terry is struck by a car, leaving her paralyzed and him jilted.Years hence, Nickie has become a successful painter thanks to an anonymous wheelchair- bound benefactor. Long considered to be the definitive cinematic love story, this remake of a 1939 version lives up to its designation thanks to its perfectly matched leads and its tearjerker ending that still remains unrivalled.Plus, the easiest way to tell if someone is paralyzed is they've given away all their pants.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of the greatest Hollywood love stories, ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a rare instance when I share this honor with another Hollywood tear-jerker supreme, "Love is a Many Splendored Thing," with a luminous Jennifer Jones in perhaps her greatest film role, and a superb William Holden. But I think the greatest difference between them is that "Affair" has many more laughs than tears, due in large part to the largely underrated comic genius of Cary Grant. Grant, who gets my vote as the single most handsome leading man in all of filmdom, was also one of the most adept at using self-deprecating humor to give his films a rare accessibility, combined with a degree pure male charisma to be admired. In terms of casting, writing, and score, it should have at least garnered an Oscar for it's enduring theme song, "An Affair to Remember" (sung by just about everyone, but none as good as Vic Damone), which continues to shine. In spite of Grant's admiration of the original film as better, alas, this one will remain the better known and most beloved version for the ages. After dozens of viewings, I never tire of it's tireless romance, unending entertainment value, and spectacularly heart rending ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cary Grant we remember; Superbly witty and sentimental film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you buy a Blu Ray edition of an old film, you never quite know what you're going to get, With the nice boxed edition put out by 20th Century Fox, you get some very nice extras, including some rather revealing interviews about Cary Grant's love affairs and about Deborah Kerr's love affairs. But, we don't really buy Blu Ray for the extras. We buy them for a sparkling version of a beloved film. This edition gets off to a bad start. The credits and initial wide shot of Manhattan included pinkish snow while Vic Damone is singing the theme song, and then very grainy photography. Not a good omen. The way transitions occur, it's clear there has been an attempt at some restoration. But it's somewhat uneven. Most of a scene is good, just a little odd and the beginning and end of some scenes. However, in this case it is a better print than the last DVD edition I owned.There are those who say that this is the film that turned Cary Grant into the Cary Grant we all remember -- the epitome of a suave sophisticate. Of course, Cary Grant was around and sophisticated long before 1957, but this film is pretty much how we remember Cary Grant.I have long loved this film, although it is not on my top 5 list...though certainly in my top 10. The question is why. But that's easy. A remarkably witty script for the first half of the film. A remarkably sentimental script for the second half of the film. An outstanding performance by Cary Grant. An outstanding performance by Deborah Kerr.For the witty and/or sentimental script we have Delmer Daves ("The Petrified Forest"), Donald Ogden Stewart (who helped write the original film version), and Leo McCarey (also the director and producer of this and the original film version).As mentioned, this IS Cary Grant. I remember reading that Cary Grant once said that he became the character he often portrayed on screen. And this film is the evidence for that statement. He's just fabulous here.Deborah Kerr was a wonderful actress, and at least for me, this is the film I most remember her for.And then there are "the others". The other man in love with Kerr is Richard Denning. He's good, rather sanitized, and you have some sympathy for his character. The other woman in love with Grant is Neva Patterson; tough role to be so unliked by an audience, but an audience never likes a witch (or something that rhymes with that). The other interesting and humorous addition to the supporting actors is Robert Q. Lewis, who takes a humorous tone to his interview with Grant and Denning. Fortunio Bonanova adds a nice touch as an art dealer.There are so many touching scenes in this film. In fact, perhaps the most touching film in any movie -- when Grant and Kerr visit Grant's grandmother in the villa. No matter how many times I watch it, it chokes me up every time. The wonderful actress who excelled so as the grandmother is Cathleen Nesbitt, who, though old, went on to live another 25 years. Her career in show business lasted 80 years! Another touching scene is when Grant encounters Kerr, not knowing that...well, no sense of ruining the scene if you've never seen the film.But the penultimate sentimental scene is the closing. Brilliantly conceived, well written, and the perfect mix of tragic realization and hope. If it doesn't get you, you have a heart of stone. I cry every time. In fact, it is reported that Cary Grant said that whenever he watched the film, he cried at the end! Is there anything wrong with this film. Well, yes there is, although it's a minor point. In several scenes we are brought up to date with Grant's character's history (at least superficially). We never quite get that with Kerr's character. Yes, we eventually find out she was a singer, but beyond that's it's pretty scant, and it could have been accomplished in a matter of just a couple of minutes. And, I'll forgive them for having 2 Black children tap dancing.I wonder. Was this the only film where Cary Grant cried? In sum, this is one of my two favorite romantic films, the other being "Random Harvest" with Ronald Colman. Both are quintessential examples of the genre. This is a classic, and the public knows it. VHS and then DVD sales were unusually high for a 1950s film. And it's no wonder. Grant (along with Spencer Tracy) was the best that Hollywood ever offered. Here, he and Deborah Kerr shine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another childhood favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A staple into adolescence. And then didn't see it again 'till my 40's. It hadn't aged well. Grant seemed wooden throughout the movie, it was filled with a ton of fifties conventions and the whole story dripped of sap.The shock of watching a remembered favorite disintegrating like Dorian Gray was traumatic and, I think, blinding.Still, when it came up again on Encore recently I recorded it for old time's sake and am delighted I did.There is a lot wrong with it, from the awful title song, the montage of TV commentators sitting in little boxes excitedly babbling about the Bon Vivant Nickie Ferrente (Grant as an Italian playboy! Actually the name is Provencal but that's little different, Boyer was much more fitting as a swarthy cad in the 1939 version), and then there's all those cute kids that who were De Rigueur for establishing the moral character of the Heroine, who more or less had to be a teacher. Finally, Kerr's sumptuous wardrobe that would have bankrupted Onassis as well as her posh New York apartment. All on a teacher's salary.But, on my second adult viewing, I recovered all that is right with it and there's a lot, beginning with Kerr's performance.Both Grant's and Kerr's characters are Sophisticated Adults, both given Sophisticated Adult dialog and, when it works between them, it's magic. So much so that the it ignites their chemistry and transforms the movie into a very, very believable love story. This, by itself, overwhelms all of the negatives.Especially all of the scenes between Grant And Kerr as the boat heads towards Villefranche-sur-Mer, with them falling in love and, returning to New York, trying to figure out what to do about it. An Affair to Remember is very much Kerr's movie, she shines in her role and brings Grant up to her level in all of the critical scenes leading to a finale that, despite all of its schmaltz, is both touching and affirming. Grant, in this last scene is very much Kerr's equal.That scene begins with Grant's character, disappointed and little-boy hurt, appearing at Kerr's door, using his Sophisticated Adult dialog to express his hurt with sotto voce irony. As the scene progresses, that pain slowly dissipates as he realizes how much he loves her, replaced by confusion over her failure to appear at their appointed rendezvous until he finally gets it (she was hit by a car crossing to the Empire State Building to met him).That realization, amplified by his recognition of how much of a snooty little boy he'd been coming in, is a minor tour-de-force, understated and convincing.Happy Ending, love wins out and so do I, an old favorite revived.Thinking about it, I think that I originally, as a kid, either didn't notice or ignored all of the stuff I mentioned as negatives, leading to an overwhelming shock when I watched it again as an adult. Kind of like what happened to Grant's character and I'm very pleased that, like him, I was able to overcome that disappointment and recover what was lost.Though I still think all of the negatives I mentioned are negatives, the core love story, led by Kerr and expressed in the scenes focusing on her and Grant, easily rates a ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneven Affair that leaves one wanting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our Classic Film Fridays reconvened after a vacation layoff and we have been doing Cary Grant movies of late. Fans of the legendary screen presence will not be disappointed as he is his usual bounder self, devouring the screen even when implausibly playing the righteous son or the converted future husband to Ms. Kerr's Ms. McKay.The film starts quite well, with news agencies around the world telling us that international playboy Nicky Ferrante is finally getting married to a rich wife. He is currently on a cruise back to America by detour of France. We see Ferrante's dashing womanizing quite early as he flirts nonstop with a variety of youngish women while rebuffing the more senior passengers on the ship. Eventually, Nicky meets Terry and they understand they both have partners on the mainland but...a fortuitous stop in France to meet Nicky's grandmother pushes them together, at almost cliché speed.Problems arise here as we can believe Ferrante's dashing cad could be stricken by Terry McKay's humble but forthright countenance, but the push to marriage by the grandmother seems forced. They arrange for a meeting at the Empire State Building in a few months to see if they still love each other and...Terry gets run over by a car on the way there, leaving Nicky waiting until the wee hours. At this point the film takes a sad turn toward the maudlin and heart-tugging. We see Terry in the hospital, her legs broken. We see Terry teaching disadvantaged youth and, sadly, we hear said disadvantaged youth sing in an effort to add unneeded levity and heart to the equation. Meanwhile, Ferrante nad his fiancée are on T.V. Terry's husband suspects everything. We move on...The ending was decent enough, they finally catch up and admit they are attracted to each other before parting with a gift from Nicky and the discovery an oil of his grandmother and Vicky that Nicky had painted from memory.No more than a 6 out of 10 for this one folks. Grant is much better in North by Northwest or Bringing Up Baby or His Gal Friday and Kerr? I can't speak on her career but she gave a good performance and her singing inspired. Not a great film, but see it if you are a completionist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wondrous Romance You Will Rejoice Remembering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the most sentimental and the most unforgettable romances of old Hollywood, Leo McCarey's AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER is a top notch production. It is full of intense sentiment, irresistible charm, emotional musical pieces and, foremost, an aspect it is probably most remembered for, the great leading couple: Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant.In an interview, Ms Kerr said interesting words about one of the most cherished leading men on screen, labeling him as "a great believer in keeping a kind of image he has built up." Yet, no matter what we consider as a Cary Grant characterization, one thing is certain, AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER is a mutual work of both Mr Grant as Nickie Ferrante and Ms Kerr as Terry Mc Kay. Their affair, childish and sentimental as it may seem, especially being touched by the test of time, is what emerges from this charming film. But two words or even (I dare say this) realities evoke here: MEMORY and LOVE.Bosley Crowther of New York Times called their marriage pact as "ridiculously childish for a couple of adult people to make" but this critical instance is transformed in Variety review that labels their romance as "never maudlin but a wholly believable relationship." Among all these movie scholars who always manifest slightly radical viewpoints on classic productions, Helen Fredericks is perhaps closest to the truth hailing the movie as a "wonderful and witty tale of a true Love." She adds that this LOVE changed them and conquered their fears." Mind you this word 'Love' written in capital letter. No wonder there is Love because it is, after all, a romance. But memory? In one of the most beautiful film's sequences, Nickie's grandmother (Cathleen Nesbitt) who lives in an idyllic, blissful place somewhere in the Mediterranean, utters a truly remarkable line: "You are young, you have to create memories." She combines the experience of the old generation with the understanding of the young one. The quintessential aspect of the film is therein incorporated. When Nickie revisits the place, her words echo in his mind (supposedly, she is dead but her advice of wisdom lives on).The film's a typical romance in the sentimental mode and that is what you may expect from the start. The musical pieces, including the line "Close your eyes, make a wish and you're there" is the essence of fantasy. Yet, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr and the true chemistry between them make for a really remarkable love affair depiction. It lacks today's irony and offers yesterday's feeling.Pauline Kael once pointed out that the film can boast "timing and nonchalance" This observation, which appears particularly right in the context of the protagonists, proves an almost flawless viewing experience for both the viewers' of the film's period and the viewers of today.AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER is a wondrous romance you will rejoice remembering long after viewing it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Womanizing playboy Nickie Ferrante (Cary Grant) is engaged to the wealthy Lois Clark with a $600M fortune. He is traveling on a transatlantic ocean liner to NYC. He meets singer Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr) traveling alone. She's also engaged. They strike up a friendship. The ship stops at Villefranche-sur-Mer and Terry joins Nickie to visit his grandmother. Grandma Janou is taken with Terry who she mistakenly assumes to be his fiancé. It turns into more as they both agree to reunite at the top of the Empire State Building in six months after ending their engagements.Cary Grant is a great playboy. The character could be a problematic jerk but Grant is overflowing with charm. Deborah Kerr strikes me as a down-to-Earth gal and that's what the character needs. She's pretty but not striking. She's not an ingénue which gives some substance to her performance. Their relationship is given time to develop. They have fun with it. Cary Grant is just great with the comedic touches and Deborah Kerr is a terrific partner. It's very worthy remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic worth seeing again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie when I first saw it, probably in my teens. I thought it very romantic and I didn't mind the schmaltz and the melodrama. It stands up to viewing many times, and although I am now much older, I still like it. The fact that it was made in the 1950s does a lot to explain why Deborah Kerr's character doesn't contact Cary Grant's character when she fails to meet him- her reasoning is that since she isn't able to walk, her former lover might not want to see her again. To a modern mind, that seems crazy and if it happened to me, I would still get in touch with the man I was supposed to meet, in case he still wanted to see me again! However, dramatically it works very well. The final scene is full of poignancy and double meanings. The witty shipboard romance works as well, and I found it convincing that these two people got together, with a subtlety to their relationship which is fascinating. The silly behaviour of the fellow passengers, not able to leave two people alone on a ship, seems rather excessive. Maybe if a famous playboy went on a cruises he would experience that sort of intrusive scrutiny today, but I don't believe that they would allow it to happen, so we are left to imagine. But in the context of the travel options in the 1950s, it is believable.This is a classic Hollywood romance starring two of the all-time greats at the top of their game, and must be seen. Take some of the sugary scenes with a pinch of salt, but the substance of it is timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The embodiment of the old phrase "they don't make them like this anymore."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been plenty of romantic "comedies" I've seen over the last few years that I very much enjoyed. However, while watching An Affair To Remember on the big screen for the first time I was immediately struck with how great this film was. The dry humour, the charisma of the stars, the INSANE chemistry, the obvious heart and soul put into directing and crafting this film. This isn't a movie that was meant to be churned out to break 100 million dollars. This was someone's life project, their art on screen for the world to see. I'm not a film critic (professionally anyways) nor am I student of film but I am an obsessive movie fanatic and even I can see the artistic merits in this film because it isn't there to be fancy...its there to make the film even better. Its a simple love story that never feels rushed, never feels overwrought and is just fun to watch. You will literally laugh, cry, sit on the edge of your seat...its just wonderful. It is unmistakable when you see a film like this why it is considered a true "classic." The sassy dialogue between the two stars (much of it improvised if I understand correctly), the beautiful New York setting mid-movie and a truly timeless love story. It wasn't a perfect experience as there were a few things I thought unnecessary (more on that below) but you can't deny just how great this film is.It wasn't until my later years (the last ten or so) that I came around to find classic Cinema and enjoying it immensely. So I have a lot of films and a lot of stars to catch up on. This is only the second Cary Grant film I've seen and you can officially count me as a fan. The man just oozes charisma on screen. When the film first started I was sort of annoyed because I felt like he was trying too hard, or overplaying the character and the inflections in his voice seemed irritating but perhaps that was the ladies man side of the character because by the time he and Kerr are falling in love, all that was gone and I was hooked on his character. Grant is a movie star unlike few others. Deborah Kerr was near perfection as the woman that Grant falls for. After seeing him with the stunning Grace Kelly I wasn't sure I would like Kerr but she won me over in seconds. Her strong personality balanced Grant perfectly and their chemistry...legendary...truly. I can't even remember the last time an on screen couple had true chemistry like this. Kerr is very down to earth, beautiful but approachable and just is fun to watch. The supporting cast are all good but definitely there strictly to support our lovers. Richard Denning, Neva Patterson and Cathleen Nesbitt all have their moment to shine in the movie and all do very well. I would loved to have seen Denning's character get more closure or at least be responsible for the happy ending. Also the entire scene with Nesbitt as Grant's doting Grandmother was one of the best I have ever seen and I fell in love with her as fast as Kerr's character does.This was one of Leo McCarey's last films and I can confidently say from just seeing one of his movies that he is a very talented film maker. He also directed the original film (Love Affair) which I may try to see at some point though I can't imagine it being the same without Grant and Kerr in the title roles. Its the little things that make this film so great. Many reviewers mention the reflection of the Empire State Building in the patio doors (an effective and powerful scene that sticks with you.) There is an almost epic feel to the film and it would so easy for a lesser talented director to make the romance and the story feel rushed but it doesn't...not for a moment. I read one other review that pointed a flaw out and I agree and that is the musical number with the children. Cute...yes definitely. Made me smile. Out of place though and really makes the scene drag? Yes sadly it does. It has no bearing on the story or characters and feels completely out of place. Still, fortunately for them the kids are adorable and it doesn't hurt the overall integrity of the film. This is a sweeping romance unlike few others and an absolute must see again and again!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naive and very romantic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the old classic movies I would like to recommend fro watching. I remember when I was watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (1993) I was laughing at a moment when a main character (Meg Ryan) and her friend/colleague (Rosie O'Donnell) watched their favorite movie by knowing the script by heart and cried. But I was curious to know what movie they were watching. Luckily Jane, my former boss in the US, was a movie expert and she was surprised that I had not watched that famous movie as I learned later. Thanks to her I got that DVD and managed to watch that classic and romantic movie with famous actors. After watching that, the script of "Sleepless in Seattle" I got all pieces of the puzzle. This movie was created mainly for women due to romantic and sentimental plot, but frankly saying I liked this movie more than that well-known "Casablanca". The story of "An Affair to remember" is simple and naive, yet it served as a basis for many remakes. Watch it if you like classic and romantic movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest kiss to remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will see the most beautiful kiss scene in this movie. It is the very first kiss that Terry and Nickie could not resist any longer, and it happens so tenderly on the half way of the stairs on the boat. (About 45min. in the movie) All you see is though them waist down and you don't even see their faces. But just from the slight and delicate ways their bodies move, you can understand how desperately they've fallen in love with each other. Amazingly beautiful film making!I have been drown to see this movie by watching "Sleepless in Seattle" (Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan). It is pretty funny how the characters in "Sleepless in Seattle" talk about "An Affair To Remember" in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If it had to happen to one of us, why did it have to be you?"I have to admit that An Affair to Remember is not really my preferred kind of movie (I'm more of a Casablanca man), but it's difficult to imagine a lover of old school romantic films in general not enjoying this. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr star in this tale of star-crossed lovers who find each other when they already belong to someone else.&nbsp;After parting from their brief days of bliss together, they agree to meet again in six months atop the Empire State Building. Alas, Fate has different designs.An Affair to Remember is bittersweet, mature, and witty, but I'm not the greatest fan of this genre. I heartily recommend it to anyone who is, though. It's impossible not to appreciate how well it achieves what it sets out to do, and it's easy to buy into the on-screen chemistry of Grant and Kerr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully frothy confection, not perfect by all means, but a pleasant watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a comedy film of sexual manners, "An Affair to Remember" is very frothy, sentimental and somewhat sugary. It is not perfect either, the film has a tendency to be rather slow moving and it does loses its way in the last half. But I still really liked it, thanks to the sophistication of the direction and the rapier delivery of the dialogue. The atmosphere is endorsed with rhinestone-encrusted dresses, impeccable dinner suits and raised champagne classes, making it lovely to watch visually, courtesy to some beautiful cinematography. The music score in general is gorgeous, the incidental music certainly is that and the title song(sung with unusual sensitivity by the talented Marnie Nixon) "An Affair to Remember" really is a pearl in an oyster. However, I didn't care for the children's songs, I didn't hate them, I found them forgettable and I wasn't taken with the way they were sung either(too shouty). The performances from the two leads are what drives this film. Cary Grant is wonderfully arch and urbane, not to mention charming, while Doborah Kerr is enchanting, self-contained and sassy. With these qualities, the two wonderful actors share a what I consider believable chemistry that does bubble on screen in the best scenes. All in all, this is not a perfect film, but a pleasant one with a tearjerker of an ending. Better than its reputation I think, not for everyone, there are those who understandably find it too sugary sweet, but I think it is a handsomely mounted and a in general well performed film. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Affair To Remember is directed by Leo McCarey and is a remake of his 1939 film Love Affair which starred Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. The film stars Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr and Cathleen Nesbitt.Thanks to new found fame when clips from the film were used in Sleepless In Seattle the film is still as beloved today as it was on it's release back in 1957.Wealthy playboy and worldwide ladies man Nickie Ferrante(Cary Grant)is taking a cruise back to New York to marry his fiancé.A story the press are turning into the love story of the decade.Desperate for some peace on board he takes a late night walk on desk and meets beautiful nightclub singer Terry McKay(Deborah Kerr).The two form a genuine bond and before long have fallen in love.There lies the problem though both have fiancé's and Terry knows Nickie's reputation.So how are they to ever have a happy ending?well both make a pact that in a few months if they have both changed their life around (and ditched the fiancé's)then they will meet on the top of the Empire State Building on New Year's Eve.However tragedy strikes and it seems the pair may be destined never to be together after all. Make sure you have your tissues to hand when Cary is fantastic as Nicky and he has lovely chemistry with Deborah, together they make this film really special.There's also fine support from the fabulous Cathleen Nesbitt as Nickie's Grandmother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excessive Remake of a Classic Chestnut About a Shipboard Romance Ruled by Fate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Leo McCarey ("The Awful Truth"), this overly revered 1957 romantic tearjerker has always felt bloated at 115 minutes given the slight story presented and repackaged by McCarey and co-scenarists Mildred Cram, Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart. The fact remains that the veteran director told the same tale in just 87 minutes back in 1939, and the extra half-hour feels like pure padding in the update. Moreover, the sentimental wash of the love story feels even more contrived on the grander scale of a full-color CinemaScope production. You certainly couldn't ask for stars more luminous than Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr at this point in Hollywood history, but their charms can only go so far in sustaining interest in their characters' burgeoning romance.The familiar story goes like this. Traveling alone on a transatlantic ocean liner, playboy bon vivant Nickie Ferrante is trying to avoid public glare over his recent engagement to a prominent New York socialite. Onboard, he meets comely nightclub singer Terry McKay, who is also engaged and also traveling alone. The pair strikes sparks quickly, but a combination of guilt and gossipmongers keeps the would-be lovers apart. Things change considerably when they visit Nickie's kindly grandmother at one of the ports-o-call, and Terry sees his more sensitive side under the elderly woman's becalming influence. Needing to attend to their impending marriages, Nickie and Terry vow to reunite on top of the Empire State Building in six months' time. As anyone who has seen "Sleepless in Seattle" knows, fate intervenes, and their lives take a different route than either expected.Grant is on cruise control as Nickie, exhibiting his debonair manner with easy assurance. His big moment of revelation in the final scene is the only time Grant shows something deeper in the character than a suave lover and a frustrated artist. As Terry, Kerr stands in the considerable shadow of Irene Dunne, whose natural élan and sparkling wit elevated the original to classic status. Another key difference is that while Dunne exhibited her own impressive singing talents, Kerr's voice is dubbed by Marni Nixon on Terry's two nightclub numbers. Still, Kerr manages to convey enough of her character's sharp sensibilities and romantic vulnerability, and the chemistry with Grant is very much in evidence here. Cathleen Nesbitt plays the Maria Ouspenskaya role of Grandmother Janou with twinkly, wizened charm, the same valedictory role Katharine Hepburn played in Warren Beatty's inferior 1994 remake. The rest of the supporting cast is purely incidental with special mention going to the avuncular Charles Watts playing an obnoxious passenger who follows the illicit pair without remorse.The 2008 two-disc 50th Anniversary Edition DVD package seems excessive for anyone but the film's most devout fans. Disc One contains a pristine print of the film along with a perfunctory commentary track from film historian Joseph McBride with additional comments from Nixon, who shares her personal memories of the production. Disc Two has a number of featurettes starting with a pair of retrospective featurettes, one on Kerr, the other on Grant. Just before his death, screenwriter Peter Viertel reminisces about his wife Kerr, while Grant's widow Barbara does the same. The featurette on McCarey is more interesting in that it shows colleagues and film critics contributing their insight to his impressive body of work. Other shorts focus on producer Jerry Wald and the film's cinematography courtesy of Milton R. Krasner. The best extra is an AMC Backstory documentary on the film's production and legacy. Completing the package is vintage newsreel footage as well as a couple of photo galleries. For fans only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven and ridiculous movie with a few redeeming moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Affair to Remember is an uneven mess. While the movie had many redeeming moments, there were several areas that really could have used improvement. Many commenters espouse the merits of the first half of the movie, but I find the love affair aboard the boat forced and lacking chemistry. Not until the visit to his grandmother's house did the first half take flight. In addition, there were many moments where the director's intentions seemed incomprehensible. When they kept bumping into each other, was it supposed to be comedy? Was Cary Grant purposefully orchestrating the accidental meetings? Did she fall for him immediately and why? Why were the other cruise passengers boors beyond reality or comedy?Deborah Kerr's character seemed to fall between two movie archetypes - the younger woman who falls for Cary Grant and the older, seasoned woman who rebuffs his advances at every turn. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me and I didn't buy it. I also didn't believe his character suddenly fell for her. Maybe their affair started out as a lark for both of them, but the director failed to convey the lightness of spirit that would accompany the beginning of a fling or love-at-first-sight. For him it mostly seemed out of boredom and routine but we never understand why or when his opinion changed.A questionable moment that occurs at the crux of the movie was when the grandmother chooses her by sight as the perfect woman for Nicolo. Was it the ravings of a senile old woman that came true because of Nicolo's admiration for his Grandma (most realistic scenario)? Or, as I believe, was the audience expected to adore the grandmother and accept her opinion as movie truth? Either way, the entire scene at the grandmother's villa was asking for the MST3K treatment, from the prognostication, to the long awkward moments, to the creepy eyes in the overlong piano scene. Maybe because of the scene's campiness and length, the movie's best moment comes out of nowhere and clobbers the audience with truth and melancholy. Unlike the rest of the movie, this one moment has become even more poignant over time as families live further apart and time together is fleeting.While the first half would have played better light and funny, it may have been restrained in order to mesh with a dark second half. This is of course where the plot becomes completely unbelievable and Deborah Kerr's motivation makes no sense. Instead of telling the love of her life what happened, she hides in shame despite knowing it will crush him. On top of that, her previous boyfriend is basically a saint with no hard feelings whatsoever and the remarkable ability to divine the hidden meaning in every gesture she does. Her boyfriend comes off better than any of the other characters.And of course in the second half, we have two orphan singing scenes which beg to be skipped. Although if you skip them you'll miss the wonderful moment where all the white kids get singing solos and the two black kids get to do a terrible soft shoe. I think the scene wouldn't have been so awkward had the kids actually been *good* at dancing.In the end, he discovers why she was unable to meet him in a somewhat clever way. Unfortunately, the path to get to the scene is so completely unbelievable that the twist is only worthy of a smirk.Even with all that's wrong with it - the pacing, the plot, the characters' motivations - I'm glad I watched this movie. It's a time capsule - as someone else said "I now know why the 50s invented the 60s". Even the scenes that are ridiculous are enjoyable in their ridiculousness. The overall theme of getting older and life's fragility is the movie's strong suit and it's the one that will stick with me when I remember it in the future.Other notes:- This was nominated for best cinematography but there were a couple external shots of the boat where the camera severely rocked back and forth. - I didn't know how to react in the awkward scene where the other cruise passengers openly laughed at them. It wasn't funny or realistic. - The kids' acting is awful and takes you right out of the movie. - Cary Grant had some kind of a huge knot on his forehead at the beginning of the movie. - The caricatures of other nationalities at the beginning of the movie really fall flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie a couple of months ago and found it really interesting. Rightly said by an earlier reviewer..."the best romantic film I've ever seen." This is the best romantic movie I have seen. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are at their very best in this film. They are wonderful actors. Especially Deborah, she has shown true emotions in the movie. I don't know what's the deal but I watched 'Love Affair (1939)' starring Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. These two movies have the exact same story, same dialogs, exact same sets and even the character names are unchanged. Personally, I think 'An Affair to Remember' is a better flick than 'Love Affair' but given that the latter was produced almost 20 years earlier, we have to give it to 'Love Affair'.Would recommend both the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Review...www.dereksheldon.blogspot.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Affair To Remember (1957) An A Version to Remember?I Der ya to listen:Little known this movie has been made three times by Hollywood. First, there was the 1939 original titled "Love Affair" with Irene Dunn. Next we have "An Affair to Remember" with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.Finally the last time this movie was printed was titled again "Love Affair" with Warren Beatty and his wife Annette Bening. Undoubtedly, everyone knows that the 1957 version is the best due to Carey Grant and his stature I believe. It was pretty much a standard that everything Carey Grant touched turned into gold. Mr. Grant's picture was listed in Webster's Dictionary under the word: Class. (Fun filled fact: Cary's real name was Archie Leach!) So all together this movie had a head start of being a great success to 20th Century Fox. This movie probably will be remembered after all as one of the most romantic movies created in all time. I cannot say this is due primarily to Carey Grant, Deb Kerr, or even the plot. The 1957 plot was followed to the letter, verbatim from the 1939 version. So the question is why is this remake so remembered after all...no pun intended?So now I will try to dive into the reels of celluloid to solve this mystery of this film classic (untangle me please, I think I just got lost in the "Wizard of Oz"). Most important if you have not seen this movie please do. If you didn't please submit to me WHY so I can laugh at you! Even if you are a couch potato guy and non romantic type, something about Carey Grant will impress upon you and keep you entertained, if not Debbie Kerr's boobs should do the trick. You can obtain a copy of this movie here http://www.amazon.com/Affair-Remember-Cary-Grant/dp/B00007JMDF.( A free ad support to Amazon.com. I love Amazon you should too.) Alright back to the movie, released July 11th, 1957 billing two very big stars it instantly was born into the canals of movie legend. While I do like Carey Grant, Deborah Kerr was always a hit or miss for me. I find her to mostly be annoying and stuck up. Hollywood saw her as an approachable/average lady type but I tend not to agree. I do not believe anyone could ever even come close to approachable as Audrey Hepburn. Had she been in this..it would of been immortal. Maybe I can go back in time and recast this...but I doubt it. My first conclusion is primarily, Cary Grant made this film what it is. As I have explained above, his billing ensured insta success and mostly every single one of his pictures was a monetary success. Known for his looks, his charm, and he was able to do all this while reminiscent of an average Joe. He was known in Old Hollywood for being the only leading man that could bear the brunt of jokes thrown at him. People loved having this demigod that they could laugh and touch. It would be as if a modern day Zeus would sit and eat popcorn with you watching this movie. I believe Mr. Grant's touch of himself allowed this movie to be what it is. I do believe he had a great vehicle of a script to do whatever he had to in this film. Since we are staying with actors in this paragraph, I shall briefly touch on Deborah Kerr. Yes, granted I believe she did a great job. I will give her the due for her part. I do not however think she made this film "MEMORABLE". There are parts in the movie, mainly the last scene that do shine though. I mostly start to like her when she cannot walk anymore. Somewhere, somehow she related to the pain of this character immobility. Maybe it was more dramatic? Who knows. In the scene when she is on the cruise liner I like she is able to hold her own water with Cary Grant in her comeback lines. Without Cary in the scene, it becomes lack luster and somewhat mundane. So again, I give this 1st portion to Mr. Grant.Technicolor. Technicolor. Technicolor. What a change to the film industry for the better. It was the first major development since voice and sounds were added in the 1929 film" The Jazz Singer" Ms. Kerr here had the ability to use her red hair to boost her presence. Anything in color to me was better. I'm sure my buddy Robert Osborne (Hope your my friend!) might disagree. I prefer color. I believe that the colorization to the film helped entirely. Since "Love Affair" 1994 was color, it goes back to it was all about Cary Grant. I do love the version with Warren Beatty, I really do. But It just is not the 1957 version. Soundtrack. Soundtrack. Soundtrack. While we pulled a headline famous song routine entitled" An Affair to Remember" to accompany this movie it increased sales. Vic Damone was the first singer to attach his credits to it. Vic was pretty popular in his hay day and it was truly a good song. Ms. Kerr did fake sing a portion of her song but it was boring boring boring.

		<fullReview>This movie is one of my all time favorites when I'm in the mood for a good romance and a good cry. Men be warned, this is a "chock-flick" in the truest sense of the word. Women be warned: you are going to love this movie and cry your eyes out if you love romance stories.The story is all based on the notion of whether there are people we are truly destined to be with - against all odds. Yes it may be formulaic, but there must be some reason it is done over and over again, because ultimately we want to believe it. I think the notion of self-sacrifice also strikes a chord - that although Terry (Deborah Kerr) loves Nickie (Cary Grant) dearly, she decides against telling him of her horrible accident so as not to make him feel obligated to her. And yet, in spite of all the steps she takes to leave him in the past, ultimately he finds her through the strangest of circumstance, in a way that has you believing it has to be fate or God bringing them together in the end.This one never fails to make me cry, no matter how many times I've seen it ( at least a dozen times).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliantly shot, this love story explores the affair that a couple have aboard a cruise ship - and the time leading after they vow to meet in six months at the top of the Empire State Building. The picture is beautiful, bringing back a look at the romanticized past. (The scene 'shot' in beautiful Italy/France captures the characters and their blossoming romance, and the scene where one of the characters is inside a house, the Empire State Building reflected on the glass, glimpses into the destiny and a reminder of romance.) There are many things to like about this film, but the pacing/middle of the film is not one of them. The film seems to lose some direction after the accident, and a lo of effort and time seems to be placed here when it could have been, in my opinion, shortened or explored the characters' emotions a little more efficiently. Overall, it's an excellent and sad film, but it's beautifully made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cynics stand back. This sentimental and romantic tear-jerker is for folks who love to curl up with an appealing couple and then cry as they undergo various torments. It's a cinematic concept (often with little or no relation to reality) that has pleased many a film-goer through the decades. Grant plays a rather idle playboy, engaged to a super-rich (even in today's terms!) heiress. He's on his way home to New York City from Europe via cruise liner when he happens upon Kerr, an austere beauty who, unlike virtually every other woman, resists his charms. Naturally, that only encourages him more, so he works on winning her over. Once they've discovered their mutual affection for each other, they realize the inappropriateness of it (she's heavily involved with another man herself) and strive to separate from each other. Eventually, though, they find that they can't resist the thought of spending time together and give up, sharing a memorable afternoon with Grant's aged grandmother (Nesbitt) and finally declaring their love. Since they are each romantically entangled with others and have no real means of support, they agree to take six months to establish themselves financially and prepare for a life together. They decide to meet on the 102nd floor of The Empire State Building at the end of their self-imposed separation. From there, the film swerves into near-tragedy, with the lovers becoming separated until the cathartic final moments. Grant is his typically suave and endearing self. Always at home in both comedy and drama, he has little trouble inhabiting the dual characteristics of his role. Kerr, an appealing and attractive actress, does a fine job as well. She and Grant, despite their 17 year age difference, create a couple to root for. She, however, due to her inherent sense of class and taste, hardly suggests the child of a Boston drunk! These two are also both a little mature to be approaching marriage for the first time, especially Grant in his mid-50's! That's Hollywood, though. Nesbitt does an excellent job in her extended scene, cementing the romance between these people and seeing in advance what they may not be aware of yet. As the jilted partners, Denning and Patterson are strong. Denning is the definition of understanding without coming off as a sap. Patterson adds a welcome dose of high society plasticity tinged with a sexual underpinning. The film (a remake of a 1939 movie titled "Love Affair" by the same director) is gorgeously photographed and beautifully appointed, though budgetary restrictions dictated that some scenes be shot against a blue screen when location work might have been preferred. The first hour has the feeling of a mild drawing room comedy with some unusual bits of humor thrown in (mostly supplied by fellow passengers on board the ship.) The second hour is more dramatic, but is augmented by the inclusion of several musical numbers. Many people loathe these numbers and, in truth, they needlessly extend the running time, but there is occasional brightness to be found in them. Perhaps the best approach would have been to only show part of the songs (cutting in or cutting away) instead of making the audience sit through entire numbers from start to finish. In any case, "The Tiny Scout" is a definite oddity with some really homely, but strangely endearing, children chiming in at various times. The youngest girl is particularly amusing, especially in an (unscripted?) encounter with the edge of Kerr's bed! Though common sense does at times take a back seat, the point of the film is to wring emotion out of the audience and on that score, it succeeds beautifully. Only a Grinch could remain stone-faced during the (exceptionally well-written and acted) final sequence in which the lovers confront each other after a separation. Most people will be yearning for a reconciliation through wells of tears. The title song, crooned by Vic Damone, is indeed beautiful. A horrible, wrong-headed second remake (with the original title "Love Affair") surfaced (and quickly sank) in 1994.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple falls in love and agrees to meet in six months at the Empire State Building - but will it happen? This is a remake of "Love Affair" (1939) and a strong inspiration for "Sleepless in Seattle". Interestingly, both this film and "Love Affair" were directed by Leo McCarey and both were strong Oscar films. Apparently a director can make a film twice and be honored both times! Cary Grant makes a decent lead, and certainly had the charm and charisma to be the romantic actor type. But it is not a role I prefer for him. Indeed, he is so much stronger in madcap comedies, when strange things happen. Here there is just no soul... it may as well be a modern romantic comedy, which is not a compliment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good enough movie within its genre but it still got made a decade too late.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a bit weird seeing a 1957 like this one. The movie is definitely a throwback to the happy, sappy and melodramatic romantic movies from the '30's and '40's. It even has some of its stars from those days in it; Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.The movie itself is also a remake from a movie from that era; "Love Affair", from 1939, that got directed by the same director; Leo McCarey.The style and just overall way of story-telling and film-making seemed very outdated, even at its time already. However if you judge this movie simply for what it is and as a part of its at the time already outdated genre, it's simply being a good and pleasant little movie to watch. Lovers of the genre certainly wouldn't mind watching this movie. Besides the usual melodramatic and romantic elements, the movie also has some elements of the screwball genre in it, which is also a throwback to, mostly, the '30's.It's simply being a pleasant movie to watch but I most certainly wouldn't call it one of the best movies within its genre. It's definitely not a movie that is without its flaws. It's definitely arguable that both leads of the movie were being a bit too old for their roles. This is especially the case for Cary Grant, who was already in his 50's at the time. It's not like a good romantic movie can't feature older actors and characters in it but this particular movie has simply more a story in it that is suitable for younger actors for its main leads. The overall story would had worked out better and more credible if it was about two young people, who were new to real love and still had a long bright future ahead of them. The characters in this movie already seemed to have a long past behind them instead, which simply did not worked out too well for its story.It's one of those movies in which two people meet each other and immediately know that they are made for each other and want to get married almost right away. This is also the type of approach that was really common for movies that got made in the '30's and '40's but is of course something that is quite ridicules and far from believable. These are two people who already have different commitments, responsibilities and reputations but yet they throw this all overboard once they have set their eyes on each other. I actually hate it when a movie does this and it often sends out a wrong message as well. It also certainly doesn't make the whole story a very convincing or much involving one. It's also often being far too sappy and melodramatic for that.But it still remains a well made movie, that is also being pleasant to watch throughout. There is therefore also no reason to sound unnecessarily harsh about it, since I actually quite enjoyed it for what it was.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting bit of very trivial trivia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the orphans is a young African-American girl who does a brief dance during the singing. She is Gloria Lockerman who, at the age of 12, won $16,000 (not positive about the amount) spelling "antidisestablishmentarianism" on the $64,00 Question.Since I need to have a total of 10 lines, I will say that this is my favorite of all romance movies. At the age of 62, I've seen many. I always find it interesting that you never actually see them kiss, and it's still so romantic. I would give my teeth to own Nanou's home and garden. I would give my teeth to have had a fling with Cary Grant. It would be wonderful if sailings and arrivals were still so dramatic. Nuff said now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Love Story to Remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing I can say here will do the movie justice. It is something you have to experience to understand. But I can try, here, to put my feelings for this movie down on paper.Deborah Kerr is a breathtaking Terry McKay, playing the role with both the comedy and the drama the film requires. Her light 'fencing' scenes with Grant at the beginning disappear after their outing in Villefrance, replaced by a desperate (and failed) attempt to suppress her feelings for Nicolo Ferrante, who she begins calling 'Nickie' almost as soon as they reach the 'turning point'. The comedy virtually disappears, replaced by touching and tender moments, beginning with the glances they share as she sings the French version of 'An Affair to Remember' accompanied by Cathleen Nesbitt as Janou... the only role an actress could ever match in a remake (Katharine Hepburn prevented the 1994 'Love Affair' from being complete and utter trash, giving a remarkable depth to the role and easily outclassing every other actor in the production by a thousand miles). The looks and tender moments continue, with a little comedy interspersed (the outside stairs and the stairs down to the dining room). As 'Auld Lang Syne' begins to play, and she and Grant begin to talk about a future, you can feel the love in the air. And the absolute urgency in her voice when she says 'You name the place and I'll obey'... and their last stolen, fervent, forbidden, and desperate kiss as they plan to meet... She is an absolute goddess in this film.Grant is no less stunning, providing a remarkable counterpart to Deborah's talent and showing his own signature moments... most famous is the look on his face when he finally realizes the devastating truth about why exactly Terry didn't meet him. Without being melodramatic he touches all our hearts. And the chemistry between him and Kerr is remarkable... they seem to start wildfires every time they so much as look at each other.This film is far and away the superior of the three versions of this story... the original 'Love Affair' holds its own, thanks to Irene Dunne, but the 1994 version is prevented from being tossed into the trash only by the wonderful performance of Katharine Hepburn. These two actors, however, convey a classic and passionate romance that will stand the test of time. If you want a story of passion, true and unending love, and overcoming all obstacles for the sake of each other, you have found that movie. Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant will never die so long as this film lives on. 100/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the rich and famous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A witty, light comedy, about a rich and famous bachelor taking one last transAtlantic cruise before marrying, and meeting a beautiful night club singer who is also about to marry, gets terribly derailed when they debark to meet his elderly mother who lives in an ocean view villa on an island off the European coast. When the boat returns to New York, the two promise to meet again at the Empire State Building, but on the day of their reunion, the woman gets run over by a taxi as she frantically rushes to make the appointment, leaving the man there waiting in vain for hours on the view deck. It actually isn't half bad, and the film seems to regain its footing with this new development, except for what follows, an indescribable decision to make the woman a music teacher in a disadvantaged school. Painful to watch, condescending, stereotyped mush is interjected in a disastrous effort to dramatize her (and his also, as he now has become a painter) search for personal fulfillment, their shallow materialism thrown off as they see life's important gifts. My guess is that they should have stayed on the boat with this picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant dazzles again, and Deborah Kerr is a sweetheart in this movie. It's a bit on the long side (damn that middle part for being so sketchy and long, as if it was never going to end.), but the ten minutes of tension towards the end of the movie and the subsequent ending is all worthwhile. There's not much I can say that isn't said by watching the film, really, which is terrible for a review but basically the thing speaks for itself. It's the fact that the love should be strong enough to get through all of the "crap", as they're trying to figure out whether they're going to fall into one another again that has you thrilled. Go watch it already, you'll enjoy yourself, as long as you can sit through the gray middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i dig this movie. it's a two-hour epic, and that's cool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love to watch this movie because of its simplicity. So many films today try so hard to be clever or profound, and build up little details to a disappointing climax. Some of the most important things that happen in this movie aren't even shown on-screen, and we also aren't given a lot of backstory about our characters. (I see some reviewers on here are annoyed about these two things -- it's too bad today's formulaic Hollywood has trained you people to need everything tied up in a neat little bikini-waxed package! and what's with people calling Deborah Kerr ugly?!) However, this doesn't matter, since all we need to know about the characters is revealed through the leads' amazing acting. This story about a whirlwind affair between two strangers is not just a cookie-cutter love story, (as many would have you believe) but also explores the complications and differences between an *affair* and a *romance*. It's not all hearts and flowers, but there are enough hearts and flowers for you weepy romance-lovers, and enough incredible acting and intelligent filmmaking for the rest of you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to drag for the first fifty minutes or so before it began to pick up. The whole scene with 'Janou' was a little too sentimental for my tastes and indeed much of the courtship before the midway point felt saccharine. Some people found this film to be funny. I must say I think only found a couple of scenes funny. But by the midway point the dramatic aspect finally overtook and I appreciated the position of Nickie and Terry at this point in their lives. It takes an act of great faith to give up security and familiarity at that point in life for something as abstract as romantic love. The final conversation between Nickie and Terry is also very moving. It was perfectly acted by Grant and Kerr. Recommended, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, where are David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams, the wits behind "Airplane!", when you need them? If ever there was a movie that needed some serious spoofing that movie is "An Affair to Remember". Celebrated as the ultimate love story, I had the Kleenex handy, but spent most of my time either laughing or wincing. At first I did a double-take - I didn't know that the movie would start out as a broad romantic comedy. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it. Leo McCarey extracts a lot of humour out of the shipboard romance between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, the worst kept secret on the boat. But would two worldly, urbane adults really behave like that - furtively skulking around like thieves in the night? The dialogue really threw me, as well. It's artificial. If real people spoke like that I'm not sure that I'd want to be around them. (Compare the dialogue in this film to the bright, sly and droll lines spoken in the much sexier "North by Northwest"). Veering suddenly in another direction the movie presents Grant's little old grandmother in scenes that are trite, but manage to be sweet and affecting nevertheless.Once in America the movie sinks like the Titanic. The catastrophic television interview with Grant and his fiancé surely would never happen in real life - I can't imagine it ever being aired and the interviewer not being fired. I had never imagined Kerr as a torch singer, and I still don't, even with the help of the ubiquitous Marni Nixon. And Cary Grant moving from playboy to starving artist, ignoring his millions to live in poverty (in a suit and tie, of course) in a garret so that he can prove something to himself and his lady love? Cary Grant? You kidding me? This whole romantic, pseudo artist thing might have been in-vogue in the 1950's ("An American in Paris"), but now it's just silly. Six months into the movie, as Kerr hurries to their agreed meeting at the top of the Empire State building, she's hit by a car and is crippled. It's at this point that I recalled the singing nun and the sickly kid in "Airplane!" and broke into uncontrolled laughter. Then the singing troupe of cute kids from the slums shows up, including one oh-so-cute little munchkin, and my jaw just dropped and hung there. Is there any trite contrivance that writer/director McCarey wouldn't shamelessly stoop to using? Sure, I'll weep when genuinely articulated joy or tragedy arise in a movie, but not when they're blatantly manufactured tripe. "An Affair to Remember" keeps switching gears from one type of movie to another, presents mostly contrived situations, and is anything but subtle, all the way through. It's so far out there that I regard it as a genuine curiosity piece. Fortunately, it's Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr (whom I've never seen look lovelier) who are on board, bringing to the movie more conviction than it deserves. "An Affair to Remember" isn't a wipe-out. It's the best bad movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lofty expectations are not rewarded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of the latest version of Titanic the first time I saw it. A decent plot overshadowed by a horrible script. Maybe its best to start with the few redeeming qualities of the film: Deborah Kerr and the ending. Deborah Kerr's character is entirely conceivable and adds just the right bit of stubbornness into the relationship with Cary Grant's character to keep the romance at a barely audible level. Note to filmmakers of the future: sometimes what the actors don't say is more important than what they do say. Please reference 'Rear Window', 'Remains of the Day' or 'Rashomon'. Things did improve at the end of the movie and the ending has a 'Citizen Kane' -esque feel. Now for the bad news. No matter how much it was mentioned in the film, I could not believe Cary Grant's character was a thrill-seeking playboy. He reminded me rather of a rich tycoon who was hitting on a girl that was entirely too intelligent for him. Where is the arrogant banter between the two? And another thing, I deplore the use of children to enhance any film especially when the film is this bad. Two pretty faces on the screen might have sold tickets back then, but now......oh yeah, I digress. Let me back up: if you are a moviegoer who has liked any Richard Gere film in the past, this is just the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most romantic movies ever made. The on-screen chemistry between Grant (Nickie) and Kerr (Terry) is magical just as it is in "The Grass is Greener".This movie's theme is that true love is forever and conquers all obstacles. Not only the love between Terry and Nickie but also Kenneth's love for Terri. Only a man who truly loves a woman would help her knowing she loves another and expect nothing in return from her.The ending scene where Nickie confronts Terry is definitely a tear jerker and very moving.I disagree with the previous commenter's opinion regarding the movie's attitude towards women - the movie was made in 1957.

Also, the original "Love Affair" with Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer is many many times better. Compared to the original this seems studied and prolonged. Still it is fun to see NYC in the 50s. Cary is of course amazing as always but be sure to check out Love Affair. Affair to Remember has that BIG color, BIG cinema scope feel to it but..so what? It doesn't have the heart of the original and no one, but no one has the spirit of Irene Dunne. Compared to her Deborah Kerr seems vapid and reserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a rather boring and unrealistic love story replete with many of the standard movie clichés of of the '40s and '50s. Of course, the players needed lots of Champaign cocktails, smoked lots of cigarettes and so on and so forth. As par usual in this genre, the principal characters had no visible means of support and seemed to be dependent on other characters with whom they were having a relationship. The decor was immaculate and of excellent taste and as the movie trailer promised, there were absolutely stunning shots of the French Riviera. But otherwise, the film was practically empty. There was one scene that really bothered me and I'll explain why presently.The scene was of Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr) being entertained by some children she had trained to sing. This was to show what her life was like after the accident that crippled her. I noticed that two of the children were Afro Americans. I was very pleased that they would include Afro American children in a singing group in 1957. But, sure enough, for no apparent reason, they had the children I just mentioned, do a soft shoe number in the middle of the performance. No other children danced. Both me and my friend screamed "Oh no!" during this racist filler. I suppose that things are historically defined, so "An Affair to Remember" is no exception.Finally, the music was bland and made no impression upon me.I'm afraid that "An Affair to Remember" is quite forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Affair to Remember (1957): Dir: Leo McCarey / Cast: Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr, Richard Denning, Neva Patterson, Cathleen Nesbitt: Overrated yet entertaining romantic comedy about connection. It stars Cary Grant as playboy Nicolo Ferrante, and Deborah Kerr as nightclub singer Terry McKay. They are both engaged to other people but viewers are jerked around for much of the film as these two struggle to avoid each other. They are aboard an ocean liner going from Europe to New York but they have one pit stop where he takes her to visit his grandmother. When they get to New York they go with their fiancés, however they promise to reconnect in six months atop the Empire State Building. Tragedy strikes leading to an ending where one of the leads uses tactful methods to withdraw information that leads to the revelation. Formula but charming film directed by two time Oscar winner Leo McCarey who previously made The Awful Truth and Going My Way. Grant is charming as a guy who struggled to settle down until now. This is just the inspiration to bring him back to his previous passion of painting. Kerr is effective as a conductor for a corny youth choir. Other roles are not quite up to par. Richard Denning and Neva Patterson are absolute bores as the cardboard fiancés. Theme regards connection and relationships that shape up to last. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew that the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan film Sleepless in Seattle had borrowed the Empire State Building for their climax, I just had to see it, from director Leo McCarey (Duck Soup, The Bells of St. Mary's). Basically on a cruise from Europe to New York, handsome playboy Nickie Ferrante (Cary Grant) and beautiful night club singer Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr), both engaged to be married, meet each other and get to know each other. Nickie is heading to New York to meet his fiancée Lois Clark (Neva Patterson), and Terry is heading to New York to be with her fiancée Kenneth Bradley (Richard Denning), but it becomes obvious they have feelings for each other, and a romance begins. Knowing that they will be parted, they both agree to meet again in six months time at the top of the Empire State Building. Six months pass, Nickie is waiting for Terry, not realising that she has had a terrible accident on the way to meeting him, she is paralysed, and Nickie believes she does not love him anymore. Time passes by, and Nickie and Terry do meet again by coincidence, and he tracks her down to have a calm talk with her, and that is when it hits him and he realises her situation, and they kiss for their happy ending. Also starring Cathleen Nesbitt as Grandmother Janou, Robert Q. Lewis as Himself - Announcer, Charles Watts as Ned Hathaway and Fortunio Bonanova as Courbet. The performances by Grant and Kerr are perfect with some witty dialogue, and with small humorous moments, and of course the near tragic love element, this is a very watchable classic romantic drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music for Hugo Friedhofer and Best Original Song for the title song. Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actors, he was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 23 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Passions.

By the time the film came to it's climax I was so vested in the characters that it would have been wrong to shed hollow tears, instead I felt the kind of physical heartbreak that normally only comes with seeing your own love life crumble then as it all came together at the end, my spirits soared. I gave the picture 10/10 simply because of all the emotions it evokes, something modern films seem to miss. This is a must see for any girl with a Cinderella complex or anyone with a heart for that matter. Just be warned, you'll be smiling for years every time you think of it.BTW Just in case you're thinking I'm a golden oldie myself, I'm 22.

		<shortDescription>I Don't Get That Guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nickie Ferrante and Terry McKay are both travelling alone on a cruise liner from Europe to NYC, and both are engaged to other people. They meet, fall in love, and vow to marry each other instead, but fate has other plans ...This is the one where Grant and Kerr agree to meet atop the Empire State Building only she gets run over by a car on the way there, winds up paralysed, and can't bring herself to tell him despite her overwhelming love because she doesn't want to be pitied. Do you see how that looks when you actually write it down ? I can forgive bad or unrealistic stories if they're fun (I like Larry Cohen movies), but I'm afraid this one is contrived beyond belief. What sort of a guy is Denning, a cuckold who, after being thrown over by his fiancée, resolves to do everything to make her engagement to a confirmed skirt-chaser work ? Am I supposed to identify with these people ? Grant and Kerr have a good on-screen chemistry and there are some nice moments, like the unconventional kissing shot where we only see them from the waist down. McCarey's direction is fine (he made Duck Soup, which is certainly in my all-time top ten film comedy classics), but like so many romance stories the plot is hackneyed and the characters have sweeping personality transplants throughout the story. There's also a really awful song called The Tiny Scout sung by some well-scrubbed street urchins. Scripted by McCarey and Delmer Davies, this is a remake of the director's 1939 RKO movie Love Affair (remade again in 1994 as an expensive bomb with Warren Beatty) and is heavily referenced in Sleepless In Seattle. Trivia - whilst many think of glamorous Hollywood stars Grant and Kerr as American, they were in fact English and Scottish respectively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the most wonderful love story I have ever seen! I love the tandem! It brings the viewers to this magical land of romance without ruining the humor and love Nickie and Terry shares. The kissing scene was neatly done! Nickie with his feet hanging from the steps and Terry immediately "hugs" him while he's kissing her. It's so nice! At least if you're a kid, you won't see the actual kiss but be happy still! The ending was a little cheesy and a little hanging! It's when Terry says "It's the nearest thing to heaven... you were there!" but I guess she delivered the line so nicely, some people didn't notice how cheesy it was. It's just how she expresses her feelings! Nickie just nodded all the way till the end, realizing of course that his remorse was upside down all this time! And I think it's the nicest thing that you find out that you're wrong and the person you have put anger into wouldn't be mad at you or be disappointed. The two of them truly understand each other and as a result, they hug each other! It's so nice! All in all, it's the nicest things I've watched! I am watching it twice a week now and it's okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong, sappy and not very memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I saw "Sleepless In Seattle" I've wanted to see this movie. I finally did last night and boy was I disappointed. I thought there was zero chemistry between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. The movie seemed to be padding out its length. For a non-musical it had an awful lot of musical numbers. A group of children get not one but TWO numbers, which include the two token black kids tap dancing! Nice. One minor scene in the middle and one crucial scene at the end involve characters looking at paintings that we, the audience, never see. Couldn't the studio have hired some hack artist to do a painting of Deborah Kerr? Even for 1957, this movie is hopelessly sappy, old-fashioned (not in a good way), and artificial. I heard the original 1939 version was better. I love romances but this one just didn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>narrative logic is not the idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I saw this film in just about the best conditions possible, in this most amazing cinema in Paris, La Pagode, which is a genuine Japanese temple lit by candles!! So already you're back in the glory days of cinema, when men were men, and women weren't easy. Cue Grant and Kerr, who even kiss off screen. A slightly mad bit of censureship that one (or maybe Grant had bad breath and Kerr begged the director to not have to do it really)! The whole film is not very strong on plotting -they fall in love because his Grandma has a nice house or some such nonsense. But you just have to forgive it this and let the whole emotion thing wash over you, and the final scene is both moving and gloriously cheesy in equal measure ("if you can paint, then I can walk!"). Personally I think Kerr's sub Audrey haircut a far bigger tragedy than her slight accident crossing the road. So my advice - accept you're going to see something saccharine sweet, then sit back, enjoy, and wallow in it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and annoying at the same time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"An Affair to Remember" is a fairly touching love story that suffers a great deal from one major weakness: it has too many annoying aspects. For example, the irritating TV interviewer and the laughing people at the dinner are exaggerated. Those are just minor aspects that can be considered petty niggling but they crucially decrease the enjoyment of the watching experience. And the musical numbers do not belong here; their only purpose seems to be prolonging the length of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good moments not enough for a thin film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming after the success of The King and I and To Catch A Thief, clearly Leo McCarey's brief was to have Kerr singing and Grant looking suave. He achieves some success with all this, turning out a Techincolor pageant that dwells on the principals and their romantic locations (Cote d'Azur &amp; Big Apple). There are also one or two coups: the first kiss; the ending.It's a dreary film though. The dramatic - and, alas, comic - pacing of the film sputters like a choleric coupé making hard work of a drive in the Riviera mountains. I gather that the principals were encouraged to improvise. It doesn't work at all. When points are to be made they are overworked and patronising, clogging the film like cholesterol. Too much of the film is made in the studio and all of it over-tinted so the locations feel wasted; Grant's strong tan is almost risibly dark.If you've seen Sleepless In Seattle you have also seen most of this; thin but not without charm. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Forgettable "Affair"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Save for Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant as romantic leads in certain key scenes of this rather farcical flick, there isn't a great deal to remember here. As for the "affair," I can't say I ever saw one shaping up. Grant gave Debbie a kiss on a flight of stairs, but all we saw of it was from the waist down so even that took place outside our view. In fact, the obvious consummation of their supposed deep romantic love did not seem to occur, even given the moral strictures of the late fifties when the movie was made. Since the word "affair" is in the title, however, I suppose we must surmise that the pair had sex somewhere along the line if only because they were reasonably sophisticated adults who'd never been married before. Setting that question aside for the moment, there WERE three or four nice scenes in the film. One was when Deborah invited Cary into her cabin but rejected his advances, then upon his retreat, suddenly suggested they go out to dinner. Another was when the ship made port in the Mediterranean and they visited his grandma, discovering that each of them were more or less devout Catholics and that grandma had given her spontaneous blessing to their potential union. We sensed the old woman would not be alive much longer, adding a poignant touch as she accompanied Kerr's singing on the piano and heard Grant speak French fluently. Another good scene was when the ship landed in New York and the pair critically assessed one another's steady flames. Finally, there is the last scene, in which Grant discovered that Kerr is the wheelchair-bound woman to whom his agent gave his painting and thus he suddenly understands all. Unfortunately, in between these interesting moments was a lot of silliness which at times was painful to watch. For example, why all of a sudden did Deborah decide that she couldn't be seen with Cary during most of the voyage, even though everyone on board the ship was well aware of their budding romance? It didn't make sense. And why was she playing music teacher to a bunch of cloying brats just because she couldn't walk? Quite obviously, it constituted a failed attempt to reprise her previous role as teacher at the royal Siamese court in "The King and I," where her youthful charges were rather endearing, and more to the point, central to the plot of the story.Others have commented at length upon the silliness of the plot line, so I won't bother to belabor the point. Let's just say that both actors did much better work than this in other efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes. I liked it better than the critics did. There is something unusually soothing and pleasant about this dull film. I found myself enjoying its dullness, its civility and lack of passion. Here is one film which does not try to be a roller-coaster but is content to be a pond. There are few of those. I also enjoyed the original version, but this one is nicer to the eye. It's better than "Love Story", isn't it? Love that old lady (not only Kerr!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sappy, Senseless, One to Forget!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say after viewing this I only wanted the all-too-oft mentioned Kleenex(tm) box to *THROW* at the television.SPOILER ALERT!!!Okay, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr fall in love on a transatlantic cruise and though they are both bound by fiancees, they agree to meet in six months atop the Empire State Building.Well, SOMETHING dreadful occurs offscreen to Miss Kerr (we only hear a shriek) and it is never sufficiently explained, one can assume she is paralyzed and unable to walk, but one would think she had been stricken with something terminal, from the odd way she is periodically hospitalized because she is "sick." Does she inform poor Cary, like any sensible person would do? NO, she keeps it from him, senselessly *ashamed* of her handicap. Lepers are more socially responsible than her character is, and rather than wonder if they will get back together in the latter portion of the film, I am left wondering if "handicapped," "disabled," or the by-today's-standards politically incorrect "crippled" was a Blacklisted Word by 1950's standards. At the very very end, Grant struggles to say it, but cannot! STUPID and senseless. The film nearly likens the mere glimpse of (gasp!) a wheelchair as though it were something shocking indeed. Kerr's character even meets up with Grant, well after the mystery-accident, and we KNOW they want to clear things up, but no! She simply can't. I hissed at the television in incredulous anger "What is the big d*mn DEAL?" A sensible person having been presumably plowed by a taxi would simply contact the other when possible and explain.Wouldn't one?However *this* character goes into some sort of odd funk in what must be a self-pride issue, needlessly heightened by the non-sequitor choruses of little children at a couple of points. This sudden pathos, indeed suggesting another director stepped in, shifts what might have been a tamer, light romantic comedy ala Doris &amp; Rock into a guilt-ridden, dark pall.Absolutely senseless.Kerr's misappropriated shame makes this film incredibly annoying, and renders a somewhat tangible love-story into a true anamoly. I would only recommend this picture to loyal Grant/Kerr fans, not the casual observer. You will want to throw things...</fullReview>

Back end is brought down with melodrama, sickening musical pieces, and forced scenes made to make the audience cry. Cary Grant delivers an above average performance as the suave Nicky, but Deborah Kerr lacks enthusiasm, therefore making many of the interactions fall flat.

		<shortDescription>A highly overrated remake--see the original instead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just an okay movie, but thanks to it being mentioned in Sleepless in Seattle, it is now considered by some to be some sort of classic. The sad fact is this is a poorer remake of a pretty decent romantic movie, LOVE AFFAIR. Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne simply did a better job than Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in this unnecessary remake. In many places, the movie is copied word-for-word and scene after scene from the original. So, why not just watch the original?! Also, although better, the original isn't exactly the best movie ever made because the whole gimmick of being hit by a car and not being able to walk is just pretty hokey--for goodness sakes, women, just tell him you've been in an accident and end all this angst!PS--since originally posting this review, I've gotten a lot of negative ratings. Provided you've also seen the original film, I encourage you to rate my review poorly. Otherwise, see the original FIRST so you can understand the context for my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts strong, turns mawkish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film started off pretty well, and I really enjoyed the scenes on the cruise ship. The latter half of the film turned excessively mawkish, however. I suppose this was the sort of film that women in the '50's flocked to. There's nothing wrong with a romantic film, they don't ALL have to have car chases and explosions. But Tom Hanks' character in 'Sleepless in Seattle' had it down perfectly, a total chick flick. There was one interesting directorial choice. When Grant and Kerr's characters share their first kiss, it is more or less off-camera, in that the viewer can only see the lower parts of their bodies, while their heads and arms are obscured. It left a lot to the imagination, not such a bad thing.(Take note, modern directors!)Cary Grant could do almost anything well, while Deborah Kerr was fairly forgettable here. Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original movie "Love Affair" is much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen "An Affair to Remember" twice.... after seeing Sleepless in Seattle circa 1992, and again a few months ago. I didn't enjoy the film either time. It had a good ending, but the 115 minutes prior to that were loooong and booooring. Incredibly dull.Today I saw the original black-n-white "Love Affair" with Irene Dunne. MUCH better. The dialogue &amp; acting are better, and the length is just over an hour..... it gets right to the point, doesn't waste precious viewer's time, and you still get the same powerful ending.I'd skip the remake, and go for the original movie. It's much more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but a bit slow and sappy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not for Sleepless in Seattle and the Warren Beatty/Annette Bening remake, I probably never would have seen or even heard of this movie.I thought the script was a bit too melodramatic for its own good and it was rather slow-paced compared to modern movies. Note the many singing sequences which do nothing to move the story along. Were this made today, it probably would have lost 10-15 minutes.Also, I was somewhat annoyed at the obvious sets. The boat where most of the first half takes places obviously isn't and Nickie's grandmother's house is obviously in front of a large drop, not the sea as nothing in the background moves.That's a minor annoyance though and the turns out pretty well anyway thanks to its actors, particularly Cary Grant, though he is cast somewhat implausibly as an Italian. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr were one of those screen couples that probably could have made any script tolerable (they were in a total of four movies together), and here they're working with a script that isn't half-bad.I'd recommend this to old-fashioned romantics, but if you don't have a taste for fifties movies, particularly romances, you probably won't like this either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet yet simplistic movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 11/3/2001 - 5 out of 10(Dir-Leo McCarey): Sweet yet simplistic movie where charm leading to love conquers all. There are some interestingly put together scenes and some innocence in the characters in their pursuit of their relationship that is not seen in modern times, but to me it all kind of falls flat as an entire movie. Grant &amp; Kerr play together well and do their best to charm us into the movie, but their monotone almost emotional-less approach to this situation where each character is leaving behind a fiancé to pursue each other seems unreal. Yes it is only a movie and there are much worse romantic/comedies but in my eyes there are much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie to Forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Cary Grant, and this is the first Cary Grant movie I've seen that I don't like. I think primarily my reason for not liking it is because of the dialogue. Deborah's Kerr's especially sounds too much like, well, like it was written for a movie. Everything she says is too perfect, the words come too easily. There are too many unfinished sentences throughout the film, and in the final scene they're talking in riddles. Maybe it's just me, but I didn't "get" this movie. I didn't find either of the main characters to be believable, nor did I find their "true love" to be believable. The scene at his grandmother's house is nice, but it seems out of place. There isn't much humor in this film (not that there has to be in every film), but what humor there is I personally didn't think was funny. I would still recommend this movie to Grant or Kerr or romance fans, because I seem to be in a minority in not liking it. But for myself, An Affair to Remember is a movie to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I watched Casablanca expecting it to be a mushy, sugary 1940s love story. I was pleasantly surprised and would rate it among the best films I've seen.Sadly, all the elements that make Casablanca a great film are distinctly absent in An Affair To Remember. The film is entirely about the relationship between two very dull people. If you are going to base an entire film on the relationship between two people, you at least have to give them a little charisma and personality. I just didn't care whether Grant and Kerr achieved ultimate happiness because I didn't care about them as people. To make matters worse, there is nothing else going on in the film; no sub-plots and no cameos like the French policeman in Casablanca.In Casablanca, Bogart, Bergman and Heinreid ooze charisma. The action moves at a reasonable pace and the love triangle is played out to a backdrop of war-time tension and desperation. Add to that the humour and the classic dialogue and you have a great film.The action in An Affair To Remember rolls along so slowly it is hard to stop daydreaming. Throw in the "characterless" characters and one-dimensional storyline and you have a film that is mediocre at best. I don't think I could sit through it again without drinking an entire bottle of brandy.</fullReview>

The acting seemed poor but I think that was just because the script was so poor. Cary Grant was ok, but the leading lady was a bad combination of annoying personality and below average appearance.I've read all the comments about this movie making people cry and "the scene" that gets you every time. I have no idea what that scene is or why anything in this movie would make someone cry. It IS sad that the lady is so ashamed of being injured and has so little faith in their relationship that she doesn't want to see Grant anymore, but it isn't the kind of sad that makes you cry.

It's beyond sweet, and into stupid. There are tolerable places, like the bit on the ship (pink champagne). However, once the ship bit is gone, the film dissolves into worthless crap.
