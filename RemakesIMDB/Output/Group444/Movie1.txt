		<shortDescription>OK, i'm sticking my neck out for this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only problem i found about "Thirteen Ghosts" is that it is not scary. It has the elements to be a horror movie, the ghosts, the gore, but it is not frightening at all.So this film can be a real party pooper if you're watching it with the lights off at your girlfriend's house waiting for her to grab your arm through the hard scenes, or expect to enjoy having some nightmares about it. But, omitting that--yeah, i know it's hard to omit that a movie labeled as "horror" is not scary--, i judge it as a very interesting film. The production design is great; the glass house is a state of the art, away from your typical haunted house, looking both luxurious and somehow creepy at the same time. That innovation, carried out with such a splendid result, is worth my applause. So is the decision to make the ghosts be real actors in the set, not digital freaks. Human monsters, even if having to go through 4+ hours of make-up sessions, even if having to use a double amputee actor to play a particular ghost, are the film's best trump card. There are good ideas in this film, and they're very well developed. It doesn't deserve a bad score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was fun. It wasn't a horrible flick my any means. The acting didn't make me want to leave, which is a definite plus for a horror movie. I thought the computer graphics were impressive. The ghosts were definitely freaky, and yes, I jumped a few times. I rarely jump in horror films, but this one I did...more than once.There were times where it was predictable however. This didn't take away from the entertainment factor though. I mean, this film isn't going to win any Academy Awards for best picture or anything, but it was a fun film. If you're looking for something to do this Halloween, take your friends out to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I've said so many times before...people, this is just a movie. It is not intended to make deep social comment; it is not meant to reflect reality; the characters are not obligated to exercise good judgment; the fact that this movie is supposed to be "based on" the earlier version is not really relevant; and it ought to be possible to be entertained by a movie without necessarily feeling genuinely scared.I find this to be a very entertaining movie. Good special effects, decent acting, lots of action, neat props and mechanicals, and some unique ghosts make this a lot of fun. Was I scared? No. I was startled sometimes, but not scared.So what IS wrong with this movie? Well, I'm back to my usual gripe about action movies. There's a point in the film where one character says to three other characters, "Stay right here until I get back. Don't touch anything." Without going into detail, let me simply state the obvious: the other characters don't obey him and the results are not good. This is always a big turn-off to me, because the people who disobey almost always end up getting out safely, while other people die for their mistakes. In another film, for example, a family in the Federal witness protection program is told not to contact their old friends. The daughter, however, can't live without calling her boyfriend at least once. The bad guys intercept the phone call, show up at the "safe house," and end up killing several US Marshals. Of course, the daughter is oblivious to the damage she has caused and goes on to live happily ever after. Just once I'd like to see the survivors turn to the person who was reckless and say, "That was all your fault!" and blow the person away in a hail of lead.Now, back to THIS film. I recommend it if you enjoy over-the-top horror/action films, but not if you are looking for some sort of psychological thriller or a moody mystery. If you liked "Dog Soldiers" and "An American Werewolf in London," then you should like this movie.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Thir13en Ghosts' is a movie with lots of flashing images and loud sounds. Most of the time that is a little annoying, although there are moments it adds something to the scary events that happen. I am not a big fan of the horror-genre, although I can appreciate it when it is done good. Here you have no real story, but there are some real scares. Since it is about ghosts those things can turn up anytime and anywhere. One of the characters even explains that "they like to do that".To explain the story would be quite pointless. What I can say is that a family without a mother but including dad Arthur (Tony Shalhboub), daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth), son Bobby (Alec Roberts) and nanny Maggie (Rah Digga) inherits a strange house, created by their uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham). We learn that Cyrus was a ghost hunter, of course with a purpose and a thirteenth ghost as the answer to a mystery, and that twelve ghosts are locked in the basement of the house. Two other characters are in the house as well. Dennis (Matthew Lillard) who sees future and past when he touches people and who used to work with Cyrus, and an opponent of Cyrus named Kalina (Embeth Davidtz). When the ghosts are unleashed they have to save themselves.I realize I actually have told you the story, but that is not what this movie is about. What makes it at least interesting is the visual style of the movie. The house looks great, the effects and art direction are very admirable. That there is hardly time to notice that is a shame. The scares might be stupid but they work enough to make this a real horror movie. Yes, there are many flaws and things go terribly wrong near the end, but if you normally like these kind of movies, you must be able to enjoy 'Thir13en Ghosts'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For fans of B-horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night, and I thought it was entertaining. Sure, it's a B-movie and has its flaws - it's a bit silly, it's not particularly horrifying (although I must admit no movie has scared me in 10-15 years, and I've watched quite a lot of horror flicks), it's a tad silly (Ghostbusters meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer?). But as B-horror movies go, this one is entertaining for those who like films with supernatural phenomena and people dying in "imaginative" ways. Actually, Thir13en Ghosts reminded me of one of my favourite films, The Cube. But that's just the reason I can't give a lot of points for this movie - there are better B-movies with which to entertain yourself. Cube-films sum up the better parts of the film and dispense with boring love-issues. But then again, there are heck of a lot more crappier films than this, and it was funny enough for me to even buy it for five or so euros in case I came across this in a store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Castle Would Be Proud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original 13 Ghosts when I was 12 years old and it scared me half to death. They gave you a viewer so when the ghosts appeared on screen you looked thru one color and could see them, but if you looked thru the other color you couldn't see them. Now that I see that movie again I wonder what I was scared of. But I loved all of William Castle's movies. He was the master of gimmicks and chills in his day. Now comes a new version of the old story, packed with gore and shocks galore in living color. No glasses or special optical device handed out at the theater this time. The film hits you with a punch to the senses in the opening scenes before settling down to a poor man struggling to make ends meet after the tragic death of his wife. He later learns that his dear wife's "ghost" has been captured by his eccentric uncle and is kept in a special cage in the basement. While vastly different from the original, this film can stand on its own. It is a complete retelling of the story with great action, special fx, acting and a few laughs thrown in as well as some references to the original. If you are just looking for some mindless supernatural fun and maybe even a moral (love is stronger than evil) this film is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someone HELP -- I love this movie, I hate this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you cannot hate fully, but you cannot like fully either. Something is missing, I can't point a finger to EXACTLY what it is, but I know if "it" were included, this movie would have been a blockbuster.It's a great Halloween "popcorn" film. It's entertaining. It's a nice attempt at an update of a movie that wasn't that hot to begin with. I liked the actors, I just wish they had more to work with. I really liked the Ghosts, I wished they were developed more, had more exposure/time onscreen and were a little bit more gruesome. Only a few ghosts out of the 12 got featured, I felt shortchanged.Maybe there was too much about the family for me..then again, maybe too little. Maybe the family didn't have enough goose-bumpy peril for me. I REALLY liked the daughter washing her face in the new bathroom scene. Maybe there should have been ALOT more of that kind of suspense/horror. I loved what happened to the Lawyer. I HATED the ending, it just fell apart for me. But, I loved the Nanny's closing line at the end and I think it would have been more effective if the film was a whole lot scarier and gruesome. I have to wonder, is there stuff on the editing floor that didn't make it?I watch this film everytime it comes on Cable-TV for it IS interesting, and there are parts that are good. Then there are parts that ruin it. Character development that has plot holes as big as the grand canyon. It was as if they wanted to make a horrific, scary ghost movie and just when they were about to let go, they pulled back. But ya know, you can still watch it and be entertained.Thir13en Ghosts 2? Only if the makers, the scriptwriter, etc., are allowed to let go and its released with the sheer horror, fear, gruesome tale it looks like it was headed in.I know it may offend alot of folks if Thir13en Ghosts went that "balls-out" route, but for what we're paying to get into movie houses now...do me a favor and scare the hell outa me!!! I can take it!!! Make me jump out of my seat ALOT...scream...grab onto my boyfriend and/or whomever else is sitting nearby! Trust me, I'll come back for more.This film had all the elements in place and it just peter-ed out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't rely on too much splatter and it doesn't try to startle you out of your seat every two minutes so that immediately makes it better than the average horror flick. The ghosts were unusual enough to be memorable and there was not a lot of familiarity to the plot. This was very nearly an excellent film with a solid cast and very good effects. Five or ten more minutes of scary interaction between the ghosts and the children(if you can call Shannon Elizabeth a child) would have made the movie much better. I call it a near miss which is as good as most horror fils can aspire to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great visuals with an above average plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see that most people aren't nearly as fond of this one as I am, so I feel compelled to write why I *did* like it.First, the visuals were really good. Many thrillers have to avoid showing detail about the villains because details end up being fake looking or difficult. This is one of several reasons why so many take place at night. Thir13en Ghosts works around that by giving the protagonists special glasses which allow them to see the ghosts. It's a lot less goofy than seeing it written in this review makes it sound and it means that the movie doesn't have to be shot in the depths of night.Second, the story was up to the task and original. I'll not dwell on this too much as the story centers around the house and the house is one of the main characters in the movie, but suffice it to say I was pleased with the twists.This one isn't going to win any awards, but it's a really solid film for it's genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Horror is the Script and Direction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For fans of nephew Arthur Kriticos(Tony Shaloub), you might find the film interesting enough to watch, other than that , buyer beware. Cyrus Kriticos(F. Murray Abraham), is the well renowned ghost hunter and collector. He needs a certain number and specific ghosts in order to fulfill his evil plan.Arthur has met with a personal tragedy, his wife died in a home fire, and he has inherited another home from his Uncle Cyrus. He moves in with his family , daughter Kathy(Shannon Elizabeth) and son Bobby(Alec Roberts). Subplot of Dennis Rafkin(Mathew Lillard) as super-sensitive paranormal investigator, who worked for Cyrus, and now comes to the aid of the Kriticos family.Subplot # 2 Kalina Oretzia(Embeth Davidtz) as another ghost hunter, who may have her own agenda. The direction is tawdry and pedantic. Jump cuts and abrupt scene changes only carry so far.The lack of emotional involvement dooms this film from the start. It fails to establish an emotional connection with the main characters, and the ghosts are shown as evil, rather than victims.So , there is little connection with them either. Certainly with such a talented cast, they could have made a better effort, but I suppose that most of the money was used for special effects,and as usual, that isn't enough to save this trick for Halloween, not much of a treat. 4 out of 10 on the boo meter, get your scares from "Fright Night" 1 or 2. A reel(pun intended) , disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This move is how do you say, a nicely wrapped up piece of crap.Thirteen Ghosts is about a machine. This machine was designed by a Man who was at the time possessed my Satan. Yes, Satan. If the plot doesn't seem stupid enough, it needs Ghosts to power it. Ghostbusters anyone? At the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a Michael J Fox movie.As time progresses you find out that the 'demonic machine' needs to be powered by ghosts. If done right, it opens the 'Eye to Hell'. Omgz0r. It's getting stupider.. The ghosts haven't killed anyone. Except that dumb guy that walked in between closing doors. *sigh* So, they find out that to stop the Machine a person has to sacrifice himself in the name of LOVE! This is a horror movie? In the end, everybody discovers to love and the ghosts walk away. I frigging hate this movie. For the good of mankind, please do not watch this movie! I beg of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films I have seen in a while...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is very much like Marmite. It makes you sick to the back teeth because it's just that bad, or it makes you twitch every time you see in the paper that Thir13en Ghosts is on. I, myself, fall into the latter category. I loved every second of this film! I saw this a few weeks back, I was bored and I was flicking stations on TV. Luckily, the film was only just starting. The scrapyard scene had me hooked. One downside to this was that Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) got killed off quite quickly. I would have liked to see a little more about his past, but then that would be trailing from the path of this story. Notwithstanding, the very feel that this film gave me was astounding. The makeup on all the ghosts had me looking away at times. I thought it quite strange that the ghost we saw the most of was naked to the eye, there should have been a bit of camera-share there. As we are really starting to get into this story, we find out that Kalina (Embeth Davidtz), the woman who is also trapped in the house, is actually helping the ghost of Cyrus. A small problem there, is he dead or not? He had a chunk of metal wrapped around his neck, yet he can be seen without the ghost-seeing glasses. Perhaps it's just me, I may have had my fingers clasped around my eyes.Brilliant film, I completely recommend this for anyone who wants a good fright and some small laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A family inherits what proves to be a haunted house, but a special pair of goggles allows them to see their ghostly tormentors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a chiller remake with grisly horror, genuine chills and shocks . When Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) , a very rich collector of unique things dies, he leaves it all to his nephew and his family. All including his house, his fortune, and his malicious collection of ghosts. As reclusive Dr. Zorba has died and left his eerie mansion to his penniless nephew Cyrus Zorba (Tony Shaloub) and his sons (Shannon Elizabeth , Alec Roberts) . Along with the house, the Zorba family has also inherited the occultist's collection of 12 ghosts (Laura Mennell as The Bound Woman , Kathryn Anderson as The Withered Lover , Craig Olejnik as The Torn Prince , Shawna Loyer as The Angry Princess , Xantha Radley as The Pilgrimess , Ernst Harth as The Great Child , Laurie Soper as The Dire Mother , Herbert Duncanson as The Hammer), who can only be seen through Zorba's special goggles.The house suddenly closes itself and they encounter trapped inside and soon supernatural creepiness begin frightening the hosts . Then they'll spend a ghastly night in the spooky house with killings-laden history . The family members, their lives at risk upon the discovery a strange book that lies hidden somewhere in the house , they receive aid from unexpected woman (Embeth Davidtz) as the threat to their lives is revealed .This eerie story contains bit good fun with grisly killing , relentless horror and lots of blood and gore. The chiller version packs genuine chills and terrifying deaths such as a horrible quartering . It's silly but amusing fun and with an excessive use of computer generator FX and special make-up in charge of Robert Kurtzman , Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero . The monstrous ghosts are the real stars of this production , being rightly realized by means of an excellent make-up and magnificent special effects . Some scenes are clumsily shot but the movie has some good moments here and there , the illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the creepy ghosts . The film was lavishly produced by Dark Castle , production specialized on terror genre and in charge of Joel Silver , Robert Zemeckis and Gilbert Adler ; both of them have produced successful terror movies dealing with eerie tales about horror , grisly killings and lots of blood and gore such as ¨House of haunted hill¨, ¨Return to house of haunted hill¨ , ¨Gothika¨, ¨Ghost ship¨, ¨House of wax¨ , Whiteout¨ , ¨Splice¨ , ¨The reaping¨ , ¨Orphan¨ , among others . The motion picture was professionally directed though without originality by Steven Beck who subsequently filmed ¨Ghost ship¨. The film resulted to be an acceptable but inferior remake from superior ¨13 ghosts¨ by William Castle . It was plenty of gimmicks, leaps from the screen and surprises descending on cinema-goers such as hidden wires and others . Of course the biggest film about this astonishing story is this vintage 1960 classic version rendition by William Castle that was starred by Charles Herbert as Buck Zorba , Jo Morrow as Medea Zorba , Martin Milner as Benjamen Rush , Rosemary DeCamp as Hilda Zorba and Donald Woods as Cyrus Zorba .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a choice between watching this and "Jeepers Creepers'. I chose "13 Ghosts" because I had seen '"Jeepers Creepers 2" and it really didn't impress me. Before the film started, I checked its rating, and roughly knew what to expect. The film was put together to form something that comes under the badly-remade-horror category. Hmmm...let's sum up the good things... The lawyer's death was a nice touch of gore, which this film doesn't have much of. I love the ghosts-they all have a different backgrounds and are pictured brilliantly, not using CGI for the first time in a horror film in a long time-I just wish they concentrated more on who the ghosts are. The building itself is different, and that is refreshing too. The idea with the machine and why the ghosts were kept was quite interesting, but it wasn't turned into a good script. It is awfully clichéd, it is not acted out well and it wasn't unpredictable and surprising enough. The story has some twists, but they aren't what they should be.I didn't mind this film too much. On the whole it was quite poor, but it had the potential to be good. If only more work was put into it, it could really have been something. But unfortunately it just turned out to be a popcorn flick which doesn't require you to use your grey cells. But hey, nice to watch something which can let your brain relax after a whole day of hard work. Am I right?Oh, and I shall just mention the creatures of the make up department again. They do make the film a a bit worthwhile, and I hope that the work of the department was appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story is very cheap!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listens to the story cheaply like in many classic horror movies. And this is also the Story.A couple of people come somehow into a house. You are locked in. Ergo they don't come out any more. How it also should be different, they meet spirits away under. The spirits are also prisoners of the house, though. You are sick but from their cells from rage around himself. Kill you for one couple of living.It files a lot of blood. The story is mindless and unimaginative. Therefore one doesn't have to think much. Every step is foreseeable. One gets the feeling as if one had written the film script himself. Much with tension is also no more there. Little existing tension anyway already increases seeing this one.The FX-effects aren't always so quite convincing either. But they aren't for everyone it isn't cheap for Splatter, so bad either. For every dumb apt Horrorfans one eye feast. Everything is weakly the Story and the FX-effects also don't put not quite incredible and the hairs at the nape of the neck for themselves open. Although this should be the case actually at a horror movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene of 13 GHOSTS instantly reminded me of umpteen other sources . The scrapyard reminded me of Freddy`s resurrection in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 , and with the involvement of a secret paramilitary organisation I couldn`t help but be reminded of these pre credit hooks in THE X-FILES . An ethereal voice ? Well fill in your own favourite voice from nowhere film moment .As the film continued I wasn`t really reminded of any other movies but became very aware of what is wrong with expensive genre movies coming out of Hollywood studios these days : A big budget spent on set design and CGI FX with an uninteresting script that`s completely empty on characterisation . That`s not the major complaint on this movie , my major complaint is this : The amount of strobe lighting . It`s very irresponsible of film makers to allow this . Even if you don`t suffer from photo sensitive epilepsy - And if you do then do NOT under any circumstances watch this movie because it`ll give you a fit - the amount of flashing lights between edits will give you a blinding headache , so much so you`ll probably want to switch off the TV . Having said that even if there was no strobe lighting I would have been hard pressed not to turn off the TV anyway because this is one boring movie overflowing with crap CGI and wafer thin charactersOne last point - One of the characters is told to join Greenpeace in order to " Throw paint on womens` fur coats " I wish to point out that as a former member of Greenpeace the organisation doesn`t allow this type of violent behaviour . Nor does it allow critical free thinking which is why I`m a former member</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i went out to rent 13 ghosts I was expecting it to be a little different than other horror movies and a lot more scarier. After viewing it for the first time i was dissapointed as their didn't seem to be much of a storyline to this film. This was a movie about greed, betrayal and wasn't realistic enough. The film though did have its good bits as well as the bad bits. Some things were done ingeniously such as the glasses as when you would put them on you could see them or with the role of the psychic (played by Mathew Lillard) who I must say once again performed brilliantly in this role as he does with his other movies. The way the ghosts were captured was cleverly done and most of them were very well costumized and they looked the scary part but others didn't. Overall I gave it a 4/10 because of the special effects, the brilliant acting of Mathew Lillard which I must say I'm a big fan of and some of the scenes were actually pretty cool and well done.Overall a big dissapointment and a lot more I thought was expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Severely Lacking horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thir13een Ghosts" really only exceeds in one area: that it's just another addition of the list of cheesy movies with numbers incorporated into the title (see: Murd3r 8y Num83rs). This hasn't been clever since "Se7en", which fits because this movie is anything BUT clever or original.The movie is about a family on the rocks following the tragic death of their mother. Now in seeming financial ruin, they are surprised with the announcement of a death of their estranged Uncle, who has bequeathed upon them a new but strange house. And this is where the family meets with the dreaded ghosts....First off, the movie is genuinly "jumpy" in some scenes. There were slight moments of suspense, but all finished with no real payoff. There were moments where I jumped, but thats not the same as scared. If you flash a picture of a cow smiling in front of me, i might jump too, especially if it's accompanied by flashy strobe lights and loud static and screams. Anyone can make you jump with a lot of trick editing and loud noises. The scares were totally left to the work of the editor, which says something about the story itself. Some of the ghost are kind of cool, but you can tell that they set forth to think of like six really cool ghosts, and then settled for a couple other filler-ghosts, and some silly characters. And the cool ghosts are just disgusting looking, not scary. To make something as disgusting as possible does not equal scary (see:Halloween's Mike Meyers).Now for the Acting. To put it politely, it was come of the worst I've seen in a looong time. Matthew Lillard is usually crappy, and he succeeds again here. Note:Spit Bubbles and wide-mouth expressions do not equal great acting. They equal drugged-up mental patient. Also Shannon Elizabeth is reeeally bad here. She is the most pointless character, and she also succeeds in being completely useless. She has the corniest lines ever, all delivered with the same wide mouthed smile and pig-tails. She is absurdly annoying and stupid here, words simply cannot explain. Tony Shalhoub and F. Murray Abraham are too good for this movie, and are scraping the bottom of the barrel for a paycheck here. And don't even get me started on Rah Digga's acting debut as the family's sassy black nanny. First off, the family is supposed to be poor and struggling, yet they can afford a nanny. Also, beware stereotypical sassy-black-women lines. They are here in abundance, and they are seemingly unaware of how dated and unfunny and racist this character is. And no, I haven't forgotten the young son, but I'm trying too, as will you after viewing this movie. You will forget about him halfway through this movie, and seemingly so does his family, sort of like the younger sister in "Family Matters". Oh yeah, she was there.So, in conclusion, this is a not at all impressive "remake" of a Hollywood Horror "Classic". Make no mistake, this "classic" horror film is about as classic as "House on Haunted Hill" was...which means it wasn't. Hollywood throws the word 'classic' around like its nothing, and this is the case here. This movie will have you shaking your head and laughing at some points, it is that bad and unintentionally. However if you liked "House on Haunted Hill" you will probably enjoy yourself here. Full of flashy editing, gross-out "scares", and some gore, "Thir13een Ghosts" is just another addition to the growing list of forgetful horror movies who place amount of blood-spilled and gory-ness of the wounds way higher on the totem pole than the story or acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again, like House On Haunted Hill, I came away from 13 Ghosts with a sad feeling of what might have been.I don't know, maybe I'm old fashioned, but I would have liked this remake to have been made around the time of the original; they made films for adults then, you know. Putting in lots of gore does not an adult film make.Apart from some shock tactics, and you will jump, the film is devoid of any tension and feeling of being trapped within a machine. I would have liked the emphasis placed more on how the characters get from A to B within the glass machine. For a much superior example of this go and see Cube.The glass walls were a nice feature, but I get the feeling the design was different for different's sake. There were lots of narrow corridors, however, I missed the big spooky rooms of a more traditional haunted house.The ghosts were designed for cheap shock value and lacked any genuine creepiness. They looked more like the ghosts of WWF wrestlers!For me, the film failed to define the characters well at all. This was not neccessarily the fault of the actors. The greiving father character had to communicate the loss of his wife, his home and the protectiveness of his kids in a movie that quickly resorted to the rapid editing of a pop video.The protective parent under adverse conditions was not covered particularly well here; for a better example one only has to see Ripley and Newt in Aliens.13 Ghosts is not a terrible movie. Anyone who enjoyed House On Haunted Hill, (and I did), and has the DVD on their shelves, (and I do), will find this an adequate stablemate, (I probably will), but if you're looking for a serious ghost adventure film with fully rounded characters, like Aliens with ghosts, then we still have a bit of a wait until filmakers stop making films for teenagers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailer Sucker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this movie and thought it looked great. Although I'm not a "horror" film fan I do like a good suspense and shock film, if intelligently presented or just plain entertaining.This however is none of these things.Surely a requirement of a horror film is to actually SCARE you, right? Why is it then that not one scene in this film is geared towards doing that. True, some of the ghosts antics might make you go "ewww" in mild disgust, but it's all handled so poorly you find yourself switching off 15 minutes into the film.It's a crying shame because the actual plot is a great one - some mad old nut traps ghosts in his house in order to power some diabolical machine. Sounds good on paper and the machine and house itself actually looks great on the screen too.But the ghosts weren't the only souless things in the building, where on earth did they drag-up such a "dumb and dumber" cast? I was actually rooting for the little kid to get sliced. Some of the ghosts look like they could be truly terrifying given a chance but what do we get? Some nutcase with a cage on his head slashing around for a bit and a naked "Carrie" covered in lipstick (sorry, slash wounds). The interesting looking ones do very little other than stand and watch the cast try and flee from them.All in all I can't actually think of a single good thing to the film. It has just 1 twist to the plot which in itself is quite predictable, truly average effects, no scares whatsoever, dull acting and a dull ending.Has to be one of the only movies I've ever seen where I enjoyed watching the trailers before more than the actual movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another idiotic horror film by someone who doesn't know how to make a horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While anyone must admit that the original "13 Ghosts" was no masterpiece, it stands as a monumental achievement in filmmaking when compared to this reeking, plotless mess. Aside from a funny line here and there, this movie shows no discernible quality that makes it worth watching. Sure, the implausible, mechanical glass house with the allegedly Latin inscriptions on the walls is rather interesting to look at, but, unfortunately, glimpses of it are interrupted and marred by the silly film that keeps intruding.Scenes of gratuitous gore actually become quite silly. Take, for instance, the scene in which one character (I won't say who) is sliced in half by a set of apparently razor-sharp doors. Folks, this is strictly adolescent fare at best. I can picture it now, a room full of 15-year-olds (my apologies at this point to intelligent 15-year-olds everywhere, for these filmmakers are below you) guffawing and saying things like, "Dude, wouldn't it be, like, totally cool if his head just, like, explodes, spewing brains and s*** everywhere?! That would be, like, so awesome. We should have one guy, like, get cut in half, you know."I'm sorry, but my patience has really been worn thin by misplaced attempts at creating horror. Horror is not about seeing people cut in half by glass doors or about seeing mutilated corpses in bathtubs full of blood. It's about suspense, which this film, tragically, possesses little of. It's just one ugly scene of gratuitous gore, violence and/or nudity after another. It seems that Beck's idea was merely to throw graphic scenes at his audience in rapid-fire fashion in an effort to terrorize or sicken them, none of which he achieves. I found myself laughing at scenes that were supposed to be shocking. I laughed because I could not take them seriously. It was like watching a film made by juveniles for juveniles based on what they thought would be "awesome" or scary.Simply put, this movie is just far too stupid to be scary or the least bit suspenseful. Even the opening scene is too overdone to be taken seriously, and it goes downhill from there.I watched the original "13 Ghosts" when I was a child, and I remember thinking it was a really spooky movie. When it recently aired on TV, I sat up late and watched it, and, even though I didn't find it quite as scary as I remembered, I thoroughly enjoyed the campiness of it. The original film at least does offer some truly suspenseful scenes and actually possesses a plot that intrigues and engages the audience. When it was over, I thought to myself that it would be really neat if it were remade. Sadly, I have discovered, this is not true. With filmmakers like Beck running amok, old classics and pseudo-classics are best left alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.I saw "Thir13en Ghosts" upon it original release back in 2001. It's not particularly scary, but has some nice makeup and special effects and the ghosts themselves are not badly done at all. The plot is simple, yet the premise is better then in you average horror flick.Overall, "Thir13en Ghosts" is enjoyable movie for while it lasts. The premise is much better than the final product, which could have been much better and bizarre. It's not the worst horror flick, but it's far from good. Given the budget at the time 20 million $ they should have focused more on direction and more sharp and tight script and not entirely on ghouls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strictly Okay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1960 film of the same name by William Castle, 'Thir13en Ghosts' is a strictly okay horror film, that offers a few scares here &amp; there.'Thir13en Ghosts' Synopsis: When Cyrus Kriticos, a very rich collector of unique things dies, he leaves it all to his nephew and his family. All including his house, his fortune, and his malicious collection of ghosts!'Thir13en Ghosts' begins well &amp; offers a fairly scary first-hour, but fails to engage in the second-hour. A weak second-hour, with a prolonged culmination, adds to its minus. The Screenplay is average, however, it offers a few genuinely scary moments. Steve Beck's Direction is atmospheric. Production Design is excellent. Make-Up is fabulously done, as well.Performance-Wise: Tony Shalhoub doesn't rise above the given material. Shannon Elizabeth is passable. Matthew Lillard hams. F. Murray Abraham is wasted.On the whole, 'Thir13en Ghosts' is, at best, watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm watching it right now, about the 4rth time of watching, roughly. STILL love it :) First of all, Matthew Lillard, playing Denis Rafkin, is an exceptional actor, and i love the character he plays also- an interesting character who has Johnny Smith (The Dead Zone) like powers. 'Bobby' is also a great actor, especially considering his age.The story is interesting, original, and the glass house is amazing. It definitely deserves more than the rubbishy two stars it got! The direction of the ghosts was very well done, it has gory moments (think 'Cube') and tense moments, but most of all it is just a genuinely good film, and worth watching. I thoroughly enjoyed it.My favourite scene, and perhaps the most memorable is the bathroom scene, but i won't give anything away, you'll know it when you see it. I also loved all the scenes with Matthew Lillard as he's soooo good.~ SparkyCola ~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a second outing from Dark Castle Productions, (House On Haunted Hill remake being the first) This movie was boring and dull.No doubt, the effects of the house and CGI of the ghosts where worthwhile, and chilling..As for actors, every one was wonderful espically Matthew Lillard (Rifkin) and F. Murray Abraham (Cyrus). Abraham was in a role that the late Vincent Price would have been at home in. The characters for the rest of the cast where dull characters... You couldn't care for them that much, In the beginning you did, finding out that their mother died, and the lost their house, and now living in a tenement with a housekeeper.... (How can they afford a housekeeper?)But the children are brats, they don't listen (which makes you dislike them, automactically you forget about their mother is dead) the Daughter (Shannon Elizabeth) is only eye candy in the movie.. The son is morbid, he reads the obituraries into his 'My Little Recorder'. Disturbing.... And the housekeeper who doesn't do any work...These qualities make you dislike them.. Had they had more redeeming characteristics you would like them. The only member of the family that you like is the father. He's trying to do the best he can.. He is an average Joe, trying to support his family and get but in life, missing his wife in the process....The film could have been better than it was. I Highly recommend the oringinal '13 Ghosts' or if you want a scare try the House on Haunted Hill remake, The Haunting, or even The Legend of Hell House.Happy Haunting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like the movie. I saw the trailer when it was first released and thought it would be an enjoyable movie. But when I saw it, I just couldn't conceive of how this was allowed to be made.First, let me just say that I was disappointed with there being only thirteen ghosts. I saw the DVD packaging and the number of different ghost pictures on the front. Now that I look at it, I see that they are all only among the thirteen ghosts. See, when I first picked the movie up, I thought there were dozens of ghosts, and only 'Thirteen Ghosts' was a clever title.Second, acting. Tony Shaloub isn't convincing at all when it came to playing Arthur. And that annoying Bobby kid. F. Murray Abraham is alright, but isn't as good as he could be. And the number of cliché moments in the film really bothered me, especially the credit sequence with the SAME happy family and the SAME happy brother-sister relationship and the SAME loving, warm, fuzzy family, and finally, the SAME disaster that tears them all apart.Third, the make-up. While the ghosts are very interesting to look at, I could tell it was really sloppy make-up. The hammer guy and the juggernaut were awful. I would say the only interesting make-up would be the lawyer getting sliced in half by the glass.And last, the ending. Another cliché. The SAME "oh, we're all together now kids, everything's gonna be alright. The ghosts are freed and we can live a happy life." Wrong. Did Arthur happen to mention that they have no house and that they have to go back and live at that crappy apartment? I didn't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait - weren't there actually F15teen ghosts?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty bad. It starts off with a really noise and busy scene in a scrap yard where a bunch of people get killed by a mean-spirited ghost. Then we meet an annoying family who inherit a house that is actually a "machine built by the devil, and powered by ghosts". Of course the kids don't listen and wander off, and more people get killed (rather gruesomely, although I have the admit the lawyer getting sliced in half was rather ingenious), until the spunky African-American housekeeper/nanny/comic relief saves the day by scratching some records.But there was some rambling legend about needing 12 ghosts, and then a 13th ghost to open up some Devil Eye or something...now, there were 12 ghosts in the house...then the lawyer gets killed...then Shaggy...and then Benedict Arnold-ish soul saver chick...so shouldn't there have been 15 ghosts wandering around?? I must admit the set (the moving glass house) was pretty cool. But the best part of the movie is the opening credits, where the camera pans 360 degrees around a room, while time passes and the room changes, without any visible edits. The director deserves better.</fullReview>

I didn't end up watching it at the cinema (I knew that everything happens for a reason), which annoyed me because I had heard it was terrifying, majorly haunting and just plain scary, but was I watching the WRONG film??!!! NO, I was infact, watching 13 ghosts... it even bored me so much that I kept fast-forwarding the supposedly really "scary" parts. If you have not seen this yet, I would definitely say...

		<fullReview>"Thirteen Ghosts" was no more made in the earnest hope or expectation that people would enjoy it than a ten-by-ten centimetre postage stamp is minted with the expectation that people will use it to mail letters. No; this movie, like the stamp, was made expressly for curio collectors of one kind or another. As such it isn't even a real curio.It wouldn't be so bad to watch a set of poorly-drawn "characters" move without purpose through such an idiotic, jury-rigged plot, if the film weren't so deeply, minute-for-minute unpleasant. To start with it's loud. Not just loud because there are events taking place which as it so happens produce a lot of noise, but loud because the sound engineers wanted to assault our eardrums; WHATEVER happens on the screen, they do what they can to ensure that it fills the dynamic spectrum entirely, producing an ear-splitting din that's only just this side of physical pain. There's gore everywhere, when there's no need (insofar as the story makes sense) for ANY gore. The people are needlessly nasty to one another and the footage is not so much edited as shredded. You don't seriously mean to say that there are people who LIKE watching this kind of stuff? If there are, there shouldn't be.Some people praise the set design, but you won't catch me doing so. It might have sounded like a neat idea to have every single wall and floor and ceiling made of sturdy clear glass, with Latin phrases written on every surface in white letters, and it may even have looked impressive to the cast and crew as they walked around the set, but to us, it's just shopping-mall chaos that hurts the eyes and conveys nothing. And what's the POINT, visually speaking, of having the house reconfigure itself, if it ends up looking precisely the same after as before?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Forget about the story, the ghosts and the acting. All those are deliberately stupid in the name of being artfully bad.But the house is remarkable.Since the beginning of film, directors have struggled with how to manage the camera in the context of space. Many types of solutions. Welles made the funhouse a character in `Lady from Shanghai.' One can see the influence of that, plus the library from `Ninth Gate' in this `house.' Polanski is the master of building-centric horror, so naturally he will be a source.But usually the solutions to space focus on turning the environment into a machine. Even the dreadful `Waterworld' had that marvelous trimaran.But the genre gets narrower when the machine is for supernatural purposes as in `Fifth Element' (on which the set designer worked), `Stargate' and so on. Just in the last few weeks, I have seen many films whose influence one can see melded here. Three influences: sliding walls, pits, orreries. The construction we have here is a pretty intelligent mix: a machine slides walls to manipulate the action of the theater. The inhabitants actions provide energy for the orrery-like mechanism. That mechanism centers on a pit.Examples:--- Sliding walls have a long tradition. Only a few examples come to mind other than Welles' funhouse. `The Cube'--- Also we have the influence of orreries. These were originally mechanical models of the heavenly bodies, which over time have come to represent control over heavenly forces. It's the same idea as the guy who can stop time by halting the movement of hands on a certain watch. Orreries are seen in `Dark Crystal,' `Hudson Hawk.' `Tomb Raider.' The version we have here uses counterrotating rings like the machine in `Contact.'-- The pit is the least interesting influence, something that is downplayed here. `Lair of the White Worm' is the purest example. `Mystery Men's' pit was cool too.I'd appreciate it if fans of the genre could send me more examples.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is no Juggernaut.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghost hunter Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) and his physic assistant Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard) have traced the ghost of Juggernaut (a serial killer called Horace "Breaker" Mahoney) to a junkyard. During the fight many are killed, including Cyrus, but Juggernaut is captured. Just why has Cyrus been collecting the ghosts of vengeful spirits? Enter Cyrus's nephew, Arthur (Tony Shalhoub), and his two children, who since the tragic death of their wife and mother respectively have fell on hard times. They are informed via the family estate lawyer that they have inherited Cyrus's bizarre maze of a mansion. So with babysitter Maggie in tow, they enter their dream home along with the suddenly appeared Rafkin, who is looking to get paid the money that Cyrus still owes him, and the lawyer. From where they unwittingly activate a machine that unleashes 12 murderous and vengeful ghosts.Produced by Robert Zemeckis and Joel Silver, it's no wonder that this remake of William Castle's fun and creaky 1960 film of the same name is a ball of noise and bedlam. Dispensing with Castle's creepy house formula, the makers here go for attempted psychopathic gross out set amongst a complex story, within a science fiction type mansion. The house works as a spectacle, the glass and metal revolves and slides and acts as a ghost prison-cum-deadly weapon in itself. But the makers forgot one very basic ingredient, it's just not scary-at all. Once the ghosts are unleashed, a vile looking and odd bunch they be, the whole bloody shrieking and banging things antics quickly grows tiresome. All sense of peril and potential hope for gore disappears, rapidly replaced by bad acting and potential harm to our eyes and ears. It's a shame because the premise is a dandy, if only they had thought it thru and hired better writers and a better director than the hopelessly out of his depth Steve Beck.To rub salt into the already weary wounds, upon searching thru the DVD of the film we find the ghosts have unique and interesting back stories. Now that would surely have made a better film one feels. Some nice design and a couple of tricksy moments aside, this Thirteen Ghosts just about scrapes in as a drunken time filler. 3.5/10</fullReview>

My memory must be worse then I thought.The first thing that struck me was that the picture quality made it look like a TV movie, the intro was horrible, the little plot reveals were done in an amateurish way the way the scenes were shot made it seem clunky and cheap. This stayed true for the rest of the film.When it introduces the main family, the 'imperfectness' of them was done in a lame way. I didn't care ONE bit about any of them. When they were driving to the house, there was a shot where the car was leaving the city on a bridge, heading across the screen in one direction, then when it cut to another road with them driving past, it was going the opposite direction. Just straight forward BAD directing.In fact the only two things that were good about the movie were the house...even though it really could've been better, plus it wasn't shot very well and the lawyers death was pretty damn cool, especially how his tie falls off first.I remembered the ghosts being great. But they sucked, only the fat ghost was creepy, because of his mum taking him around mostly. None of them were used effectively though.Total waste of what could've been some good mindless fun.I must watch the original.2/10(reviewed after third-ish viewing (must've seen it at least a couple of times many years ago))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects with little else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you expect little more from a film than good special-effects, then you may find this film worthy of your time. If, however, you value character depth along with an interesting story-line, I suggest that you not spend your time watching this film. First, the characters in this film are very flat, all of whom embody the values typical of what the moderately educated middle-class place so high: a reverence and desire for all things that, on the surface, seem worthy of attaining (money). More specifically you have the 'caring, yet bumbling Dad just trying to secure a future for his family'; 'the hot and naive teenage daughter', whom, because of her good looks, we are supposed to pity when she is unjustly assaulted by one of the ghosts ; 'the mouthy Negro woman who 'tells it like it is''; and, of course, 'the sketchy character of the family that cannot be trusted', namely the rich uncle.The story-line of the film is told before the backdrop of these lame characters. And as if the plot were not already predictable, it is then explained to the viewer TWICE! The result is devastating for the movement of the plot, as any interesting ending it could have had is laid bare for the viewer. The reason for this self-sabotage suggests that the makers of this film either believe its viewers to be completely stupid, or have no clear idea how to tell a story with an eye to holding the audience's interest. This is not a work of art as good cinema is, but just a collection of archetypal characters supporting a very tired and weak formulaic story-line. The special-effects are fairly good, but they can and never will be a replacement for rounded characters, an interesting story-line, and artful scripting. Leave this film on the shelf.</fullReview>

Somebody ran out of ideas in the creation department and though, "Shucks, we can't have this be like the original, but nobody likes creativity anymore. I know! Lets just throw around vast quantities of blood and have a naked female ghost running around!" Let me say this to whoever thought that: Go look through the classifieds because you need a new line of work. Blood and gore does not equal scary.Point two: By the end of the movie, myself and the rest of the audience were rooting for the ghosts. When Cyrus was thrown into his own machine, there were universal groans - we had all hoped that it would have been one of those annoying kids. I'll be honest, I couldn't blame Cyrus for wanting to toss his nephew into the Eye of Hell, the thought occurred to me a few times during the movie.Third point: For those of us who can read Latin, I was not amused. I swear (though nobody would pause the movie for me) that one of the glass panels read "Semper ubi sub ubi" (and apparently somebody else saw it, too).Point four: People, write a comedy or write a horror movie, don't try both. Comic relief is a good thing but come on, having the day saved by Rah Digger's mad DJ skillz?! What was that? Conclusion: I kept hoping that this movie would get better (alas, twas in vain). Instead, it was like a trainwreck - I wanted to look away but my masochistic side wouldn't permit it. I beg you! Spare yourselves! It would have been a much more pleasant movie if a car in the junkyard had fallen on Matthew Lillard instead of Cyrus. End result: Unless a movie is some sort of art- nouveau social commentary, the audience should not be cheering for the bad guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of plastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my friend bought this on DVD, a group of us sat down to watch it, anticipating a horror movie that would torment us in nightmares to come with gory deaths and haunting climaxes. However, the very act of having to sit through this entire movie will be what's giving me nightmares from now on! Emblematic of what happens when Hollywood has too much time and money to blow, this was simply a waste of people's time and money. Rife with stereotypes (get the black woman always being hip with the mixing even amidst the 'gore', or the 'high school quarterback's story) that bordered on the comical and farcical, it's hard to think that this wasn't satire or some other horrible joke. Watching the 'biographies' afterwards was downright unbearable. Could not give it a worse rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a poor and disconnected storyline, an annoyingly tired cliche cast of characters, mix in a lot of overpriced special effects and bad halloween costumes...top it all off with a healthy dose of bad directing, sound effects and music right out of the October happy meal, and some of the worst acting you can dig up...and you have this steaming pile of excrement.The story has the feel of something that was worked out in a couple of days on a cocktail napkin. It rushes you in with little suspense to what I suppose was meant to be an interesting plotline, but which rather winds up resembling an early episode of "He-Man" or some other bad cartoon of your choosing. The characters follow suit. You have the detestably cute little boy who lisps every other word, you have the "you go girl" token african-american nanny who I think is supposed to be comedy relief, you have the evil eccentric uncle out to conquer the universe, and a whole array of ghouls right out of the Spencers Halloween season catalogue. Everything about this movie is so poorly done and cartoonish, it never even approaches anything remotely frightening...beyond the fact that someone actually wasted a great deal of money making this atrocity. A word to the creators of this horror...You should all be ashamed of yourselves.</fullReview>

Special effects laden remake of the 1960 William Castle cult classic about an inherited haunted house with the titular spectres gets a facelift with state-of-the-art visuals and an impressive production design (Sean Hargreaves) that outshine this otherwise tedious scare-free horror flick (the second of cult horror classic facelifts produced by Richard Zemeckis, Joel Silver and Gilbert Adler, the guys responsible for resurrecting "Tales From The Crypt" as a successful HBO series) with Shalhoub and his family in peril after being willed a glass house/machine driven entity with angry ghosts seeking vengeance. Some cool graphic offings (i.e. someone is efficiently sliced in half vertically) can't make up for a weak storyline and bad acting (Elizabeth is reduced to a lot of airheaded mugging).

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I have seen in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the worst and most pathetic film I have seen in years. It is not that it is so bad that it is laughable, it is that it is so bad it is painful to watch. My friend next to me began staring at the wall because he just couldn't stand the stupidity anymore.There is no buildup and the characters are instantly thrown into the plot with little background. This makes it so the audience couldn't care less what happens to these people, and actually hopes they get killed so we won't have to hear them spout their pointless lines any longer. It was as if the makers of this film got all the special effects done and then realized they forgot to write plot and dialogue.Therefore, the audience is given such classic cliches as "This house is so big. We will never get this done. Let's split up." I just kept being dumbstruck by all the stupid angles this movie was trying to go in. The acting was laughable and I am surprised the performers could keep a straight face while delivering their ridiculous lines. The worst of these characters was the terrible exploitation of the fast talking black actress whose soul purpose in the film was to spout off stupid tired cliched lines that are intended to get a laugh. Shannon Elizabeth, although beautiful, also shared in this pathetic wasteland of meaningless lines and had no point in this movie beyond being pretty. Her little brother was equally terrible and I was glad they forgot about the two during half the movie.The film also contradicts itself an many ways- the actors can talk freely through the "soundproof" glass. Also, when the house is foiled in a unbelievably easy manner, this "unbreakable" glass explodes. Interesting....Avoid this film at all costs.</fullReview>

I was utterly disappointed, as I was expecting much more. I didn't end up watching it at the cinema (I knew that everything happens for a reason), which annoyed me because I had heard it was terrifying, majorly haunting and just plain scary, but was I watching the WRONG film??!!! NO, I was infact, watching 13 ghosts... it even bored me so much that I kept fast-forwarding the supposedly really "scary" parts. If you have not seen this yet, I would definitely say...

		<fullReview>Well, being as forthcoming as I can, I have to admit that I wanted to watch Thirteen Ghosts for a really long time. I love haunted house films, and there was no reason why I should not like it. But it way surpassed my expectations. I was bad. Really bad. Not even Tony Shaloub nor Shannon Elizabeth could manage to save it. Ok so the SFX and sound are really good, but that isn't enough to save a movie. The characters were overly stupid, the plot dumb as well. As I watched the movie, I totally lost the interence halfway through. This movie is so down, that even House on Haunted Hill was better. No Kidding! What bothered me the most was how come when you see a movie like this you don't feel involved? This hasn't a begining, middle and endind pre defined; it's all a mess. Hallfway through you don't know where you are, and suddenly when you start to fairly understand the movie, it ends. Let's not even talk about Matthew Lillard's last appearance. How isn't he ashamed of coming out eversince?In the movie connections area, there is that this movie references The Haunting (1999). DON'T believe it.

		<fullReview>The only scary thing about this movie is that someone out there thought it would be a great idea. The plot starts off OK, but after about half an hour, it runs out. At this point, it degenerates into repeated bouts of men running around in rubber masks, and jumping on the unsuspecting victims from behind conveniently placed furniture. By the end of the film, both the scriptwriters and the actors have given up completely.Admittedly, the house in which the film is set is a masterpiece of design and the special effects are passable. But, like its predecessor "The House on Haunted Hill", the pitiful storyline is only there as an excuse for the characters to be placed in a house full of Ghost Train-like scares. And like THOHH, once all the special effects are over and done with, the film rushes towards an extremely unsatisfying ending where suddenly everything ends OK without any explanation why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not enough scares, but a great visual look. ** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 GHOSTS / (2001) ** (out of four)I'll admit that I'm a sucker for haunted house movies. I forbid a guilty pleasure watching miscellaneous characters roam through dark, creepy hallways and walk through ominous corridors as vicious evil lurks behind closed doors, and observes from the shadows. The characters' fates are never in question, but it's a lot of fun watching them meet a gruesome demise.I enjoy this kind of film so much that I even found a soft spot for "House on Haunted Hill" and "The Haunting," 1999's critically mauled haunted house movies. Naturally, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of "13 Ghosts," a state-of-the-art remake of the 1960's William Castle horror film of the same name. Warner Bros. released it the weekend before Halloween, and they couldn't have picked a better time. In 1999, "House on Haunted Hill" broke box-office records when released on the same weekend. All that aside, "13 Ghosts" will be a major disappointment to even diehard fans of the genre like myself. The film perspires with potential scares, complete with an intriguing premise, a tantalizing trailer, and an astonishing visual appearance. Unfortunately, the screenplay drops dead on arrival, filled with enough recycled moments and cluncky, one-dimensional dialogue to wake the dead. This movie is a wasted opportunity.The film stars Tony Shalhoub as Arthur Kriticos, the widowed father of two children, Kathy ("American Pie's" Shannon Elizabeth) and preteen Bobby (Alec Roberts). As the movie opens, the family faces tragedy as a fire burns down their house and kills Arthur's wife. They are left with nothing.Nothing, that is, until Arthur inherits a unique house from his late, eccentric uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham). The house is a masterpiece of modern architecture. Made entirely of glass and steel, antique treasures fill the rooms, strange machines, gears, cranks, and big glass chambers position themselves throughout. The family can't believe their good fortune, nor do they believe a mysterious character when he tries to explain the house is haunted. Like most haunted house movies, "13 Ghosts" works best when the characters explore the mansion completely unaware of the danger that awaits. Too bad this kind of sequence only inhabits but a few moments of the already short movie. With a running time of only 88 minutes, everything feels rushed, contrived, and astonishingly brief. Talk about rushing things. This movie pounds us with moments of loud noises and violent encounters. If the film would have developed an ominous atmosphere and obeyed the rules of haunted house movies, then the rapid-fire violence may have worked to some extent. But we just don't get that here.Prosthetics specialists must have had a field day with this movie. Contrary to the title, there are twelve different ghosts in this movie. We admire the makeup and special effects department when we see the masterfully crafted ghouls. But when we do see them, it's through quick, brief flashes. The editing is choppy, brief and visually incoherent. It's like director Steve Beck wanted the ghosts to be special effects instead of a solid physical presence. Big mistake. "13 Ghosts" will not win any awards for composition. The overuse of slow-motion photography quickly becomes a nuisance. The editing, photography tricks, and computer animation techniques often feel misplaced. However, even if the film was masterfully constructed, a good technical department does not make up for the lack of a sufficient script.But no! "13 Ghosts" is too concerned with pleasing audiences, and providing us with comic relief. Relief from what? The film does squeeze in a few decent horrific moments, but for the most part it is not that scary. If the film was 88 minutes of pure, edge-of-your-seat suspense and horror, I can see why comic relief might be in order. But with "13 Ghosts," we deserve more than comic relief, we deserve a better movie entirely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thir13en Ghosts (2001): Dir: Steve Beck / Cast: Tony Shalhoub, Matthew Lillard, Embeth Davidtz, F. Murray Abrahams, Shannon Elizabeth: Dreadfully loud and stupid film that is way over budget and too loud. F Murray Abraham plays a man who is totally out of his mind and desperately needs mental counseling. He seeks to capture thirteen ghosts and accompanied by a meathead Ghostbuster played by Matthew Lillard. Abrahams dies and a relative family gain possession of the massive house. They meet a cynical lawyer who is severed in half vertically and we are given the glorious image of his guts sliding down the glass. There is thirteen ghosts concealed in the basement as occupying an apartment complex. The ghosts get loose, thanks to stupidity and go on a killing spree until Embeth Davidtz appears as another Ghostbuster. Director Steve Beck could have spilled toxic waste on the floor and got better footage. It is every bit as fetching as toilet waste. Horrible acting by Abrahams, Lillard and Davidtz as well as Tony Shalhoub. Abrahams in particular should have known better since he is famous for his performance in the far greater Amadeus. Shannon Elizabeth goes from sexy image to idiot in this film. The special effects are massive but the film is graphic and disgusting and should be placed in a paper shredder to become a much prettier mess. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen "Thirteen Ghosts" about four or five times already, I can say that the movie continues to be entertaining when revisited with some years in between. And I simply refuse to refer to the movie as "Thir13en Ghosts"; I am not a hipster having to include numbers in with letters.It is the story and ghost design that makes the movie being fun to watch again and again. The concept of trapping ghosts in a house and unleashing them to wreck havoc is just downright fun. And the designs of the ideas for the various ghosts is nothing short of visually great. They always impress me.The effects in "Thirteen Ghosts" are quite good and really adds to the enjoyment of the movie.It should be said that the acting in the movie was good, and especially Tony Shalhoub impressed in "Thirteen Ghosts". Normally I am not much fan of Matthew Lillard, but he was actually quite good in this movie. And F. Murray Abraham as Cyrus was just perfectly cast."Thirteen Ghosts" is not a scary movie as per se, but it is worth watching for the story and the special effects.</fullReview>

I like the idea of the Black Zodiac, and as I have the DVD I got to find out each ghosts back story which I found really cool. It also has quite good CGI in some places (every long shot of the house from outside is CGI, which I didn't realize until I watched the special features). Overall, a pretty good movie (don't be put off by the fake-looking blood at the beginning when the truck sprays it out in the car dump like me and my friends did the first time so we turned it off at that part- but it gets better :D )</fullReview>

I guess that it would have been much more interesting to explore the back-story of each one of those ghosts, rather than the generic "jump-scare" drivel that it turned out to be. The original "13 Ghosts" film was quite cheesy too (To say the least), but at least the character's from that movie weren't so annoying.This is just a shallow and forgettable exercise of style over substance.2.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>21st century remake of the William Castle gimmick classic is evidence of that old adage that bigger ain't necessarily better. It has all of the special effects that money can buy, and action to spare, but completely lacks any sense of subtlety or atmosphere. The story has a struggling family - father Arthur (Tony Shalhoub), daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth), and son Bobby (Alec Roberts), with nanny Maggie (rapper Rah Digga) in tow, coming into possession of a house owned by Arthur's late uncle Cyrus (Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham). What they don't know is that Cyrus was evil and designed a house of horrors, with an abundance of windows and a collection of angry, ugly looking spirits whom Cyrus has been collecting, with the help of a whiny character named Dennis (Matthew Lillard). Shalhoub and Lillard compete to see who can overact more, while fortunately Abraham doesn't act like the material is beneath him but gives his all in each of his scenes. Embeth Davidtz co-stars as the spirit specialist who supposedly is on hand to rescue the family and help them solve their problem. However, as anyone can guess, spectacle takes precedence over characterization as people get terrorized and bounced around inside this haunted house. The great conceit of the Castle original does get carried over to this film, in a way; back in 1960 theatre patrons were given glasses that would allow them to see the ghosts. Here characters in the film are given glasses to make the ghosts visible. The KNB group do an admittedly impressive job at giving us a macabre rogue's gallery of nasty looking spirits (the Jackal has to rate as this viewer's personal favourite), but the real star of "Thir13en Ghosts" is the house itself, a triumph of production design, art direction, set decoration, and special effects work. The film really doesn't do that bad a job of creating a funhouse feel, but it could have been pulled pack a bit to build up a little more mood and ambiance. As it is, it's reasonably fun but never exactly scary. One good thing is that the film goes on no longer than it needs to; pacing is not an issue. It should be adequate entertainment for some horror fans. Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the thing - I've seen this a bunch of times on TV, and I have yet to understand what the hell is supposed to be going on. I get the obvious plot. Still. This is clearly no house, funky bathroom notwithstanding, and I'd think the first reaction from the family, after the awe, would be: it's basically an unlivable sort of machine (which point was plain from the start, as most foyers/living rooms don't have spinning floor centers). Then, I can't fathom the role(s) of Psychic Glasses Dude, who is oddly surprised to encounter the ghosts he helped round up. Worse is the unclear 'resolution' regarding Shaloub's sacrifice. As has been said hereabouts, what's the point of the machine kicking into high gear when the guy waiting to benefit from it is dead? Biggest mix-up: are these ghosts purely evil or merely due parole to some afterlife? There is no agenda of actual ghostly malice toward the family, since we never quite understand what the hell the ghosts are after, except freedom. Which ties into the strange addition of Shaloub's wife. ONE ghost gets to be non-psychotic/horrible? This relates to the bizarre factor that the wicked Cyrus would somehow not anticipate that his humane nephew would screw everything up out of love. Also noted here: how does a broke math teacher afford a nanny, even if she supplies the sassy, Eve Arden element? The movie is actually watchable because care went into the ghosts. I rather think exploring their back stories would've made for a better film. But, in terms of any linear story or rationale, this is way a clinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the success of "House on Haunted Hill", a couple years later Dark Castle entertainment would go on to produce another remake of a William Castle film; "Thir13en Ghosts". Adding 13 in to the title was the remake's own fancy novelty. I have never seen the original 1960's version, so I can't really compare, but for most part this eccentrically gimmicky horror staple was slickly made and mildly fun. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. Aiming for macabre fun. The execution in some aspects does pale in comparison to the concept. Really the inventive premise is archetypal, especially with the daft twists but it's the clockwork mansion along with its harbouring ghosts that make the day. The almighty mansion was a strikingly vivid creation, like some sort of mechanic Rubik's cube made of glass and bestowing an ominously demonic edge. While the spirits locked inside, each with their own distinguishable quality provided some unnerving images with their jerky, sped up movements and nasty encounters. The only ways they can be seen are with special glasses. Director Steve Beck goes on to create a forlorn funhouse atmosphere with dazzling computer effects, grisly make-up FX and numerous slow-motion visuals. While flashy, it does feel empty. This can be seen in some of the performances too; Tony Shalboub, Embeth Davidtz and Shannon Elizabeth (whose character has a real excitement for bathrooms). Although Mathew Lillard is a neurotic live-wire and Rah Digga annoys more so than entertains with her comical role. F. Murray Abraham shows up in a small part, but is probably the best of the lot. Stark, but slightly amusing supernatural horror escapism."This place is awesome!"</fullReview>

The lead man Tony Shalhoub is actually quite a good actor and was the only good thing in the movie, but unfortunately he alone was not enough to bring the quality of the movie up at all.Everyhing was over the top and unrealistic - especially the scenery - way too much gold and glass, plus all of the ghosts look ridiculously fake.They were continuously trying and failing to produce suspense and scary moments, the only people they would've been able to frighten would be 9 and younger, purely because of it's lack of believability.I'm not even sure why i sat through the whole movie and would not recommend it to anybody, and i really do think the three star rating I gave it is being generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The average creepy movie addict would not be pleased. The film attempts to meld the horror genre along with a spoonful of comedy, a formula that kind of kills it before it even gets a chance to really show it's potential. You know that a horror movie isn't going to work when there are more laughs than screams.The plot line is rather discombobulating. The concept is simple, at first. A filthy rich kleptomaniac dies and leaves his house to his freshly widowed nephew. The house happens to contain a sinister implement of Satan in the basement, where in addition to the devil-spawned machine, holds several dead, but undead souls as well.From there the plot line gets a little knotted, and unfortunately, it never really untangles.The transition between scenes does not run as smoothly as one might like. The scenes with the ghosts are done in frequent flashes from one character to another-- and the end result looks a little flaky.The ghosts themselves reminded me of homicidal clowns-- though more comical, than scary. (big, exaggerated steps, lots of growling, snarling, exposing canine teeth) The ghost's costumes, while supposed to be frightening, are as over-the-top as their acting. Did anybody else wonder why the little boy had an arrow sticking through his head? It made him appear more like a sideshow than a evil force to be reckoned with.So as I said before, hard-core scary movie watchers should stay away. But those looking for moderate entertainment are encouraged to give it a shot. You might enjoy it, but the chances of actually liking it are less than 20, maybe 12%.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, more people should make movies like this. Years of penetration into the mainstream by great cult films, combined with biannual doses of M. Night Shyamalan have made everyone think that horror movies are supposed to be these leaden ballets of dread (or, equally bad, winking, awful self-parodies). Honestly. I'm glad somebody still has the sense to make a horror movie that is this silly without feeling the need to pretend their in on the joke. Who knows, maybe Thi13een Ghosts (hip spelling, eh?) was supposed to be an elaborate, deadpan satire of horror, but I doubt it. It seems more like a big, dumb, fun spectacle - the only movie I can think of that combines a man who likes a lot like David Bowie getting sliced in half, a skinny girl with slash marks on her enormous breats, Matthew Lillard literally at one point foaming at the mouth, and (Academy Award Winner) F. Murray Abraham getting ripped apart by a giant gear. Come on. The editing is ridiculous, the continuity is mediocre, the token black character is vaguely racist in her sassiness, and the movie has Tony Shalhoub AND Shannon Elizabeth. Wow. It makes it look easy - makes what look easy, you say? We live in a time when it's difficult to make a movie this ridiculous and MEAN it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand the scorn poured on this movie in the reviews that I just read through. It's not THAT bad. The acting isn't terrible - like so many people say. The actors try their damnedest - and lets face it, with a script this thin, they had their work cut out.On the other hand, all the ghosts look like rejects from Clive Barker's Hell Raiser and would barely pass muster in Michael Jackson's Thriller video so why lavish all the praise on them? They weren't scary AT ALL! I'm the guy who slept with the light on for a month after watching Salem's Lot. I scare easily. And this film is just not scary. No hiding behind my hands or gripping the edge of my seat. Just mildly entertained by watching the SFX mechanics.But it's not a bad film. I've seen a whole lot worse. Problem is, it's not good either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the original movie of the same name, which by the way, is better--somewhat dated and corny, but overall better, I decided to view the 2001 version. I could not wait for this version to end--it was that bad. Horrible, awful, dreadful. Lousy acting, a thin, pale resemblance to the 1960 film. The plot here is very unrealistic. The movie is just a waste of one's time, one's money. It is not scary. It is just stupid. If you are interested, I would suggest you see the 1960 original, which is available on DVD. You'll enjoy that one more. The 2001 Thir13en Ghosts is a total and complete lousy movie. Once again, it's horrible, all right, horrible to sit through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Ghosts Not A Total Waste Of Time --Spoiler--</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-SPOILER--Unlike the majority of the reviews I have read here before seeing this film, I liked it. I felt that the sets and special effects were very good as well at the dialog and acting by the cast. Although I did see quite a bit of copycatting from other horror flicks in the plot line, the pleasant surprise twist toward the end of the movie was clever. The house was awesomely disturbing and the ghosts were full blown grisly. I found the horror was horrible without being mind numbing. I am an avid "Monk" fan and I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I weren't. The simple fact of seeing Tony Shalhube walking around most of the movie with either a coffee stained shirt or blood on his hands made me grin, given his super phobic germ persona on the USA series. I kept waiting for him to impatiently say "wipe" to his nurse and side kick Sharonna while she nervously fumbled through her purse looking for a package of portable wet naps. The whole "messy Monk" theme tickled our funny bone. The coincidence that he also plays a grief stricken husband at the loss of his wife in both the movie and the series was interesting. Perhaps the role he was born to play. If you are planning to watch this movie with a teenager and are offended my nudity and the F word, I suggest you pass. ON RANT: One of the ghosts is a silicone sister of voluptuous proportions. I'm talking a seriously slashed, butcher knife wielding babe who is buck naked through the film. The 20 something babysitter who proclaims in the end that she is "sick and tired of working for those crazy white people", spews the F word at the drop of a hat. In that respect, I am old school. I still believe that there is a time and place for the F word, in real life and at the movies. Not the brain dead usage of it that reality shows and some movies choose to insert it. When I hear the F word, it better be for a good reason. Other wise, for me, it loses it's original purpose of shock value and becomes nothing more than the inarticulate banter of the masses that is just soooooooooooooo pedestrian. END RANT Over all, we found it to be 90 minutes of enjoyable couch potato time, kickin' back in front of the big screen with a friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**MINOR SPOILERS**This was also recommended to me by a friend who found this movie "very scary" in their words. When I watched it on tape I found myself laughing my butt off. The ghosts were really cool, but I wish IN the movie they could have told their stories, some background on the ghosts a little bit. It wasn't too gory, otherwise it would have made this movie even cheesier, but all in all it was pretty good. I thought the ending to be a little weak, throwing Kriticos into the middle of the Eye of Hell, and then after that the ghosts just walking off and disappearing. I think it could have been a bit better than that. Over all it was not scary, mostly funny, the ghosts were awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*maybe spoilers*Nononono... doesn't work for me. This movies only plus would be the good ghost makup because that is really really good. THE BIG minus in exactly that same department would be that you hardly ever really get to see the ghosts. Only in very short shots and they DON'T REALLY play a big part in the movie! What plays the bigger part is the labyrinth this movie is about. The ghosts are kinda trapped in it and they get the poeple in there a good scare. That's about it. So what you see in this movie is some kinda intro, then the people get trapped in the labryrinth, then they get scared - run around (or climb arround) screaming constantly for about an hour and then comes the conclusion which really really sucks! So the movie is basically culminating from the 30 minute mark onwards.So, my 3 of 10 points go to the ghost makup only!!!!! I must say this: Unless you are a makup fanatic or makup artist or special FX person - don't watch this! Because it isn't scary, it isn't logical, it isn't consistant, it is simply very stupid, naive and what not. But it definatly isn't good entertaining. I felt very very very very dissapionted, because I love ghosts but eventho this movie claims to be about 13 of them they were hardly in it. So what you will get a heart attack of is not fright but because you're mad at yourself that you watched it!Now don't say I didn't warn you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did nothing for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As usual, I watched this on the recommendation of a friend who told me it was scary.It turned out that it wasn't scary at all. The effects were impressive, but they weren't backed up with a strong story and convincing acting. I didn't feel for the characters, cared whether they died, more how they died, and I was hoping for something interesting to happen. Unfortunately, nothing interested DID happen so I was generally disappointed in the film.Watching the extras, the effects were well produced. The CGI and the make-up and photographic effects are as good as most high budget movies. This is all very well, but if there's no structure to the rest of the film, it counts for almost nothing.It's been a while since I've seen a film that's moved me on a thought-provoking level (like The Ring or The Blair Witch Project) and Thirteen Ghosts hardly touched the surface.I'm tired of film-makers trying to affect viewers with visuals - it's time they came at us through suggestion and psychological angles - to make us fear our own fear rather than wait for a predictable monster at the end of a dark corridor.As for a rating, 3/10, purely for visual effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Thirteen Ghosts'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To give you a basic idea of the story behind the movie 'Thirteen Ghosts' would just simply be a waste of time. Why? Because there isn't much of a plot or story in this shallow special-fx spectacle. Granted, there are some neat visual effects but there isn't much more. The premise of 'Thirteen Ghosts' is directly recycled from that of 'House on Haunted Hill', another stinker that at least had some entertainment value unlike 'Ghosts'. So, the movie is definitely lacking in terms of originality and freshness. Is it scary? Well, let's just say that the level of scariness in this movie will make you question what passes for horror these days. So, what we got here is a rather silly atttempt at horror. Pile that on with a lame story and bad acting and you got a real time-waster.Rating: (3/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so disappointed when I watched this film having high hopes for it especially since Matthew Lillard was in it you know? The story line made a lot of sense. I think it was a good storyline wasted it could have been put to better use by another writer. Everything went downhill when the only cool part in the movie passed( when the lawyer was split in two). It seems anything Shannon Elizabeth, after American Pie, goes downhill. Rah Digga who was in the movie just to add comedy FAILED seriously. Rah Digga if you see this stick to rapping but you were good in Carmen: A Hip-hopera. It seemed so vague and empty like your just waiting for the interesting part to come in you know the part where your like THIS IS A MOVIE. I most give props to the monsters though especially "The Jackal". My last words are:- Watch at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One hell of a ride. A theme park ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One good thing can be said that about this movie: that at least it is substantially less stupid than the original, which isn't much of a point. Unlike another William Castle remake, The House on Haunted Hill, which was flawed but rather hysterically entertaining, this new 13 Ghosts isn't much fun: it is, in fact, mostly boring. Its look and feel is that of a theme park ride. As a ride it would have worked very well, but movies also need things like plots, characters and the like.The funny thing is, that their attempt to improve on the original ends up working against the movie. Namely, unlike the old version, in which only Emilio the cook and the lion-tamer and his lion are distinctive in any way, this new version individualizes the ghosts and even gives them rather poetic names. Unfortunately, one feels that their story would have been more interesting that the story the movie actually tells and about that we know nothing. Whose son was the First-Born Son? Why is the Torn Prince torn and the Bound Woman bound? Or the Angry Princess angry, for that matter? What was the deal with the Great Child and the Dire Mother? Why did the Juggernaut live (well, "live") in a scrap yard? Alas, we don't know. Now, isn't that a pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome make-up effects, and not a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, to me, is a rare exception to horror movies. The way I think many people think, is that a good horror movie makes you scared, and that a mindless gorefest will not scare you as much as psychological fear will. This is an exception because the purely grotesque make-up effects can actully evoke dread. Just looking at some of the creepy creatures from "13 Ghosts" is enough to freak some people out. Of course the movie overall wasnt too great, but this is one of those where the visual effects actually CAN make up for a crappy storyline. Also, the make-up effects guys were smart to make each ghost look different, and to have each one be unique as a stand-alone. Any one of the ghosts from this movie could be in a movie of their own, explaining how they were created, how they were killed, etc. Unfortunately, I think that the usually comical Tony Shaloub was really a bad choice of casting, because he really doesnt seem like the kind of guy to play a victim in a horror movie, and his acting was not so great. Dont get me wrong, hes a good actor, but horror really doesnt seem like his thing. However, Matt Lilliard was really good, and even added a comical sense to the usually dull thought of a "ghost hunter." Overall, I say 7 out of 10. Minus 3 for bad casting choices and a stupid storyline, plus 7 for awesome, fear-evoking make-up effects. A must see for horror fans. ..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... that was a good thing. I expected to see lots of senseless blood and body parts. While it had its fair share of gore, I was glad it did focus more on the plot (a faulty, but intriguing one, nonetheless). I suggest you watch the extras on the DVD as they contain background information on the plot and the ghosts. My only 3 complaints are:- Shannon Elizabeth's pretty face getting a touch-up by the Jackal.- explanation of Cyrus Kriticos' appearance. Is he a ghost (can't be because Arthur Kriticos didn't need the glasses to see him) or is he alive (can't be because he still has the neck injury)?- the ghosts are free. Now what? No real closure (although I'm sure some viewers wouldn't care).Otherwise, I liked it mainly because the death scenes were original and the main plot was resolved. If you liked this movie, I recommend Ghost Ship, which is directed and produced by the same person and company. Special effects for both movies were great.7.5 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Final Score: 6.3 (out of 10)After making a splash with their debut film, the remake of `The House on Haunted Hill' - a gory piece of stylized guilty pleasure trash - Dark Castle has made a cult name for itself among the horror crowd just as a single director or writer might. They employ a turnstile of filmmakers who either remake or construct from clichés hills-old horror stories, updating them with a hyper-stylized visual style, and an attractive, talented cast of names willing to romp in this. I bet in the Dark Castle corridors that `pandering' is not an insult. Many of the `Haunted Hill' qualities show up in `Thir13een Ghosts' but with a different director at the helm. I didn't care for the overblown `Hill', but I do like this one.The story is admittedly unoriginal, the script rubbish and the acting corny - all hamstringing the score unavoidably low. But director Steve Beck plays this tune the best way it can be played: as a mindless fun guilty pleasure genera romp. Beck brings with him a colorful eye and a solid soundtrack. The movie doesn't take itself at all seriously and its playful tone creates more of a funhouse ride atmosphere than a gory endurance trial. Sure, it's not scary. Every ridiculous gimmick and set piece worked for me: the goggles that somehow see ghosts, and the ghosts themselves, their wild designs showing none-to-subtly their method of death. But the mansion is the real star of the show. A labyrinth mansion made of glass walls and clock controlled doors. H.H. Holmes would have killed for it.Propping it all up is a likeable ensemble. Its fun watching talented Tony Shalhoub finally in his first lead role, as it is with Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth (who has oddly never been more attractive) and F. Murray Abraham (in the `what am I doing here?' role). Manic, but appropriately subdued, Lillard in particular keeps jump-starting this ridiculous material when it probably doesn't deserve it. The casting of a quirky character actor like Shalhoub as its hero should be a clear tip of the hat to the movie's more cult aspirations. A well put together (out of scraps, really) guilty pleasure romp through the haunted mansion that knows its limitations and how to get around them. Better and more fun much of its kind.</fullReview>

The downside is it is NOT scary. Unless you ghoulishly terrified of ghosts, it really isn't scary. It is edited well though. Not as much gore as you'd think, but good enough for what it was and it didn't go overboard with the gore either.

		<fullReview>Widower Tony Shalhoub (is that the correct spelling?) inherits a huge greenhouse from his ghosthunting uncle, and since his own house is about to be repossessed, moves in with his young family, his lawyer and a rather dodgy looking "electric guy" (Matthew Lillard). Much to nobody's surprise there is a collection of ghosts in the basement.Sadly most of the ghosts resemble actors in halloween costumes, and despite their habit of sneaking up on you they're not really that scary. The script provides very "thin" characterisation and a few lame gags. Still, there are some neat deaths, which will make you say "Ouch!" or "How did they do that?"In summary, not great but fair enough to pass a couple of hours, if you can suspend your critical faculties for that long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the get-go, I was on the edge of my seat!The make-up and special effects on the ghosts was remarkable. They weren't just a bunch of generic ghouls walking around. Instead they each had their own gruesome features and stories, and the talented actors portraying them gave each their own distinct personalities. The design of the house was amazing and the sound-effects (sliding metal, moans/groans, loud cackling, ceremonial chanting) were very disturbing. What made the groans coming from the ghosts more disturbing was that sometimes, you could pick out words that helped play upon their back stories. For example, you can hear The Withered Lover say "why did you leave me?" and you can hear The Torn Prince yelling "help me out of here!" (If you have the dvd and watch the histories of the ghosts, then this will become more clear).The camera work and editing was great. I especially loved the scene when we are first taken to the basement and are given a glimpse of the ghosts that haunt the house in a series of quick flashes. The acting was not bad. It was a little overdone on Mathew Lillards part and a little cheesy on the son's (Alec Robert's) part. Also Rah Digga was funny but I was just like, "what is she doing in this movie?"But other than that, I had a great time watching it, and this movie stuck with me a lot longer than most other horror flicks!</fullReview>

After having seen Ghost Ship as well, I assume it must be Steve Beck's goal to become the newest wunderkind in horrormovies.

The acting was good though, especially by Matthew Lillard (Scooby-Doo, Dish Dogs, Scream) and Tony Shalhoub (TV's Monk). Also, I must give an applause for the 'fx' and ghosts because they were some freaky works of art and really made me uneasy at times. 6.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thirteen Ghosts was indeed a pointless movie, it had actors from soap operas, a terrible plot, and it didn't "flow" together. The only thing that was remotely impressing was the house itself ( or machine ) and the ghosts. The tale of the 13 ghosts was quite corny and didn't bring anything new. If you want to see it, get somebody else to rent it for you, don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite what I was Expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silly beyond belief, with all the groan-inducing one-liners you've come to expect from these movies. Thirteen Ghosts is also the most ridiculous yet entertaining modern horror film I've seen for a long time. Not since Pitch Black has a 'dumb' horror film delivered so much entertainment. While others revelled in 'Jeepers Creepers' for some inexplicable reason, 13 G's, while like JC's, isn't scary, it is (unlike JC) entertaining, (without resorting to a 'slasher' film), especially when the ghosts start doing their business. The whole premise of seeing ghosts with special glasses (with some people having them on, others not) makes for more interesting viewing then anything JC threw at you. In the dumb horror film department, it's nowhere near the fun of Pitch Black, but it is entertaining, despite the weak finale, and at least one death scene will leave you with a smile. Some will call it tame, but unlike JC, at least there's some interesting deaths, albeit them being few and far between. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good star, but the end sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers -----When i saw this movie a few days ago (2 May), i think that the movie has a good star. The first scene, is when Cyrus Kriticus try to hunt a ghost and is well succeed but with some casualties. In the beginning, lets clear that Cyrus is collecting ghosts for some kind of machine (which the purpose is unknown). There is a cut and the new scene star with a Arthur's family. In these scenes, is clear that Arthur was devastating with the lost of his wife, but start to recover this. Until this point the movie working good, but when Arthur and his family going to Cyrus house (Arthur is Cyrus's nephew) all movie became a mess. Exactly as a other comment said the two kids are there for one single reason bring some problems to Arthur (In other words: THIS SITUATION AGAIN?). There are only two things that save this movie of the complete failure: the performances of Tony Shaloub (as Arthur) and Mathew Lillard that try to do the best with these limited characters (ok F. Murray Abrahams don't compromise in the role of Cyrus). The situations don't work well, are nonsense and predictable. All this, is culminated with "The End" very weak.Spoilers ---------Tony Shaloub and Mathew Lillard could choose better films, also i believe that this movie could have a good development with some effort. This film could be a good movie but predictable scenes and very weak "The End" downfall any hope.My vote is 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What scares me most is how "cool" everyone thinks the blood, the gore and the nudity is.Anyway...I saw the original 13 Ghosts when I was a small child and it scared me AND entertained without a lot of gore or nudity. I saw the original again recently and, well, it hasn't aged well, but it's still good, campy fun. (I mean, how can you not love a movie that casts Margaret Hamilton as one of the good guys and has another character comment on her looking like a "wicked witch." It's a hoot.)When I see this new version claim to be based on the original, I want to toss my cookies. About the only idea this film took from the original was the thirteen ghosts and maybe the character names. If they wanted to make THIS movie, why give a tip of the hat to William Castle at all? Why not just change the ghosts to demons and psychic forces and call it "The Black Zodiac" or (God forbid) "The Glass House"? Or anything but Thirteen Ghosts.Tony Shaloub (highly underrated and really a great actor) works hard. So does Matthew Lillard. They manage to make something of their one dimensional characters. Embeth Davidtz, on the other hand, is playing Sigourney Weaver playing Ripley in "Alien." And F. Murray Abraham, please tell me you were doing this for the fun of it! As for the two kids, let's face it--they were there because they were two kids. And they were in danger. And we're supposed to care about them because they are two kids in danger. I kept thinking "Tony, let 'em get eaten by the doomsday machine or whatever it is, and get out of there. You can do better."And then there was the Nanny. I hope Rah Digga was paid handsomely to prostitute herself. When did it become cinematically necessary that all black characters in horror films have to run around acting like Buckwheat in "The Little Rascals"? Think: Ernie Hudson in "Ghostbusters 2", eyes bulging and nappy hair on end. Why is the black character always the only one who realizes there is a major danger to be met, so let's get the hell out of it now? Think: Whoopi Goldberg in "Ghost." What's with the stereotype and why do they keep allowing themselves to be sucked into it?In the end, this wasn't a serious, character-driven movie because it wanted to be a light-hearted special effects driven scare fest but it also wanted to have Something Important to Say about family relations. And it wanted to be a message flick about meddling with The Unknown. Sadly, it was none of these and was, instead, a Great Big Mess that can only be loved by people who want to see gore and nudity. Geez. At least the original knew it was camp and didn't pretend to be anything more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS....I saw this movie on HBO during timeouts of the sweet 16 and even though I probably only actually viewed a combined half hour, I think it's safe to say that I know as much about the film as its director, writer and actors. Despite your Oscar winning cast, Shannon Elisabeth and Matt Lillard, (where was Prinze?), the movie pretty much sucked. The dad was the taxi driver from Wings and Shannon Elisabeth played one daughter, knockers were looking HUGE, some random Mexican kid played his son. At one point he hears voices calling his name in basement and he goes down to check it out. Always smart in a horror movie, he probably misheard and thought they were offering him booze or a ride on a landscaping truck. Anyway, I think Lillard dies by getting clubbed to death by a ghost. I don't know why the ghosts were so intent on killing everyone. If I was a ghost I'd just hang out all day, maybe play some basketball, watch some tv or sneak into women's locker rooms; killing people would be really far down on my list of things to do as a ghost. These ghosts also had the power to touch living people, which was impressive cause it took Swayze forever to learn how to do that in that movie with Demi Moore, (either Point Break or Roadhouse I don't remember which). If I could touch people I'd walk around all day urinating off overpasses and punching Robin Williams in the junk. Anyway, back to the movie, the Mexican kid rides his scooter around until all the ghosts get bored and leave the house. There are some other people in the movie too but I don't remember what happens to them, I assume they either die or just get bored and leave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my FAVORITE Scenes...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to rent this movie one day with a friend of mine, we watched the beginning and didnt really think it would be all to great, but then it began to get better.I liked the Back Stories to the Ghosts, and i enjoyed the house, very eerie in my opinion, ALSO those glasses were REALLY cool, i liked the Bathroom scene, where we see through the Glasses. That was great, and when Shannon Elizabeth was washing her face, and the Ghost went up to grab her and her dad walked in! That was great. This movie has a lot of Gore, no a lot a lot, but just enough, u get people cut in half, a torso walking around, a naked but cut up Princess, and plenty more. This movie had me going.My favorite scene however was with Shannon Elizabeth walking, and suddenly the Jackal pounces on her, dragging her to the wall, and then ripping at her face and clothes and pulling her up the wall!! Fantastic! If you want something REALLY scary, i wouldnt say get this, but if ur looking for a good time with friends, get this definitly! I now own this movie, and believe me, i'm not sorry. Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So nice you have see it twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying this is one of the most original horror movies I have seen even though it is a remake of the 1960 one. The plot which is about a man named Arthur and his two kids inherit a glass mansion house by Arthur's late uncle who was a rich collector of unique things. Now knowing Arthur who is in a bad financial state he jumps to the offer, but there is one drawback the house has ghosts in them. Thats just about all I'm going to say about the plot seeing as it has some good twists and turns during the movie. The special effects are solid making the ghosts look really realistic, and the acting was good as Matthew Lillard put on a good believable performance in his role.Overall this movie could of been better in many ways, and what I mean by that it shouldn't of had any comedy in it (which it didn't accept maybe at the end). It should of just simply been a Horror/Thriller, and it could of been rewritten and polished better, but all in all if you want to see a great horror movie in my opinion check out the Thir13en Ghosts once you've seen it once your going to want to see it twice.</fullReview>

The plot is ridiculous cuz no one in their right minds would fall for a house that looked like that. The ghosts were hideous people in real life and looked slightly better in death. Just dumb and not worth it. I wish I was dead to just become the 14th ghost and tell them all to go haunt an attic or something more useful than being in this film.</fullReview>

There was the First born son, The angry princess, The lonely widow, the Jackel, the great baby, the dying mother, and uh I forgot the rest of them. The part that scared me was how those ghosts sneek up to them at the window. THe part that made me cry was at the end where this guy named Arther lost his wife in a fire, then a the end he gets to see her ghost and she tell's him and his two children that she loves him and she fades away as she says that. The funny part to the movie was at the end where the nanny left the hell house all freaked out. Watching this movie makes me wish I was one of the thirteen ghosts, but not the messed up ones. The house in the movie is awesome, I wish I lived there. I like scary stuff. I rate this movie 7/10.</fullReview>

Oh my god... a family inherits a house from their "dead" relative, but guess what?! It's got ghosts in it! It reminds me of an episode of the Simpsons. While the acting wasn't bad (except for that stoopid kid on the scooter who should have been shot), that still doesn't manage to hold up this entire film, which I am still sure was a joke. I mean come on, the scary parts were hilarious - especially the part where the lawyer dude gets sliced right down the middle of his body with the glass doors (although I am sure that isn't really possible... is it?).

		<fullReview>Thirteen Ghosts is a most mediocre movie. Special effects, make-up and production design are great, I must say, and both Tony Shalhoub and Matthew Lillard do a great job. The other actors are OK, with the exception of Rah Digga, who is absolutely horrible. The script, which appears to be interesting at first, turns out to be disappointingly unoriginal; the ending is particularly bad. What the entire movie is missing is a climax - it just isn't going anywhere. And while the sets are very impressive, cinematography and editing are a complete and utter disaster. All these horrible quick cuts and flashes make the movie tiring and take the 'scary' element out of it, because you can never 'get into' the movie.Now, it's not bad. It's just nothing special. And I find it very disappointing when I think about what a director like Fincher could have done with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWEFUL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most aweful movie ever made in my opinion. Unknown actors, stupid (S.T.U.P.I.D) plot. Preperation for the movie, I was all prepared, got my popcorn, soda, dimmed lights and my cable remote. I barely survived the first 15 minutes of so-called movie. Let's start with the terminology. Although the writers thought viewers didn't know Latin, they were VERY much mistaken. The translation of many terms used revealed errors, specifically "Inferno" which does not mean "hell" in the first, second nor third meaning in the dictionary. It means "Fire" - This is to the writers: 'Learn to imagine, not steal' - This movie is a cheap, CHEAP RIPOFF of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. The acting is about as convincing as the plot, which speaks for itself. Some interesting goofs. They first said the glass was sound and breakproof. In many other moments you can obviously hear what the other person said. Anyway, I'm rambling.. Out of 5 stars, I give this -1 (BAD BAD BAD) - The ONLY good thing was the machine, quite interesting, inventive design.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second horror movie of the year I have seen, after the rather unsuccessful, but still entertaining, Resident Evil. Initially I thought this would be a thrilling film, but when I say initially I think of the moment when I read the title and I saw the poster. I believe it would have been better if that had been all there was to say to it. Unfortunately, it isn't.SpoilersThis film is about uncle Cyrus, who catches ghosts so that he can become the strongest man on earth. All he has to do is catch 12, and get someone to sacrifice himself so that he could have 13, the amount needed for his demonic plan. After what seems to be his death, his family, with which he had little contact, gets his strange villa, made solely out of glass. And so, the "horror" trip begins.We get to see people cut in two, ghosts who do not really inspire fright, and generally a lot of blood. Blood and violence. That's all there is to this movie. A totally childish and idiotic plot can not become a good movie with the best actors on this world. But just think what you can get if you have this plot and a bunch of pathetic actors! Oh my... No thrills, no chills, no comedy, no horror. No nothing! I wonder how anyone can put together such a movie. There just isn't anything original worth remembering here.With all my sympathy towards Tony Shalhoub, I can quite easily define this as the worst movie of 2002, and maybe even one of the worst movies ever. Not even the interesting architecture of the house can save the sour effect of the rest of the film. I do not recommend it to anyone, except those who don't have anything better to do than watch this pathetic "piece of art". It's not even worth a four: 3.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of horrible commercialized Hollywood crap is the film "Thirteen Ghosts". I rented this piece of trash, because I was fooled because it had a new release 99 cent Quick Pick tag on it, but that will never fool me again. This film was the worst film I've seen since "House on Haunted Hill"(Remake) and is essentially the same exact film (ie. plot, characterization). What it lacks in originality, it also lacks in style and substance. Its shot like one, big MTV hip-hop music video, complete with the high-resolution camera angles, slow motion and all the usual crap that MTV tries to shlock out to our ever degenerating culture. The direction is mediocre at best and when it tries to truelly impress a film fan, it really falls flat on it's face. Aside from falling into the usual cliche's and niches that these sort of commercial stinkbombs do, the performances also go right into the preverbial crapper. I mean Matthew Lillard's performance didn't really convince me that he knew anything about paranormal investigation at all, and I've seen better acting from a fifth grader. "Thirteen GHosts" had a very lavish set design, so it was obvious that no expense was spared to make the ghosts look frightening, but they really didnt look scary at ALL. Does Steve Beck understand mise-en-scene at all, I mean when I watch this movie it doesn't really make me escape my dull reality at all, it just looks like a movie wear a bunch of actors are crawling around in this big playhouse that looks as synthetic as a disney ride. I can't believe this film would make it on anyone's top ten list, it has the most worthless Disney-style happy ending also,(I cant believe I sat through the whole thing)and there is really nothing that I can recommend about this picture. You want to see a better ghost film get either "THe Sixth Sense" or even "The Haunting" or "Blair Witch Project" I mean these films at least try to help you escape reality, all "Thirteen Ghosts" does is provide an annoying distraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything good about this movie happened off-screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm serious.What do I mean by that?Well, what I mean is that all the really interesting elements of 'Thir13en Ghosts' were accomplished Before and After the camera rolled.For one, the house. The house is simply a MASTERPIECE of design, function and plain-out coolness. It has to be seen to be believed--and even then, you may still have some trouble. Whoever designed it knew EXACTLY what they were doing.For two, the design and execution of the ghosts. Now, I admit, I'm not much of a horror-film person, so my experience is decidedly limited. But the ghosts were very interesting, because, visually, they were extremely striking (with the exception of Ghost #4, the Withered Lover; for plot reasons she had to look reasonably unscathed). According to the "back story" of the film, all the ghosts met violent, ghastly demises, and the character designers tried to create apperaances that would communicate some of that violence. If you ask me, they succeeded.If there's anything to complain about, however, it's the OVEREXPOSURE of these ghosts. I haven't seen 'Alien' but I'm told the treatment of the alien in that film set a standard in fright movies--show just little bits of it and let the audience's imagination do the rest. 'The Brotherhood Of The Wolf' is a film that actually USED that technique, and it worked quite well. But in 'Thir13en Ghosts' you see several ghosts frequently... And the shock value wears off. Some more subtlety would probably have been wise.Back to what makes this film good. For three, I've always been a sucker for snappy dialogue, and Matthew Lillard has a lot of good lines. Watching him bounce frenetically off weary, incredulous Tony Shalhoub is a sight to behold. Lillard knows how to overact to good effect, and it works well here. (Why didn't he do it in 'Wing Commander?' The character he played there is the KING of overacting. But that's another story.)Four: the editing. The movie switches constantly between shots of the 'normal' world and the 'ghost' world--often alternating between slow- and fast-motion. This could be confusing, but, thankfully, it isn't. As proud a movie as 'Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship' lost me during its battle scenes by shaking the camera too much; it's hard to create confusing-but-still-comprehensible images out of fast, flickering action. But 'Thir13en Ghosts' manages it. ...And the rest of it was crap. I went along with the plot only because I wanted to see what would happen next. The characters were the stereotypical Horror Movie Brainless Morons. The music was nothing special, and the sound effects were about what you'd expect from ghosts who have iron cages strapped to their faces. The actors had very little to work with, and their performances were accordingly flat.But 'Thir13en Ghosts' isn't ABOUT characters, or plot. It isn't even really about scaring the bejeebers out of the audience. It's about presenting striking, interesting visual imagery. It's eye-candy. Maybe the producers tried to make it more than that, but it didn't work, so don't bother, you'll be disappointed. Just drool over the eye-candy. 'Thir13en Ghosts' is one of the most visually creative movies to be released in a long time.</fullReview>

It just fails to generate any real enthusiasm. The makeup is also not that great. It is listed as a horror/comedy, but I don't see where you would get comedy out of it and I don't see all that much horror either.Despite its many flaws, the movie's execution has many attractions -- the high tech mansion and the occult machine.

		<fullReview>This horror movie has a really cool glass house. I also liked the special effects of the ghosts. Some of them don't do anything, but you gotta admit the Hammer was awful pretty. I actually thought the Jackal was scary, especially the way we first get to see what she is all about. (SLIGHT SPOILERS): I also really liked the part with Shannon Elizabeth in the bathroom and the naked chick with the knife shows up. It is really creepy when she sits in the tub and SE turns on the water. And when the lawyer "splits", that is really neat.On the downside, there should have been more deaths. I mean, where is the group of stupid high school kids that get locked in the haunted castle. Mathew Lillard was rather annoying in this. His character should have been the comic relief instead of the babysitter, who looked older than SE. SE was miscast in this. She is too old for this part since the brother is only 8 or so.I liked the editing of this movie. It shows quick shots of the ghosts and then they disappear. How can you not jump when one of the ghosts suddenly appears and hits the glass in their box.FINAL VERDICT: Cheesy horror movie, but the ghosts are better than in most films like this. It's short and worth a viewing on HBO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im sure its pretty easy for you to know this i mean, You get a secondary cast..then you shoot the film. I mean all they got to do is stand in front of a green screen, so they can do the special affects. I didnt like this movie, There was no scary parts to it cause nothing was real! :( 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How many movies were ripped off to make this one?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I lost track of how many movies this one stole from -- Cube (the scene where the lawyer was sliced in half was entirely too much like the scene in Cube where the one guy gets it in the giant egg slicer), Tomb Raider, Ghostbusters, the Shining, just to name a few. And how original was it to have the only black character in the movie constantly cracking un-funny jokes and grumbling about white people. Amazingly, she survived to the end of the movie, which is unusual for cheesy horror movies. The writing in this movie was... not good. The scene where the psychic rants and raves about being an amoral, greedy freak felt like bad X-Files fanfiction. Already mentioned the jokes. They were not funny at all.A young boy on a scooter in a house made of glass. Gooooood idea. Am I the only one who was reminded of the boy in The Shining zipping around the hotel on his Big Wheel?There was no reason I could figure for the "princess" to be nude, other than to fulfill the gratuitous nudity clause every cheesy horror movie seems to have. She reminded me of the woman in the bathroom scene in The Shining, now that I think about it.I could go on, but I can't stand long user reviews. I watched this movie only because it was on cable on a night when there was nothing else to watch. If I'd had special glasses that could make it invisible to me, I'd have taken them off and ground them into dust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me that so many people SWEAR that this movie is good. It's not. It's bad. Real bad. Why is F. Murray Abraham in this? Why is Tony Shaloub in this? Why is Shannon Elizabeth in this? WHY IS ANYONE IN THIS? The plot is convoluted, the characters apparently made out of cardboard, and the villain's plot is so complicated it rivals the one in "Chinatown". Also, I was so annoyed with the "heroes" that I was ready for them all to be killed off by the ghosts (many of whom, if you think about it, can not actually hurt you). The only bright spot that this film has is in the theme and makeup design of the ghosts. This design job is one to be noted by future horror filmmakers, they just need to forget the rest of the movie. Oh, and the terribly racist caricature of the nanny character is a nice touch too. Just awful, thematically wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I probably would have avoided this after seeing the trailers on HBO. I like my ghost stories 'pure' rather than the result of some mechanical means (the recent remake of Shirley Jackson's The House comes to mind). But I noticed that Tony Shalhoub was in it, and having become a fan of his Mr. Monk series on USA, I thought I'd give it a try. His low-key performance was the best thing about the film. The occult elements were ho-hum; the ghosts were ugly but not scary. F. Murray Abraham was wasted as the evil uncle, who sets up his nephew and his children. And one of the biggest missing plot elements is just exactly was the goal of the uncle and what would have happened if he succeeded in activating the machine? It's kind of hard to get invested in an outcome if you don't know the stakes. The special effects are fine, but I'd only recommend it to those who must see all B films of this ilk, or completist fans of Tony Shalhoub.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Something Missing Here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, "Thir13en Ghosts" was a pretty good movie. It was original and innovative with never-been-done-before effects which were cool. But my main problem with the only one-and-a-half hour movie was that it didn't give enough information. It wasn't until I looked it up here at the IMDB did I know the actual ghosts had names (I.E. Billy Michaels, The First Born Son). They don't give enough information about the spirits' pasts and all that. It could've been longer and more informative, perhaps revealed how and why these spirits were tortured. Not only would it have been less confusing, but there would have been more of a personal and emotional impact. Granted, that's not what horror flicks are supposed to do, but the bottom line is it would've been nice to know a little more about the spirits' lives and what mental problems The Jackal had (he was in a straight jacket, so it's obvious he was a little cuckoo) or why there was railroad spikes driven through The Hammer's face and did The Torn Prince and Angry Princess seem very prince or princess-like? What was up with that?</fullReview>

Movies work when the viewer projects themselves into the situation at some level. Nothing here. Just watching people being stupid. The acting was just bad, not intentionally campy bad, just bad. The thin plot at least could have been made up for with some chills, but alas, the movie runs its course and nary a one.

		<fullReview>I was expecting this to get remade soon after 'House on Haunted Hill' came out again. I was right so I bought my ticket and watched the movie with my buds. I was truly disappointed. It does have a few good points, The special fx are good and the house is interesting. The house was something new and it was indeed a step in the right direction. It is made of glass and you can see right through it. Plus, Shannon Elizabeth is staying there and she is fond of the bath. Don't get your hopes up though! She is really boring in the movie and she looks rather bored herself. She is miscast as Tony Shalhoubs innocent daughter and Rah Digga and the annoying ten year old kid are truly awful in their acting roles. I hate it when they add annoying kids into movies to increase the number of kids going to see it. If it's rated 'R' or '15' then why bother. Oh yeah, there is a kid in the original but it still angers me. The ghosts themselves are good and are creative. The only ones that seem to be murderous though are the Juggernaut, the Hammer, the Jackal and the Torn Prince. This results in few deaths and some CG gore which is bad. Apart from these bad points, F. Murray Abraham, Matthew Lillard, Tony Shalhoub and Embeth Davitz are all suitable for their roles. There is one good death and the house was a nice change although it was very ridiculous. I rate it 4.5 out of 10 but I recommend 'House on Haunted Hill' a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you See?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting a while to see Thirteen Ghost. Mainly because of Shannon Elizabeth and the word of it having Sexual Content. Yeah Yeah, I'm a guy and I think Shannon is very attractive. So sue me. Its just after American Pie, I (like millions of guys around the world) became awww'd about this woman's beautiful form. I hear her contract prevents that happening again, but still it caught my eye. Not only was there a hot girl in this movie, but it was a scary one. It caught my attention, and I got sucked in. It definitely had an eerily quality to it. There were some spook-ful moments and some racy scenes (both sexually and bloody). The idea of the Glass house reminded me allot of well the movie, "The Glass House." The ghost in allot of ways reminded me of "Hell Raiser." It's just the way they did these bludgeon characters. There was allot of comic relief from Lillard and the guy from "Wings". Oh and you can't forget from the nanny. I felt it was needed at times because of the spooky nature of the film. I think it may have been allot scarier for me because I was alone in an old house, but still it was a scary movie alone. It was a movie worth seeing and in my opinion lived up to the scary movie genre. It might not of been the scariest I have seen, but I think it does a good job with thrills and chills. Oh and in case you're wondering, no Shannon naked. Of course not, it's not in the contract. Although she comes close to it and you do see some T&amp;A. :) I recommend at least seeing this once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well produced popcorn/picture, rollercoaster ride to terror that more than succeeds at it's intent; i.e. good, scary, fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well produced remake (Robert Zemeckis &amp; Joel Silver) with an inventive new twist on the 1960's original. Nay sayers should keep in mind the spirit and verve of the original's director (William Castle)and enjoy this film for what it is; a fun roller coaster ride through the spook-house. This is a stylish recreation of a 60's classic rendered with more than enough snap, crackle and pop to satisfy today's popcorn brigade. Listen, this isn't Lawrence of Arabia, but it not supposed to be, it's a up tempo, fast moving, beautifully photographed, well written and acted popcorn picture, directed by a passionate true believer. The filmmaker are not trying to educate, elevate or elaborate to wax poetic about some great political issue or anything like that. They are trying to entertain you and scare the pants of you, and they are succeeding very well. Bravo Dark Castle Productions, can't wait for the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real trash. Not the good kind either. Stephen King's Graveyard Shift trash. The movie has terrible headache and nausea inducing editing, accompanied by white flashes and slashing sounds. It made me feel not so much excited or scared but nervous and strung out. Despite the house being impressively designed, it's claustrophobic and ugly, and some of the funniest scenes in the movie are when the family gushes over how great it would be to live there. Shannon Elizabeth, one of the worst actresses in major movies today, is disturbingly obsessed with the bathrooms. You'd think Tony Shalhoub would notice that the mechanically opening and closing glass doors might be a safety hazard for his children but oh well. The ghosts are heavily made up and cleverly named, and I can imagine myself as a kid watching this movie and getting into the individual "characters" memorizing their names. But they're incredibly goofy looking, and when they're actions are sped up they just look like a Benny Hill sketch from hell. * out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the original, and it seems they stuck pretty close to the plot - which is not always a good thing, because I just couldn't get over the preposterous notion that any family (let alone a penniless one) would employ such a lazy bitch nanny. Rah Diggah's character was completely unlikeable, and so obviously a PC addition, it hurt to watch.Matt Lilliard manages to act more manic than ever before (for someone who only acts that way anyway, it still seemed overdone), and his character also has no redeeming features.Shannon Elizabeth doesn't have much to do but look pretty, including a cheap 'T-shirt' ripping moment which stops short of any worth.. ..and her younger brother is as annoying as all brat kids, but mercifully gets kidnapped before too long; doesn't reappear until the end; and doesn't personally save the day with the aid of some toy, as in many movies.Unfortunately, the alternative is an equally shoddy ending.Tony Shalhoub (in his worst career choice ever) struggles against the overwhelming tide of the script, and Embeth Davidtz (although she's beautiful), well, underwhelms in a terrible role.The house is actually pretty nice, from a design point of view, and reminds me of other 'infernal machines', like the box in Hellraiser, but the core of the machine is a case of CGI-over-substance.. ..and I thought the ghosts were well designed &amp; realised, but used in too random a fashion (and the rapid editing throughout the movie really sucks). Afterwards, I watched the separate ghosts' profiles (on the DVD), and I think this would have helped if it was in the actual movie.Overall, the movie sucked big-time, the CGI looked kinda cheap occasionally (not always, some effects were quite good), and for this kind of movie, not nearly enough death. If you edit out a few seconds here and there, and throw in a labrador, you could slap a Disney label on it.I would only watch this mistake again if it were re-edited so that the kid and the nanny get killed at the first opportunity. Perhaps the other reason I found this rubbish quite so offensive was because the classy opening credits promised so much more, and the premise could have actually been quite good.Checking the credits of the Director and Writers, I should have avoided this movie anyway. The biggest 'positive' of Thirteen Ghosts is that it may encourage you to create your own movies and screenplays, because if this trash can get made, what's stopping you?</fullReview>

Right from the start you get a good laugh. That scene in which cars "eat" people is histerical. If you see this movie, prepare yourself to MST3K it, otherwise you won't enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I'm a scary-cat, and hate horror movies. It takes very little to make me cover my eyes, or find a reason to leave the room, when viewing scary movies. So if a film doesn't scare me, it won't scare anyone! But, should you watch this movie for the plot and the story, you won't be disappointed. The characters are well build, and the story line in itself is interesting. Some twists and turns are also included, and very gory though not scary ghosts are added as bonus. Many of the others user comments mention how great the house was, and that is true. However, I felt that you never knew where anyone was, and therefore you never really knew if they were in danger or how far away from safety they were. Every corridor was the same, creating a visual boredom during the middle of the film. What let the film down more then lack of suspense was the ending. It is just too simple, too easy, especially when looking at the years of planning that went into creating the house and these 13 ghosts. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as I can see this movie lacks any redeeming qualities whatsoever. As a horror, it's not scary. I've had scarier trips to the toilet. As a comedy, it's not funny. The inclusion of the black maid character for comic relief was frankly OFFENSIVE. The plot is derivative, the acting is terrible and the direction is poorly paced. The director seemed to think that jump cuts (wildly overused) create frightening effects, but I've got news for you. The only thing frightening about this was the fact that I've just wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this piece of cliched filth! ***SPOILER*** this movie really is terrible.I give it a 2 out of, let's say, 67.

		<fullReview>I saw the commercials for this Movie on T.V. and I said to myself, man that looks SOOO scary!! I went to my friend (JAMES) House for a sleepover with some other guys. He Rented 13 ghosts. We Turned off the lights and popped it into the VCR. We expected to Wet ourselves in fear. We were tense as the "WARNING: legal stuff, blah, blah ,blah faded of the screen. But, It wasn't scary. It starts off in a junkyeard where a rich guy tries to collect his 12th ghost, (The Juggernaut) But Gets Killed and his big glass house is left to his Nephew and his family, who were living in an apartment after a fire killed his wife and burned the house down. They go inside to look around with a lawyer, a psychic power technician that is trying to fix the power. They accidentally unleash the 12 ghosts in the basement one by one and they cannot escape the house.This movie was not scary. It had a pretty thin plot, The "Ghost Machine" thing looked like something out of a fairy tale (OOH, So Scary). The ghosts were cool and freaky, but another thing was that most of the people didn't get killed by ghosts and that you needed these glasses to see the ghosts. I thought that was just dumb. One scare though, is when some ghosts are released and are roaming around the basement, the innocent little 5 year old boy goes down to investigate and the doors close behind him and your like "OHHH, The Kid's gonna get marmalized!" and *SPOILER ALERT, If you don't want it ruined or haven't seen it Read no Further!!!* He just runs around and dissapears until the end of the movie. After the movie, We expected to have nightmares before we watched it, but I just dreamed of logging ontop IMDB and saying it Not to Expect too much of it. It's pretty good though.

		<fullReview>Thir13en Ghosts isn't, particulary, a superbly crafted horror film. What it is, is an hour and half of fun. It will make you jump and maybe even scream. The suspense levels are fairly high but the frights come from the look of the monsters and, to a certain degree, the editing style. Yet, it is well worth seeing. Set design and make up effects stand out above the sometimes over-the-top acting but it's fun. What more do you want from a horror film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Goats?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic premise is interesting in this remake of a 1960 original ? a group of people are trapped in a giant glass maze into which, via a system of timed sliding doors, a procession of ghosts is introduced. It also had a good central performance from the dependable Tony Shalhoub, a few gruesomely inventive deaths and excellent make-up. And a funny goat joke.But?and the better your television's sound system, the bigger the but?every appearance of a ghost (and I mean every single appearance) is accompanied by a strobe effect and an overloud piercing noise. When this happens every few seconds, and it frequently does when the action hots up, it makes watching this film a sense-battering endurance test. Reliance on sudden loud noise and fast editing for horror effect only works on the undemanding viewer.It's not without interest and is reasonably entertaining but it's ultimately only an exercise in special effects and a demonstration of why (along with The Haunting a couple of years ago) effects?laden remakes are not generally a good idea. It's horror for the MTV generation. It's like watching a 90-minute rock video with the music taken out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a concept, this movie should have rocked the house. Instead it ends up a limp, bland movie.I loved the idea of a crew of ghostly baddies each with a theme and history running amok in an enclosed space. Many were visually realized in an effective way (especially the Jackal). The story just didn't utilize them in any effective way.Maybe I just didn't care enough about the main characters to want to see them survive. Maybe the ghosts just weren't scary enough (except for the Jackal and maybe the Angry Princess, the Jackal especially reminded me of the Face of Death from the Exorcist). It just fell flat for me.This movie is a good example of why today's directors who seem to think gimmicky rock-video camera tricks (slo-mo and the like) won't ever get it. It's mood, stupid! Cool house though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not at all like the original 1960 version, which was creepy and had some imagination to it. The special glasses are still in the remake, but in 1960 the glasses were a gimmick for theatre audiences to enjoy similar to 3-D glasses. They had to put on the special glasses to see the ghosts in the film. The 2001 version is too flashy and subliminal with the ghosts. Why is it that the ghosts these years always seem to look like Night Of The Living Dead? This version will not be a classic like the original. What I will remember is Tony Shalhoub as the father, Alec Roberts as the son and Kathryn Anderson as the mother. Good acting and performance by all three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok so this movie isn't going to win any awards and it wasd mostly hates by critics when it first came out but horror movie fans are sure to eat this up. The only problem with this film is that besides die hard horror fans, people looking for something new and interesting probably won't look much past the movies special effects. The story like that of other horror movies is cliched and predictable but a suprsingly effective performance from Matthew Lillard keeps things interesting. The true highlight of the film is the special effects. Not to say that the special effects here haven't been used before but they have never really been used this effectivly. So althought it's not ground breaking it's got enough gory effects to keep horror fans pleased and will keep people looking for some entertainment on a rainy night occupied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has everything a horror fan could ask for: a cast of unsmart big breasted teens, loads of gory special effects and a cliche ridden story that most critics hated. So for die hard horror fans this movie will probably be the answer to your horror needs to everyone else looksing for something new and interesting you probably won't see much interesting past the great special effects and camera moves. The acting is nothing new eccept for a suprisingly effective performace from Matthew Lillard as a pshychic ghosts hunter. The movie doesn't deliever any real scares due to the fact that this has all been done before but because of the special effects it puts it above most of the horror movies that have been coming out these days. So if you need something to do on a rainy weekend pick up a copy of 13 Ghosts and enjoy.</fullReview>

Some one referred to this as a 'remake of a Roger Corman film", try William Castle. Another reviewer said, 'it look like a remake of a 60's cheesy horror film', well, DUH!, it is!OK, now that I've gotten that off my chest, The movie was pretty good, Shaloub was excellent, as usual, Shannon was pretty, as usual, (remember, she started as a model, models don't win Oscars!), my one objection was the nanny. This big a display of tokenism in this day and age? C'mon, guys! Lillard was actually pretty good in this, better than anything I've seen him in thus far. The ghosts were great, (yes, I AM a guy, so I was digging the "Angry Princess"!), the house was cool, (OK, how many people would like to live there?), F. Murray was top notch.Like a lot of films these days, more attention was paid to style over substance, but still, a reasonably good scare. 3 out of 5.As I usually have to point out, don't see a movie like this expecting Shakespeare, and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Perhaps I have become desensitized... but the small amount of gore in this film isn't enough to disturb me. All of the 'shock' effects were very predictable... and thus, not 'shocking'.

I must say though, that is quite the house!! I really liked the plot of the movie. Well done.

Most horror movies don't manage to give a hard core viewer the creeps no matter how many gross special effects they employ. Ususally what you get is more of a squeamishness at the grossness of it all. The ghosts in this flick do manage to convey a sense of menace. It's too bad the living cast isn't nearly as effective, otherwise this might have been a really good ghost story. Still, the special effects are creative and the glass house is a nice touch. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

However, the film is a lot of fun, and a good updating of the equally silly William Castle original, and infinitely better than their remake of "House On Haunted Hill, which was an utter bore. First-rate special effects, scenic design, make-up, and good enveloping surround sound, make this film a must for horror-film fans. Tony Shalhoub and Matthew Lillard are fine, and Rah Digga, utters one of the funniest (and dumbest) lines, I've ever heard in a film (while looking at the lawyer).

I have a feeling that this movie will become like the Rocky Horror Picture Show and in 30 years when the effects suck people will watch it just because it's so stupid it's funny. The sad part is that they were actually trying to make a scary movie, actually that makes it funnier, kind of like Evil Dead.

		<shortDescription>Attempts to set a new precedent for horror...but fails!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visual effects supervisor Steven Beck trades hats as he directs his first feature in ?Thir13een Ghosts'. This visually superb film contains some nifty effects but lacks in pure enjoyment of the antiquated notion of haunted houses. Tony Shalhoub plays a widower sent to claim his late uncle's estate. To his dismay, the larger than life home harbours trapped spirits that are retained in the basement. As the film progresses, the audience is exposed to ancient spells, machines created by the devil, some extraordinary visual effects and tiresome thrills that seem new and exciting, yet do not deliver a wholesome product. The film is well made and has the budget to boast for it. ?The Matrix' Producer Joel Silver and Director Robert Zemeckis back this film in production values and it shows. Yet while I was watching the attempted thrills and lacklustre enjoyment value I thought to myself, this film could have been a really fun horror film. Unfortunately, in my earnest opinion, it was not. The film takes off on William Castle's 1960 Horror film in which when watching the film at the movies, Castle created a 3-d film where viewers had to don those glasses to get the desired effect. In this film, our characters promenade around the house only actually observing the ghosts when looking through the glasses. It could have been an inventive concept, and it was not far off. Yet this is where my diagnostic eye comes into play. Director Steve Beck makes a solid attempt at revitalizing a tired genre. He quickly cuts between shots of the scene with and without ghosts in an attempt to incorporate what it looks with the ghosts absent to the naked eye. The key close up scenes were quite intriguing considering the extensive make up the actors had to go through to get some shock value, but the movie tries so hard at being innovative that it really does not bring a new kind of scare. Bear in mind, the film is very dimensional and attempts a new precedent for horror. Too bad it forgot to scare us while thinking of new ways to look good. This flaw is not supported by a sponge script, some bad acting by Shannon Elizabeth and a miscast crew that does not fit the exact characters they are supposed to portray. For those who get creeped out easily, they shall have a swell time. Yet for the discerning viewer, it contains no earth shattering elements despite the visuals that make this film stand above the recycled horror trash there is out there.Giancarlo's Rating: *1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a pretty decent haunted house movie, quite better than the remakes of both "The Haunting" and "House On Haunted Hill", and it was especially better than the recent TV movie, "Stephen King's Rose Red" (supposedly the "ultimate haunted house movie"). To the folks here that have wrote the highly negative reviews about this film: LIGHTEN UP- every horror flick simply isn't going to be an outright, jump-out-of-your-seat scary, horror masterpiece as "The Exorcist" or "Alien"- in fact, most films aren't going to live up to the standards those movies set. Your expectations seem to be way too high and you're probably expecting this type of movie to be crap, so you set yourself up with that in mind and- guess what, that is your opinion when the movie is over. Nothing ticks me off more than to read these reviews by folks who want to smugly blast a new film just for the sake of being able to do it. Anyway, enough ranting about that. I rented this film and was entertained much more than I anticipated: the ghosts were pretty scary, the special effects really good. I plan to buy the film on DVD to add to my library. I can imagine that, had I saw this on the big screen- in full surround, it would have scared the bejesus out of me! Still not the "ultimate" haunted house movie, but a little bit closer than we've seen in a while. Definitely worth adding to your horror collection. Rating: ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thir13een Ghosts is scary in some parts, laughable in others (some unintentionable). You can really juice up the "spook" factor by buying or renting the DVD version and play it through a great surround sound system...loud! The acting is so-so and the plot is thin. Director Steve Beck's use of quick-cut editing enhances the urgency of the situations. But his best shot is during the opening credits; the voices in the background tell the story of how happy this family was and then tragedy erupts. The pan shot of the living room, from well-kept to fire scarred in a single shot, is pure genius (though slightly Hitchcockian). This film would make a good at-home date movie. Straight-ahead, no-bones horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'll be one to admit that I enjoyed this film, I haven't seen the original but I actually want to now after seeing this. The makeup and special effects were superb, if anything that's what this film should be praised for. I rented the DVD and ventured into the special features category and went behind the scenes and discovered the huge amount of work that went into this underrated thriller. Some actors spending more than 5 hours in makeup, and 10 second scenes taking months to put together, unbelievable. I also loved watching the ghosts' fact files and why they were chosen for Cyrus' collection, it was interesting. My only complaint? Shannon Elizabeth's VERY less than stellar, um, performance isn't even the correct word. Why on earth does she get cast in films? Oh I know, because since American Pie she's been established as being totally hot (she's favorably pretty, but not stunningly beautiful). It has to be her looks getting her these roles, cause obviously it isn't her "talent." Matthew Lillard was great as always and the rest of the cast wasn't that bad, except for that annoying kid. I wouldn't call this movie great, but it entertained me and that's why I rented it in the first place. Don't take it too seriously, it's just supposed to be creepy and fun, which I thought it was. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading all the negative reviews on this movie I felt the need to stand up a little for it. Just reading the reactions that people get when all someone was trying to do was make a scary horror flick only makes me realize that unless it wins an Oscar, a horror film can never be successful today. If you like horror movies you'll most likely like this. Its got the gore, the ghosts, the crazy make-up, etc. This movie is such a relief to horror fans after watching the genre slowly die with the recent trash studios were putting out. It doesn't rely on hot-shot actors and trying to please the critics. This is what horror IS. Forget the Academy Award winning actors and developed story! Horror is supposed to be scary and entertaining. This is. It's horror. There you have it. My advice to those unsure whether or not they want to see this? Well, if you like horror at all (remember, horror, not the films in the past 5 or 6 years...) then it's great and fun. If you don't like horror it's still cool to watch. Don't expect that much, already! This is not the perfect example of a horror movie, but it is a step in the right direction and serves to getting horror back on track. Thank Hollywood, they finally made a traditional, good ol' horror movie! Sorry it didn't clean out the Oscars, people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rented this flick the other day, and I have to say that it's nowhere nearly as bad as everyone says it is. I mean come on, this isn't supposed to be Shakespeare ?it's a B-movie. It's one of those mindless pieces of eye candy that's fun to watch on a lazy afternoon or evening. Sure it has huge plot holes, but then again so do far better films such as Memento or even Citizen Kane. I can think of far worse movies than 13 Ghosts. I only have two real complaints about this movie:1.) The Nanny: Why was she even in the damn thing to begin with? (SPOILER) She was so annoying that I was disappointed with the fact she survived. I was waiting for The Hammer to lay some smack down. (END SPOILER)2.) The Ghosts: Even with the brief glances we get at these characters, we can tell that there's some sort of back-story to each of them. In fact they were publicly released on the Internet before the movie came out. Why didn't they include them in the film? I wanted to know more about the ghosts. They didn't have to spell out each one's history, but we could have used little scenarios like the beginning to introduce the Juggernaut or the bathroom sequence with the Angry Princess. And what the hell happened to the Torso? We get one real glance at him in the basement, and he vanishes. I feel that the Torso had the potential to be one of the scarier ghosts ?can't you imagine something like that stalking around the basement in the dark? Creepy. . .In the end, this film is worth a $1.99, 5-day rentals, just don't try to make it into something it isn't. You want scary and tense? Try The Others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not amazingly bad, just not very interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this film, I had a feeling it wouldn't be very good. I was right. All pretensions aside, this is a haunted house movie, and as a basic idea it's not too bad. Unfortunately the director falls down by following few or no rules of any ghost story - suspense is rare, tension is low, and to be honest, some of the adverts I saw before the trailers had better technique. Instead (apart from some pretty heavy gore) the only scare-factor used is that of the fast cut (i.e. a heck of a lot of quick shots in sequence, showing a ghost going 'Boo' or something from different angles). Terrifying. Obviously, the film isn't so bad in isolation, it's just that the whole thing has been done far better before. The make up is excellent, the special effects are pretty nifty, and the set is superb. The acting is so-so, at its worst in the sickly sweet opening titles, but there are some good moments. Even the plot has a convincing twist or two. The ghosts are pretty well handled, only some are pretty unconvincing, which doesn't help matters. It's at least nice to see some depth being added to the characters...if only the film was just more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the best way to spend a birthday, unless you fancy sleeping, of course. I wanted to nod off during 'Charlotte Gray', another unbelievably boring movie, but this one trumped it. An exercise in how to look scary but not achieve any suspense/tension/interest/atmosphere. And the cast was forgettable; the music laughable; the composition non-existent. Anybody who has seen 'Memento' will know how to relate to a movie whose scenes are not in chronological order. Anyone who watches this film wonders if they would notice if the scenes were jumbled up, and shown in a different order each time. It wouldn't matter, because there is no reason TO SHOW it in order. The middle hour of the film is a complete mess; oh, and the last five minutes is also a mess; oh, and the first fifteen minutes is also a mess, but a slightly DIFFERENT mess. I give this 1 out of 10. 0 equals a walk-out and I didn't do that because I was enjoying the sleep. How can any critic recommend this crap? Jonathan Ross has now lost his credibility. Awful with a capital ZZZ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many ghosts that did nothing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I just saw this movie and wanted to comment on this, because it was fairly entertaining, even though its plot, acting, and direction were quite weak. I must stress this is not a very bad movie, since it had an original horror story; however I thought it was unnecessary that there were 13 ghosts involved throughout the whole story. Some of those ghosts didn't just appear much. They should have appeared some more to make it more dreadful. It didn't make sense at all. This is not very scary, but this is rather enjoyable. I like the scenes where the babysitter complains about her job. Those scenes were a little bit funny. I also liked the way the main character tries so hard to save their children from those evil forces. It shows us how much a parent could love his children. As for the house, It's really awesome looking.The story is about a man who lives happily with their family. Unfortunately his wife dies because of a fire accident. The man's enigmatic uncle who is dead made a remarkable clause in his will. He's left his nephew a big and beautiful house far from other neighborhoods. He and his children are completely excited about living in that amazing, but strange house. They get the special house with their babysitter and discover something odd in this. This house has many ghosts and two people are trying to set them free in order to defeat them. It'll surprise you when you find out that the fourth ghost is the man's wife. The man will try to do whatever it takes to save his children from those 13 ghosts. Overall this is not one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but I know some scenes are thoroughly incoherent, worthless and disturbing; nevertheless you know it's what a horror movie is about. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film must be said to be an ordinary horror movie. Well known actors, who are not too prominent (expensive) act in a story, which everyone knows, who has watched "The Haunting" and "Haunted Hill". But why did Tony Shalhoub act in this movie? He was brillant in "The Man who wasn't there", but here... Very brutal and gory effects (the death of Embeth Davidtz... everybody who saw the movie will know what I mean). It's entertaining, but not scary (I often wondered why). After all it's not a must-see-movie, but if you've got time to watch it you should probably do it (if you like the horror-genre). 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, but like the house ... needed work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When I saw the trailer for this I was intrigued by the cool house design and wanted to see it just for that. Just as well really. The house is indeed very cool and stylishly designed but unfortunately like many aspects of the movie amazingly underused. One magically inscribed glass wall is very much like another and we only see three or four rooms that allow some variation in the camera angle. The ghosts are well created and the stroboscopic flashes make the most out of their appearance but they are underused as well. We see three or four of them actually do something (the naked female ghost obviously gets the most screen time) while the others appear briefly, look a bit distressed for a second (probably disappointed they didn't get _more_ screen time) and then we don't see them again until the end. We learn nothing about their histories or how they died (do the producers expect everyone to read about them on the web site?) or where they were captured. SPOILER ...On the way to the end of the movie plot logic gets locked out of the house and the essential "love conquers all cliche" gets locked in. Shannon Elizabeth vanishes and reappears without explanation, Embeth Davidtz changes sides for no clear reason, and the ghosts are summoned instantly to another room making this viewer wonder why it was necessary to have a super-complicated machine to set them loose to wander around the house in the first place ... Less running around screaming and a longer running time to flesh out the ghosts would have made a big difference. As it is, good undemanding entertainment on the TV, that any way you look at it makes a change from the usual slasher pic. Just don't expect the plot to live up to the style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a fairly good second part of the year for horror movies. Jeepers Creepers was very entertaining if lacking something in plot, second part of the year for horror movies. Not brilliant or outstanding by any means, but definitely fairly good. I was expecting a good deal from this offering. It is difficult to throw a decent plot into the mix of stunning and frightening visuals. The plot here is simplistic and doesn't overshadow the point of the film which is, obviously, to make you jump. More graphic and less atmospheric than Jeepers Creepers, it fails to make you feel for the characters, with the exception of Cyrus, the mad-scientist-cum-evil-uncle-cum potential master of the universe. It has a happy ending which s out of character for fright movies at the moment. On the whole, rippingly good stuff. Not as disturbing as ?The Cell' or as gory as ?Hellraiser', but a combination of the two.</fullReview>

The acting talent was acceptable but almost wasted on this weak vehicle. I give it 5 out of 10. Or as I rate them here in NYC: $4.50 out of a full ticket-price of $9.50.

		<fullReview>Not since the release of Scream (also starring Matthew Lillard), has the horror genre been refreshed and shown in a way that is new and amazing. I found myself more than once durring the movie, literally on the edge of my seat, with a death-grip on the arm-rests. Filming this movie in a totally constructed set on location was impressive and the new look of terror, surrounded by clean lines and classical elements, made this movie more than just a victorian, cob-web ridden creep fest. I think that what some people fail to realize about this film isn't that it's the ghosts that are meant to scare you the most (although, they are fantastically frightening) but the fear of the impending unknown. It's the suspense that thrills and chills. This movie is bound to step out of the realm of the atempted, but failed remake, and into a life all it's own. see it now, in theatres, and be ready for the unexpected!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoo-hah did that bite!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that I am a huge fan of William Castle and, in particular, of the original "13 Ghosts". In fact I have two VHS copies of it &amp; will buy it on DVD someday. Yes, it's not a very good film, but it's got... I don't know... a certain quality which I find charming. It's a movie I remember first watching late night on TV probably in the late 60's on Big Chuck and Hoolihan.OK, that being said, I was just hoping that this remake wouldn't be too bad- maybe something along the lines of "The House on Haunted Hill" which, while not great, kept my interest until its goofy ending.ANYHOO, I looked at my wife about 60 minutes into the remake of "13" and said "this is horrible". She just nodded mutely. I figured there was no more than 30 minutes left so I stuck it out till the end. Hoping, just hoping, for one redeeming reference or homage or ANYTHING that wasn't freaking STUPID.Loud, moronic, and uninteresting is my three word description for this atrocity. I had real bad misgivings right from the get-go with that loud, moronic, uninteresting scene in the junkyard.Why did they change the last name of the family from "Zorba"? Why did they remove the mother and add the housekeeper (and as someone else already commented- how could they afford her)? Why was there not at least a nod to the original film? Why am I spending this time and effort on a piece of crap film?So very disappointing. I doubt "Dark Castle" films is going to fool me into seeing one of their "remakes" again.BTW, I think Tony Shaloub's best work is in "Barton Fink". I thought he was excellent in his (too short) role as a harried producer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you ever wonder where they find the people in horror movies? You know, the people who walk into rooms covered with sinister-looking messages in indecipherable languages and just frown a little and say "Hmm, I wonder what it means?" People who walk blithely with only a candle into places no sane person would set foot in without extensive prepping by artillery fire?Wherever they get them, there must be quite a supply, 'cause, boy, they sure don't last long. (It may be the same place where they get the cops in B-action pictures).Now, I'm not saying that such people (I understand the technical term of art is "idiot in the attic") cannot be a source of genuine entertainment and suspense. But they need to have a good movie around them. "Thirteen Ghosts", or more technically "Thir13en Ghosts" (which, if you think about it, is almost twice "Se7en", only without the atmosphere of impending existential doom) is not that movie. It might have been, if only the writer had worked half as hard as the production designer.The plot concerns Arthur, a math teacher trying to recover emotionally and financially from a tragic event, who is visited by the creepiest lawyer Central Casting could come up with. Creepy, esq. informs Arthur that his eccentric uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham, trying valiantly to erase any memory of him as a good actor) has left him a house and a pile of money. No one in the audience would trust this guy to pour them a glass of water, but Arthur and his family follow the lawyer to the house, since they are natives of the Land of Suicidally Stupid Horror-Movie Characters (motto: "Let's split up."). This despite the fact that the house (and Uncle Cyrus' unsettling video will) has glass walls, tons of cryptic writing and eerie symbols, and images of rotting, gape-jawed skulls. I guess that's what the real-estate market will do to you. The house is full of ghosts that Uncle Cyrus captured with his band of ghost-hunters (think of the Ghostbusters, only with Reynolds-and-Saran-wrap jackets and no sense of humor) have imprisoned. They need the ghosts to harness their energy to power an ancient device that - oh, never mind.There is a great deal of running away from various mutilated and disgruntled ghosts (who can only be seen with special glasses), which at least gives the cast a break from speaking their flat and uninteresting lines. Tony Shalhoub lends Arthur some tortured dignity, and of the characters who get the most screen time, his is easily the most credible performance. Also trapped in the house are his two children, played by Shannon Elizabeth and Alec Roberts. Partisans of the winsome Ms. Elizabeth should note that, despite her prominence in the movie's marketing, she disappears from the action for a very long stretch. Embeth Davidtz shows up as a kind of undead-rights activist with a spell book and a bag of TNT blocks (when trapped in a haunted house, it's always advisable to bring at least one cast member from "Army of Darkness"). Matthew Lillard, who places an undue dramatic value on annoyance, plays an angry psychic (aren't they all?) who was helping Cyrus get the ghosts.The ghosts are really the most interesting part of the movie, as you might expect. They are a diverse group, and their disparate energies are required to - oh, forget it. But I was hoping for more back story on them, like who they were, how exactly they met their sundry bad ends, or why it was their bad luck to end up as the ethereal equivalent of the Energizer Bunny. But little development of the ghosts is forthcoming, except for a few vague hints here and there, enough to pique your curiosity, but not enough to satisfy it much.In the end, "Thirteen Ghosts" adds up to less. The house is cool (I can't imagine what the glazier's bill looked like), and some of the ghosts are intriguing (though quite over the top). Mostly, it's "Ghostbusters" without the wit, and "The Sixth Sense" without the depth. But never fear; we aren't likely to run out of idiots in the attic anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want something to make you jump in your seat a bit, I'd recommend this. The computer effects and make up were great. I do have to say the rest of the acting left a bit to be desired, but I went to see the ghosts. With that in mind, I would have also liked to see a bit of history in pertaining to the 12 ghosts (or at least 11 of them, we know about number 4). Who were they, how were they caught? I also would have liked to see the other ghosts in action, more than just the Jackal and the Juggernaut, the rest didn't do much. The movie over all was good, but it could have been better, much better. There was a lot of building the writers could have done on it. And the book nonsense needed to be explained a bit more as well, instead of just throwing a book into the movie, explain what it is more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a horror buff, you've probably seen the "classics": "ReAnimator", "Hell Raiser", "Bram Stoker's Dracula", "Dawn of the Living Dead", etc. If you have, you've seen about 90% of this film. In fact I can almost see the Editor grabbing clips from these movies into a test print and trying to digitally alter them just enough so that Columbia Pictures won't get sued.But the idea of having a horror film take place in a "glass" house seems to have been original(I tried to spot a reflection of the camera, but could not spot it). And it turns out that the house is the real star of this movie, although after a while you get the idea it is a flat and not the multi-level structure they try to suggest.As is (unfortunately) becoming more common, Shannon Elizabeth is becoming highly over-dressed in her roles, although one voluptuous babe makes several nude appearances as a ghost with her tits slashed!Anyone under the age of 13 that has not rented any horror videos, might find this movie interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect movie for Halloween, but not a perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the best movie to release on Halloween weekend, but that's not to say it was a perfect movie. First of all, the set design was amazing. The house they get stuck in is not just made of glass walls and floors, it's etched glass. Plus, the walls and floors constantly move, some of which was awesome computer graphics, but most was actually moving sets. The set designer should get nominated for an Oscar, it's that cool. Now, onto the story. I won't get too deep into this, since I don't want to ruin anything. Just suffice it to say that the story wasn't especially strong, but in a film like this, that's almost forgivable. The plot started off semi-fantastic, and ended up in the near-ridiculous. But, again, no sweat. I didn't go to think, I went to be scared. -- The acting was ok, with a hodge-podge cast of characters. The only character I had a problem with was the black nanny. They had written some good stuff for her, until halfway through the movie. During a slower moment in the story, they ran out of intelligent dialogue for her, and she started spouting out token black sayings, like "Stuck in a room with crazy white people", and at the end she says something similar. This leads me to believe that the writer's thought the movie might be too intense, and needed someone to be comic relief. But, I have to tell you, it was completely out of place, and her character became disposable. Besides, we already had comic relief, (albeit DARK comic relief), in the form of Matthew Lillard, of "Scream" fame. -- As mentioned before, the visual special effects are great. The makeup effects are very cool on the 12 ghosts, (the 13th ghost is the secret to the story). The editing was effective, although at times I knew what it felt like to have epilepsy. The sound effects and creepy score were the real key to making this movie scary. There are, fortunately, plenty of weird sounds and whispered voices in the theater to make you look behind you. Unfortunately, however, some of the key sound effects were turned up so loud that it was almost painful. I imagine the producers wanted to give that extra "push" to the audience, but it was somewhat distracting. -- Now, a couple of things I wanted to point out about specific things in the movie, one good and one bad. First of all, in case you don't know, the idea of putting on special glasses in order to see the ghosts is taken directly from the original "13 Ghosts" by William Castle. In the 50's, Castle was the P.T. Barnum of filmmaking, and would do anything to scare an audience. He was known for flying a skeleton over the crowd's head during "House on Haunted Hill", and even making theater goers sign a waiver before going into the movie, which released William Castle from prosecution in case the viewer died of fright. In another picture, he rigged all the theater seats so that he could give the audience a small electric shock during a pivotal scene. For the original "13 Ghosts", viewers were given a pair of special glasses, similar to 3-D glasses, and were told that if you got too scared during the film, just take off the glasses, and the ghosts would disappear. This piece of quirky nostalgia was not only mentioned in the remake, but it was made an intregal part of the plot. Very cool, indeed. -- **MINOR SPOILER AHEAD** -- The only goof I found in the film was a BIG one. Lillard's character makes a point to tell us that the glass walls are soundproof. Later, he's stuck inside one of the glass rooms without his trusty glasses. He gave the glasses to the black nanny, who says "I'm sorry" for locking him in there. And he hears her! Then, when he's attacked in the same room by a nasty ghost, she starts yelling instructions like, "Duck!" and "Move!" Yeah, soundproof, right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary at all?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning contains Spoilers My summary says it all? We saw this as a family group and the youngest in the group was 8 years old. As is normal when we go to a movie, the adults sat in the middle of the theater and youngsters in our group sat up front as close as thy could get to the screen. We told them at the beginning of the movie, "if you get scared just come back and sit with us? They never did. After the movie as we was riding home I asked the 8 year old, "Did that scare you?" His answer was "No, it was boring, I knew every time before the ghost came on." This coming from an 8 year old. He and his 10 year old brother sat in a row by themselves and never once moved. He did say, after I asked him several times if it scared him at all, that the bathtub scene scared him in his words "Just a little bit." I found this movie boring, predictable, and not scary at all. I did think the house/machine was "interesting" I don't, as many others, think the acting or special effects were bad. I blame the low quality of this movie directly on the director, the director makes or breaks the movie. Also I think that the scrip left much to be desired also, this movie could have been saved simply by changing the ending. If instead of Arthur winning and everyone going home happy, it would have made a much better movie if the bad guy had of won. Everyone knew that in the end the good guys would prevent Cyrus from completing his machine. If suddenly in the end Cyrus had completed his machine it would have completely caught everyone off guard and I would have been much more satisfied. All too often today in the movies everything works out ok, I remember watching "Fallen" and was totally stunned and left feeling like I got my moneys worth when the demon won. This is one time I wished I had waited for a movie to come into the video store and saved my money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, this movie is not perfect by any means. Those who said that the ending on this movie sucks are right. If I see any more horror flicks where the family has a happy ending thanks to a helpful ghost I think i will be sick. The cast is poor, very poor and the plot is choppy and thrown together. Matthew Lillard can barely save this film but he plays his part to the fullest and despite the irony that may go along with him taking this role, he's pretty convincing as psychic. I can feel his pain in every one of those spasms. The effects are stellar and perhaps alone worth seeing the movie. Their presentation is somewhat similar to that of the bodies in seven. The whole movie is dark and haunting and I guarantee some jumps. In response to some of the other reviews, the shots of the house where "it looks like the director doesn't know what else to shoot" are for a purpose. They serve as a reflection of the aura the house holds so you can appreciate the genuine eerieness saturating the walls. It's an artistic manouevre. If only to view the incredible effects (and one hell of an original death scene) and to forever lock this film away in your mind as novelty, I recommend seeing it. There are some great laughs among the spooks as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Ghosts was an overall good movie, but it lacked the "fright" it reported to have. You see a few (maybe 5 or 6) great scary scenes but the rest are just a walk in the park. When I came to see the movie I expected it to have a frightful intro (which it did have in the junk yard), and for it to be non-stop scary (which it lacked more times than needed). But I loved the way Ben Moss(JR Bourne) lived up to his character. This guy is a great actor, and i really enjoyed his playing through out the film. And not to forget the totally incredible special effects - oh man, once you see these you will fall on the floor, they are spectacular! - along side the 12 ghosts (you guys are going to love the Jackal (Shayne Wyler) and the Juggernaut (John DeSantis). I think they were the best acted out ghosts). On another note, the movie was kind of short (only an hour and 28 minutes), it would have helped if they added an extra 30 minutes of story line). Overall this movie is a good one, but not what you probably expected. Go see it, but you won't be having any nightmares thereafter.</fullReview>

THIS IS THE LAST THING I WANT TO SEE IN THE END OF A HORROR FILM!The Dark Castle movies seem to be taking all these risks, but it's all run right into a brick wall at the end, providing us with a half-fast cop-out commercial substitute.You know what's worse than a bad movie?

Speaking of which, the princess was quite the character. Probably more memorable is the Hammer, with his nails-you figure it out. The lawyer also provided some good humor with his smartass personality. See it and watch his timely demise. There is a lot of gore and extreme violence, as well as some nudity, but it's not completely critical to the story. It helps, but probably wasn't really needed.

Especially where they don't say something along the lines of "I am stuck with a bunch of crazy white people."Now that that is out of the way... This wasn't a very enjoyable movie. Sure there was tension, but it was all very contrived. Mostly done with choppy edits with scary sounds during the edit. The only real question was whether the "nannie" was going to die. And what is a poor teacher who has a mountain of debt doing with a nannie?Another problem is the kids. Shannon Elizabeth has no business being related to any of the others. It just doesn't fit at all. Then there is the boy. Why do all kids have to have a "cute" speech impediment? I much prefer the equally cliched but easier to stand kid who talks like an adult.At best this is a par for the course horror movie, i.e. all the characters are annoying and you almost hope they all die.</fullReview>

After a lot of running around, the comic relief character dies and comes back as a ghost to help our heroes...Wait a minute, that's "The House on Haunted Hill" remake. This movie is about an eccentric millionaire who gets some people to go to a strange, unique building which soon seals itself, trapping the guests with some angry... you get the point. This movie is the perfect example of going back to the well, but it must've gone dry because "Haunted Hill" is much, much better than "13 Ghosts" which is very sucky.Like "Hill", this flick has one token actor from a cult horror film (In "Hill" it was Jeffrey Combs from "Re-Animator", here it's Embeth Davidtz from "Army of Darkness"). The ghosts look excellent (KNB kicks ass!), the sets are neat, and there is one good death scene, but that's about all to recommend here. The plot is over-elaborate and confused, making up some rules and then breaking them later. The characters are lame (you know you're in trouble when the most likable person in your movie is Matthew Lillard), there's a stereotypical black chick ("Trapped in this house with these crazy white people!"- BTW, how can this debt-ridden family afford a live-in nanny anyway?), and it features one of the worst kid actors ever (Don't they audition these kids? Doesn't anyone notice they're horrible? I guess this is the "Jake Lloyd Syndrome"). Except for the lawyer death, no one dies until the very end, which packs in a lot of twists and crap, but by this time you won't care what's going on. The movie doesn't even try to be scary, it just piles one talky scene on top of another.I hated this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the 1999 version of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (7/10). 13 GHOSTS looked similar, so I was hoping for what I got out of that movie, which was just a cheesy, fun, haunted house movie with a lot of gory deaths.This movie didn't cut it for me, though. First, the good points. The ghosts were, mostly, cool. (With the exception of that STUPID large baby ghost.) The first "ghost-hunting" scene was also pretty cool, as was the death of the lawyer. I also enjoyed the (short) scene in which a character was trapped in a small room with a killer-ghost that he can't see. And Tony Shalhoub did a decent acting job in the lead role.Other than that, though, this film was pretty lame. The most annoying thing in the film to me was the irritating black-stereotype (I truly don't mean this offensively, of course) unfunny "comic relief". Anytime she was around, I was pretty much rooting for the ghosts. The kids were annoying too, especially Shannon Elizabeth's character. Although I think Shannon Elizabeth is cute and even a good actress, her character in this movie acted like she was maybe 6 years old. It was distracting and aggravating.The dialogue was lame and the movie was predictable. As the Arrow also pointed out, the first plot twist of the movie was easy to see coming a mile away. The second one was not, but only because it was pointless and stupid. The ending was largely unsatisfying to me, but the characters annoyed me so much by then that I doubt any ending would have worked for me at all.There also weren't enough gory deaths in this movie. I mean, come on, it's what you expect from a haunted house movie. The movie could've done with more of the cheesy fun from THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. I would definitely recommend renting THAT film rather then checking out this one.4/10</fullReview>

It is so bad with the script and so bad with just the constant barrage of sound that the film sinks real low into the realm of the horrible horror movie.And one more thing, in the commercials for the movie (if only on the radio), they state the movie is rated R for violence, nudity, etc. If I may let the men in on a secret who might just be seeing the movie on the reason of nudity, Shannon Elizabeth isn't the one that get's naked, it's just a couple of ghosts (and if anybody find nude ghost women arousing, you might wanna seek some help).

The scene that introduces the audience to Arthur Kriticos and family was superbly done, the slow circular transition between what once was and what is now was a work of art. Matthew Lillard was absolutely the perfect choice for Dennis Rafkin, I can't think of any other actor that could have brought that level of manic intensity to that role. F. Murray Abraham was completely smarmy as Cyrus Kriticos and had me thinking that Cyrus's parents were perhaps never married. Rah Digga did her job well as comic relief; the audience chuckled nervously in all the right spots. Plenty of gasps and exclamations were heard from the members of the packed movie theatre.The ghost cast, oh my, menacing, chilling, frightening. I'm not sure which ones were scarier, the noisy ones like The Juggernaut, The Hammer and The Jackal or the quietly threatening ones like The Angry Princess, The Great Child and The First Born Son. The make-up, set design and effects crews did an amazingly outstanding job; I have never seen anything like this before. The sound effects were perfect from the grinding gears to the ghostly murmurings. I have seen the original 13 Ghosts movie complete with "Illusion-O!" effects on DVD and it was gloriously cheesy, William Castle made scary movies for fun, they were meant to be fun and the remake is no different in that respect; it is a fun movie, complete immersion in sights and sounds. This version kept the number of ghosts, the general foundational premise and both movies are loaded with tongue in cheek references and humor but that is where the two films part company, as they should, they were created 41 years apart so of course the remake should take advantage of the advances in film technology. I really enjoyed this movie, I wish it had been a bit longer, spent a little more time on the background of those incredibly angry ghosts, fleshed out the living characters just a bit more, perhaps moved just a little bit slower but then, the fast-paced frenetic energy and aural/visual stimulation of the movie is what kept my eyes glued to the screen. Hooray to these moviemakers for making a fun movie for the sole purpose of entertainment. I recommend this movie to all who enjoy going to the theatre to turn off your mind and just be entertained for a couple of hours, this is comic book horror in big screen perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect from this movie, made by the same folks who gave us the remake of "House on Haunted Hill," which was really only a mediocre film. Sure the special effects were neat, and it had a Marilyn Manson song in it, but the rest of "Haunted Hill" was sorely lacking in characters and tension. Like most films of the CGI age, it demonstrated that the ability to make anything imaginable appear on screen has squashed the age-old concept that "less is more." Too bad, because "13 Ghosts" falls prey to this same mentality.The original plot is jettisoned except for the idea of a family who inherits a mansion haunted by tormented spirits (hey, stop laughing...it wasn't such a cliche back when the original came out). In the new version, we have a maniacal ghost hunter named Cyrus who uses elaborate contraptions to trap spirits inside of glass boxes...just like the Ghostbusters did! Well kind of. The ghosts are stored in the basement of his glass-and-gears house, and when Cyrus is killed during a capture, his last will and testament indicates that the mansion goes to his estranged brother, Arthur. Coincidentally, Arthur's wife, Jean, was just killed in a tragic fire six months previous. We know this is a tragedy because we get a hokey introductory time-lapse scene that goes from voice-over "happy family" dialogue to screams, crackling fire, and panicked voices, but not to worry...members of the Angela Lansbury fan club will be able to predict where Jean will turn up next. Anyway, Arthur and his two kids, Kathy and Bobby, go to check out the house, accompanied by Bobby's live-in nanny, Maggie (whom Arthur can afford to hire even though they are in the midst of financial ruin). Maggie has the thankless "token black person" role, and she manages to be one of the most appealing characters in the movie, despite the obligatory line where she has to complain about being trapped in a horror-movie scenario with "stupid white people." Yes...they went there.Matthew Lilliard is absolutely grating as Rafkin, one Cyrus's ex-assistant who can "feel ghosts", and Embeth Davidtz is shockingly amateurish as a ghost hunter with a secret up her sleeve (and no, it's not a cue card). These characters converge on the haunted glass house and are immediately trapped within its walls when a mechanism seals off all the doors and windows (just like "House on Haunted Hill"...cause like, if they didn't do that then everyone would just leave the house and the movie would be over). But don't worry...even though the house is supposed to be completely sealed off, the female ghost hunter reveals that she managed to slip in through a small gap when the house was "shifting".In a nod to the original, the house also comes equipped with special glasses that allow the characters to see the ghosts for themselves (William Castle's original "13 Ghosts" featured a gimmick where theatergoers were given special glasses that would allow them to either see the ghosts or not see the ghosts if anyone should find the flickering blue images too frightening).This new movie could have used a gimmick like that one. The new plot involves the plans that Cyrus made to take over the world via a ghostly apocalypse, or something like that....it's all explained in about two minutes and I didn't quite catch all of it, but I cut them some slack, since stupid plots can be just as much fun as good ones. I was just amazed at how the makers of this movie managed to assemble a cast where every single actor was bad. I felt like I was watching the outtakes, or an informal reading of the script, instead of the actual movie. OK, so you're the director of this film and you've got a lame plot, shiftless actors, and special effects that look like a Sega game. At least you can get some interesting set piece murders going, right? Wrong. Although there are a couple of gruesome deaths, they occur so quickly and suddenly that there's absolutely no tension or excitement, and only a chance to go "Ewwwwwwww!" once it happens. I'm sure the agents of the actors involved in this mess will not be getting any Christmas cards this year.Judging from the near-empty theater...on the movie's opening night, no less...I predict "Thirteen Ghosts" will evaporate like the apparitions that are the movie's only real stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun way to "kill" an hour and half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're old enough, or if you're just a sucker for the horror genre, you'll remember the William Castle shlockfest, 13 Ghosts, which was released in 1960. It's a fun movie, but only mediocre -- and it's said that those kind of movies are the best to remake. After all, why re-do something if you cannot improve upon it? I'm happy to report that 2001's 13 Ghosts is indeed an improvement over the original. The plot has been loosely preserved -- an eccentric ghost-hunting uncle bequeaths haunted house to poor relatives -- but mostly this is a stylish, spooky special-effects extravaganza. Unlike the gangly ghost-gandering goggles of the original, the new glasses are pretty plain -- but the important thing is what's seen through the lenses. The ghosts are just about the freakiest, scariest, most way-out creatures to come rattling down the hallway in a long time. Since there are twelve of them (who's the thirteenth ghost? As in the original, that's a mystery till the end), there's a special nightmare for everyone. The Torn Prince, The Torso, and The Jackal, to name just a few. The house is vastly improved as well -- it's a much scarier see-through structure than the one used in this year's wannabe thriller, "The Glass House."Trapped in their new home by shifting walls and churning floor levels, the family (Dad Tony Shaloub, daughter Shannon Elizabeth, and son Alec Roberts) encounters evil entities that want to eradicate anyone in their path -- and unlike traditional ghosts, these ones can (and will) do bodily harm! Aside from the family, their housekeeper and two other people end up trapped inside the malevolent structure. One is Rafkin (Matthew Lillard), former assistant to the aforementioned eccentric uncle (F. Murray Abraham) -- I've always liked Lillard, but he didn't work for me here. He's too funny, and I think that 13 Ghosts would have worked much better as a straight-ahead scary movie. (And there isn't quite enough comedy in it to make a comedic horror film, like An American Werewolf in London, or even Scream.)Steve Beck, who is making his directorial debut here, is no stranger to the film industry. He served as visual effects art director on such films as The Hunt for Red October, The Abyss, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. He definitely knows how to keep our eyes trained on the screen. Everything comes together really well and compliments each other (the music score and sound effects overlap and entwine, following the action on the screen perfectly).I'm not saying that 13 Ghosts is the best supernatural horror film of the year (that honor would have to go to The Others, with Jeepers Creepers on its heels), but it's a fun way to "kill" an hour and half this Halloween season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"13 Ghosts" happened to be one of my all-time favorite films. Though a bit on the "campy" side, it was still fun and a wonderful childhood memory. Hollywood is so lax in talent these days, that they have reduced themselves to taking my favorite old films and remake them into special effects porn films. Its an insult and an outrage. I didnt expect much when I saw this film, either. And I wasnt let down. I got just what I expected. Crap. They take my old faves, rip them apart, change them around and filthy them up, then present them to the new generation. Its sad that Hollywood is so pathetic today that it has to drag old films out of the vault to remake them because they just cant find anyone with any original ideas. What are they going to do when they've remade everything? Finish making films based on old 60s tv shows like they started? Then what, movies based on old 70s shows? How pathetic. People, if you go see this film, please make sure to see the original 13 Ghosts, first, so you can compare the two? I dont even believe why they took the whole family out of the remake...first, it was a father, a mother, a daughter and a son...theyve cut out the mother and son. Why?? What was the purpose of THAT?But I should have known. Remakes *ALWAYS* suck...I just wasted ten bucks for *nothing*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Ghosts is a Jules Verne-funhouse thrill-ride through a haunted, mechanical mansion-a truly entertaining blend of soft-core sci-fi and the supernatural.13 Ghosts is scary and absolutely gruesome at times, but it's also hilarious. Although replete with magic spells and satanic schemes it's not the kind of movie that revels in explicit, unrelenting cruelty (like, Se7en or Hellraiser, for instance). Writers Robb White and Neal Stevens give us smart, likeable characters to root for and everybody's got a fighting chance. You could probably take your mom to this movie if she has the good sense to throw her hands up over her eyes when the music gets creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got sneak preview passes to see 13 Ghosts tonight, and I was expecting the worst and hoping for the best. I haven't seen a real scary movie come out of Hollywood for a long time. To my disapointment, this was another one of those movies. Shannon Elisabeth sucks (as always) as do the other actors. It is the type of movie where you are rooting for the ghosts to kill everybody off so you can go home. The ghosts by themselves are frightening, and I would have liked to see them more, and had their individual stories more fully developed (because they were the only redeeming quality in the movie). What you get is you standard cookie-cutter horror. Quite disapointing, and the ending is ridiculously idiotic. I am beggining to feel insulted by Hollywood. Do they think all they need to do to scare us is throw in some gruesome gory scenes and a couple of helpless idiots trying to get away from "bad guys"? Another stinker....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A widower (Tony Shalhoub) with two kids learns he's inherited his dead uncle's house. It's not just any house, though, as the family finds out when they move in. The house is basically a glass prison for ghosts the uncle had captured. There's also some stuff about a machine but I'll let you watch to figure that out. Anyway, the family and some other folks become trapped inside the house with the ghosts. Oh heavens whatever will they do...Effects-driven remake of the William Castle classic isn't as much fun as the original but tries in its way. There's certainly a lot of scenery chewing going on. Unfortunately, there's too much emphasis on CGI and gore and not enough attention paid to actually making a scary movie. Director Steve Beck used to work for ILM, so I suppose it should come as no surprise he only cared about the special effects. The sets are nice, though, I'll give it that. The acting ranges from fine (Tony Shalhoub) to inept (Alec Roberts) to absolutely terrible (Matthew Lillard, one of the worst actors of all time). Also prepare yourself for Rah Digga's embarrassing turn as the stereotypical sassy black nanny. If it weren't for the profanity and people being bisected alive, I would've wondered what decade this was made in. Worth a look if you're into these types of things but, if you're hoping for a suspenseful and scary movie, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly enjoyable remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a relatives' death, a family learns they have inherited a giant glass-and-steel house that has been built to contain dangerous spirits for a powerful device that will unleash the powers of Hell and forcing them in a race to get out of the house alive.Overall this was quite the impressive and enjoyable effort that really gets the better of original. The main one in this one over the original is the house itself, which is incredibly impressive design and layout here that it's really unique and creative. The glass paneling and steel support frames provide the kind of basic look that is so unusual for any kind of film with its post-modern look that never seems to look livable but is more for look and appearance which succeeds wildly. This is one even before getting to all the mechanical devices, trap doors and even the writing all along the glass denoting all manner of spells and warnings that make this one of the most impressive, elaborate settings to place a film even before this one manages to utilize this great setting to fine effect here that really sets the fantastic stage for the spectacular ghost action throughout by putting it all inside such a great location. The opening to this in the car graveyard, which is the only scene outside the house, is the perfect start here with the crazy deaths showing cars being thrown around quite easily and really gets the freaky moments to add in with a fantastic sequence while getting the action in the house really nicely. The chases through the hallways are quite fun by letting the different ghosts and their gruesome looks which makes the scenes all the more fun. There's a large amount of the confrontations as well that provide not only the creepiness needed here while also making it thrilling as confrontations around the bathroom, around a pane of glass set-up as a barrier in the hallway and gong through their containment chambers in the basement are all incredibly enjoyable here. These fun attacks manage to bring about plenty of fun gore as well with plenty of gruesome, bloody deaths that go alongside the rather gruesome ghosts for a great time here, and along with the explosive action of the finale house destruction for all the great positives in this one. There's really only one flaw here for this one which is the fact that there's way too many important parts of the storyline introduced far too late into this one to get their full effect. The general gist of being there and them stumbling upon the ghosts is far more impressive when weighted against the wholly overblown stance this one puts forth in detailing the need for the specific ghosts and then being placed in the house to begin with. Otherwise, this was a highly enjoyable offering that has a lot of right with it.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity.</fullReview>

I found myself questioning what would happen next even though I had seen it when it first came out. Also the claustrophobic trapped factor is something that heightens the fear factor. Some horror movies are pathetic in the fact that all the victims need to do is walk out the front door but no that would be too easy.It's awesome seeing a cast that have developed so much over time and have just gotten better with age. Also the ghosts feel like characters themselves and it would be great to find out more about them. They seem so unique and I would love to know what drives them and their motives behind what they do. That may have made the movie comical and lacking fear though, kind of like Eddie Murphy's The Haunted Mansion. Oh and the Cyrus character is just plain old batsh!t crazy and kind of a jerk.But as far as horror movies go I really enjoyed it and found it to be full of suspense and fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could be naiveness on my part, but I expected to see a dark horror with creepy atmosphere. Boy, was I disappointed! This film has to got be one of the wort horror films ever made, let alone all movies.The characters are among the most obnoxious ever seen on camera. You're supposed to feel for these characters, but it's impossible because of how unlikeable they are. Arthur(Shalhoub) is an extremely bitter and impatient man, his kids are terribly annoying, the Nanny, Maggie(Diggah) is just as annoying as the kids, Rafkin(Lillard) is just plain boring, and the others seemed unnecessary.The ghosts were a mixed bag, some had interesting designs, but some went too over-the-top, and some were just rather plain. But due to the terrible camera work and cheesy "flashing" effects, you were barely able to make out any of these ghosts. The mansion that the movie was set in was really "out there" in terms of design, and it didn't help the movie at all. I think the film would've been much more effective if it were set in a more "traditional" haunted house setting(see "The Others" or Kubrick's "The Shining"), had very dark and ambient lighting, no cheesy effects, and of course, characters you could actually root for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mediocre Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the movie began, it seemed that we were in for a sort of whimsical, "Ghost Busters" like story of the attempt to capture ghosts. Then, as the movie continues, it turns into more of a horror movie than a typical ghost movie (I don't necessarily consider those to be the same thing.) The problem is that it doesn't really work that well regardless of which genre you try to fit it into. No doubt it's creative. The story (once you figure it out - and it is a bit confusing) has to do with the so-called "black zodiac" and the attempts of a mysterious figure (played by F. Murray Abraham) to amass great power by capturing the ghosts required to fill out this zodiac. The zodiac requires twelve ghosts, all of whom have to fit a certain "type," and then a 13th ghost is required - the ghost of a person who has to voluntarily give himself out of love. Cyrus (Abraham) chooses his nephew Arthur (Tony Shalhoub) to be the 13th ghost and lures them by faking his death and willing Arthur and his family a strange house, which isn't actually a house but a "machine" of sorts whose purpose is to bring forth the power Cyrus wants.The "house/machine" was both a strength and a weakness. It was very well designed and very mysterious, and yet it also seemed overdone in some ways. It was too much, and it - rather than the ghosts or the people - tended to become the focus of the movie. There are a handful of scenes of gore (notably the lawyer being sliced in half) and some decent enough frights and chills (confined mostly to the last half hour or so.) The story really isn't very well developed, though. The very last scene of the movie is an unfortunate attempt at humour that added nothing to one's memory or appreciation of the movie. It's a mediocre effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love cheesy horror movies, and cheesy this certainly is. It played out a lot like a Sy-Fy channel original movie. (Though I must confess, I enjoy watching those as well.) The writing was bad, the acting was bad (except, of course, for Tony Shalhoub) and the make up was definitely spotty. These faults distracted from any actual thrills that might have made it through, but as it was, I didn't scream once. I did, however, laugh quite a bit. I'm not complaining - it was what I expected from the film, and it delivered.Briefly touching on the subject of Tony Shalhoub, as bad as this movie was, it only made me appreciate Shalhoub more. I loved him in Galaxy Quest, and of course he's brilliant in Monk. For him to actually manage to get his acting skills across despite the writing and lack of support from the rest of the cast is a tribute to his greatness. It was like watching a real person surrounded by a troupe of bad actors. He was the only person to draw me into the story for any amount of time."Thir13en Ghosts" is a good flick for a few laughs with friends, but don't expect a serious horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem this movie has is the fact that the director knew it was going to be in theaters. As a result, everything but the special effects suffers. That's not to say that the ghosts and set designs weren't spectacular, they're just all you get.In a movie with a more than able cast, you wouldn't believe that these actors have had much experience because their characters are so flat. Tony Shalhoub is the only noteworthy player as his character has the biggest range of emotions. Matthew Lillard could have done well except for being too spastic. Shannon Elizabeth is obviously nothing more than eye candy since she never gets much of a chance to show that she can be more. Rah Digga seems like she was plucked from a pre 1950's Disney cartoon. F. Murray Abraham works as the villain since he has the most menacing look.The attempts at humor were what held the movie together and kept it from becoming boring. If that hadn't been incorporated, the movie would have been nothing more than a lot of flashes and loud bangs.The ending was easily the worst part because it feels too forced and haphazardly slapped together. It seems like no one really knew how to end it, just that it had to end.I suppose I should at least say a few good things about this movie. I did enjoy it. The make-up work was phenomenal, and the set design showed more dedication than most movies that have been released recently. If you want to see a haunted house movie and aren't very demanding, you'll enjoy this, too.</fullReview>

The original was idiotic and more camp than horror. I was expecting the Marx Brothers, Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges or even Abbott and Costello to jump out at any moment to alleviate the torturous 'acting' in this film. The 2001 remake is just as bad, no, no it's actually worse. Matthew Lillard has to be the WORST actor of his generation. Is he John Agar's grandson? This movie is utter crap. It has no merits whatsoever. The acting, plot, dialog, 'special effects' and direction are more painful than trying to take a crap after eating a pound of cheese and a box of Immodium. If you eat things out of dumpsters, you like the smell of other people farts or you can't spell your own name, then this is your movie. Anyone else should steer clear. I've had more fun waiting for my dog to take a crap in the rain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning,I have to say that I didn't like this movie too much.It has good idea,but the work is very bad.Firstly of all,number 13...why it's so special?Everyone who mentions that number says it's bad luck and that sort of thing.The other things - ghosts.I don't think I should talk you about ghosts now,but they have some figurative meaning which is very stupid.And when you pack number 13 and ghosts into one box,you get something very bad.In this case,it's a movie.I said,the idea is very good - the house is perfect,Latin spells are very interesting detail...But,something's missing!The acting is...HM...awful?I didn't like the actors,but thanks God on Rah Digga,I watched the movie until the end only because she's got a role in it.I don't know...I didn't like the eyeglasses because that is the most stupid detail in whole movie.I have just waiting for the moment when some guy's going to put his glasses,look at some girl and tell her:''Oh,my God,I can see you naked!'' Rubbish! So...i give this movie 5 out of 10,although it doesn't deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie lacks effort, plot, and excitement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The overall plot is a tired one that we have seen many times. A family gets a big inheritance from a dead relative and moves into the creepy relatives house. However, the plot has a twist in that the ghosts are actually a collection of spirits that Cyrus(dead relative) was going to use to power a giant machine from hell. WHAT THE HECK IS THAT ABOUT? seriously, this movie made me want a full refund in the theater of not only my money, but the two hours of my life I wasted watching it. How many times are we going to see scary ghosts, in the haunted house of dead uncle Cyrus, terrorizing the poor innocent relatives. Honestly, I could have made a better movie. The only reason I gave it a two was because there are a few jokes in the movie that I enjoyed. (namely when the lawyer gets cut in two and the babysitter says something like, "where'd the lawyer split off to?" Unless you like tired plots, boring lags in dialog, and a stupid ending, don't watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thirteen Ghosts" is the second movie made by Dark Castle Entertainment, who brought us the equally chilling "House On Haunted Hill" remake in 1999. This film is a remake of William Castle's 3-D ghost house romp. This movie opens with some real-life "ghost hunters" hunting ghosts in a wrecking yard, the ghost is very violent, lots of people die. We are then introduced into the Kriticos family, which consists of a father, his daughter and son, and their live-in nanny. Living in a cramped little apartment, they are happy when they inherit their uncle Arthur's glass-walled mansion after his death. Little do they know, Arthur was a ghost hunter, and the basement of the house contains sealed rooms that hold twelve assorted ghosts. When the family goes to see the house one evening, they meet a kooky electrician (who is actually a previous ghost hunter who worked for Arthur). And after entering the house, it seals shut, and begins to shift, hallways disappearing and changing, etc. Turns out this glass-walled "house" is a ghost machine, and as the night progresses, the ghosts below are released from their containment.This is one of those movies that is really flashy, jumpy, and loud. It uses these qualities as scare tactics, and they actually work in this film. The ghosts in the movie were scary as hell, each of them have a bit of a backstory and a name. The ghosts that freaked me out in particular were The Pilgrimess, The Angry Princess, and The Jackal. All of them were scary in their own ways, but out of them all, those ones stood out to me. The setting for the film was great, and the whole house set was magnificent - all the walls made of glass, glass floors, etc. It looked awesome, some real credit must go to the set-designers because they did a stunning job.The special effects were great as well, especially the makeup used on the unique ghosts, and it had plenty of startling action sequences. The acting was decent, good enough in the context of the movie. And the realtor's death was probably the best in the whole film, very original and gruesome. I liked how they incorporated the "glasses" theme into this movie. In the original 1960 version, you had to wear actual 3-D glasses to see the ghosts. In this movie, the characters must wear special glasses to see them. However, behind all the amazing visuals, the story suffers a little bit.Overall, "Thirteen Ghosts" is an entertaining ghost-themed horror movie. It's not necessarily scary, but it's startling on many occasions and the ghosts in the movie were really creepy and unique, I've never seen ones quite like this in a horror film. Don't expect a suspenseful mystery thriller, but if you like supernatural horror movies that are jumpy and flashy, you'll enjoy this. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern horror movies seem to be stuck in some sort of crappy evil circle. They all try the same horror effects and they all fail as miserably. I haven't even begun to jump in my chair when going to the movies for years now, and "Thir13en Ghosts" is even worse than most of it's kind.The movie begins with a nice big plot-hole as well as inexplicable irrationality from the main characters. Not a good start, even though i can't say my expectations were very high to begin with when it came to plot and coherence. Tony Shalhoub plays a man who is apparently poor but still manages to have a house-keeper (the house keeper being the extremely out-of-place rapper Rah Digga). He happens to be the nephew of a rich collector though and is given a huge inheritance. Including a house that looks like a big transparent glass cube with a machinery inside it. None of the characters forming this little family stop to think "maybe this is not a house made to live in, which would explain the machinery looking almost like the insides of a clock". Instead they all amble in immediately losing track of each other.Then the horror begins. And i don't mean that in the "good" sense where you'd actually be scared, rather in the "bad" way where the horror lies in how awful the movie is. Director Steve Beck has one idea on how to scare people and one idea only: use flashing images. And so we have an hour or so of epilepsy-inducing flashes in which people in makeup thrash about like spastics. Like that was not enough, of course these ghosts can not be seen without special glasses on. So everybody runs around with these huge 1980's style goggles with which they can see the flashing images of spastic ghosts.And the resolution finally, without giving anything away, is as disappointing as expected. And i finish watching this movie more depressed and annoyed than scared. There has to be people with more talent than Steven Beck (whoever he is?) that could make horror movies instead of him. Because this is not watchable. Reasonably gifted actors are wasted completely in these 90 minutes of crap. So please cut your losses there, don't let the movie waste your time like it wasted their talent.2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like "Thir13n Ghosts" (or whatever) very much for what it is - an triumph of art design, sound design, makeup effects, and roller-coaster plotting. No, the writing and the acting aren't going to win any awards (although I think Shaloub and Lillard are quite effective in their roles), because all the characters are cardboard cutouts who exist only to be menaced, knocked off or eviscerated. On that level, it's little more than "Friday the Thir13nth" (heh) with the ghosts standing in for Jason. But there's cereal box cardboard and then there's masonite cardboard. The actors here are pros who deliver their lines with energy and conviction and they work hard to make their roles believable and interesting. No one here sucks the way the actors in, say, "House Of The Dead" suck. No, things aren't particularly scary - or at least, not in a creepy, unsettling sense. The scares and thrills here are strictly of the "I...GOTCHA!!!!" variety, with the Bogeyman jumping out from an unexpected direction and doing something horrible to a victim. But they do exist, and some of the events carry real weight and impact (what happens to the lawyer is enough to make anyone flinch). And boy, is this movie fun to look at and listen to. The sets and the makeup are the real stars here, and loving care has obviously been lavished on each and every detail, from the Art Deco frills on the knick-knacks in the cabinets to the shattered, deformed slats on the cage around the Juggernaut's head, to the cryptic runes inscribed on the transparent shatter proof walls that slide around and trap or release people or ghosts in unpredictable ways (and in one case, slice a hapless victim in half). For all the lack of depth and originality in the plot, set designers and makeup and SFX artists must have worked themselves into comas with all the cool stuff they came up with. And the sound design (easy to overlook in a visual film like this) is the same way - layered and sophisticated and completely immersive. So in essence: Eye (and ear) candy, supported by just enough plot and acting chops to make this a movie instead of an extended MTV goth metal music video. Fans of Tony Shaloub (I'm one) or Matthew Lillard (him too) will also get enough of their participation to justify the time watching the movie. I picked it up used on DVD for $10 a three years ago, and am still happy with my purchase. I watch it for laughs for Halloween and horror oriented movie nights, and enjoy it each time. A fine movie for the horror enthusiast and completist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An adventurer-Cyrus Karist (Oscar-Winner:F.Murray Abraham) died in a car junkyard. While succeed catching a violent ghost with the help of a scared psychic (Matthew Lillard). A widower named Arthur Karist (Tony Shalhoub) inherits a mysterious see-through house from his wealthy but eccentric uncle-Cyrus. Arthur and his two children (Shannon Elizabeth an Alex Roberts) with their nanny (Rah Digga) decide to move to their new home and they are amazed with the steel, glass and elegance but soon... they are trapped in a structure unlike anything ever built.It's shifts, turns and morphs into different shaped and configuration. Arthur's uncle was devoted to capturing ghosts and the house is the phantom's prison. The house is a marvel of design with it's mysterious puzzle like box with those eerie corridors, sliding walls, spinning floors and phantasmic fiends may allow no one to escape but the family also gets helps from the inside the house from the psychic and an oculist (Embeth Davidtz) to destroy the house.Directed by Ex-Visual Effects Supervisor:Steve Beck (Ghost Ship). He made a fun, entertaining, claustrophobic but flawed supernatural thriller. Although it's lacks certain scares. But thanks to a good cast, excellent production designs, imaginative make-up effects and strong visual effects makes this surprisingly good looking horror movie. The film has a few plot holes, style over substance wins this movie over. One of the film highlights in the cinematography by Gale Tattersall (The Addams Family).This is a remake from a William Castle film from the original 3-D movie by the same name. This movie is remade from the original storyline by Robb White. The updated screenplay is by Neal Marshall Stevens and Richard D'Ovidio. This is the second remake from William Caste, the first was the trashy but creepy and enjoyable "House on Haunted Hill" (1999).The remake is produced by Gilbert Alder (Tales from the Crypt Presents:Bordello of Blood), Joel Silver (The Matrix Trilogy) and Robert Zemeckis (Contact). DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an strong- Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the director, production designer and make-up effects supervisor. The DVD Best Feature is the Ghost Files, narrated by F.Murray Abraham. Which does explain each Ghost of the film. DVD also has the behind the scenes featurette, theatrical trailer and an music video. This is not the best Ghost Thriller out there but it's a fun movie and which is fascinating to watch for the unique production designs. (****/*****).</fullReview>

I never saw the original film, but I can't believe its anything like this awful mess! I think Russ Meyer, if he were still alive, could have made a better film than this. I haven't seen that many ghost films, but these films were better: "The Shining", "Red Rose", "The Sixth Sense", "The Ring", "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", "Beetle Juice", "The Legend of Hell House", "Halloween", "The Fog".</fullReview>

Plot, anyone? If you still feel you want to see this movie, imagine someone allowing 'The Haunting' and 'Mindhunters' to mate, and having to watch all 83 minutes of their offspring. As a matter of fact, if you liked both of those, by all means watch 'Thir13en Ghosts'. But don't say I didn't warn ya!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a horrible horror film, so to ensure that I don't sound clichéd with my review, I am going to write out thir13en ways that this film could have been improved.1. Hacking somebody to bits sells a horror film, not huge boobs. While some may enjoy scenes like this, I find that it distracts from the bigger picture. One of the ghosts had "huge boobs" power, which was not very scary in my eyes. What was she going to do? Poke somebody's eye out with the enormous nipples? I don't think she would have sent anyone away in fear. I think most would just cozy in for a warm winter's nap ? because it wouldn't be the holidays if it wasn't much hooter ? hotter at the malls." 2. I don't want to sound racist, but the family seemed to be a bit mismatched. Were all the kids adopted? None of them resembled Tony Shalhoub at all. They didn't even look like their burnt mother. I was confused. They also were very disrespectful of a man that just lost his wife to fire. Everybody knows that a fire death takes anywhere from four to eight months recovery. You shouldn't rush him into normality if you can. 3. I did enjoy the cameo from the guy in the movie Se7en. It is always good when directors that randomly throw in numbers in their title to create a symbolic reference can use the same actors. Look for the guy from Se7en that ate himself to death, then look for the guy that ate himself to death in Thir13en Ghosts. I think you will be able to spot him well. 4. Matthew Lillard needs to stop working ? NOW. 5. I enjoyed this film better when the characters had names like Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston and when they battled guys like Slimer and the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man. I mean, there was nothing in this film warning people not to cross their beams. That is a warning that should have been mention. 6. For some odd reason I never saw 13 ghosts. I was counting too. I think, at the most, I saw five. I think some people in the marketing department got the ax after this film. 7. Did anyone catch the phrase "Semper Ubi Sub Ubi" written on one of the walls. Not cool. 8. Apparently, in this film, the only way to get rid of ghosts is by throwing a flare at them. Now really people, you could tell that the production team had run out of a budget after developing the glasses and had to resort to flare throwing as a battle weapon. These ghosts needed to realize that they were already DEAD, flares wouldn't hurt them. See, never forget the rules. Train your ghost first, then let him terrorize. 9. Have your ghosts work for you. This was a very common problem in this film. The ghosts were not working for anyone. If you have 13 spirits that need employment, do not allow them to just sit around and sulk. Get working or get out. Kriticos must have been a softy in the workforce because these spirits did not listen to anything or follow any directions. Ghosts need discipline just like you and I. 10. Matthew Lillard needs to stop working ? NOW.11. Can anybody explain to me what F. Murray Abraham was doing in this film? This man is an Oscar winner and he is forced to do work like this? I have no hope for Hollywood. 12. Glasshouses need consistency. This film did not, and the first reason why is because the bathroom was not made of glass (unlike the rest of the house). Consistency. Learn this and you may have mastered the ways of the horror genre. 13. (Nothing?. There were not 13 ghosts so why should I have to worry about 13 points? Riddle me that bucko!)Overall, this was a horrible film that somehow needed to be watched just once than forgotten about for the remaining days of my existence. Skip it, and you will die a very happy person. Watch it ? and you may become one of the (DUM DAH DAH?.) Thir13en Ghosts.Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With some movies, it's obvious that the producers put most of the budget in the special effects, others put into landing big stars, a few actually spend money to come up with a worthwhile story (though not as many as there should be). With 13 Ghosts, it appears the lionshare of the money was spent on building an incredible set, and then that's as far as it goes. This film proves that sometimes, bad things happen to good people. Shannon Elizabeth was hot, she was THE actress in 2001 after the success of the American Pie movies, and Tony Shalhoub won an Emmy for his acting in Monk, but this movie is a blemish on their resumes. The story has something to do with a house that may or may not be a portal to Hell or something to do with Satan that comes into possession of Shalhoub and his family, his daughter is Elizabeth. The movie is a series of scary chases with ghosts, a melodrama with a dead mother, and Shining-like gross nudity. The plot and the characters will make you wish you were elsewhere, possibly the house that is the center to the story. It is really neat looking, a wonderful looking set, a house filled with glass doors that separate wide open rooms into smaller compartments, it is the lone success of the movie. By the end, the film is boring and I didn't really care what happened to everyone. This reminds me of what has happened to the horror genre, nowadays it's not scary to build up to suspense, but rather film makers thinks scary is non-stop blood and gore, lots of quick hits of action. Gone are the days of Hitchcock where terror came from surprises after some slow pacing setting up the payoff. Why? I guess people don't have the attention span to stay with such films, but after seeing 13 Ghosts, I long for something like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller only for those easily thrilled...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike a psychological thriller that is well-written, freaky, and thought provoking (ex. The Sixth Sense), this movie was cliché, poorly written, and had numerous plot holes. Actually, it didn't seem like there was much of a plot at all. Syrus, was a 1 dimensional character, almost a cartoon, and very out of place with the modern day family. And while the special effects were cool at times, (in my opinion) special effects do not make a movie. Trapped in one house for the majority of the movie could have provided a very creative opportunity for the writers and directors, however it was not taken advantage of. The actions were all repetitive...yes, we understand that ghosts can't get through glass with spells written on them, and yes, we see that the ghosts (for some unknown reason) are very violent towards the family...no need to spend 2 hours reviewing! If you want to see a horror movie that takes advantage of being in one house the whole movie that isn't a waste of time I recommend the Shining (although I have to admit that the book was better...it always is). Otherwise...save your money...this is only a "thriller" to those easily thrilled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, much has been said dissecting this film. To be honest, the film doesn't deserve even that kind of commitment. Made by Miss Castle, daughter of William Castle, as a "remake" of his original 13 Ghosts, Thirteen Ghosts is in no way a remake. Now, I wasn't expecting too much. I had seen her remake of House on Haunted Hill. It was fun, a bit too gory, yet entertaining. This film has entertaining moments but really is just ridiculous. I liked the glass house. I liked the glasses. Even the story about all the different types of ghosts needed was innovative and interesting. But how about all those pitiful CGI special effects, particularly at the end. The ghosts themselves were, with a couple exceptions, very unconvincing. And the dialogue in the movie ranks right up there with any Rambo film with an endless stream of one-liners. Most of which were not amusing. The acting didn't fare much better. Tony Shaloub did an okay job with THIS material. F. Murray Abraham adds class to whatever dreck he appears in. But everyone else? C'mmm - acting school ended too quickly for most of the other cast members. There were a few shocks here and there, but I just question the need to glorify all the blood and guts aspects of these films, which by the way were not in the original sources at all. I know making money rather than art is the primary factor at work, but sometimes you can try and do both. If Miss Castle is looking in - try and move back toward House on Haunted Hill and then tone that down a bit. That will make for a nice formula. This film I think just went to far in the wrong direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But that's modern horror for you. I didn't expect anything else when I took this off the shelf.The cast was small, which is good. Too often movies like this have way too many personalities on screen at once and almost all of them are stereotypes. But why must every movie have an annoying little know it all kid?The "horror" in the film consisted mostly of grotesque images flashed at the audience, which might have been effective it wasn't used throughout the entire movie. But other than these cheap tacky tricks (reminded me of Event Horizon) there were really no scares or suspense to speak of.I mean, they tried to make a good story, but once you involve stupid supernatural elements you're really going to be hard pressed. I'd personally like to see more horror movies which don't feature anything other worldly at all, but those can be hard to do.Acting deserves no mention, come on, this is a cheap horror exploitation flick. Overall though, it offers nothing new to the genre and and is even lacking in appeal through its use of well used horror themes.The ending too was completely out of place. I'm not talking about the dumb climax, but the very last bit of the movie where the up until then pretty normal acting black nanny burts into a stream of stupid ebonics and then the credits start to roll with accompanying rap music. It was completely inappropriate.Nevertheless, movies like this have a place in the market. There's bucketloads of crap out there and it's not as though 90 minutes is more time than you can afford to waste. Bad movies have their own entertainment value and what's more they don't require you to think at all nor do they (or at least, should they) take themselves seriously. They are perfect time killers.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5/10 ***/5 ~ Slick thrill-ride is visually dazzling but just no fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like their House on Haunted Hill (1999), Dark Castle Entertainment's remake of William Castle's 13 Ghosts (1960) plays as a grade-B cash-in on the misguided new version of The Haunting (1999), emphasizing dazzling visuals, imaginative production design and obligatory CGI effects over good old-fashioned spookery. Thir13en Ghosts (2001) has none of the charm or chills of Castle's family-friendly Halloween favorite, and the original's mild subversiveness as an Ozzie-and-Harriet ghost story is lost in the imposition of a nasty, nihilistic tone. The keynote is excess, with an overkill of self-canceling thrills. Master showman Castle, were he alive today, would no doubt have exploited gore and technical effects for all they are worth, but with the restraint necessary to allow the big moments to stand out. Castle would have known when to stop, but this version can't trust itself to entertain and wears out its welcome fast. It just isn't any fun, although some of the old Castle humor is present in amusing performances by Matthew Lillard, as a professional ghost-buster, and Rah Diggs, as a comic domestic so un-PC as to raise the specter of Mantan Moreland. But the comic material is less funny than cynically clever and self-congratulatory. Little of Robb White's original story remains, except the situation of a haunted house being inherited by an average All-American family (here an average All-Greco-American family with average All-African-American nanny), and the point-of-view is no longer that of the little boy. As dead Uncle Cyrus (White's reference to the Old Dark House classic The Cat and the Canary), F. Murray Abraham blesses the film with the kind of juicy, campy presence Vincent Price gave to Castle's House on Haunted Hill (1958) and The Tingler (1959) and which was the essential ingredient missing from the bland original.Yet the shabby little haunted house of Castle's 13 Ghosts had a warm soul, while this one's dazzling glass mansion-of-the-damned is cold and empty for all its state-of-the-art shocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just don't set you expectations for this movie too high or else you'll end up disappointed. "Thir13en Ghosts" is not a new "Aliens", "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Halloween", but nevertheless the movie is entertaining and good in it's very own way.The movie tries very hard to created an "Aliens" like atmosphere but it never even comes close to it. It never becomes really scary and it lacks tension.The acting is OK and the characters are fine with the exception of a few needless characters that just don't add enough to the story. Some of the plot twists are pointless and the movie lacks a good final.The make-up however is fantastic, especially for the 13 ghosts. The special effects are nice too and only used when really needed which is a positive thing. The movie has a good quick pace and some nice camera-work.The concept is good: A man and his family are trapped in a glass house with ghosts in it. However the execution of it could and should have been better.But nevertheless it's a entertaining movie and well worth the 90 minutes of your time. Like I said before: Just don't set you expectations too high.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest ghost story ever told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the closing credits came up for this film I was hard pushed to find where the 91 mins had actually gone. An extremely weak plot surrounding a family that has allegedly gone through the massive loss of losing the mother and wife of Arther Criticus (Shalhoub) and his two children. The children seem mis-cast with Shannon Elizabeth as an older sister to Alec Roberts who looks 20 years her junior and their appearance during the film is somewhat brief with them both dissapearing with no explanation for most of the second half of the film, only to reappear together trapped in the giant gyroscope of the machine. These factors didn't get me on the families side, so it was hard to feel scared for them when they were being chased by the 12 ghosts. The machine / house although very well designed had a similar feel to that of the Cube in the film of the same name, but only 10% of the suspense. On the plus side, the effects and general look and feel of the film were well done, its a shame the edit seemed to lose any suspense, tension, fear and story that may have existed when this film was devised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ranks as one of the four movies I simply walked out of. The only redeeming quality was the house, which was not only freaky as could be but actually original, with all the sliding doors making the building change shape and corridors and pathways appear and disappear. Beyond that the story was incomprehensible, as even the opening scenes made no sense, and how the ghosts got to be the way they were was never explained.Most of the movie was your typical haunted house deal, with a bunch of blithering idiots doing the most stupid things possible as they run around corner after corner (accompanied by loud music to accentuate EVERY TURN. LOOK, THE LITTLE KID'S TURNING A CORNER! LOOK, HE'S TURNING ANOTHER!)I think it says a lot about the lack of tension generated when the movie's in full gear and my only question is how in hell a destitute Tony Shalhoub can afford a maid.Maybe the movie had some sudden redeeming turn in the last half hour, I'll never know as I put this one on the "blot from existance of my mind" category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glitzy Remake of 1960 William Castle "Classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thirteen Ghosts" was originally made by the legendary William Castle in 1960. Castle was known for promoting his films with gimmicks to draw in the customers. For his "Thirteen Ghosts", 3-D glasses were handed out to patrons to enable them to see the ghosts on screen. For 2001, the story has been updated to the present. Instead of the usual old dark house we have an all glass mansion that looks more like an amusement park attraction than a haunted house. Instead of the customers having to wear glasses to view the ghosts, the film's characters don the special glasses so that THEY can see the ghosts. The story involves excentric millionaire Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) dying and leaving said house to nephew Arthur (Tony Shaloub). Arthur and his two children (Shannon Elizabeth, Alec Roberts) along with their talkative "maid" Rah Digga take possession of the house. Inside, with the help of Kriticos former assistant Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard) they discover that the house has twelve frightening spirits imprisoned in the basement. One by one they are being released. Why?  With special glasses the humans are able to see the spirits, one of which is Arthur's dead wife. Along comes the mysterious Kalina (Embeth Davidtz) who explains that the ghosts are an the keys to Uncle Cyrus' plan to open the gates of hell. But to complete the rite, a thirteenth ghost, a living person, is needed. But who will it be? Is Kalina really what she seems to be? Is Uncle Cyrus really dead? Are the ghosts real? The performances by Shaloub, Abraham and Digga stand out from the rest. The ghosts are not computer generated but are real actors in frightening makeup that do provide some genuine scares. If you watch the DVD, there is an interesting featurette where Uncle Cyrus gives some background to each of the ghosts along with his reasons for choosing them for his "project". There is also another featurette that shows some of the actors playing the ghosts being made up for their roles. The best of the elaborate computer generated effects has to be the machine that controls the house. All in all this film is quite enjoyable and yes a little scary.</fullReview>

However, the very act of having to sit through this entire movie will be what's giving me nightmares from now on! Emblematic of what happens when Hollywood has too much time and money to blow, this was simply a waste of people's time and money. Rife with stereotypes (get the black woman always being hip with the mixing even amidst the 'gore', or the 'high school quarterback's story) that bordered on the comical and farcical, it's hard to think that this wasn't satire or some other horrible joke.

Films are supposed to have plot, development and characterization, otherwise why should one lose time and not visit the nearest roller coaster playground instead? One - admittedly very impressive- set and some clever directing ideas (the camera zooming through the special glasses in the bathroom scene) do not make up for over-acting, pointless screaming, confusing plot lines and -the greatest fault- uncertainty of tone which blow the film to smithereens. And why may i ask are the main characters of Greek descent? Is there a hint somewhere i am missing? Do the screenwriters know or was the name thrown in to give a touch of exoticism and ancient mystery? Pity for the probable good intentions.</fullReview>

Horror film with a lot of mumbo jumbo, little logic, and an almost incoherent script. Shannon Elizabeth and Embeth Davidtz are wasted. Tony Shalhoub miscast. F. Murray Abraham is impressive in a solid, chilling performance. However, Rah Digga steals the film from that big of a cast in a funny performance. Only other saving grace is the handsome looking production design, good sound effects, and terrifying special effects.Rated R; Graphic Violence, Nudity, and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, disturbing, fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its rare to see a horror movie nowadays that manages to both creep you out and keep a solid plot. 13 Ghosts has succeeded in doing this, and while some of the acting may seem a little overdone (Mathew Lillard), overall the film was a great remake to a classic film.As much as I love classic horror movies, the old black and white films with bad visual effects is only entertaining the first time through. thats how I felt towards William Castle's original 13 Ghosts, it was great for his time, and fun to watch once, but not again. Now that Dark Castle has revived the old experience with better visual effects, cool storyline twists, a cast of awsome ghosts (as well as the creative idea for the glasses), and a cool 1 location set, I really found I appreciated the movie better. Sure you may think at first that the glass house is a stupid idea, but honestly, its pretty brilliant. Not only has it never been done, but its succeeded in doing it. To make things interesting, strange latin (or something) is carved on the glass as containment spells to keep the ghosts from just walking about. And while the body count for such a small place may seem a little low, the thrills and effects make up for it.Still, the greatest thing about the movie is the ghosts themselves. They are as follows: The Angry Princess, The Bound Woman, The First Born Son, The Great Child, The Torso, The Hammer, The Jackal, The Juggernaut, The Dire Mother, The Pilgrimess, The Withered Lover, and The Torn Prince. These are the ACTUAL stars of the film, and they do a great job at being freaky. I just could help but be creeped out by The Jackal and disturbed by the Angry Princess, and while some of the ghosts werent shown as much as others (Pilgrimess, Torso), what was shown of them was pretty cool.So watch the movie, and judge it for yourself, but in my eyes, it was a blast. Dont miss out on this great remake.</fullReview>

The ghosts were the most realistic and scary component of the movie, if I had been younger the nightmares would have started the minute I saw the juggernaut. The pace was fast moving, it was interesting and there were a mile a minutes thrills. The DVD features are great, giving each ghost an individual back story.The ending was a bit corny and could have used work but it generally flowed with the story. I loved Matthew Lillard and thought he dawned the psychic well, I could feel his tension at all times. The father, Arthur was also good I thought.

		<fullReview>I was actually very impressed by this ghost movie. The acting was pretty good, the special effects were great (of course), and it was scary. Was it better than Spider-Man. Definitely not, but it was definitely worth seeing. Matthew Lillard as the electrics guy/psychic was very convincing at his portrayal of physically damaging disturbing thoughts, that is whenever he was attacked by a disturbing thought of a ghost or of someone's past, it looked like he had been physically attacked. Anway, it had a pretty good cast (Shannon Elizabeth is definitely hot) and Tony Shaloub is great as the widowed father. There are two scenes in the movie which are graphically disturbing, so viewers beware. At one scene, the idiotic lawyer is cut in half by a door and then later on, a woman is crushed between two walls of glass. Except for those two scenes, there weren't many "gory" parts, rather many appearances by the ghosts, which are pretty scary. Overall, I thought this was definitely a well done flick.</fullReview>

How can you not like it?!!! This is the greatest horror movie of all time!!! And people who say "Oh, the older one was better! it wasn't based on special effects and blood." well, the 2 different 13 Ghosts are in different genres. the fist one was kinda thriller ness [for 1960]. the 2001 version is pure horror. so, in conclusion, this is the best horror movie ever. and in conclusion. if you ask if you won't be creeped after seeing it, i'll just say "I guarantee nothing."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I would like to clear, that I saw this movie only, and only because of a mistake. And what an error.I was already waiting for the worst, but for my surprise the film actually started getting better than I thought. I couldn't stop noticing the pathetic screenplay and lame performances by the actors as the cast itself, a horrible direction and as worst, an extremely predictable and cliché sequence of events.But I just tried harder and finally got open my eyes to see it. By time the climax started approaching, I really started changing my posture, and It really got me awake -since I was only not sleeping because of the constant and systematic ghost-strikes-.But when I was just about to declare it acceptable, the worst came. It was just so clear that they had run out of budget, and just ended it up. Things got messy and simplified, the end was already known 15 minutes before, the story became worst than ever, and everything started rushing in a brute manner. The prohibited romance, the return of the nanny, the heroic father as the noble siquic are just a few examples of this.I can only admit with shame that it has a really outstanding sound edition, since I was asleep most of the film. It does not scare, kill time or even distract you. In other words it because of movies like this that not only give terror gets the crapy fame, but make you avoid theaters for weeks...By the way, if you are just going for the chick, you better rent American Pie again and save a few bucks.</fullReview>

The plot has so many holes in it you have to wonder what ended up on the cutting room floor. Speaking of the cutting room floor what was with all of those quick jump cuts? There was no purpose! My theory is that they had to cut quickly so the audience couldn't tell how poorly the make-up effects were done on the ghosts. And finally, I have to mention the end. Why, oh why, did the black housekeeper make a little hip-hop beat out of the ancient satanic chant? Why would she do it, did she see a purpose in it? It looked to me like she was mindlessly fumbling around with the controls, but then out came this nice sounding record scratch, and not even on a record. It was a reel-to-reel! I bursted out laughing so hard, I missed the following few lines.There is now other way to describe this than TERRIBLE. Un-Godly flawed on completely TERRIBLE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard so many bad things about this movie, but having seen it, I think it succeeds on the levels to which the filmmakers were aspiring. It's scary, it's creepy, and it's actually touching in parts. So many reviewers had a low opinion of this film, and maybe it "worked" on me because I saw it in my home at 2am with the lights out. And actually I thought the DVD feature where they tell you about the lives and deaths of the ghosts was thoroughly creepy. In fact I had to put on NCAA basketball to get de-creeped. I loved the makeup, it had a good story, good acting, good directing, a great house (as a major character), pretty good pacing, and neat special effects. I really did like this movie and was expecting to just hate it. The only thing that sneaks in to make it a little more like the formulaic horror movies of our day is the Rah Digga babysitter character, who interjects retarded lines like "Man, I'm gonna die with 3 white people," "I need a pay raise," and "That's it, I can't take it anymore, I quit!" when faced with the ghosts. I don't think Rah Digga did a bad job, but I think her character was even sort of unnecessary. Every function her character performed could have been achieved with some other character. Like I said, she's not a bad actress and did what she could. But that character is the one major flaw in the movie. She even steals away the last shot in the movie--don't worry, no spoiler--which should have been left for the more sentimental part of the movie. I would have thought that would have been more satisfying than seeing her wandering around shouting. Other than that character, the rest of the movie was not only not as bad as I thought, but actually a real standout in the horror movies I've seen in the last few years. I haven't seen one that really scared the crap out of me in quite a while either! I think Thirteen Ghosts just really exceeds expectations on all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is my favorite genre of movie and I pride myself on having seen many a flick but rarely would I actually consider a horror movie "scary"...until this one. After watching it the first time I was creeped out, then the second time I realized it's not just creepy, it's downright frightening.13 Ghosts has all of the elements of a, dare I say, perfect horror movie. It's got the blood and gore, the tragedy, the suspense, a madman (or 2 or 3 or 4), great dialogue (though Shannon Elizabeth's character was given a few really corney lines), humor, and scenes that will stay in your head for days. It's the kind of movie that leaves you just a little freaked out to be in the dark alone.Wonderful cast. Matthew Lillard gave a very impressive performance and made me feel like the role was made just for him. He creates some good moments of comic relief, if even for a moment.Above all else with this movie, I am in praise of the premise and set of this movie. Very original idea (even though it's a remake) and you can tell that the set designer worked REALLY hard on this flick. And it paid off. I only wish this movie got more attention when it was out in theaters. I think this is one of the best horror flicks ever made...at least in my opinion.</fullReview>

Mathew Lillard seems to be a promising actor but he just keeps taking these amazingly stupid roles, he should stick more to his SLC Punk days.

		<shortDescription>Easily the Worst Movie of the New Millennium (In a bad way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily the worst movie of 2000-2001!This movie made money, and it's really sad because it's from the producers of House on Haunted Hill and The Haunting. Complete and utter crap filled with suicide-inducing cliche's of characters, dialogue, gags, and plot devices. It's obvious that this is an outcast movie from Hollywood and I hope it's the last of this sleuth of crap.Stereotyping of African Americans takes place in this 'film' as well, as the black NANNY, who has many cliche' oneliners in the film that makes me hate the lowlife 'actress' for selling out on her own race. She actually had the last brutally insulting line of the film.Everything in this movie is stupid, stupid, stupid. Why did I waste the time to write this critique? I hated the movie that much and had to vent. Why didn't I stop watching? You got me. I was bored. I wrote bad at the top because it's not funny 'this movie is terrible!' bad, yet 'this is a sad piece of evidence that Hollywood spends money on unqualified writers/directors' bad.DON'T SEE IT, LET ALONE BUY IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where on earth can I start? This is without doubt the worst film I have seen this year, to be honest I would go as far as to say it could make it into my top ten worst films of all time. About as suspenseful as Scary Movie and as chilling as Casper, Thir13en Ghosts (which genius thought of spelling the title like that?) deserves absolutely no credit whatsoever. I have never seen such appalling acting in a theatrical release, the cast shares the combined talent of a porn star. NOTE - Some minor spoilers may pop up here and there from now on. Shannon Elizabeth deserves an extra mention for such superior dialogue like "This place is awesome!... It's beautiful!... My own bathroom!" and sure enough "It's beautiful!" again. For the love of God Shannon, take some bloody acting lessons!!! More fab dialogue comes from the Dad, who upon seeing a book on a table exclaims with as much enthusiasm as Steven Seagal "What a wealth of knowledge". The virtually non-existent plot devotes no time to character development or back stories for the main characters so we feel little emotion for them, who incidentally seem to be so unbelievably stupid you end up rooting for the ghosts instead. This brings me to my next point - the make up. Again, this fails on every level. Most of the ghosts look like bad actors in those cheap rubber horror masks you buy at the hardware store for ?5 with plastic knives and spikes sticking out of them. The most prominently featured one - a naked girl - simply has a truckload of black eye shadow plastered around her eyes and two huge 'gashes' over her breasts, which actually looks like two lines of red lipstick. There is no logic to the film, no real plot, in fact the whole thing made me ask myself "What in God's name was the point of this?". I can tell that I'm losing it now, the thought of last Friday night just makes my skin crawl.Despite the film being horrifically bad in general, it had a few good aspects. For example - SPOILER - the awesome dissection of the salesman. Now that's good 'ol fashioned gore!!! Special mention should also go to the set, which is actually fantastic. However, a mind-blowing set does not a good movie make, so take my advise: avoid this film. At all costs. Please. I beg you. If Satan were ever to disguise himself as a roll of celluloid, this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great remake with fantastic effects!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With films like Thir13en Ghosts and house on haunted hill, you don't take into consideration the storyline....cos you know its basically not gonna have one....and this film excepts it. Its not going to win any awards of course but it was extremely entertaining through the aid of some individual acting performances and superb special effects.The film is about Cyrus Kriticos (Abraham) who imprisions the souls of various ghosts in his fantastically crafted glass 'haunted' house. The ghosts are used to power some sort of machine that will eventually open a gateway to great demonic powers. He dies during the capture of the last ghost and passes on the ownership of his house to his nephew Arthur Kriticos (Shalhoub) and his two children, the oldest being the incredibly sexy Shannon Elizabeth.Then here comes your typical plot, ghosts escape from their captivity and terrorise the family and the 2 scientists that sneeked into the house. Although the movie was predictable, i found it very enjoyable with one or two really jumpy scenes assisted by the wonderful special effects that were used throughout the whole movie.Matthew Lillard who played Dennis Rafkin in the movie did a great job portraying the crazy psychic ghostbuster. He was the only character in the film that i felt played the part really well. Embeth Davidtz, Shannon Elizabeth and Tony Shalhoub were all below par in there roles leaving Murray Abraham with not enough screen time!The ghosts themselves looked fantastic and created a great deal of tension through each individual scene that they were in. The only serious complaint that i have with the overall movie is that the ending was rushed and gave no real satisfaction to a really good hour and something to the movie.But anyway this will be brill on DVD and i will probably buy it knowing my taste. I gave the movie an 7. Recommended to those fans of House on Haunted hill!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it, really brilliant horror movies have lately been a rare thing. Well not anymore. I went to see this movie "13 Ghosts" with no expectations-other than to be a bit scared, a bit entertained and a bit disappointed. I was none of those. I was really scared, very entertained and very content with what I was seeing. The movie starts with an action sequence that nails you right to your seat.The rest of the movie is like a roller coaster ride in a haunted house.Ok, maybe the plot development had some little flaws. The movie explains very little, so the viewers have to make their own deductions.The director could have given some hints to the viewer and not leave us guessing in more than one occasion. What ever disturbed me (gaps in the plot) was soon forgot as the movie played on. 13 Ghosts has the nastiest looking ghosts I've seen in a long time. The special effects were excellent and the whole house was created beautifully. Good actors can make any less than brilliant movie seem brilliant, and that was the case with this movie too. Matthew Lillard has his own style of acting, that sometimes is more irritating than good, but here he fits in like a shoe. The rest of the cast was also brilliant (F.Murray Abraham is always good). It's been a long time since I ran home from the movies and was scared to death in a dark hallway. I did both after seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those movies that really surprise you when you view it. I thought that maybe it was going to be only about ghosts and how they haunt the house but you really need to think about it. You really have to think about why there are 13 ghosts involved and why the doors have those inscriptions. They were very creative in this movie because I don't think that there has been anything really like it. All of the ghosts that they made were very realistic and scary. The make-up artists for this movie did a really good job on all of the ghosts. They allowed them to have the effect to scare people. It wasn't the kind of movie where they just put it in not caring if it looked real or pleasing.When you pay close attention to the movie, you tend to get into the story too. With the whole thing about the glasses. Now that is creepy. How would you like to be going around your house wearing regular glasses and all of a sudden having an encounter with a ghost that has been living in your house? I think I would be pretty freaked out about that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warner Bros. and Dark Castle Entertainment bring us the horror film "Thir13en Ghosts", one of the many William Castle films to be updated by Dark Castle Entertainment, a company formed by producer god Joel Silver and director Robert Zemeckis. Now is it possible to make a horror film with no flaws and that keeps your eyes glued onto the screen? The answer is yes.The film keeps your attention focused on the film and nothing else. The cast gives great performances, including Shannon Elizabeth and Mathew (Scream, Scooby Doo) Lillard. All the ghosts in the film are amazingly terrifying and they look awesome, and talk about a breathtaking house, man this all glass mansion that the ghosts inhabit sure is a beauty in a horrific twisted way. Now don't get me wrong, this film is pretty gory, so teenagers and adults are fine but any kids who are under the age of thirteen, better not see this. The only other films in the year 2001 I can think of that have matched this film's grasp and nature are "From Hell", "The Others" and "Soul Survivors". Bottom Line: Do not miss this film, horror fans especially! Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror films are a weird batch, these days. Ever since "The Blair Witch Project" came out, the marketing apes in Hollywood figured out that confronting an audience with a force that they can't even see is much more effective than parading some knife-wielding munch around in a mask and making the film the longest "Scooby-Doo" episode in recorded history.But even these new "horror" movies (as opposed to formerly "slasher movies".) have also gone down the creative drain. We zoom in on an empty space and then we cut to a shot of Haley Joel Osment or Nicole Kidman looking absolutely petrified. This new breed makes their ghosts more and more cuddly to the point that we aren't scared anymore.Enter "Thirteen Ghosts," the second William Castle/Vincent Price remake since 1999. Some, or I should say many, will find this movie loud, vulgar, irritating, and stupid. I can't argue with them, but I will say this: It gives the audience what they want. This film has thirteen horrible spectres that, if you met them in real life, would cause even the bravest to douse their drawers. And they're not docile by any stretch of the imagination. They are out for blood.Imagine "The Juggernaut," who picks up his victims and breaks them in half. Or "The Hammer," who is run through with a couple dozen railroad spikes. Or even "The Torso," who's name is self-explanatory. This film isn't scary in the conventional sense, don't get me wrong. But it is intimidating, and that's saying something.*** out of four</fullReview>

"Sure" they all replied, and we were off...thirteen dollars later, I left the theatre p***ed off, and angry that I spent thirteen bucks on crap when I could have bought some nachos and a slurpee with change to spare. This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It contains some of the worst acting/ dialogue/ story/ everything that is wrong with a movie that I have ever seen. What makes me chuckle is the fact that some people considered this rubbish scary of all things. This movie is not scary. It is not spooky. It is not jumpy. People that were in the theatre that were getting scared were thirteen year old junior high kids, and they were just annoying. All of my friends agreed as well that this was one of the worst movies that they had ever seen. So, that being said, this movie is absolutely terrible. I'm saddened by the fact as well that movies like this are still being made in lieu of actually decent scary movies such as "The Others". So yeah, this movie sucks.</fullReview>

The stylishness of the house is the movie's best element. It's a fascinating house to look at, plus the special effects are good at times once the ghouls start harrassing everybody. Those two aspects makes "13 Ghosts" watchable to a point. But were treated to a mediocre script that hurts the film from being a really good one. One point of interest is the good cast that's featured. Tony Shalhoub ("Galaxy Quest"), Shannon Elizabeth ("American Pie"), Matthew Lillard ("Scream"), Embeth Davidtz ("Schindler's List"), and Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham ("Amadeus") do what they can with the silly material that they're given. Lillard comes off best as a wisecracking ghostbuster. But newcomer Rah Digga comes off worst as the family's annoying nanny. This character got on my nerves almost from the start, then tries to provide comic relief towards the end that doesn't work at all. "13 Ghosts" is a fun movie, but it could have been so much more than that. It's strange that one of the movie's producers is Robert Zemeckis. Didn't he have anything better to do than produce this goofy movie?**1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I saw this film one week agon on my USA trip I never heard about it ever, so I did not have any expectations on this movie. Some friends just said it's a new horror movie. Already after the first few minutes you are right in the middle of the - not really deep - storyline and know what the movie is about. The ride can begin. You get to see a great special effects, thrilling action and scary as hell moments in the following 90 minutes. The ghosts look really wiered but not bad, like in b-movies. The makeup and special effects are great and I don't think it is possible to sit in your seat without at least some higher heartbeat in some moments. The actors do a more less good job, altough I did not like the small boy who is just annoying. If you like horror movies and do not expect a very complex story, then go into cinema and enjoy this movie. All in all : Absolutly worth the money ( 10/10 ).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It's been a while since I've said that about what was supposed to be a scary movie. I do agree w/some of the comments made by people that didn't like this movie. The only thing that really bothered me though was the fact that they didn't let you have any background information on most of the ghosts. I think that would have made this movie a lot better, for me atleast. But, like I said...I did like it. It really freaked me out. I live in a really old house that already has a personality of its own...(it's not like it's haunted...it just has a feeling to it). Not only did I tell my friend at one point in the movie that I didn't want to watch anymore b/c I was so on edge, but, when I got home, I turned on every light in the house. Even now, over a week later, I'm still checking behind me when I leave a darkened room. Anyway... I thought the effects were great...and I think I mostly liked it b/c I was just looking to get scared...I wasn't expecting great acting or a plot w/o some holes (though I atleast wanted something better than JeepersCreepers where all I wanted to do was strangle the characters)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of ghost movies, ever since I could watch them. This movie in particular is creative and well written, Matthew Lillard (Scream, She's All That) was cleaver and extremely likable. I realize that there was a movie in 1960 with the same name and idea (I haven't seen the old one), but from the viewing the new film I really had a great time. I must admit that I wasn't really that scared (probably because I've seen a lot of ghost movies), however I was uncomfortable when the characters were separated from each other. I became intrigued with the production design and camera work (cinematography), very cool! This movie will definitely be in my home library. Executive Producer Robert Zemeckis (Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight, The Frighteners) has produced another creepy and fun ghost movie.</fullReview>

Now when i went to go see this movie i thought wow another ghost movie but it was WAY better than i thought it was going to be. The nudity in this movie isn't anything it's just some lady without a shirt on, i would let my sister,10, see it that's how harmless it is. Now try to pay attention to what the people say in it it doesn't really matter that much but it will help you understand this movie.

		<fullReview>13 GHOSTS (2001) Rating: 7/10I'll admit that I'm a sucker for ghost/haunted house movies. So, I enjoyed the hell out of this film. While it's not The Others or The Sixth Sense, it's still better than the remakes of 1999, The Haunting and House On Haunted Hill.The opening scene in the junkyard was gruesome, loud and chock-full of bloody visuals. I also liked the way they presented the opening credits. It introduces the audience to Arthur Kriticos and his family in a slow circular transition between what it once was and what it is now. Sure, the plot is unbelievable and you wonder what makes someone just get up and take their family to a house that they've just inherited from someone they barely know? Not to mention they're supposed to be poor and have numerous unpaid bills, yet they have a nanny? But, it's a horror film and they're not exactly known for their Oscar-worthy screenplays (The Others and The Sixth Sense fit into the horror genre but, to me, were more Drama then Horror). The acting isn't that bad and is a lot better then most Horror films, but the dialogue was kind of silly. But, you know what? Who cares?! This was a fun, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. The suspense was great. I felt myself clinging to my seat a few times. The visuals were stunning and the ghosts themselves are beyond awesome. My favorite ghost was The Jackal, freaky as hell with his straight jacket, caged head and gorilla-esque run, he had the pleasure of being in the most tense scenes in the film, getting himself a piece of Shannon Elizabeth and Tony Shalhoub. Pretty thrilling, I thought. The house is pretty amazing in design and function, and the few death scenes are extraordinarily vivid and grotesque (to my delight) ;).I really enjoyed this movie, I wish it had been a bit longer, spent a little more time on the background of those incredibly angry ghosts, fleshed out the living characters just a bit more, perhaps moved just a little bit slower but then, the fast-paced frenetic energy and aural/visual stimulation of the movie is what kept my eyes glued to the screen.Overall, if you are looking for a fun movie for the sole purpose of entertainment, give 13 Ghosts a shot. It's pretty suspenseful and the ghosts are awesome. Just remember to leave your brain at the door, as the story does not require you to have one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Ghosts is definitely a movie for those of you who like the cheesy horror slasher genre. The ghosts themselves are beyond awesome, the house is amazing in design and function, and the few death scenes are extraordinarily vivid and grotesque (to my delight). The acting is also fairly decent for a movie of this type. Matthew Lillard stands out with a character that, despite having his trademark goofy voice, is rather endearing. I'd recommend this movie for the special effects alone. I have three complaints about the movie, however. Number 1 - for a slasher movie, not enough people die. In my opinion, when more people survive than die, it is not a true horror film. Number two - Shannon Elizabeth is stupid and she doesn't die!!! Number 3 - the last half an hour of the movie completely devalued the first hour and a half. In short, the ending sucked. So I'd recommend you rent this movie, watch it up until the stupid part where Lillard and the WINGS dude are absurdly carrying around a wall from one of the rooms, and then turn the movie off. Because it all goes downhill from there. It's not a bad horror flick, but it could have been a pretty good one had the producers not spent all the money on special effects and let the plot lag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Ghosts Steal Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of ghost movies, especially the original 13 Ghosts, but this movie is a remake in name only as it has barely anything in common with the original. This movie is pretty much creativity unleashed with a lot of unneceassary gore and nudity tossed in with a lot of overdone special effects. The junkyard scenes are pretty much a rip-off of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. The script and plot are over the top, but it is bogged down with a lot of phony and nonsensical occult mishmash.The paranormal idiosyncrasies in this movie are amusing, but no where as scary as the anxiety of a real haunted house. The ghosts are interesting but farfetched writer's fantasies, but at least the house is an interesting architectual curiosity to make it one of the stars. Tony Shalhoub shines in his first appearance as a dad as Matthew Lillard gets his ghost training in before doing Shaggy in Scooby Doo. Shannon Elizabeth plays straight since her irritating role in Scary Movie one. In short, I like this movie, but I could have done a lot more scary with half the budget.</fullReview>

If you saw the updated "House on Haunted Hill", it's basically a rehash of that movie in a glass house.

Avoid this movie at all costs and wait for this movie on DVD and videotape!

		<fullReview>Going into this movie, I did not know what to expect. When I heard that it was brought to us by the same people that did the dismal "House On Haunted Hill", I was a little bit skeptical about seeing it. However, I gave in and was pleasantly surprised.The story, though not really "ingenious", revolves around a recently widowed man who inherits a magnificent glass home when his eccentric uncle passes away. Together with his two children and their nanny, they travel to their new home. Unknown to them, that the home is actually a fortress designed to house captured ghosts.The special effects are fantastic...the ghosts are truly gruesome. Some might think that this film is a little bit too graphic. The only real problem I had was that the ghosts are very violent, and love to kill human victims. I never saw a ghost story where the ghosts could actually pick their victims up, and smash them into pieces. It is original, I give them that.If you are looking for a good short diversion from real life, give "13 Ghosts" a shot. Just remember to leave your brain at home, as the story does not require you to have one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though it was slightly incoherent at times, and stupid at others, it was intertaining the whole way through. And scary even. Mr. Lillard gave me one of the only comic releaves in a long time I didn't find annoying. Probably because he was also serious at times. Only the last minute or so bugged me. The ending just didn't make much sence. It seemed allot like the script writer(s) was sitting, wondering, "now how are we going to wrap this up" and then slapping the ending together because they were too lazy to go back and review the script. The acting was passable on all accounts, and the ghosts were just plain creepy. I must say though, I much prefeered the creepy part, before the plain out war; ghosts just aren't ideal for action movies, but it was pulled off fairly well in any event. 6/10. Good halloween fun.</fullReview>

Here is a movie whose directing and script-writing makes even a likable bit part player like Tony Shaloub into a hard-to-stomach star. Shaloub and the ever-irritating Matthew Lillard try hard but cannot carry the dead weight of this movie all the way to the anti-climactic ending.Not even worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1960 "13 Ghosts" was a very boring, stupid horror film. This one, while no classic, is actually quite good.A grieving widower Arthur (Tony Shalhoub), his hot daughter (Shannon Elizabeth), annoying son (Alec Roberts) and feisty black maid/cook/babysitter/whatever (Rah Digga) get trapped in an all glass house with a sort of psychic (Matthew Lilliard) and a ghost liberator (Embeth Davidtz). It was set up by the evil Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham) and he has 12 murderous ghosts in cages down in the basement. But they all get out, one by one, and go after the family.This is pretty dull stuff until they get locked in the house, the ghosts escape...then the movie REALLY gets going. The ghosts are very brutal-looking and their attacks are bloody and violent. In a nice tip of the hat to the original, people in the movie can only see the ghosts when they have special glasses on. The special effects are excellent and it has more than a few scary scenes. The plot does go out the window at the end, but I was still interested.The acting--Shalhoub is OK as the father. Davidtz is in it for the money (and her character is badly written). Lilliard goes way over the top...as always (take a few Valium bud)...seriously, can't this guy do anything but overact? Elizabeth is full of life and is viciously attacked in one scene but she's not in the movie enough. Roberts is just annoying as the kid. And F. Murray...he can play this villain role in his sleep...and he does. And Digga is funny but her character is cliché city.No masterpiece but not the disaster I was expecting. Worth seeing in a theatre with a good sound system.</fullReview>

After some blood and gore which makes the movie worthwhile in its squeamish department, we are introduced to a depressing little family that moves into a deceased uncles house. We have some scares, we have some laughs (Especially from the zany nanny Maggie) as well as some tear jerking moments. Overall, this movie was NOT a waste of time, however, it was hard to take it seriously due to the over zany antics of the nanny. I would definitely recommend this movie and watch it again.

		<fullReview>I got really bored today and this movie was on. Having never seen it before, I cautiously tuned in.This was a horrible movie and I have a horrible headache after watching it. Nothing about it is engaging, frightening or suspenseful. Every single word of spoken dialog sounds like someone repeating cue cards. It was my impression that after the fire that killed his wife, Arthur and his family were poor, barely making ends meet. How is it they have a nanny? And why? Is the daughter not old enough to keep an eye on that bratty son? Isn't he a teacher? Doesn't that kid go to school? Why wouldn't Arthur be back to watch him seeing that he generally would get out of school at the same time? You see, we haven't even gotten to the ghosts yet and already i'm rolling my eyes. The "nanny" is your typical token minority. "She's sassy!" No, she's boring and unnecessary and had nothing to do with the rest of the story.Anyhow (sigh), they inherit this weird house from an equally weird relative, upon checking it out, there's gears and glass everywhere. No one seems to think there's anything strange about this. All hell breaks loose when the ghosts are set free, and start to come after the living. Honestly, they're grotesque, but not the least bit scary...nothing they did shocked or frightened me. Unfortunately this type of mediocrity is what makes up the entire movie. I can't even blame the actors, it's the fault of bad writing and even worse directing.What throws me off is that a good chunk of the actors have all been in GREAT movies and have the ability to morph into a role when properly led. F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus), Tony Shalhoub (Men in Black, Monk), Embeth Davidtz (Army of Darkness, Fracture), Matthew Lillard (SLC Punk, Scream), Shannon Elizabeth (Tomcats (yes even THAT was better than this movie)). It's like decades of wasted talent! This is an utter waste of time with no redemption what so ever. You want to see a scary movie that will really disturb you? Try "The Hills Have Eyes", or "Silent Hill". I give this a "2" because of my respect for these actors and seeing them in much better roles, and because of the make up and prosthetics done on the ghosts which actually looked real (not scary, just real).</fullReview>

Maybe there's nothing particularly special about a visual effects-laden movie in which a family inherits a haunted house, but the movie definitely has its moments, namely when the lawyer "splits". Tony Shalhoub, Embeth Davidtz, Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth, Alec Roberts, Rah Digga and F. Murray Abraham are all able to turn in neat performances, even if the whole movie is pretty outlandish. I would recommend the original version more, but this one isn't bad.

Arthur, who lost his wife in a tragic house fire 6 months earlier, is now a bitter, heartbroken mess of a man, living with his two children and a sassy au pair in a small apartment. The family is ecstatic when they are informed by a creepy lawyer that they have inherited Cyrus's grandiose estate and immediately make the several hour drive out into the remote countryside to see their new home. The house, made entirely of sound and shatterproof glass, seems like a dream come true...at least until Dennis Rafkin, a tweaky psychic filled with dire warnings, shows up and passionately advises Arthur to get out and take his family with him. But it's too late. The house is actually a giant machine designed by Satan and built by Cyrus for the sole purpose of opening the "Eye Of Hell" and it seals itself shut, trapping everyone inside and releasing the 13 ghosts imprisoned in the basement from their enspelled holding cells. The ghosts are now onthe hunt, determined to kill anyone who crosses their path.First, the good points, few though they may be. The ghosts are pretty cool looking. The Jackal in particular is impressive with his steel cage headgear and his rabid temper. The girl ghost too was sufficiently freaky looking. The house itself is a cool set, filled with some really nifty looking mechanisms. And that's where the cool stuff ends.The performances in this film are excruciatingly bad, and the script is so abysmally idiotic that it hurt. Matthew Lillard is by far the only character I gave a damn about; his twitchy, geeky psychic was oddly likable. And poor F. Murray Abraham...he really deserves better roles than this. The rest of the family is so freaking annoying that I was looking forward to seeing them all get killed in many painful and horrible ways. After five full minutes of listening to the cast scream: "Bobby!" over and over, I developed a pounding migraine. The gore is minimal but halfway decent when it appears, i.e. the "split" scene. But the film gets really tedious really fast as characters spend much of their time running down glass corridors, screaming their heads off and stupidly pausing to look through their spectral welding glasses at the ghosts, who are given ample time to close the distance between themselves and their brain dead victims.A very bad, stupid, lifeless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not for the weak at heart, and not for reasons that you would relate to a 'horror' film. The film is an atrocious blend of poor poor acting and a poor poor plot. There is no spark in the film at all, crackling along to its under-par and un-horror movie like ending (what ever happened to classic horror films, why in this day of age do we have a machine powering a house which powers the ghosts)There was one bright spark in this film, and that was having the "lanky guy out of Scream" in it. I wanted to turn over from the first ten minutes or so, but managed to see it through.Also, in general, what has happened to horror these days. Film makers used to churn out brilliant films week in week out (The Excorcist and Don't Look Now in the same year tells the story). Now-a-days all they can muster is watered down (so it can get a 12A rating), flimsy stories about a family who move to a house in a wood which has been dead for years and the thing in the trees chases them for a bit until they shoot it !!!! SHOOT A GHOST !!!! SHOOT ME IF YOU LIKE !!!Well I hope I've avoided offending anyone in this report, but the fact that horror in general is on its last legs and ready to die off completely can not be ignored. Bring back NICHOLAS ROEGI give this 'thing' 1 out of 10. I have to say its a shame they don't do a 0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted remakes usually suck but this had enough gore and split tale innovations that made it quite entertaining. The acting was a bit shaky but not everyone can be a Julia Adams (The Creature From The Black Lagoon)&gt; You had a few scenes that make you jump. Okay killing sequences, and some twists make it a good entertaining horror flick. Tony Shalhoub would not have been even in my top 20 to play the father of the family that is suppost to move in but I'm not sure who I would have put in his place but definitely NOT him. F. Murray Abraham has delivered a great performance and well Shannon Elizabeth .......well enough said. Mathew Lillard does a wonderful job as usual we can expect great things from him. There are a few lines that are real shaky that make you think "How Dumb for them to say that" BUT its a good film to watch for an evening of suspense and a little gore check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special at all and will only appeal to undemanding genre fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cyrus Kriticos is eccentric at best and has squandered most of his fortune collecting as many unique things as he can. His most recent project is collecting ghosts and, sadly, it is the 12th ghost in his collection that leads to his own death. Totally unaware of this, widower Arthur Kriticos and his family are informed that they are the sole heirs of Cyrus' home and what remains of his estate. Excited, they go to visit their new property on a stormy night and encounter Dennis Rafkin, who tells them about his work catching ghosts with their uncle ? ghosts that are sealed in the basement. However, he tells them too late and the house seals itself and the ghosts are released.Although I'd like to think of myself as a true man's man, in reality I'm not a big fan of gore and horrors that have unsettling images (ie quick cuts or static creepy figures) do actually creep me out. I was a bit worried that I would be freaked out by the film I decided to give it a go anyway since that is the aim of the film. After some creepy moments in the opening 20 minutes though the film settles down into a pattern of clichés and make-up that is sadly lacking in real scares. The story is just a series of chases on the way to a couple of stupid twists and I did want to be gripped by it but instead I was merely put off by large sections of it; the gore is unpleasant but it is not scary ? but then even if you want gore you'll probably find this film to be a bit on the tame side. Without scares the clichés stand out for all to see and the material was all rather flat and, by the end of the film I was as far from the edge of my seat as I could have been and I honestly didn't care who lived or died.The cast list hadn't filled me with hope for a great film anyway, given that it contained quite a few names that are hardly synonymous with fine acting but with the genre then it doesn't seem to matter. Shalhoub is OK but cannot raise the material. Lillard is his usual self and, if you like that then fine, personally I don't like him very much and didn't change my opinion with this performance. Elizabeth is eye-candy and she makes no real impression; Rah Digga is the obligatory black presence and her performance is just the usual stuff. Abraham takes the money and trades his reputation in with this film. The ghosts are all so-so, nice make-up but few of them have any real scare presence and their initial impact was quickly lost.Overall fans of the genre may like this but basically it is just par for the course for modern horror movies, relying on gore and effects to do the job rather than developing the tension or chills. The cast do nothing special at all and, by the time it all ends the film has become a distinctly average affair with nothing special to really recommend it for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 13 Ghosts was silly but never tried to take itself seriously. This one THINKS it's being great...it isn't. Acting wise you have Tony Shalhoub...then everyone else. The house design may be brilliant but it only does one thing; keep any semblance of a story or character development from happening. This movie is about the house...not the family who inherits it, and that's the BIG mistake. Once agaom a director thinks MORE blood means scarier moments...MORE of 'I'll show the audience everything' mean more fright. W R O N G! A thousand times wrong. Every human has the potential to create more fear with their imagination than with any 'in your face' effects. This seems to have been forgotten by all but a few directors AND, unfortunately, embraced by people who WANT everything done for them, thereby dulling their imaginations...possible destroying them forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have much to say about this movie other than it was one of the worst films ever put before mankind. It never ceases to amaze me how studios that have extremely deep pockets allow something this atrocious to be made. The studio executives would have been better off throwing their $20 million in a fire pit because it would have been much more worthwhile than spending it on making this film. The best actors in the movie are actually the ghosts themselves, which are pretty hard roles to screw up considering that a lot CGI was involved I'd imagine. The only single positive element to come from this crime of a movie are the rather impressive set pieces. So if you have dreams of one day being a set designer maybe you would want to watch this thing and know how to make good sets for future GOOD films, otherwise avoid this trash at all costs. This is the kind of movie that has the ability to make people depressed after viewing it because they feel as though they have wasted a valuable chunk of their life when they could have been doing something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thirteen Ghosts has a stupid plot, is poorly acted and has some cheesy as hell dialogue. But, hopefully, you already expect this. But this movie could have been a little bit scary, or at the very least fun. But it's not. First, let's get the good points of the movie out of the way. This won't take long. The movie's major pull is the gore. And it has some gore that is inspired. Blood and death. Not enough to make it worth the 90 minutes, however, but there are some nice moments. Also, the premise is interesting. Not the plot, but the premise. There's a house with glass walls and violent ghosts. Nothing earth shattering here, but interesting. Some of the ghosts have themselves interesting back stories. These aren't explored in the film, but they have names that hint at something, and they look cool. The set design and make up are also good. There's one or two good 'jump' scares (but another two hundred that fail). That's about it. Thirteen Ghosts has four major failings, or five if you count the child, who apart from being very annoying is the worst cast child actor since Ruthie in 7th Heaven. Firstly, it takes itself way too seriously. It attempts a couple of plot twists and tries to give us some sympathy for the characters. It's hard to care whether they live or die- some characters you want dead- but there are attempts made to make us care. These attempts fail. Then there's the complete lack of atmosphere, which is something that all good horror movies need. I believe The Sixth Sense was overrated, but this beats this movie by so much. The choice for a glass house was an attempt to make this movie modern, rather than having a big, old, creepy house on a hill. But big, old, creepy houses on hills are atmospheric and in the right hands, scary. Dark Castle's first movie (this is it's second, I think) was The House on Haunted Hill. That was also nearly as cheesy as this movie, but it had atmosphere as well as just gore. Thirdly, there's the fact that we have twelve ghosts here. Yes, the title is thirteen ghosts, but there are twelve. There is a story saying who the thirteenth ghost is and what they do but it's too silly to go into in any detail. But, we have twelve ghosts, and the majority of them do nothing. About four of them actually cause harm, and another has significance to the characters, but the rest we only see fleetingly. They perhaps bang on the glass a little to shock the characters or stand at the end of a hallway, but that's it. This movie could have had many more scenes with characters being chased or at the very least scared by these ghosts, but it doesn't. There is a lot of untapped potential. Finally- and this is what robbed the film of being at all scary- there's the editing. The editor must have swallowed thirteen ecstasy tablets before starting work on the movie. The editing robs the audience of having any chance of getting a sense of the house. The house could have been really cool, but the camera cuts so much, and speeds up, and snaps between seeing the ghosts and not, and it makes it impossible to know where the characters are in comparison to each other and a possible escape route. Most of the movie could effectively have been shot in one length of corridor, instead of wasting money building the maze on the set that they did. Instead of the tracking though the house, we get millisecond cuts of various identical looking glass rooms with monstrous ghosts mugging the camera. Instead of the ghosts being introduced in a way that gives them menace, we get a FLASH, FLASH, FLASH introduction. All attempts to scare come from a quick cut to a ghost with a loud noise, rather than having some sort of build up. Also, all the scenes with characters actually getting attacked never run their full length. They are always have other scenes cut into them, and this ruins any effect they may have had. In the end it just gets irritating. Thirteen Ghosts (or Thir13en Ghosts, as it is often stupidly called) did have potential. It was never going to be brilliant, and no one expects it to be. Plot holes and bad acting are practically considered a necessary element in the post-Scream wave of horror movies. But it could have been so much better. If you want a movie that's scary, get Halloween. If you want a movie that's fun and gory, get Evil Dead 2. If you think Shannon Elizabeth is hot, get American Pie.2/10</fullReview>

I only have to comment how bad it really is so no one else might do the same mistake as I have done, to see this crap. Where is the so called horror genre going. The movie is based on a pure idee of an old movie some where around the 60 (13 Ghosts). So the story is good, the effects also, but hey c´mon, the most important thing to put in to a horror movie is atmosphere... and this movie has non of that. In my world this is a comedy and a dam annoying one to. And hey, what is this college thing that has been happening, this movie is tha same as Screem, I know what you did last summer, and all that bad movie category that really is just turning a respecteble genre down the drain. Some hate Resident Evil, hey i dont, it has the most importent thing going....an atmosphere. If you want to se a ghost movie that is the best of all this teenage crap, i rekommend Hell Night for example... its old and its better.

		<fullReview>Clocking in at just under 90 mins this cross between the infinitely superior Cube and Hellraiser is a waste of some extraordinary talent. The scariest thing about the film is the fact that it ever got made!Steve Beck, a former ILM effects art supervisor turns his hand to direction, with banal and cliched consequences. Though the film tries desperately to shock and disturb, it falls painfully short of the mark. This type of survival horror has been done before and done a lot better. On the up side, the set design and construction is impressive as the giant machine of a house shifts its walls and doors like a labyrinth, but from the moment you see that the house is almost entirely glass, you just know there will be a cliched explosive ending that will see many panes of glass vomiting shards in slow motion; and guess what? You'd be right.Even the strong and somewhat talented cast cannot redeem this film from video bin hell. The ever great Tony Shalhoub is wasted as the heartbroken father who has typically lost his wife under very painful circumstances. Embeth Davidtz who we last saw in Bridget Jones's Diary is pitifully unconvincing as the token Lara Croft clone no matter how many explosives she packs in her bag. The undeniably talented Matthew Lillard shines as best he can given such a weak script and, due to his recent choices, does make you wonder if he is just repeating the "Wing Commander" incident for a laugh. Shannon Elizabeth fills the cliched screaming daughter role quite well, but it doesn't take much talent to fall over and scream a lot so don't expect anything more than her usual superficial performance.On the whole this film looks like it will blissfully fade into obscurity in the bargain bins of your local video store in no time. Best place for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traditionally, a remake of a horror movie is going to stink. Sure, this can be said about more than half of all remakes, regardless of genre, but it's especially true with horror movies, because unless the new movie goes off in a completely new direction, the suspense and the fear factor have been eliminated.This was somewhat true with House on Haunted Hill (1999), which was a remake of the 1958 film of the same name, and it's even more true with this film, a remake of Roger Corman's 1960 movie.An eccentric rich dude (if he were poor, he'd just be weird) who loves collecting oddities bequeathes his house and all the goofy stuff in it to his unsuspecting nephew Arthur (Tony Shalhoub) and his family. The house is a gorgeous mansion, although it is stuffed with some truly gruesome antiquities. Oh, but the late Uncle Cyrus (whom Arthur met a couple of times, tops) certainly danced to a different drummer, so the weirdness quotient's acceptable. His house is away from everything else - not a neighbor for miles, the lawyer tells them all - lending a supposedly eerie atmosphere to the murky, muddled script.Arthur is joined by his lovely daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth - you might remember her from being scantily clad in the American Pie movies), his morbid young son Bobby (Alec Roberts), and his son's nanny Maggie (Rah Digga). The mother died in a fire, a fact that's brought up more than once throughout the movie. It's all about ghosts, you see, just in case you were misled by the film's title. Ghosts and souls and fun, uplifting stuff like that.At any rate, the family gets this house, but weird things happen even before Arthur signs the paperwork. For one thing, there's the wacky dude named Rafkin (Matthew Lillard) who palled around with ol' Uncle Cyrus (played by F. Murray Abraham - remember when he won an Oscar for Amadeus? Poor guy can't catch a break now, generally playing heavies, but this is a new low for his career). Seems Rafkin knows more than a little about these weird goings on. So what's it all about? There are thirteen ghosts, collected there by Uncle Cyrus, and there's also a whole buncha money, safely stowed inside a whole horkin' ton of traps.But Arthur and his clan just want to get out of the house, which sealed itself shut as soon as possible. The ghosts don't want them to leave, y'see, because they're basically ghosts of Really Bad People (oh, and they can only be seen through use of these nifty special glasses). Naturally, the kids get lost, separated from their dad who must, with the dubious help of Rafkin, somehow locate them before they're tortured and killed by the spirits.This movie is about 95% screams - and no, that's not a good thing, no matter how enamored you are of slasher films. The plot is simplistic and is largely unnecessary, given the massive budget for effects (I'm reluctant to call them 'special'). There's much shrieking, probably so designed to distract the viewer from the unending, undying crappiness of the film itself. Forget the acting - there is none. These people take every cliche from the Great Book of Horror Movies and overact their way to stupendous boredom. It's a lesson in ennui, which is tough when you're trying to make a horror movie. One fun pasttime for those watching the movie is to see how dumb and gullible the characters are. This is a time-honored tradition; ever sit down and watch a cheesy 70s horror movie, pointing out the utter stupidity of the Dumb Blonde who comes back to the cabin to find none of her friends around, then proceeds to take a shower - with the bathroom door open? Sure, we've all done that. That's about all you can do with this waste of time, too. In the grand pantheon of horror movies, it's pretty awful, albeit slightly better than that benchmark of Crappidom, Blair Witch Project II: Book of Shadows.</fullReview>

The ghosts were truly frightening. The plot was interesting. But most importantly to me, the movie was fast paced and scary from beginning to end!The acting left something to be desired. But the characters were pretty well developed. F. Murray Abraham is menacing as the evil genius Cyrus Kriticos. Tony Shalhoub was good as Cyrus' tormented nephew, Arthur. Shannon Elizabeth gave her typical mediocre performance as the preening daughter. Most disappointing was the performance delivered by Matthew Lillard as the reluctant hero Dennis Rafkin. Lillard was so great in SLC Punk that I know he is capable of a better performance than this one.All and all, I would recommend 13 Thirteen for the sheer creepy fun of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Original and Terrifying Horror Movie That I Have Ever Seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Ghosts is my all-time FAVORITE horror movie. Not to mention, it scared the crap out of me, and yet the movie was so original and great. When a father (Tony Shalhoub) and his teenager (Shannon Elizabeth) and young Boy (Alec Roberts) lose their house and mother in a fire, the family moves in to a small apartment with a nanny (Rah Digga). the, by surprise the father's Uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham) dies, and leaves the family a huge mansion, the family is very excited. And when they go to see the house, they meet Rafkin (Matthew Lillard), who worked for Cyrus in a ghost hunting buisiness. Now, when the family enters the house, they ar dazzled by it's beauty. The walls are made of glass and there are many great rooms and fabulous work done in the house. Then, when the house closes up, Rafkin tells the family that there are 12 ghosts in the mansion, and the 13th one is unknown. Now, they must find a way out, or get slaughtered by the 12 blood hungry ghosts, and must uncover the 13th Ghost.This movie is a definite horror movie, and it isn't no slasher movie, it is real horror. If you liked "House on Haunted Hill (1999 version)" or "The Haunting (1999 version)", you will LOVE this horror movie. It is the greatest haunted house thriller in years. I give13 Ghosts a 100 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't as scary as it was intriguing. The concept of the movie was intriguing to me because they were into capturing ghosts, non-ghostbuster style. Of course trying to harness ghosts might be a little dangerous, hence this becomes a scary movie.The inherited house was another cool feature, in fact it was probably the best feature of the entire movie. It was a glass death trap. It was a transforming glass house with a bunch of inscriptions on it to keep the ghosts in. The house was designed very much in the image of the movie "Cube". But in the end I just wasn't all that interested in Cyrus Kriticos' (F. Murray Abraham) goal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fantastic. The acting was good and the plot was good. I really loved how they used actual people to play the parts of the ghosts. That was really cool. It's not your typical ghost movie and that's what I love about it. The ending was a bit iffy. I didn't like how Matt, "Dennis Rafkin" died. He was a really well thought out character. With the ghosts being released at the end, I am definitely sure that there wont be a sequel to this. But if there was and it could hold up stronger than this one, and use the same family, I think it would be a great one. I personally wouldn't classify this movie as a sci-fi film, but due to the reluctant ghosts, you will probably see it air on sci-fi a couple times. If you are into ghosts movies, you should watch this. It is worth your while. The acting is great. It really holds up. Not your average ghosts film. It does lack horror but I credit it with being quite a bit "freaky." I don't suggest you go out of town in hopes to find it, but definitely pick it up for rent over the weekend. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thirteen Is One Ghost Too Many, Perhaps... (5/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing like a good ghost story to get the juices flowing, and not one that merely opens a creaky closet door and says, `Boo!' but one that grabs! you by the nape of the neck and commands your attention with a bona fide scare. Unfortunately, such films are few and far between, and though `Thir13en Ghosts,' directed by Steve Beck, is perhaps not the `Grand Guignol' it aspires to be, it is nevertheless a valiant attempt and will do in a pinch. And it does have the added bonus of having something of a unique twist to it: Whereas most stories dealing with supernatural apparitions are the result of chance encounters or happenstance, even those set within the tried and true venue of the `haunted house,' the spirits confronted here do not arise from accident, but by design. The burning question becomes, of course, by whose design and for what purpose? Ah, but therein lies our story, eh?In the film's prologue, we are introduced to one Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham), a man of obvious wealth and means who has apparently made it his life's work to capture the disenfranchised spirits of those who have died a violent death, encasing them in holding cubes made of impenetrable glass. But before the opening credits have ended, Cyrus falls victim to one of his intended trophies, a particularly rambunctious soul who apparently doesn't take kindly to the idea of being kept in a cage.Upon the passing of Cyrus Kriticos, his entire estate-- which is rather substantial-- is bequeathed to his nephew, Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), a math teacher currently in the throes of some personal travails, who barely knew his uncle and had, in fact, only met him once or twice in his life. As often happens in life, however, it is from this least expected source that Arthur seemingly finds the solution to his problems, for his inheritance, which includes a rather unique mansion-- albeit in a remote area-- insures his solvency for the rest of his life. But upon entering this singular house left behind by Cyrus, Arthur's life and that of his family is about to change in ways he could never dream of, none of which are not good, and all of which have to do with something Cyrus left in the basement. And just like that, with the flapping of the butterfly's wings in China, a tidal wave is about to hit shore a continent away.Working from a screenplay by Neal Stevens and Richard D'Ovidio (from a story by Robb White), Beck has crafted and delivered a less than compelling film that has it's moments, but relies primarily on the special F/X for the impact it's attempting to make. The film has it's moments, but to put it into perspective using the one hundred floor `Haunted House Spooky/scary' scale, it checks in on about the fiftieth floor, just a couple below `The House on Haunted Hill' (1999). `The Others' (2001), meanwhile, currently occupies the penthouse, while the dreary `The Haunting' (1999) is, and will forever languish in, the basement. The ghosts here are disconcertingly gruesome, though some of them tend to be a bit over the top; a few of them appear to be the product of a mad designer who should have had his sketching crayon taken away from him sooner. A few less spikes, bolts, piercings and protrusions would have made them more convincing; as it is, they don't have enough `humanity' left in them to be credible as formerly living beings. It's a good case for the `less is more' theory, in fact. The real interest in this film is the house itself, which is perhaps the most unique design in the annals of the cinematic haunted house. With it's glass walls filled with Latin inscriptions and it's ability to alter itself into a claustrophobic maze at will, it is actually more jarring and shocking than the otherworldly denizens it houses in it's subterranean recesses. Arguably, it can be said that the house is, in point of fact, the star of the movie. And Beck does use it to good effect.The real star, however, is Tony Shalhoub, as the unwary nephew, Arthur. Shalhoub has emerged as one of the finest character actors in the business, and even if the character he is playing is a rather straight forward, `normal' every day type, which is basically who Arthur is, nobody does it better. What makes him so good is that he has the ability and talent to make whatever character he's portraying believable and convincing, whether it's an alien in `Men In Black,' a street prophet in `Life or Something Like it' or your run-of-the-mill generic math teacher. He works from the inside out, which gives his characters depth and nuance; deep down Shalhoub IS that person, before he-- whomever it is-- ever makes a physical appearance. And THAT is good acting.After Shalhoub, however, there's nothing much of note here, performance wise. Abraham does a good turn as Cyrus, but his role is little more than a glorified cameo with little room for character development, and even though what he does is good, there's no getting around the fact that early on his Cyrus falls into stereotype. Matthew Lillard does a quirky turn as Dennis, but looking at him for any length of time can be distracting; Shannon Elizabeth, as Arthur's daughter, Kathy, is too pert and perky to be effective, with a perpetual smile that would be more fitting in a toothpaste commercial or `Starship Troopers 2' than here; Embeth Davidtz (Kalina) is simply underused; young Alec Roberts (Bobby) is annoying; and making her acting debut, Rah Digga (better known as the "female" MC and only woman in Busta Rhymes' renowned Flip Mode Squad), as the nanny, Maggie, leaves a lot to be desired, which pretty much sums up `Thir13en Ghosts.' This one, as they say, is close-- but no cigar. There's just not enough magic. 5/10.  </fullReview>

Other than that, it's also a REALLY dumb title, but it's only my opinion, obviously, and anyone else is entitled to feel that it's clever, and whatever else....(?) HOW, exactly,is "Thir13en" supposed to be pronounced, anyway?? "THIR THIRTEEN EN"? Who thinks up this crap? I probably wouldn't see it simply because it has such a stupid title!

		<shortDescription>Yet another bottom-of-the-barrel remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why, Why, Why was this movie made? The answer simply is: Hollywood want to remake everything. But why do they have to make them sooo bad? That's a question that no one knows the answer to. This remake of the 1960 William Castle film was completely unnecessary and is a joke of a movie, and is as bad as other remakes like 'Prom Night' and 'The Fog'.The plot: When their wealthy grandfather dies, the Kriticos family inherit his house. They are amazed by it, as it has transparent walls with cryptic writing on them. There are also 12 ghosts contained in the basement that are inadvertently unleashed and terrorise them and their nanny. The plot is? weird. It had some pretty confusing elements to it, like why a 13th ghost was needed in the first place, and I didn't really like the idea of only being able to see the ghosts through a pair of special glasses. But I can't really blame the screenwriters of this trash, as this did originally come from William Castle.The acting/characters: This whole section is what made the movie excruciating to watch. The acting was completely bland, and it was all really hammy. There's also no character development whatsoever. But the worst thing about this movie is the casting. It has to be the worst casting in movie history. I mean, Matthew Lillard in a somewhat serious role? You have to be kidding me. Also, Rah Digga as the nanny comes off as someone from a Tyler Perry movie, making sassy comments and trying to generate humour, except it's not funny at all. On top of all that, the script sucked too.The scares/special effects: This movie is not scary. It seems like the director thought it was more of a comedy, so it replaced what could've been scares with unfunny dialogue. I thought that some of the gore effects were OK, but the CGI looked cheap and unrealistic. The make up and pure concept for some of the ghosts was terrible. For example, one ghost wears some sort of metal helmet that's split open where the face is. It looked so much like fondant that I was laughing. One of the ghosts was also some sort of fat adult 'baby' which had me in hysterics. It looked hilarious! I wasn't surprised to see that the ghosts were done by the same people who did the make up for 'Ghosts Of Mars', as they looked pretty much the same. The set was the only redeemable thing in this movie. It was pretty much perfect and definitely gave the movie a more stylish feel.Summary: The set was the only thing that impressed me in this movie. The casting and acting sucked, the special effects sucked and this movie in general sucked. Don't watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great effects, make-up and house and Abraham and Elizabeth are decent, bad everything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seem William Castle's Thir13en Ghosts in a while, though I do remember not being sure what to make of it. After seeing The Tingler(with Vincent Price) I now have a pretty good idea what to expect so will re-watch the film with those expectations in mind. I didn't care at all for this remake, which is proof that a remake can be bad on its own merits without being compared. It is not as if I dislike Dark Castle movies, I did enjoy Ghost Ship and House on Haunted Hill, though both had major imperfections. This said, Thir13en Ghosts is not a completely terrible movie. It does look great, the make-up is pretty incredible, the house is a wonderful setting and the effects are well above-average. F Murray Abraham has a great presence as the villain, although his role is not a patch on his outstanding performance in Amadeus. Shannon Elizabeth is not bad at all either though you do wish that she was in the film more. However, the rest of the acting is disappointing, mainly because the cast are very talented. I like Tony Shalhoub, but his character is annoying and he can do little to make him likable, while Embeth Davidtz struggles with a badly written role and Matthew Lillard overacts to the point that he is irritating. They are not helped though by their clichéd and poorly developed characters or by their embarrassingly cheesy dialogue. The story was a good idea but was unfortunately never lived up to. Everything feels too rushed, the ending is a thrown-in cop-out and the scares and jumps feel too brief and predictable. All in all, the visuals are great and there are two decent(not great though, Abraham especially has been much better) performances but the rest of the movie is bad. 3/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

I wish the ghosts would have killed her first. She almost ruined the movie for me with all her little remarks and such. There was a point in the movie when i said "shut the FU** up lady. The personality she played makes her look like a retarded cartoon. She was VERY over the top.

		<shortDescription>Thir13en Ghosts Long on Spooks, Short on Spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I know this is gonna sound completely whacked, all right, but just -- just stay with me. I used to hunt displaced spiritual energies with your uncle." -- Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard)I'm all for seasonal movie-watching, and Halloween just wouldn't be Halloween without something spooky to go watch. Unfortunately, new additions to the All Hallow's Eve staples (which, for me, include fare such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead and John Carpenter's Halloween) which bear up under repeated ritualistic viewing, are few and far between. This season, the most visible attempts are the remake of Thirteen Ghosts and Bones.Thirteen Ghosts was once a black and white grade C matinée of the early '60s made by low-budget schlockmeister William Castle; now it's an opulent and expensive-looking remake directed by special effects art director Steve Beck, responsible for some of the visual look of such films as The Hunt for Red October, The Abyss and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Considering his resume, Beck doesn't disappoint in the visuals of the film, in which widowed single dad Art Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), avoiding creditors, is delighted to learn that he has inherited his late uncle Cyrus's mansion. When he and kids Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) and Alec Roberts (Traffic) arrive with smart aleck nanny Maggie (Rah Digga), they discover that Cyrus's "house" is a bizarre fusion of hi-tech and medieval influences featuring glass walls, ceilings and floors etched with phosphorescent Latin inscriptions. Before they can even get over how nifty-neato it all is, an ersatz Ghostbuster (Matthew Lillard) arrives to inform them that they have fallen into Cyrus's elaborate trap: The house is a gigantic machine "powered by the dead," one of those pesky interdimensional portals between Earth and Hell which, of course, requires a human sacrifice to finish its arcane spell. About the only aspect the remake shares with its progenitor is the gimmick of the characters wearing special goggles that enable them to see the wraiths, who are all, of course, bent on mortal misery.Visually, the film is stunning, featuring spectacular set design and horrific make-ups, some reminiscent of the Cenobites in Clive Barker's Hellraiser series. Plotwise, the picture meanders, confused, through a far worse maze than the house itself. After a somewhat involving credits sequence cleverly suggesting the events behind the loss of his wife, you settle into a familiar formula of waiting to see who gets killed and who doesn't, and not nearly enough people do, although the ghosts do in Uncle Cyrus's lawyer in a fairly novel way, prompting the best line in the picture: "Hey, where's the lawyer -- did he split?" By the time Embeth Davidtz (Bridget Jones's Diary) shows up as another Ghostbuster, you just don't care anymore, which is a shame for Tony Shalhoub, who has long contributed memorable performances to such films as Big Night and The Siege, as well as funny turns in Men in Black and Galaxy Quest. It was a nice opportunity for him to carry a film, but by the third time everyone decides to split up "and we'll meet back here in five minutes," you figure they all deserve to die.Less expensive-looking but just as visually atmospheric is Ernest Dickerson's Bones, which also takes place in a haunted house, except this one is downtown in a devastated 'hood. Once the home of gangster Jimmy Bones (Snoop Doggy Dogg), the house is now one of the creepiest places you've ever seen on film, augmented by computer-generated shadows that flow over the walls like sick black ichor right out of the pages of Lovecraft. Seems Jimmy Bones, a "good" gangster who vanished twenty years ago right as crack started hitting the neighborhood, has never been found, but you just know when a bunch of hip-hop bros decide to renovate the house into a nightclub that they're going to find out what happened, especially when Jimmy's old squeeze (Pam Grier, seen recently in Ghosts of Mars) keeps warning them to run while they can. But, hey, if the demoniac wolf-dog with the red glowing eyes who barfs up maggots all the time doesn't scare them away, you start to figure they deserve their fate just about as much as the homeys in the other movie.Yet, Bones still has more of a heart than Thirteen Ghosts, and builds excellently on the tradition of the blaxploitation films of the early '70s that proved black people go to movies too, and of which Grier was a seminal star in films like Foxy Brown (plus, she still looks pretty good for a gal in her mid-fifties). The breakdown occurs whenever The Dogg himself appears, but it's not necessarily his fault. He gave far better performances in Baby Boy and his cameo in Training Day. With his gaunt look and that '70s pimp suit, he has a striking appearance that makes for a great movie monster, visually, but he's just not given much to do. You want to see more of him and Grier, with the most involving sequence being a flashback that reveals the secret story of their tragedy, but the film concerns itself more with, as they say in endless Scooby Doo cartoons, "those darn kids."Visually, Bones does a lot with a little, probably to be expected from director Dickerson, who was Spike Lee's cinematographer on films such as Do the Right Thing and Mo' Better Blues, and who directed a previous spirited supernatural romp, Demon Knight, which was a better film. But it falls down badly with its actors, particularly Michael Weiss (TV's The Pretender) as an aging cop-on-the-take, sporting some of the worst old-age make-up I've ever seen in a picture.Visually, both films deliver the creeps. Though Thirteen Ghost's budget is obviously more stratospheric, I prefer the sets in Bones as well as, ultimately, its more tragic characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty enjoyable, hardly scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I'm not a huge fan of scary movies (mostly because I'm hardly scared by them), but I decided to give this one a shot. I found it entertaining, though certainly not scary. Not one bit. Also, the main characters are pretty shallow, and the nanny (I personally think) is annoying as hell, and completely useless. She could have been dropped and I wouldn't have noticed. They could have developed Dennis Ratkin more, but he is the best human character as it is. And I have to say this, Shannon Elizabeth does NOT look like a teenager, and is totally unconvincing as such (the line "Daddy!" while sobbing after being attacked by a ghost is kind of pathetic). And that other girl, Katrina or whatever her name is, is quite unidimensional (huh, looks like the female characters need some polishing in this movie).However, the main plot and the story device (most salient is the invented Black Zodiac signs) are pretty good, and the ghosts' design is pretty creative. They could have been scarier or darker, but they are good enough and well developed. In fact, the reason why I bought the DVD was because of the extras where the history of each ghost is revealed. It's one of my favorite easter eggs in a movie, hands down. The creepiest character by far is not a ghost, but the kid! What does that say? A brat being all psyched up by a "decloplotated" (read: decapitated) man near a donut store? What the hell? Maybe if they have pushed this kid more into the dark "side" during the whole movie, it would have had scarier moments. Perhaps he could have been brainwashed by the Latin chants and become some sort of a lure for his parent and sister to be drawn to the ghosts or something.Oh, and my favorite scene is the intro (where the Juggernaut is caught). The only truly suspenseful moment of the movie.Anyways, good flick, good story, amazing concept of the twelve ghosts. 7/10, because it could have been better, to be honest. Worth watching at least once; more so the DVDs clips about the ghosts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always liked Dark Castle produced films so far, because you can always count on decent production values. So at least you'll get something worth it's money on that level, and it's no different with "Thir13en Ghosts". Well, everyone being a young (or older) horror fan in this day and age, surely must have seen this one already, so I won't bother going into the plot. And yes this movie totally lacks a story with a little weight to it, but then again, so did William Castle's original "13 Ghosts" film from 1960. And the conclusion/final doesn't add up to much either, I agree. But the set design, sound &amp; make-up effects were awesome. So the movie's worth seeing for that alone, and that's why I enjoyed re-watching it on DVD. Matthew Lillard might be severely overacting again, but I still had fun with him. At least in this film. Unfortunately, F. Murray Abraham's character surprisingly not being dead after all was a pretty stupid twist just for twist's sake. But still, a fun scary movie that really only aims to entertain and hopes to inspire some awe for the set design. As far as that goes, it succeeds. Don't expect much more from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By following plans detailed in a book written by Basilius, a 15th century astrologer suffering from demonic possession, multi-millionaire Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) constructs a huge, glass-walled house which is, in reality, the Ocularis Infernum, a magical machine 'designed by the devil and powered by the dead' which can open the 'Eye of Hell' and imbue its operator with incredible powers.When Cyrus is suddenly killed, his almost destitute nephew Arthur (Tony Shalhoub) inherits the property, unaware of its true, diabolical purpose. Accompanied by his children, Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth) and Bobby (Alec Roberts), and nanny Maggie (Rah Digga), Arthur pays a visit to his new home, where he discovers the horrifying truth about the building (courtesy of Cyrus' flaky psychic associate Dennis Rafkin, played by Matthew Lillard), and comes face to face with the source of its power: the Thir13en Ghosts!The second William Castle film to be given the remake treatment by Dark Castle (after The House on Haunted Hill), Thir13en Ghosts' plot doesn't really stand up to close scrutiny, leaving plenty of unanswered questions: what is the story behind each ghost? Where exactly can you place a bulk order for sheet glass engraved with Latin containment spells? How can Arthur afford home help? Why doesn't Kathy take a shower?.But although the film's premise sure takes a lot of swallowing, and the action ultimately becomes completely incomprehensible, swamped by a glut of fancy visual effects and irritating editing, there's just about enough fun to be had with this brainless throwback to B-movie horror to make it worth a look: the script contains some witty lines of dialogue (Dennis Rafkin: 'I hunt ghosts!' Arthur Kriticos: 'Goats?'), there's a bit of outrageous gore courtesy of leading effects guys Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger (a body sliding slowly apart after being sliced vertically by a sheet of glass is very impressive), the fine cast give solid performances, and the whole shebang benefits from lovely production design, with the house itself being the real star of the piece.</fullReview>

I lied, I can't tell you why i'm recommending it. I don't have any reasonable answers besides the fact that I thought it was good. It has a great cast and I also thought it was sort of fun in a way. But the film has the same story, pretty much, as House on haunted hill with Geoffry Rush. Well, I preferred that film anyways. I think that the performances and the scares in that film were a bit better. The plot was a bit more original also, though the two films were both remakes. I don't know, I just think that House on Haunted hill is a tad better and scarier. I'm not saying that 13 ghosts is a bad film, I just prefer House on Haunted hill. I think that some of the scenes in 13 ghosts are just unnecessary. I did find 13 ghost enjoyable and I appreciated it, though there were some unnecessary scenes. Like when that guy is cut in half by the glass wall. Also when you see the dead naked women and the cuts on her boobs. it's just a little sick.

		<shortDescription>A B, a A, or both</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 13 Ghosts, like most horror films of that era (and certainly all William Castle's horror films) was a B movie - in those days, movie house put on double bills with a main feature (the A movie) and a supporting feature (the B movie): the A and B designations were usually borne out by reference to the cast and production values. This remake is most definitely a B feature, albeit it has many of the hallmarks of an A films, specifically budget, cast, and effects. This is like hanging a Rolls Royce radiator on the front of a Skoda.Don't get me wrong - the movie is undemanding fun and, of its type, it delivers. The cast all seem to have fun, the story rockets improbably along at a cracking pace, and it ticks all the appropriate boxes. But it's not an A movie and is never going to be. Not that its audience cares.The biggest star is the set, which is cleverly conceived and brilliantly executed (though I was just the tiniest bit puzzled as to how come half the film is devoted to cast members wandering around looking for each other in a house which appears to be made totally out of glass?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie almost gave me nightmares about The Jakel ghost which is the eighth ghost I'm pretty sure. I love the very end but I'm not going to say what it is. I was laughing when I saw the ending. The ghosts were pretty creepy! Some were pretty dumb though... Like the really fat ghost with the daughter and the first ghost. The acting in this movie were descent. The special effects were awesome. This movie reminded me of The Cube and Silent Hill. If you watch this in the dark home alone I think you will get at least a little scared. Some parts were a little cheesy. Overall a good movie with a descent story line! My rating would be a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the Scream era .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this movie came out. Oh yes ! I was back in High School and Scream was out in the cinema recently and the world was not such a crap mess to live in as it is now ! On the whole should I of watched 13 Ghosts back then , I would have walked out throughly impressed with it but now that I have grown up it just seems like a crap remake for teen slasher audiences. Now don't get me wrong it was not short of entertainment , it just did not impress greatly either. I mean of course they had Ghosts and entertaining kill moments but then again nothing really scary , the special affects were good and the story moved at a good pace with a good twist. The acting was not the greatest but certainly good on a B movie level and the special affects were good with a few daunting moments. However at the end of the Day 13 Ghosts is just well a dumb and trust me sometimes very dumb teen summer movie. There are moments were people just seem to come out from no where and seem to have a logic for what is going on and the rest are just too gullible to believe ! To conclude 13 Ghosts is not a complete waste of time , its worth a look at if you are bored and don't want to watch anything heavy and just pass the time, I mean its not a complete waste of time just leave your brain behind after all it had a few violent scenes and some black humour of the Scream era to keep me watching.THIR13TEEN GHOSTS - 6.7 out of 10TERROR HAS MULTIPILED...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Castle continue to impress with their second outing, another re-tooled remake (but this time based on an original movie I have yet to see).Featuring a cast that includes the likes of Tony Shalhoub, Shannon Elizabeth and Matthew Lillard, an even more impressive set than the House On Haunted Hill (a magnificent house made almost completely of glass) and the thirteen ghosts of the title this film gets moving a bit quicker than their enjoyable debut and goes for even more shocks, frights and fun as a mechanism starts to turn and releases the ghosts on some unsuspecting new house-guests (Shalhoub and family, a lawyer and the young lad who helped trap the ghosts in the first place). If they want to avoid danger they must first realise the situation they are in and then don the special glasses that will allow them to see the violent spirits. Sounds ridiculous and cheesy? It is, but it's also more fun than a barrel full of monkeys until a final act sullied by some dodgy CGI (something that Dark Castle often has a problem with).Highlights include an unexpected door closure (just wait and see), some nice creepy moments before everything properly kicks off and a glorious set unlike anything you've probably seen before (and that must have been a nightmare to shoot in). Grab your popcorn and enjoy yet another fun fright movie from one of my favourite companies.See this if you like: House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Ship, The Frighteners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent, genuinely scary horror film. While not the absolute best, definitely worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever Roger Ebert had problems with in this film (seeing as he listed it in his most hated films of all time), I am absolutely oblivious to. I might not be getting something about it, and I haven't seen it for quite some time, but it was definitely not as bad as he says it was. Thir13en Ghosts is a very rare, unique, and unusual horror film (not to mention the house, which is probably the greatest horror set of all time). One that doesn't usually come along. What makes it even better is that it is an immensely frightening film - one that at times, you can't bare to look at the screen, but can't turn away from it.But Roger Ebert was not completely wrong; from what I recall, it does have it's faults. It is an INCREDIBLY loud film (honestly, turn the sound right down)Do I recommend it? I couldn't recommend it more. Not because it's the greatest horror movie ever made (which it sadly isn't), but because it's such a deeply interesting film that some people will like, and some will hate. Rent/buy it and see for yourself.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bankrupt family inherits a glass mansion. However, the house is haunted by 12 ghosts who are part of a plan to open the gates of hell. Horror film with a lot of mumbo jumbo, little logic, and an almost incoherent script. Shannon Elizabeth and Embeth Davidtz are wasted. Tony Shalhoub miscast. F. Murray Abraham is impressive in a solid, chilling performance. However, Rah Digga steals the film from that big of a cast in a funny performance. Only other saving grace is the handsome looking production design, good sound effects, and terrifying special effects.Rated R for Graphic Violence, Nudity and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow, yet fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "13 Ghosts" was my first experience with the work of the late Mr. William Castle. I don't remember too much of it now, but I do remember enjoying it on some level. After Dark Castle's surprisingly good remake, or better yet re-invisioning, of Castle's "House on Haunted Hill," it was no surprise that they had secured the remake rights for this film. What I, and I'm sure the rest of the world, wasn't expecting was the film we got, which is good example of a remake that really tries to separate itself from the original. Was the result any good? Well, yes and no.Pros: Pace moves nicely and there's rarely a dull moment. The acting is OK; in other words the actors do the best they can with the mediocre dialogue and underwritten characters. The whole film is a visual feast, as is the unusual, but strangely beautiful house. Top notch special, visual, and make-up effects. Some pretty good gore. A good premise, that's sadly not taken to it's full potential. The ghosts, when in action, are quite terrifying.Cons: The plot is paper thin. The one-liners are tired. We don't get to know the characters well enough to care about them. Lacks true scares.Final thoughts: I must say I really enjoyed the remake of 'House on Haunted Hill,' and this one didn't totally disappoint either. Just don't expect this to be much more than a fun popcorn horror flick and you might have a good time. Wonder what they'll remake next.My rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was on television when I was about 15 years old. I didn't get any of the back story with that viewing as i didn't turn the movie on until the majority of the characters were in the library.I watched it again about 2 weeks ago and it didn't really scare me as much as it creeped me out. I still find myself lying in bed at night thinking how terrible it would be to be attacked/chased by something you can't see.Although this isn't an original movie, it was still one of the most inventive movies I've ever seen. In a world where it seems every movie is a carbon-copy of the last big box office hit, this was actually a breath of fresh air. It's not often that i get scared, or even startled, by horror movies, but this one definitely did the job.Special effects were great, story was great, there were a lot of inventive ghosts, ways to show those ghosts, and ways for the characters to meet their deaths.Although i would of liked a better back-story for how those ghosts met their respective fates as living beings, as I had to look up those stories on the internet. I would of also liked to see more of the different ghosts. All the killing/scaring was done by 3-4 different ghosts instead of balancing it between all 11 of the 'evil' spirits.Overall, it's actually one of my favorite movies of all time. I searched for this movie since the night i saw the ending of it on television and didn't find it until about a week ago. Normally I would be disappointed with waiting for something for that long, but this movie didn't disappoint at all. GREAT film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monk fights ghosts, demons, and ghouls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monk and his kin get menaced by some bored ghosts, who decide to make this family part of their ghost family. Or something like that. The story moves fast: there's always somebody getting killed, or a ghoulie is jumping in somebody's face, or threatening them, or making funny noises, or chasing somebody. It's a pretty cool movie for late night with the lights out--there is no shortage of grisly and scary moments.Monk is challenged to a chess-like game of wits with Evil personified, I guess it was supposed to be the Devil himself: he grins and laughs a lot, and likes to brag about robbing souls and so on. Monk has to figure out the Evil One's deceptions to avoid an unpleasant fate. Pretty good story, although a few dots never get connected, and the plot is loosely done. It doesn't really matter, though, since the emphasis is on the good, old fashioned spook scares. The acting (which includes a goodly measure of screaming and running) is up to par for this sort of flick. Not a classic of the horror genre, but certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is as bad as any other horror movie with it's plot holes, suspect character decisions, and poor acting. That said, there are three things that make this movie worth your time. One, the setting is unique, and allows for many interesting visuals. Two, Mathew Lilliard and F. Murray Abraham are cool. And three, most importantly, the mythology of the Black Zodiac. The movie doesn't explain it well, and doesn't necessarily honor what they do explain, but the names are awesome, the hinted story is cool, and the impression is given that more information is out there. It's fun to think of "celebrity" ghosts. Ghosts of people who are such a personification of an idea, that they fill an occult archetype. It creates a sense of dread when you hear "the Juggernaught" is coming that is not based on anything other than what the movie itself created. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I love a good horror movie, me and my friend Jeanette are always on the lookout for a new one, and when we heard of 13 ghosts we thought, that sounds interesting, lets get it on DVD and have a scary night in. Well how disappointing, what could have been a great movie turned into nothing really. Once you got used to the fact that there was some kid with an arrow through his head, a few other unsavoury caricatures then that was it.It lacked suspense, because you couldn't care less about the potential victims and due to the fact that it was so predictable. Couple that with the pace that was trying to make up for the awful story. The mild attempts at humour failed and had it not been for the death of the lawyer it would have failed to get more than two stars. That was a good scene well done.After we watched it we thought it could have been better, maybe more about how these ghosts had died. Or just left on the cutting room floor. In fact having written this it should only get two stars. A pile of poo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Special effects gone mad in this movie but I did enjoy it.The worst part of the movie for me is when one person says to the others..."stay here,I'll be back" and they never listen and they are the ones who start all the trouble. The 1st person spend enormous amount of time and energy, ( not to mention putting themselves in danger ) to save the person who doesn't listen. If only they would listen! (Cant let human nature spoil what is essentially a very good ghost movie).Good special effects, good assortment of ghosts and ghouls, lots of blood loss and a plot you can actually follow. If it was me, I am sure I would have taken off the glasses and just given up. I wouldn't want to see what was coming after me.It is not scary to the point that you'll never sleep again, but I was getting into the story and jumped a couple of times. Horror isn't suppose to be believable, but it is suppose to make you react.So my reaction to this movie has scored it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham, who should know better) was a curious little fellow prone to collecting souls of the deceased. After he passes away, leaving his secluded mansion and everything that lay within to his widowed nephew, Arthur (Tony Shalhoub of "Wings" &amp; "Monk" fame), whom moves in with his annoying rug rat son, hot as hell daughter, and token sassy black woman live in nanny in tow, things get quite a bit out of hand. There's a fortune hidden in the basement, whom Cyrus's former employee Dennis (Matthew Lillard, who can't seem to pick a decent movie to save his life) is looking for. The amazing mansion made entirely of glass is way too cool to be waisted on such a bad movie such as this one. The gory murders have style, but the film lacks any substance, scares, or fun at all, but as an avid horror fan, I must admit that Dark Castle films do nothing for me.Eye Candy: Shawna Loyer may or may not be fully nudeMy Grade: D+ DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Steve Beck, Production Designer Sean Hargreaves and Special Make-Up Effects Supervisor Howard Berger; an 18 minute &amp; 40 second Making of; Backstory on the 12 ghosts; William Castle article; 'Excess' music video by Tricky; and Theatrical Trailer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an almost great remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting film, this 13 Ghosts. Finally watched it for the first time tonight. Actually bought it on recommendation from a non-horror fan. I'll have to think about this for a while, even watch it again in a couple of days, but my first impression was "Damn! He came SO close!". He being Steve Beck... but I suppose in all fairness I should say they all came so close. There is obviously a great deal of work that went into this film but there was, to me, an intangible element which was lacking in the atmosphere of the film. There are some truly creepy scenes in this movie as well as some really outright jump-enough-to-spill-your-popcorn jolts, but they are oddly diluted by the transparency of the sets.Ah, the sets... lets talk about them for a minute... the entire visual conception was the best part of this film. The Conceptual Artist did a splendid job of creating a really bizarre environment that had a peculiar air of timelessness-especially in that museum-like setting. And most striking to me as I sit reflecting on the film here at the PC was the bizarre feeling of technological superimposition in any visual of the workings of the doors and panels. The visual clash of those almost medieval gears mounted to thick, hi-tech looking glass panels constantly jolted me in the sense that it was visually unclear how old the house actually was. Very odd.As to the rest... make up was spectacular, cinematography uniformly excellent. Here though, I must comment on the sudden losses of forward momentum the film's pacing seems to go through. I was actually tempted to fast scan a couple of scenes, but I didn't.Ummm acting was sub par given the calibre of its main parts (Tony Shaloob, F. Murray Abraham.), but I attribute that to weakness of overall script. I gotta give Rah Diggah big points for playing the nanny and a great comic relief... I won't even touch Embeth Davidtz's performance. She shoulda played one of the ghosts! The dialog was weak all the way thru the film, but there was an unfortunate feeling, to me at least, that in the last third or so of the film, the story line itself seems to have taken on an air of having been thrown together.Weak dialog, erratic pacing and lame musical scoring detract strongly from what could have been a far better film. At least they kept the story "twist" that made the original film so cool. Oh, and I want a pair of those glasses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland story of trapped victims with a predictable body-count.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good stuff: the ghosts look pretty cool. The house with its glass walls is pretty cool. It sometimes even make parts of this movie worth watching. Each ghost has it's own story, which makes it unique in the way it wants to kill the living. The bad stuff: Gosh, people are trapped in a haunted house. They begin to die, one by one. Right at the start you get a feel for how cliché this movie is. My friend and I started guessing who would get killed first, second, third... etc. The sad part is we guessed everyone correctly - thats how predictable this movie gets. As people get knocked off, those left alive run about trying to find the way out. Sadly they never get into situations that are scary. Which is a shame, because without a few bumps, boos and jumps you only end up watching a rising body count. The set gives this movie a urban techno flavor, but by the end it's glimmer has warn off. Tony Shalub is a fine actor, but seemed miscast. Its hard to care about him or anyone else trapped between the haunted shiny walls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Ghosts 2001: 4/10 Fantastic set design and creative character (ghost) make-up effects cannot save this overloud, over edited mess.The cast ranges from the where is my paycheck crowd (F. Murray Abraham and Tony Shalhoub), disappointedly clothed (Shannon Elizabeth about 10 years too old to play virginal teenagers and cute Embeth Davidtz), and remarkably irritating (Alec Roberts playing a little boy you wish would just die. Matthew Lillard in his the most irritating role ever and that's saying something. And female rapper Rah Digger channeling every offensive black maid stereotype and inventing a few new ones. Come to think of it a black maid is so 1960's anyone who is anyone has a European au pair.) Yes the good old black maid stereotype, Digger is apparently channeling Beulah from Party at Horror beach She exclaims she ain't washing no windows (It's an all glass house) and for you film historians out there she doesn't birth no babies either. The rest of the comic relief is at about the same level. With Lillard practically imploding on his performance in a mad dog style that has to be seen to be believed and underutilized Davidtz stuck with the laughable task of playing an environmentalist ghost protector. On the plus side the ghosts are very well done however they don't have nearly enough screen time and look a bit like the cast of Hellraiser is moonlighting. The set design with a giant glass house with beautiful Latin writings on the walls is where the movie shines. I guess in a haunted house movie the ghosts and house are the real stars. It's simply a shame they had to include the plot and characters. Truth be told it would have been a better movie without them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off as a stupid but entertaining film, soon devolves into a painful experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thir13en Ghosts" has to be one of the worst films of the decade thus far and is certainly one of the most unbearable. Admittedly it starts off as a dumb-yet-entertaining horror flick but midway through it turns into an utter disaster and actually becomes painful to watch. Take (specifically two) scenery-chewing actors, place them in a movie with a truly laughable plot and see who comes out unscathed. In fact the plot for "Ghosts" is sort of interesting and with a better director, cast and scriptwriter it really could have been developed into a terror-masterpiece, but due to the director deciding to make his film into a schlock horror slasher flick with constant camera cuts and an indecipherable plot, it becomes nothing but garbage.It really is a terrible, terrible film on almost every level - acting, directing, writing, etc. Perhaps the only good thing is the set design but then again since the director is always so busy trying to twirl and cut us around from scene to scene we rarely get a chance to breathe it all in. Bash Paul W.S. Anderson all you want, at least "Resident Evil" managed to make more sense than this zombie-ghost movie! (And since when do flares scare off ghosts anyway? Don't ask.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's only one thing worse than being trapped in a haunted house with a ghost, being trapped in one with Thir13en Ghosts!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thirt13en Ghosts starts in a junk yard, full with piles of old battered and wrecked cars. Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) is a wealthy collector. He is currently in the process of collecting twelve ghosts, with the help of a psychic named Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard) who has the power to locate ghosts. He already has eleven. Cyrus, Dennis and their team of men are there to capture the twelfth. They succeed but at a price, many of Cyrus's men are killed as is Cyrus himself when his throat is slashed. Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub) lives alone in a small apartment with his daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth) and young son Bobby (Alec Roberts) after the recent death of his wife in a fire. One morning while having breakfast there's a knock at the door. A lawyer named Benjamin Moss (JR Bourne) introduces himself. Moss represents Cyrus who has left everything he had to his only surviving relative, Arthur. Including his house he built, everyone is excited and start to wonder if their luck is beginning to change for the better. Moss says he will take them to the house which is about 2 hours from the city and located in a secluded &amp; private wooded area called 'Willow Grove'. The Kriticos family and their annoying babysitter Maggie Bess (Rah Digga) arrive at the house and are shocked by what they see. Cyrus's house is spectacular, it's huge, the design is elaborate and made of what appears to be glass panels with strange writings on them. The house is quite simply stunning. Waiting at the door for them is a man who claims to be from the power company and has to check the circuit breakers, however the viewer knows that it is Dennis the psychic from the opening sequence. They all enter the house and start to explore their wonderful new home. Meanwhile when he senses an opportunity Moss steals a bag full of money which triggers a mechanism that locks the house down, trapping everyone inside. It also begins to release Cyrus's twelve ghosts that he kept in the basement from their protective cubes. Moss is quickly taken care of. Dennis starts to confess to Arthur the real reasons he is there and says there is no way out of the house. Arthur feels they should carry on the conversation outside and that they should find his children and get out. The writings on the glass panels are actually 'containment spells' which gives them some protection from the ghosts. Dennis also gives Arthur some special glasses which allow the wearer to see the ghosts. Kalina Oretzia (Embeth Davidtz) appears from nowhere and claims she is try so save the ghosts souls and that the house itself is a giant machine designed by the Devil and powered by the dead and has the ability to open the 'Eye of Hell'. The house needs Thirteen Ghosts and Cyrus collected twelve, The First Born Son (Mikhael Speidel), The Torso, The Gambler (Daniel Wesley), The Bound Woman (Laura Mennell), The Torn Prince (Craig Olejnik), The Angry Princess (Shawna Loyer), The Pilgrimess (Xantha Radley), The Great Child (C. Ernst Harth) &amp; The Dire Mother (Laurie Soper), The Hammer (Herbert Duncanson), The Jackal (Shayne Wyler), The Juggernaut (John DeSantis) and The Withered Lover (Kathryn Anderson) who happens to be the ghost of Arthurs dead wife Jean. But the house supposedly needs thirteen ghosts so where is the thirteenth? Will Arthur be able to find his children and escape the house and stop the 'Eye to Hell' being opened? Directed by Steve Beck I thought this was a fairly decent Hollywood effort but it isn't anything particularly special. The script by Neal Marshall Stevens and Richard D'Ovidio is rather slow at times, particularly the middle third, but it does a reasonable job of keeping the viewer in the dark over what exactly is going on and reveals itself bit by bit although the actual twists when revealed aren't overly exciting or interesting. There's not much gore in it and only the lawyers death is any fun. CGI seems to have been kept to a minimum and the ghosts themselves are actors with special make-up effects applied, by the extremely reliable Robert Kurtzman, Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger of KNB EFX's. They are very impressive to look at even if their severely underused and they just disappear for the final 20 odd minutes or so once the house and it mechanism starts to kick in. I must mention the production design by Sean Hargreaves and especially the house itself, it's extremely memorable is just plain cool and I would love to live in a house like this. Having said that it did get a little repetitive after a while as just about the entire film is set inside it, it also appears to be a lot bigger inside than out! It creates a visually interesting film to look at, even though in reality it would be very impractical, just imagine the window cleaning bill! The acting is OK but I found Maggie the babysitter very irritating as the obligatory 'comedy relief' character. Generally speaking it's well made and has a good polish about it, but with a budget this big that's the least I expect. I liked it to an extent, but it's nothing to get too excited about. Slightly above average and definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film many times now and have only just decided to comment on it. One thing I'd say would be not to go in expecting a thought-provoking thriller. 'Thirteen Ghosts' is good fun to watch, with a fair share of gore and scares. Although it does get a bit silly at times, it is generally an entertaining film. For a teen horror flick the acting is pretty good, mostly from the ghosts. Rah Digga does get a bit annoying, but since acting isn't her speciality, we can let her off. (At least she isn't BAD, she does provide a lot of the comedy). All in all I'd say 'Thirteen Ghosts' is a good film to rent out on a Saturday night with a take-away and a pint of beer.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only make the comparison because they are made by like the same team. This movie has a family that is going through some tough times inheriting a house left by some obscure relative. The house is a bit special as it is seemingly made of glass. The house in my view is kind of an eyesore and I don't see anyone wanting to live in a house like that. No privacy whatsoever as even in the rooms with the more opaque glass you can still make a person out. The house has a secret in its basement as it houses some mean ghosts. Their trapped, but a certain guy lets them out and then they go on the rampage. I like this one because there is on cgi creature that looks like smoke at the end and I like Tony Shaloub from his days on the television show "Wings". Still though, to enjoy this one you really have to not over think the movie. I mean how does a man without a job have a housekeeper? Other questions are raised as well. To bad they can not make a haunted house movie that I would rank above a seven, but they usually all have some killer flaw to them. This one though isn't boring and is somewhat enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised by this movie. I saw it when it first opened up, and when the audience saw the ghosts, there was a scream every minute. So, I bought the movie when it came out.And I watched it in the day time, I just couldn't wait to be scared again. But there was one problem, I wasn't scared. So my friends called me and found out I bought it, and I have a big DVD system with stereo sound. I said that it's not that effective any more. But they insisted. So, we turned off the lights, cranked the sound up to the max. And we were terrified.So, if you wanna be scared, turn off the lights and turn up the sound. And it'll work.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern remake surpasses original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies which has the ability to really deeply disturb me. It contains every principal elemental ingredient of a good horror film: magick, intriguing characters, superb acting and direction and a truly creatively unique plot. The suspense factor is VERY high, and the ghosts are so well done, you can believe, if only for a moment, that they are real.Cyrus Kriticos, played by F. Murray Abraham, is a very wealthy man who has a unique obsession: he collects ghosts. But the spirits he enslaves aren't your run of the mill variety. What he collects are the most malevolent spirits imaginable. Driven by the "Black Zodiac," and guided by a book most dire known as the "Arcanum," Cyrus Kriticos endeavors to seal his fortune with the blood of his nephew and his family, but something goes wrong."We are in the middle of a machine, designed by the Devil, and powered by the dead." Kalina Oretzia, convincingly portrayed by Embeth Davidtz.After Cyrus's death, the Kriticos nephew, Authur, and his family move into the extraordinary house of glass designed by Cyrus, complete with ancient containment spells etched into the walls, ceilings and floors to keep his "collection" where it belongs. Ah, the plans of mice and men.But somewhere in this house, the spells are breached and the angry, murderous spirits are loosed upon the inhabitants of this magnificent house of alchemy and magick. Also trapped within the glass fortress is Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard), Cyrus's unwitting assistant who, thankfully, at least knows what in the HECK is going on."Somehow...we got behind enemy lines." Dennis Rafkin I found the part of Dennis Rafkin, in particular, to be portrayed extremely well. His abilities as a psychic are extraordinary and successfully portrayed by Lillard. He even demonstrated the headaches often associated with the extraordinary talents such as those with which his character is gifted. A most impressive portrayal by Lillard, which I found surprising as I have never really been impressed with his abilities until this movie.Which means the directing was inspired. The sets and scenery were astounding and to crowbar such an outstanding performance from Lillard, Steve Beck shows promise. Unfortunately, I did not find his next endeavor, entitled "Ghost Ship," to be much of anything. So this was, sadly, a fluke. Beginner's luck, as it were.The voices of the ghosts were wonderfully done, and the soundtrack lent highly to the suspense of the movie. The artwork, glyphs, and runic symbols used in the ancient tome of Cyrus's and all throughout the house were extremely creative and so very well done as to inspire me.The housing cells of the ghosts and the mechanisms which triggered them were truly inspired. I found the whole movie to be extraordinarily creative and unique. I've never seen anything even remotely this creative, and in my opinion, it has earned its place in the Horror Hall of Fame.This movie has twists and turns, humor among the horror and LOTS of "scare-you!!!" moments!This plot, the sets and scenery, the performances by all involved are ingenious. A total creative masterpiece of horror and magick. I love this movie! It was 3 times scarier on the big screen, but it still possesses the same ability to scare you, on the small screen. It is one of the best horror movies ever made, regardless of the "Hollywood" effects. These effects were so well done that they did not appear to BE effects at all. They did nothing but render the movie believable. You could actually believe these horrors exist.The use of silver flares against the spirits is also quite ingenious. Silver, one of the sacred metals, is effective against many forms of malevolent entities. Silver crucifixes and bullets and the like have been utilized devices for decades, centuries even, against these forms of Beings.A wonderful movie of love and life; a fine testimony of family and faith in yourself.This is one of the Fiend's favorite horror movies. It gets a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's a great idea of Dark Castle Entertainment to bring back the 50s and 60s films of William Castle, which are fun filled fright romps that deserve to be remade with today's special effects and budgets. What disappoints me about the new 13G however is the complete lack of plot and character development. I actually got the feeling that when in production, the director and producers were saying: `Today's audiences are too stupid to understand anything more than loud noises and flashy imagery.'My intelligence was severely insulted. How dare young producers and directors presume that people today are too stupid to understand a film which has a plot and characters!I must make the point that I really enjoyed Steve Beck's Ghost Ship because it had such a ridiculous story and idiotic dialogue that made me howl with laughter. But unlike Ghost Ship, 13G injects lots of really moronic humour and relies far too heavily on simplistic gore to entertain. I watched with genuine relief each cast member being slaughtered as each progressive kill signified another step towards the film's end.As the end credits rolled I felt ripped off. I really enjoy the Horror genre but films like 13G give Horror a bad name by stating really loudly: `Horror's all about the gore, man!' Well to this statement, I say: `Hey, people with brains enjoy watching horror too, you know.'Lastly I'll say that I will be catching the next Steve Beck film (on video; never again on the big screen) because he does direct visuals beautifully. But next time when he signs up for a production I really hope there's a writer on the team!3/10</fullReview>

The story is nothing special as is the acting but the concept of the mechanical house haunted by 13 ghosts that all are horrific in their own different way is very good and it does remind me very much of Hellraiser. The ending is poor as is the begining but what we see in the middle of the film is good and is even scary at times.

		<fullReview>One of those modern-day horror films that is way too silly and over-the-top to be scary. Widower Tony Shalhoub inherits an elaborate glass house that is beyond monetary value. However the house also comes with a variety of 12 different ghosts that were all specifically obtained by original owner F. Murray Abraham for a deviant purpose. Matthew Lillard's enthusiastic performance as a psychic who helped Abraham while he was living is the film's main calling card. Shannon Elizabeth also makes the film look better than it is, but her screen persona does not help a production that lacks adequate writing and direction. In the end "13 Ghosts" is little more than a film that could induce migraines among viewers. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The house is the star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thir13en Ghosts is a cool movie, of that there is no doubt. The house is one of the most unique sets ever devised for a film, though the idea of a house changing its interior configuration is not new (I haven't seen the original Thirteen Ghosts, but I know The Avengers TV series and later movie remake made use of the same gimmick).Unfortunately, save for a few really gory moments (I mean REALLY gory -- if you have a weak stomach I'd hold off on the popcorn), I didn't really find the film that scary. The initial revelation of the ghosts via a form of 3-D glasses is effective, but for some reason I didn't find myself jumping out of my chair. Part of that is due to the rapid-fire editing, which I found rather distracting on the small screen (it might have played better in the theatre). The cast is excellent for the most part, led by Tony Shaloub as the nervous father and Shannon Elizabeth as his sexy daughter. F. Murray Abraham makes a fun villain. I did not like the nanny character, played by a rap singer-turned-actress, who I felt came off as stereotypical and a little offensive.The storyline is pretty good, with enough twists and turns and switches (pardon the pun) to keep you interested. And once again, the movie's set piece, the glass house, is a marvel of architecture. Lined with walls covered in Latin, and at times resembling an Escher painting, the set is a fun house ride gone mad.The big disappointment for me is in the lack of character development for the ghosts. True, their main job is to scare the heck out of the heroes and cause a few bloody deaths along the way, but as the DVD release reveals, each ghost has a fascinating backstory that I feel should have been included in the main movie. (Actually, the whole concept of Thirteen Ghosts -- the capture of troubled spirits -- would actually make a cool TV series, a sort of very dark take on Twilight Zone).I also felt the movie felt a bit too much like The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill. But then, if you include other architecture-based horror flicks like the House series, I suppose it does create a sub-genre and there's only so many original ideas to go around.</fullReview>

After arriving at the unbelievable abode, they soon realize they must deal with the warp-minded man's collection of ghosts. And they are not very happy.

Soon "Scream" star Matthew Lillard ? a neurotic psychic who helped evil Uncle Cyrus capture the twelve ghosts in the basement ? manages to convince Dad that his family is in danger, by which time the other three have gone on their own journeys of discovery around the house."Thir13en Ghosts" is a big disappointment. It stars off promisingly enough ? with the over?the?top F. Murray Abraham hamming it up as Cyrus and his paranormal army attempt to capture a psycho ghost that haunts a suitably spooky scrapyard ? but its main failing soon becomes apparent: it simply isn?t scary. On occasions throughout the movie novice feature director Steve Beck succeeds in generating some suspense and an air of impending doom, but every time this fails to lead to the prerequisite shock or chill horror fans demand. Sure, the dialogue is terrible and the characters succumb to that unique kind of logic you only find in horror movies (if there were four of you in a haunted basement would you really split up?), but as countless "Halloweens" and "Friday The 13's" showed these B?movie traits are more than forgivable if the film makes you jump out of your seat. Unfortunately "Thir13en Ghosts" doesn?t, and for a horror movie that is unforgivable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Right from the start this movie was on a collision course for disaster. The fact that Shannon Elizabeth was staring in it should have been the first clue. The whole movie simply *reeks* of Hollywood-ism, as if it were made up by the same Armani-wearing, Laté-drinking, ghoti-touting hipster who thought up S-Club 7. From the custom tailored raincoats that Cyrus' crew wore at the beginning, to the designer `ghost goggles', the movie is simply dripping with style, when it should have been dripping with blood.The premise for the movie isn't a bad one (family inherits haunted mechanical mansion), and the idea that people can only see the ghosts with the special glasses *could* have made for some creepy moments. However, I felt absolutely no connection to the family at all. They had no chemistry whatsoever, as if the actors simply rattled off their lines and then went to their separate trailers. At no point in the film did I feel at all empathetic towards them, I didn't care at all if they got out of the house alive. The worst of the bunch was the nanny who was a feeble attempt at adding comic relief to the movie. Instead, she comes across as yet another one-liner barking token black actor. Only Matthew Lillard's character can compete with the nanny in sheer cliché one-liner-spewing volume. Honestly, who is responsible for coming up with the lines for these people? Yet another failed attempt at hip-afying character dialog that is totally inane and out of place in the first place. Just about every remark these characters make is doused in horribly tame sarcasm.The only saving grace in this high budget, low mileage flop is the ghosts themselves. I didn't find the idea of a well lit glass mansion to be at all scary. However, the variety of monsters was formidable and the makeup and costumes were excellent. The iron cage around the `Jackal's' head, and the vomit covered man-child were particularly nice touches. Unfortunately, the `Marylyn Manson music video' stuttering effect, which is used whenever the camera is focused on the ghosts, becomes old and overused *very* quickly.The `surprise' appearance by Embeth Davidtz, who plays the lady with the book of spells, certainly *was* a surprise to me.it surprised me to see someone who was a worse actor than Shanon Elizabeth! I was tempted to fast forward through the parts where she hopelessly tries to spin a tale of mystery and lore behind the ghosts. She does so using veritable buckets of mumbo jumbo and tries desperately to look concerned about the family's predicament.but fails miserably. All in all, her performance comes across as something more suited to an episode of VIP than a big screen movie. What's worse is the `twist' that was added, where it turns out she was working for Cyrus' all along. It was so ludicrous and obviously tacked on at the last minute, I couldn't help but laugh.But, like all movies, this one had to end. Once everyone gets bored watching people run away from invisible ghosts in a glass house the director decides to wrap it up. The ending was particularly useless as the film makers scrambled desperately to tie up the loose ends. In the span of about three minutes Cyrus gets thrown into the spinning machine by the ghosts, the nanny then breaks the machine, the dad `saves' the kids (ie: pointlessly jumps inside the whirling rings simply to comfort the kids), the family gets a brief glimpse of their ghost mom, and the nanny spouts off every one-liner she didn't get to say during the first part of the movie. To top this speedy dispatch the musical director felt it would be most fitting to roll the credits with a *spooooky* rap song! Good call! I mean, how do you expect to sell the Thirteen Ghosts soundtrack if you don't insert a bunch of crappy commercial music in, right?Conclusion, this movie feels like it was thought up one afternoon by some Los Angles movie-making yuppie on his way to an appointment with his hairdresser. A *lot* more money than talent was funnelled into this project, and it shows. There is no excuse for big budget horror films like these to not be scary at all. Maybe the producers were too busy trying to inserting product placement for the sunglasses into every shot.Rating: 2/10</fullReview>

There were a few attempts at dry, horror-movie cliche humor, however it was a disgraceful addition to an already repulsive movie. I'm happy that it was short, about 1.5 hours.The special effects were impressive, and there was a point or two that made me jump. However, after recently seeing "The Others," I could not have been more disappointed with this attempt at horror. Shannon Elizabeth could have held the movie up a little more with her hotness, however her scenes were few and far between. Dont' waste your money. Rent "The Others" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good cinematography and good special effects cannot save a failed horror flick. Why is it failed? Well, number one, the makeup of the ghosts, including my favorite The Hammer, was extremely impressive and even frightening (think Cenobites.) But the over excessive use of the quick flash editing and poor characterization did not help bring the ghosts to independence from flashy editing and a restrictive script. It became an excersize for the director and editor to show the weak MTV generation they are hip and cool like the Matrix (none of which is true by the way.) That is not to say that I think the Matrix is a cool film because it is not, but read my Matrix review to see. If the filmmakers relied solely on the ghosts themselves to elevate the pic instead of flashy editing, the picture may have succeeded in at least giving us new cult monsters for this new generation, but alas egos must have gotten in the way because I was surely deprived. I recommend renting the film just to take a gander, but after one viewing, I will never see it again. A shame, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I might be completely mistaken here, but are we in the year 2002, or not? This film started out as what seemed like a well-done remake of the 1960 original, 13 Ghosts, but it's appeal was shortly squelched as the film-makers introduced Rah Digga's stereotypical character, "Maggie"--with no coincidence on the name, here. Digga plays an annoying, dumb, modern-day house mammy who's only contribution to the film is cooking and making slang quips about "breaking nails" as the cast tries to escape ghosts. This, while her white, female counterpart is masking diabolical plans, re-routing the rest of the cast throughout the house using her sacred book, kicking ghost ass, etc. Okay people..are you kidding me, here? Is this all Hollywood has to offer in terms of roles for Black females? The producers of this film can offer up fancy cinematography, good scripts for the white cast, yet their script for the sole, black female reads more like a Nineteenth Century black minstrel show.I for one, know that Rah Digga is in fact, an intelligent, black woman. Any exposure to her lyrics would reveal that. In many ways, the writers of this film cheated themselves by not utilizing her talent. I, in no way, blame her for taking the role. She has children to feed. I just wish these idiots in Hollywood would have a tad more integrity (yea, what was I thinking?) and stop creating roles that make African-Americans look and sound like complete idiots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 GHOSTS had the potential to be an ultra-frightfest, but failed at it. After all, what would be more frightening than being trapped in a scary old mansion with 13 ghosts? But the execution is lackluster, with only the performances of Tony Shaloub and F. Murray Abraham coming out as the highlights. Matthew Lillard also surprises, leaving his usual goofball image behind and playing things straight. Shannon Elizabeth is awful as usual, but thankfully doesn't have to do much "acting," and ultimately disappears for a good majority of the film until turning up again at the end. That was nice on the filmmakers' part. The ghosts aren't very memorable, but the make-up jobs are excellent, the set design/atmosphere great.Otherwise, it's a rather disappointing film. The concept had potential, and perhaps in the hands of another writer and/or director, something great could have come out of it. I give it 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary movie..... but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has borrowed so many pieces from movies such as "Carrie", "The Shineing" "The Cell" and many others that you might pick out as you watch. Why can't movies be original anymore? Ok, this movie was a bit intense with the way the ghosts looked and moved although some of the way these ghosts look may have been too overdone and the madeup to be "too" scary that they just looked rediculas like the guy with nails in his head and the little boy. There were parts in the movie that were gross like what happened to the lawyer but that part was taken from "The Cell" so it can't be to original. The characters in this movie were all to lame. The stepmother was terrible in this movie, she should have been gone from the beginning. And that "electrician" goofy Jim Carrey acting guy was just as awful. I don't know how they ended up in this movie much less the way they played out their roles. This movie is good for a watch but only one watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, Im no film critic, a fact that I am VERY proud of, but I must speak out against this horrible film. First off, I think Matthew Lillard should find a different profession....does this guy have any other facial expression other than the "Who let the smelly fart" look? And lets not forget the blatent token black person in the cast....making her funny, off color remarks...and then the finale DJ Ghostkilla scratchboard at the end? I couldnt believe what I was seeing? I cant think of the last time I felt like a movie had no redeeming value whatsoever, and I can usually enjoy on some level, any cheezy flick you put in front of me. The best part about this piece of crap was sitting there with my buddies and ripping it apart MST3K style. Dont waste your money or your time with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never trust a film where the sets are better looking than the actors. Horror films, as a genre, never quite get the attention they deserve. This film is one of the reasons why this is the case. The house in which the action takes place is truly the star of the show. Alas, it takes more than architecture to make a film swing. The twist in this film lies in the fact that the "haunted house" is not your usual creaking gothic number. It is high tech...has glass walls ...and wait for it ...mock gucci glasses to be able to ascertain what is happening. There ends the high tech. Its all wind up techonology after that. This is a film that can be safely missed. Unless you're terminally bored. Or dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good recreation of Castle's 1960's classic. The only problem being the complete lack of sub-plot that detracts from the overall feel of the film.For instance, certain 'items' are used as weapons against the Ghosts, and yet there is never an explanation as to why they are used in such way (and seeing as the weapons are pretty lame it makes you all the more curious as to why they work !?) We're never sure as to so many things in that they are glossed over, you end up up just watching the film rather than get into it. I counted one jumpy moment and nothing of any real significance and about two quality lines (delivered impecably by fantastic Lillard as usual)As the Producer says on the DVD special features, there is very little that scares audiences these days and subsequently I don't think any effort was made on this one.4/10 !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the younger audiences will appreciate all the action in this movie. The audience who thinks movies like Brain Dead (Dead Alive) and From Dusk Till Dawn got better in the second half, who likes John Carpenters crappy Vampires and the ultra bad Faust: Love of the Damned, you guys will love Thir13en Ghosts (ridiculous spelling, ditto movie).The biggest problem with this movie is that it lacks atmosphere and there are too many ghost attacks, too much shouting and screaming and the actors are constantly overacting. Too much of everything ruins the movie. Think about it, a ghost movie with ghosts constantly attacking, how can you be surprised or scared ? The story is very predictable but it does not matter because the movie is revealing itself as worthless already in the first scene and it does not take very long until you get bored. The mature viewer will give up on this movie long before the pathetic turkey ending (probably approved by stupid american test audiences).There is one good scene in the movie, the bathtub scene (stolen from The Shining)plus maybe two short but OK gore scenes. The special effects make-up is good and they seem to have put some money on creating the house. The music is tiresome, it is too much.Here are some recommendations of much superior horror movies: The Thing, The Howling, The Brood and An American Werewolf in London. If you are a little older and appreciates good creepy atmosphere you should not miss The Others, Mute Witness and A Stranger Calls Back. If you want gore I can recommend some of Lucio Fulcis movies (The Beyond, House By The Cemetery and New York Ripper) and many of Dario Argentos movies. If you want really twisted and demented movies I can recommend Crawlspace, Beyond The Darkness and Combat Shock. Most people will not appreciate those movies. A more recent movie that actually was surprisingly good is Jeepers Creepers (even though it is best during the first half and a little too much in the second half).My rating of Thir13en Ghosts: 3 /10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this film I was looking forward to it immensely. I am a big fan of horror and in particular supernatural films that have a number of people trapped in some situation where they are very afraid. When I did see this I was impressed with the beginning of the film but after that Hollywood gloss took over and turned it into an enjoyable but 'scare free' film. The effects are excellent and the plot full, too full. If I was trapped in a house with a number of ghosts, most of whom were malicious when they were alive I would be freaked out. The characters in the film were not freaked out and at times the twists of the plot took control of the film and became more important than the actual frightning parts. The element that was missing was the fear factor, the unknown hideous thing that you can't face and don't want to believe in or know anything about, our characters displayed too much logical thought in this film. I'm sorry but this was a thumbs down movie for me. I consider myself to be quite a horror film fanatic and I would have to say that Hollywood have absolutely lost the ability to make movies that scare you and disturb you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tries to be everything that HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL wasn't. But, the truth of the matter is, that there isn't anything that HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL wasn't. THIR13EN GHOSTS is very sad. A poor family get a house from their uncle who has just recently died. And as if that weren't bad enough, they go to the house only to find that it contains thirteen vengeful spirits. But, as each of the spirits are introduced, it seems to me that there is a hell of a lot more that just thirteen, but that's another story. No one really famous plays in this movie, except Matthew Lillard who did an exceptional job in SCREAM. But here, he chose one crappy part to play. At one point in the film, he is wandering around the house with some annoying black nanny (Rah Digga) who is continuously bothering everyone around here with racist comments such as "I'm gonna die with three white people". *SPOILER* So, they're wandering around, when this glass stuff that the house is made of begins to move. They get separated from one another. Matthew Lillard then throws Rah Digga this pair of *magic* glasses that allow them to see the ghosts, exclaiming "Here, you'll need these" , when just seconds later we find that it is he who will need them. And that is just one of many examples of what this "film" is made of. Cliched scenes and ghosties from countless other ghost movies. See this movie and then rummage around the video store and see if you can find a movie that sucks more than this one. 1/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were hoping for another HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, look elsewhere. It is both puzzling and hard to believe that this remake of a 1960 William Castle quickie is the followup to that remake of a 1959 Castle opus. One would have expected more of the production team that brought us the HOUSE remake. The best thing about this remake is the set design. Clearly, some money went into this. The house containing the spirits of 12 restless souls is pretty impressive (although not on the same level perhaps as the glass house in the recent movie of the same name with Leelee Sobieski). Otherwise, the acting is routine and lifeless (Tony Shaloub), nonexistent (Shannon Elizabeth), annoying (the kid playing Shaloub's son) or over-the-top and out-of-control (Matthew Lilliard). There's even a token black actor in an embarassing sytereotyped "mammy" role (Ra Diggs)! The script is uninspired, to say the least, and the monsters look like your typical spookies in the annual Jaycees Halloween haunted house. The Hammer creature looks like he is wearing a $20 rubber mask purchased at WalMart. The Angry Princess at least was nekkid, which is good for us guys. Too bad she didn't have more screen time. A couple of scary moments, but not enough to sustain the whole picture. Just for laughs, if you do insist on seeing this, check out the scene where Shaloub and Shaggy walk around the house carrying a full-size glass door. I haven't seen anything so funy since the cops holding one arm above their heads to avoid traps from above in the original PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to my intelligence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One glance at "Thir13en Ghosts" trailers and posters is enough to warn you that this movie relies on effects and sensationalism to thrill.Sitting through this movie was painful, especially after having seen "The Others" in the cinema two months before. It is not a thriller, it is a special effects-makeup-and-outlandish-props movie. The "ghosts" are so heavily made-up they end up looking hilarious rather than scary, the cinematography (read : loads and loads of split-second clips) reeks of MTV, and the characters transparent and stereotyped.Naturally, a weird guy is out to control the world. Naturally, an innocent family is unwittingly caught in the middle. Naturally, someone strays away and everyone starts looking for him. Naturally, all hell breaks loose and there's lots of running, screaming, and gore. Naturally, the big bad guy overlooks one minor thing, he gets defeated, and the world is saved.The only innovation are special glasses needed to actually see the ghosts. But question is, why would you want to look at them? They have lame names, all go to the same beauty parlor and all do the same thing. The only thing that is good about them is that they want to kill the cast, who are all so uninteresting, unendearing characters that you wouldn't mind seeing them dead anyway. Effects, effects and more effects. Thirteen Ghosts relies solely on effects to scare its audience, and fails miserably. I walked out of the cinema insulted that the producers would actually think that this show could get me scared. It's an insult to my intelligence. Some ten-year-old, maybe. Not me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thir13en Ghosts is about about a rich collector who supposedly dies and then leaves his house and all his collections to his nephew and two kids. When they enter the house, everything looks good at first, but then they realise that the house is not all it seems and is really a "machine built by the devil and powered by the dead" with twelve ghosts 'living' in it and a thirteenth ghost is needed to join them. I usually love these kind of haunted house, horror, ghost movies and if people like these kind of movies too, then they might not mind this movie, but there are definitely better ones out there. One of the main reasons as to why I am saying this is because the cast in this movie are SO awful and unbelievable, it makes the movie hard to enjoy and take even a little bit seriously.The worst performances definitely come from Shannon Elizabeth, (Joint with Salma Hayek for first place as one of the worst actress' around.) Tony Shalhoub, F. Murray Abraham, Alec Roberts and Rah Digga who all NEVER give good performances anyway, so I didn't expect much of them. Couldn't they of had better actors to play there parts. Matthew Lillard suits his role as the nutty Dennis, even though he's always really playing this kind of role in many of his movies. There's nothing wrong with a little humour in horror movies, but sometimes it a movie like this just doesn't need it.... A couple of different things needed like a change of cast would of made the movie SO much more enjoyable as I like I've already said I do *love* these kind of movies and the basic story-line here and the special effects used for all the gore in the movie are okay.</fullReview>

The story centers around a family who believes all their dreams have come true when they inherit a mysterious house left behind by the patriarch's recently deceased uncle. Unfortunately for them the house is much more than it seems, and is in fact a tool used solely for the purpose of trapping angry ghosts. With several of the ghosts still running rampant within the house, it's up to these reluctant new owners to try and capture them. Well-crafted thriller has a good setup, an above average cast, and all the effects that money can buy, accompanied by thin characters, ridiculous dialogue, and zero scares. *?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was wrong in so many ways. Take a look at that movie poster up there. That's gonna be your face after you walk out of the theater and spit on the guy who sold you your tickets. It's supposed to be a horror movie but I think it fails at being pretty much any type of movie. The plot is really stupid so I won't bore you with specifics: some people "inherit" a house from their dead, creepy uncle who traps ghosts. They go inside the house, stuff happens, blood flies, people die. There's some other stuff thrown in but it's all pretty much useless and confusing. The best part of this movie was the set. Give whoever designed it an Oscar now because otherwise all your movie ticket would be useful for is wiping yourself. And that might be giving it too much credit. The house is really awesome looking, but the camera work was kind of disorienting so they definitely could have done a better job of showing it off. The costumes are pretty cool as well but most of the time it's hard to really get a good look at them. Matthew Lillard does a good job as a nutty psychotic; I found myself wishing that everyone else would die so I could watch him run around saying funny stuff. Now that I think about it, not enough of the characters in this film died horrible, gruesome deaths. I mean, there's a few but I wanted a bloodbath of not-so-good actors here. You'll wish for the same thing too if you're unlucky enough to sit through this trainwreck of a movie. It had a LOT of potential but somehow they just sucked it up. Wait till it comes out on video and make it into a drinking game (drink every time someone says something that makes no sense at all within the context of the movie). Not a good date movie. If you somehow enjoyed it, she wouldn't have - and she'll be upset at you because of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much from this movie, and I didn't get much. The plot is, like most modern horror movies, thin and unrealistic. After losing their mother in a fire, a father and his 2 children, one almost grown, the other an 8 year old, inherit a house from a mysterious dead uncle. Once inside the house, they realize that "Uncle Cyrus" was not just a weird old rich guy with a cool house, but a freak with a giant machine full of dead people. (I was extremely surprised to see Oscar winning actor F. Murray Abraham as Uncle Cyrus.) Of course, they become trapped inside the machine, and of course they become separated. Maybe if I had cared about the characters at all, I would have cared when they were in mortal danger. However, the movie spent about 5 minutes developing their personalities. Additionally, the little boy was so bratty and obnoxious that I almost hoped he'd go first. Anyway, if visual images really scare you, then "Thirteen Ghosts" might, as it does have some really grotesque special effects. However, if you need a plot and intellectual stimulation to enjoy a movie, then "Thirteen Ghosts" is not for you. Also, just to rant, where the heck do they get off putting "13" in place of the "te"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 1960 film of the same name, Thirteen Ghosts' premise has been spoofed on so many times few remember the original film. And this remake will probably also be forgotten easily. Bad writing topped off by bad acting turn what could have been a great scary movie into yet another bloody, pointless mess. F. Murray Abraham (Star Trek: Insurrection) gives the best performance of the film, but that's not saying much. Matthew Lillard (Scream) was annoying from start to finish. Others like Tony Shalhoub (The Siege, Men in Black) and Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie 1&amp;2) are just there to scream when the special effects pop up on the screen.And the special effects were this films only real saving grace. The house in simply beautiful, and the ghosts truly are scary looking. How sad that they were wasted on such a convoluted plot.Summary: Not a movie for the kiddies or people who like well-thought-out plots, but if you like blood and a few surprises, it may be worth a look for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this film with the same apprehensive excitement that I went with to see the Cell. I came out with much the same feeling. Like I had seen all the scary and beautiful shots in the preview.13 Ghosts, whilst having a disturbing premise fails on so many levels. It lacks a coherent script, the dialogue is shockingly written, the acting is poor and it really isn't frightening at all. One gets the sense that the CGI characters / actors are better prepared and better scripted than the live fleshy ones.However there is one up side which redeemed the film a little and that was the beautiful cinematographic work done. Again like the Cell, there were moments when the film was shot so well you forgot that the acting was so poor, or that the script was written by a high school student. Visually, this film has much to offer and at some points, the payoff lifts the tone just enough, but not enough for me.I didn't find it scary, I won't see it again and someone will have to pay me to rent it on DVD / video. It just isn't worth any more of my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should have followed my own advice!With the added disadvantage of having seen and quite enjoyed, the original movie (albeit when I was 14) this version does not really cut it either as high-voltage entertainment or horror! As a comedy, I have to admit it DOES have its moments however! Absurdly like HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and with gyroscopic fx ripped off from EVENT HORIZON and ghostly evil-doers straight out of HELLRAISER (from which EVENT HORIZON was directly lifted anyway) this is a shallow film, as brain numbingly stupid as it is illogical!Having said that however, the "star" of the movie is inarguably the awesome house itself - pity the script and production couldn't match its originality! Shalhoub, who recently experienced a major family tragedy (spelt out during the opening credits) inherits the house from his seriously disturbed and presumably now deceased Uncle Cyrus. Pity then, the thing is the latest in a long line of gateways to Hell! He drives up there with his two surviving daughters and one sexy maid to view his inheritance, in company with the "Obviously I'm not quite kosher" family attorney. There you go, thats the entire story line - Well, with the possible exception of the 12 ghosts (YES...12!!!) locked into their "container cells" in the basement. SCREAM's Matthew Lillard is also on hand as an ex-Ghostbuster associate of nutty old Cyrus!Excessive use of Dolby Sound and a gore-fest of splattered people does not guarantee a good movie or in this case...a HALF good movie! The ending is as pathetic as it is welcome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thirteen Ghosts was one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen. It had very little scary moments- and failed to entertain me when it was given the opportunity. It was a ripoff of other horror films- most specificially 'House on Haunted Hill.' The cast was horrible- having Tony Shalhoub as the main character definitely did not make this movie any more enjoyable- same goes with Lilliard, who maintains his role as the most annoying actor to date (Wait until Scooby Doo comes out...). Only a strong performance from F Murray Abraham was the highlight of the movie- and along with the most unique 13 ghosts you'll ever see. I highly recommend this movie for people who enjoy thrills and chills- despite in this film, there is hardly any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another weak horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 13 Ghosts remake is a good example of the bad horror movies that are being cranked out by the studios. Good horror movies should be dark rather than slick, played realistically despite the situation, and treated seriously. Sixth Sense and The Others is the exception to the ridiculous horror movies that are being cranked out post-Scream. The creatures in this movie look great. A shame they couldn't have popped up in a Hellraiser type flick rather than this. Too much time is spent having Matthew Lillard flop around.They have a hot chick like Shannon Elizabeth, and they have her be a virginal daughter. Heck, Shannon is hardly in this movie. The maid character comedy relief was horrible. They do a roll call of all the ghosts not once, but twice. One scene of exposition is one thing, but then to repeat all that information a second time is overkill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had free movie passes, so I didn't have to pay to see this, but I wish I could get a refund on my time. It was a cheesy mess of a movie, and a real disappointment to see F. Murray Abraham and Tony Shalhoub, both actors I like, involved. Rah Digga turned out a pretty good almost-debut performance as the token black woman, whom we are constantly reminded is the hired help, and who "humorously" laments about her nails and about the "crazy white people" she's stuck with. But Rah's character was not the only cliché in this film, not by a long shot. In fact, the first scene is such a boring and predictable horror first scene that I half-expected the movie to turn out as another horror spoof. I mean, they already have Shannon Elizabeth on board, why not? Even that might have been a welcome alternative to the trite crap I ended up sitting through. There is no more character development than is absolutely necessary to power the thin plot, in which there are glaring holes large enough to drive an eighteen-wheeler through. It wasn't scary, or even nerve-wracking. I didn't care if the characters lived or died. In fact, in the case of the young son (played by quite possibly the most annoying child actor in the world) I was half-hoping he would die so that he would stop talking. The one thing I have to give the movie is the visual effects - excellent ghost effects, more grotesque than gory. But that makes sense, director Steve Beck having worked for ILM. Also, the house was definitely cool. Not the worst movie ever, but certainly worth neither the $8.50 nor the hour and forty-five minutes you'll spend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few ghosts short of a haunted house...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with any modern horror movie I approached 13 Ghosts with a bit of a bias. Don't get me wrong I adore horror movies, but recently it seems they have been lacking. A lot of people associate horror movies with bad acting and bad special effects. However special effects packed 13 Ghosts might be, it still had the worst acting I have seen in a film with that kind of budget. Actors who have had decent roles in the past, such as Tony Shelhoub and Matthew Lillard, come up short in the sickening stereotyped roles of the strung out, overworked widower and the goofy likeable "dork" who saves the day, respectively. And lets not forget the sassy black nanny for comic relief! If you want to see this movie i would suggest arriving about 15 to 20 minutes late and then leaving 5 minutes early. Its very similar to Hause On Haunted Hill in which it has truck loads of potential but for the most part it comes up soggy and underdeveloped. It's obvious not much work was spent on the storyline and setting up the plot takes entirely too much time, only to be let down by a cheesy let's-all-hug-and-go-home ending. Not to mention the few strands of storyline that end up not even explained at all (i.e. the silver torches, the whole Cyrus thing, the ghost of the mother etc...). Over all the heart of the movie is great eye candy and there are some okay (and I do mean okay) scares. So if you like special effects and can ignore the bad acting and ending, its not a total waste but its also not something you and your friends will talk about for weeks to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Major Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the talent on both sides of the camera and the huge amounts of money that must have been spent on it, 13 GHOSTS is a sad exercise in missed opportunities.At the beginning it looks as if it's going to be a really solid thriller. It starts with an expedition to capture ghosts which goes terribly wrong, and then goes into one of the most effective opening title sequences in recent memory. Way too many movies now just jump into the action with nothing more than just the name of the movie flashed on the screen. During the title sequence of 13 GHOSTS we establish the family situation of the main characters and then hear an offscreen smoke alarm. Sound is very effectively used to let us know that there's an awful fire and that the mother of the family is killed. Highly effective camera movement continues a full circle around the room as we see evidence of the family's decline and financial woes after the tragic events.Six months later the family finds that they've inherited a huge house and when they move in, accompanied by a very oily lawyer, they find that the house is really a device used to hold a collection of ghosts.The house is a wonder of set design. It's all glass and metal (good thing it's way off in the woods because there's no privacy) and the glass walls have Latin writing on them: spells to control the movements of the ghosts, which can only be seen by humans with special glasses.The rest of the movie involves groups of people running through the hallways of the house, up and down stairs, and shouting at each other. The characters you expect to get killed do so in the order you expect them to.The ghosts themselves could have made this a fascinating story. The First Born Son. The Torn Prince. The Dire Mother. The Great Child. And eight more, all of whom from time to time run toward the camera while loud music plays.Each of these ghosts had a story behind them, at a time and in a place. How did their spirits come to restlessly roam the Earth? Nobody who made this movie cares. Time that's spent with characters running through the house like rats in a maze could have been spent in developing the backstory that nobody seems to have thought important enough to include.Worse yet, actors seem at times to be speaking dialog intended for other characters. The daughter and nanny seem to have exchanged lines and, worse yet, the father seems to be speaking lines written for a character who's a psycic. Why else would a seemingly devoted father refer to his son as 'the kid' not once but twice? Does the man not know his own son's name?Predictably enough the evil plan is thwarted and the reunited family faces the sunrise of a new day amid the ruins of the house.At a little under ninety minutes this movie seems long, long, long. There are endless shots of the exterior of the house with panels moving from place to place. There's an initially fascinating clockwork mechanism which we see winding, winding, winding.American Movie Classics frequently runs the original movie, which is worth watching for Margaret Hamilton's wonderful performance as the housekeeper as much as anything else. It's a film of modest ambitions that's content to be simple entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard of this film and one of its female stars (from the popular teen comedies series), I guess I wanted to know why the critics give two out of five stars, but it's no surprise if it's from director Steve Beck (Ghost Ship). Basically Arthur Kriticos (Men in Black's Tony Shalhoub) and his family, daughter Kathy (American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth) and son Robert 'Bobby' (Alec Roberts), along with nanny Maggie Bess (singer Rah Digga) have been left a large by recently killed relative Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham). They immediately like what they could be living in, but it only lasts a few minutes as Bobby quickly disappears, and one by one, they see ghosts. Cyrus was not just a collector of beautiful artifacts, but of spirits, twelve to be exact, thirteen being Cyrus himself (I presume). Trying to help the family get out alive, stop the machine "designed by the devil and powered by the dead" and free the spirits, are ghost hunter Dennis Rafkin (Scream's Matthew Lillard) and his rival Kalina Oretzia (Matilda's Embeth Davidtz). Also starring J.R. Bourne as Benjamin Moss and Matthew Harrison as Damon. The effects are pretty lame, there is only one reasonable death scene, and the performances are very lousy, well, so is the film. I have to say I recognised much of the footage being spoofed in Scary Movie 2, and to be honest, I couldn't take the real (remake) film too seriously. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* out of ****I actually had somewhat high expectations for Thirteen Ghosts, considering it was from the same production team that gave us the House on Haunted Hill remake, a mindless, but enjoyable scary thrill ride. Unfortunately, Thirteen Ghosts is mostly mindless, with a handful of good moments here and there, but hardly enough to make this worthwhil to even horror buffs.Tony Shalhoub stars as a teacher whose wife was killed in a fire that burned down their house. Shalhoub and his two kids are in financial troube, but their problems seem to be solved when Shalhoub's late uncle (F. Murray Abraham, proving furhter that he's not nearly as good an actor as his Oscar might indicate) will his house to his niece. Unlukcy enough for Shalhoub and his family, the entire place locks up and it turns out twelve ghosts inhabit the place and are looking to cause some death and destruction.Thirteen Ghosts is mess, thanks to Steve Beck's hyperkinetic direction. In true MTV-style, Beck flashes several frames per second, making this an assault on the senses that's even more unbearable than Stigmata. I don't understand, does Beck actually believe these quick cuts will generate scares? Does he believe he's made a truly frightening film because of this style? If he does, I feel sorry for the guy because all he's accomplished is creating doldrums. Yes, Thirteen Ghosts commits the cardinal sin of a Hollywood thrill ride: it's boring.Why is this? Aside from the direction, it's pretty obvious who's expendable and who isn't. You know Shalhoub and his family are going to make it through more or less unscathed, which is too bad because I would have liked to have seen Shannon Elizabeth in a gruesome death scene. Faring the best of the cast is Matthew Lillard, who's always amusing, and actually kind of likable here.As I said before, there are a few good points. A couple of death scenes are fairly memorable and some of the ghosts' physical appearances are appropriately ghastly. The production design is actually fairly impressive, but not my cup of tea. The idea of glass walls that make up a house might interest some, but I prefer a good old-fashioned mansion for a haunted abode.It'd be a bit pointless to mention how brainless the movie is (they remove glass at one point for protection from the ghosts) why not just remove more and more glass until they reach outside?) or how goofy the plot twists are (I bet you'd never expect the ending would be taken straight from, gag, Casper!). I've come to expect such silliness from these films, but certainly, the trashiness factor didn't hurt House on Haunted Hill because it was enjoyable from beginning to end (and really, it was good trash). Thirteen Ghosts is just silly and dull, never a good combination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another failed ghost story that looks impressive but lacks anything resembling a decent script.As in The Haunting and Ghost Ship, we have some unsuspecting people stuck with a bunch of ghastly ghouls out for a kill. In all these films, the simple premise is soon wasted in a nonsensical script and some major plot holes. Thir13en Ghosts starts out pretty slow, and you're still wondering what really is going on as more and more ghosts appear throughout the movie. Then you realize that the filmmakers have no idea how to come up with a decent explanation either, so they throw in some running and explosions instead.There are so many things that are just stupid for no reason at all: stupid looking glasses to see the ghosts, a set of rules for ghosts that is frequently broken, machines from hell that can see into the future (or something), and that awkward feeling you get when you realize that the ghost getting the most screen time, is a naked woman.It's a shame, since the sets look great, the ghosts are pretty cool (loved the Juggernaut and the Jackal), it's surprisingly gory, and the effects work just fine. The characters, however, are of the cardboard kind. A worrying inept dad, the "wow look at the bathroom" daughter, the obnoxious little kid, Matthew "my head hurts" Lillard's incredibly annoying psychic, and (of course) the black comic relief...Could, and should, have been so much more entertaining, but sadly it isn't.

		<fullReview>I have to admit that this is the only film, that when i went to see it in the cinema, i actually saw the popcorn effect in action. That moment when the ghost appears behind the glass and Rafkin screams, that was when the snack food started to fly. That in itself says something very good about this movie. Packed with brilliant special effects, an all star cast, some truly funny moments, some truly jumpy moments, and possibly the best haunted house ever made.... This movie is very high on my list of films i would recommend.After scream i really thought that Lillard had found his calling in the Horror/Slasher Genres, this films reinforces that with avengance, he plays the character perfectly, it is like the part was written for him. He is an excellent actor anyway, but this movie really provided him with a chance to shine.The person who designed the ghost for this film should get some kind of award for them, they are nothing short of genius, with a high gross out factor, and a big shock factor when they first appear. They storyline as well is a very clever piece of thinking, and the house is sheer beauty to anyone who loves interesting architecture, the idea that it is a huge key/machine into hell is very neat. But i can't help feeling that every time i watch it transform a little more from the outside that it looks a little like a futuristic metal and glass rubix cube.As i said earlier, this film is high on my recommending list. The only thing holding it away from ten stars for me, is the choice of characters to kill, i would have chosen differently. The other problem of course with this film is that anytime you are filming in a completely glass set, the crew are going to be seen either in reflections or through the walls, and there is more than enough of these mistakes to be found in this movie. Other than that...this movie gets two major thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Make Non-Remakes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just one of several movies of late that have taken the titles of classic/B-level horror movies and made them into MYV-generation chopjobs. To me, the trilogy of Original-Raping Remakes is this film, The Haunting, and House on Haunted Hill, all of which began as good, solid movies that had some class (esp. Haunting) and were remade into slasher trash.The original movie was a tight little film about a family that needed the house they suddenly inherited and had a reason to stay even when weird things began to happen. Moreover, these were characters that had some warmth and depth. And for God's sake, at least we knew the uncle was DEAD--the new version is terminally confusing on this point. As noted by another reviewer, he can be seen without the ghost-specs BUT we are led to believe he dies in the opening scene. Very sloppy. And the ghosts of the original were interesting and varied, and not all were threats; in this version, every one is a menace in one way or another.Perhaps Hollywood could save a little money on mind-numbing special effects and invest in some originality--perhaps coming up with something NEW in horror films instead of dragging out the same titles and/or stories. And some acting would be nice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being an admirer of the eccentric director William Castle, I sadly never saw his original version of "13 Ghosts". Supposedly that's not such a big loss, since Castle's movies were only worth seeing in the theater at the time they came out because they involved a lot of ingenious gimmicks and appealing promotional stunts. During the release of "13 Ghosts", for example, the audience received 3-D glasses before the film started. This well-budgeted Dark Castle Productions remake naturally didn't had any imaginative gimmicks and it's an overall bad and imbecile film. Sad widower Arthur Kriticos and his offspring inherit a gigantic and bizarrely decorated mansion from their extravagant uncle Cyrus. Little do they know that uncle Cyrus was an avid ghost-collector and the basement of the house is congested with thirteen restless spirits, each representing a sign of the Dark Zodiac. The premise might sound interesting, but believe me, the film is an ineptly written and poorly directed bunch of pure nonsense. I didn't understand one iota about the whole Dark Zodiac explanations yet all the characters acted like it was the most common thing the world. The acting performances are truly inadequate, with a particularly annoying Matthew Lillard as some sort of spiritual medium and Shannon Elizabeth as a ? surprise surprise ? brainless beauty. In all honesty, I have to admit that the special and visual effects are fairly well mounted and they successfully distract us from the lame plot. Too bad director Steve Beck takes his own job so damn seriously and thus we can't really interpret "Thirteen Ghosts" as brainless kitsch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got home after seeing this movie, and I must admit, I've been completely freaked out ever since! I assure you that this movie will scare you, make you jump, and totally creep you out! I would categorize the style of this movie as a "House on Haunted Hill" kind of movie, but with amazing special effects (and I mean amazing!), twisted and intricate, well written plot, great actors and acting, and even some well-placed humor! I have already promised myself to buy this movie when it is released to the public the day it comes out on VHS and DVD, it is THAT GOOD! 13 Ghosts is, and will continue to remain, one of the scariest horror films I have ever seen, ever. Please, do yourself a favor... Go see it right now, you won't regret it!</fullReview>
