		<shortDescription>If You Believe...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle set out to make a fun, spooky, scarey picture for anyone who ever believed (or wanted to believe) in ghosts, and the result, 13 GHOSTS, is a marvelous and memorable little picture, that even after 40-odd years, still has creeps, scares, thrills and fun galore.If at all possible, see it the way it was meant to be seen- - -with proper Ghost Viewers-(available with the DVD edition) -so you can experience Illusiono, by which you can actually see the ghosts in Ectoplasmic Color!The plot, acting and production values may be unsophisticated, but what matter?- -The important thing is THE GHOSTS- -and they are all there as promised, including the mysterious thirteenth ghost- -and a wonderfully familiar witch (who was delighted to play the part)- -This is a great movie for kids (and adults) who love ghosts and spooky stuff, but are not at all ready (or desirous) of watching a movie full of gore, putrescent language or non-stop violence.You'll remember the ghosts, the fun and the thrills, for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie actually scared me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I watched this film in the first place was because one of my favorite actors (Martin Milner) is in it, but now it's one of my favorites. I don't generally like horror films, but this one is great. It has everything: ghosts, spooky little people, screaming women, weird special affects, and people who are more than they seem. I actually laid awake that night listening to noises in my house! Plus the little boy in this movie is a pretty good actor. The one complaint I have is that the ghosts are hard to see. I'd like to see this released either on DVD or again on video, but this time with the special illusion affects William Castle put in it in tact, and special glasses could come with the DVD/video. This may look to some like a typical cheesy 50's &amp; early 60's horror film, but it's one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still fun and scary even forty years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Ghosts has stood the test of time well, as have most of Castle's films. While much is made of the gimmick of seeing the ghosts with 3d glasses, the movie itself is well made and not just a vehicle to carry the gimmick. Seeing the movie on television or video without the 3d glasses (but with the ghosts visible) makes you realize this is a well made film.The scene where the father encounters the ghosts for the first time in the hidden room is quite spooky, and the special effects are almost hypnotic to watch. The story behind the ghosts being in the house is developed quite well, and makes the ghosts themselves more enjoyable. The ghosts range from almost comical to truly frightening, and it is fun to wait and see what kind of spirit you will encounter next.The house itself is a rather nice piece of real estate, and I'm sure some people have driven around Los Angeles trying to find it. Martin Milner plays the lawyer who facilitates the will giving the family the house, and it is interesting to see him in his pre-Adam 12 days.13 Ghosts is definitely worth watching, especially around Halloween. While some may find the plot and idea less than satisfying, I found it to be very spooky. And you really do get to see all 13 ghosts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another great old classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thirteen Ghosts is one of those great 'classic' horror films,that relied more on atmosphere and acting, then on 'gory' special f/x. I saw the re-make' and did not enjoy it at all; being a classic horror film fan, I was very disappointed. This movie features some pretty good actings; Donald Woods, Rosemary DeCamp, and Martin Milner of the classic "Route 66" TV show, Donald Woods as know to classic horror fans, appeared in the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, and John VanDreelan in "The Leech Woman" so it was goods for us old 'classiclovers' to see them, and lets not forget Miss Margaret Hamilton, the 'Wicked "Witch of the West" from the great "Wizard of 0z' all in all an entertaining, fun family film It has its scary moments, but none of the 'gore' so prevalent in today's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It did frighten me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 8 years old when this movie came out. We saw it as a family at the Baseline Drive-in. At the time it really scared me and my siblings. I just saw it recently on video and my impressions now are of course different. What I remember were the special glasses that you had to use to see or not to see the ghosts. William Castle at the time was the PT Barnum of horror movies and this was one of his latest gimmicks. Probably what I remember the most was finding for weeks afterward the discarded special glasses in our families orange grove since we lived about 1 mile from the drive-in and our road was on the way home for many people. My dad couldn't stand trash on our property and would pay each of us 5 cents for each one we brought to him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of William Castle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghost movies are among my favorite horror movies even over vampire pictures because you can't screw up a ghost movie while so many vampire movies rewrite vampire legends to fit their plots. William Castle knew how to make really good "haunted house" pictures. "House on Haunted Hill" is a classic, even with it's so-so remake, but I think "Thirteen Ghosts" deserves to be counted as Castle's best. In this movie he sets up a family nearing financial destitution despite the father's white collar job. This family with its knock-out daughter and flighty son (I shouldn't complain, that boy acts and talks the same way I was at his age) loses everything except their private belongings and then discovers a forgotten rich relative has left them his house and fortune. Wouldn't you want that to happen to you ? Before you say 'yes,' the house turns out to be haunted by the eccentric relative's ghost collection (this was years before "Ghostbusters"). The family has to decide to give up the house which may be hiding the relative's missing fortune or give it all up. It's a great plot, but the "Illusio" used at the time to create the ghosts with special glasses doesn't translate well to the black and white of today's tv screens, not even if you try to substitute 3-D glasses.Still, for what you see of them, the ghosts are chilling in a surreal sort of way as they go about their business and scare the family on the side. Some of the acting is campy, particularly De Camp's reactions to the ghosts in the kitchen. The boy, Buck, can be particularly chilling in the way Haley Joel Osment was for "The Sixth Sense." The daughter, Medea, played by obscure Jo Morrow, overdoes some of the stern sister's acting, but the father is played somewhat wooden. "Adam-12's" Martin Milner looks out of his element as the family lawyer, but he was near the start of his acting career. Kudos have to go to the casting of Margaret Hamilton from "The Wizard of Oz" as the housekeeper who may or may not be a witch in this movie too. Can you imagine what this movie would have been like with Ann B. Davis ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually.... I liked it better than the modern version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it may be old but I find it better than the "new revised" version that terribly stunk. Sure, when we see floating candles and furniture we can only imagine a small thin piece of string on the tip but hey, at least they used their imagination and had fun with it. The part played by the wicked witch from "The Wizard of Oz" was the best part. She was perfect in the film. As well as the family. They played their parts better. The father didn't act as stupid as the one in the modern version and the rest of the actors/actresses were better as well. There were alot of parts in the film that did not match the ones in the modern version but hey, thats why I liked it better they didn't have all those boring motives that the modern version had. And the ghosts were even scarier even though you could tell that it was a man in a costume with a reflecting light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better With Those Tinted Glasses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember as a kid all the publicity surrounding 13 Ghosts and how when you went to see the film you were given tinted cardboard framed plastic glasses. The better to see the ectoplasm on the screen.Sadly my VHS copy doesn't have the ghosts in color. They just appear very pale on the screen and the film has to carried by the players who don't look too motivated by the lines they have to utter.Dr. Zorba played by Donald Woods inherits an old haunted house with a witch housekeeper, Margaret Hamilton, to go with it. Woods moves in his family which consists of Rosemary DeCamp, Charles Herbert, and Jo Morrow. The lawyer handling the estate, Martin Milner, takes quite a shine to Ms. Morrow, but he also has a whole other agenda as well.Of course after they move in, various apparitions start appearing and it's pretty disconcerting believe me. Action has to be taken and it's took all right.If you're interested by all means see the film. It's acquired a cult status over the years. The special effects, impressive back then, don't quite hold up as well as say DeMille parting the Red Sea in The Ten Commandments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky , Hokey Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film by William Castle about a family of four moving into a house professed to have no fewer than 13 ghosts is a great deal of fun. Donald Woods is Cyrus Zorba, a paleontologist down on his luck. His furniture has just been removed from his flat and his wife and two children, Medea and Buck, seem used to being in continual dire financial straits. While sitting on the floor for Buck's birthday party, a creepy message comes telling Cyrus to see a lawyer in the morning. Cyrus and wife Rosemary Decamp go and discover that Cyrus has inherited a huge mansion from his Uncle Plato as well as a package containing some weird type of glasses. It seems that Uncle Plato collected ghosts. The rest of the story details what life is like in this house that has these ghosts. I did not have the pair of glasses so cannot tell you what it looked like in Illusion-O, but I bet it was even more fun. Castle always seems to do a good job at creating entertaining, fun films, though none of them ever seem to be much more than that either. The mystery is not hard to figure out at all. The acting is good all around with youngster Charles Herbert giving a nice performance as Buck. Woods is good as the family patriarch and Jo Morrow is just beautiful as daughter Medea. Martin Milner plays Ben the lawyer. And as a retainer in the house is Elaine, played by none other than Margaret Hamilton(always a joy to see her). When Ben first arrives at the house to see how the Zorbas are doing, Buck says "ring the bell and you'll see a witch." Of course the witch reference goes throughout the whole film as Hamilton looks witch-like and this is one marvelous inside gag about her Wizard of Oz performance. The effects for the film are pretty tame and very hokey, but this film is just good, old-fashioned fun. I liked it from beginning to end. If you loved the new one and decide to go back and see the old one - you will be very disappointed. Just as I was disappointed having seen the old one and moving to the new one. They have nothing except some threadbare incidentals in common and a producer named Castle(though a different first name for each).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique Frightening Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cyrus Zorba (Donald Woods) works in a museum and is completely broken. His wife Hilda Zorba (Rosemary De Camp) calls him and tells that their furniture has just been takes since he has not paid the installments. During the night, Cyrus, Hilda and their teenage daughter Medea Zorba (Jo Morrow) celebrate the birthday of their son and brother Buck Zorba (Charles Herbert), who is a fan of horror books, and he wishes to have a house of their own with furniture. Out of the blue, Cyrus learns that he has inherited an old mansion from his uncle Dr. Zorba. He visits the lawyer Benjamen Rush (Martin Milner) that tells that the house is haunted and he can not sell it. Further, together with the house, he receives the weird housekeeper Elaine Zacharides (Margaret Hamilton), a hidden treasure and the collection of 12 ghosts that belonged to Dr. Zorba, who was a master of the occultism.The family moves to the mansion and soon Cyrus discovers a set of special goggles that makes possible to see the ghosts. When Buck accidentally discovers the hidden fortune in the house, the ambitious Benjamin lures the boy with the intention of stealing the money for him. But Dr. Zorba's ghost is also in the house and will protect his family. "13 Ghosts" is an original movie directed by William Castle, actually a family entertainment. The plot is very simple but the greatest attractions are the ghosts in Dr. Zorba's mansion. The DVD delivers special goggles that allows the viewer to see the ghosts in a unique frightening experience. The only problem is to repeat the scenes to share the goggles since everybody wants to see the ghosts. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "13 Fantasmas" ("13 Ghosts")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Castle Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cyrus Zorba (Donald Woods) and his family learn they have inherited the house of his late uncle Plato. This couldn't come at a better time for the Zorba family as they are struggling with financial problems. However, once they move in they discover the house is haunted by ghosts that dear old uncle Plato collected from all over the world. Uh-oh.Filmed in "Illusion-O," William Castle never missed a beat with a good gimmick. This is a fun movie with no pretensions about doing anything other than entertaining you for eighty minutes. Charles Herbert was an enjoyable child actor with a good screen presence. Sadly this was his last credited film role. I guess the same fate befell him that would many other child actors. Donald Woods, decades removed from his leading man days, is very pleasant and likable in this. Lovely Jo Morrow plays the daughter Medea. Margaret Hamilton has fun with her Wicked Witch reputation here. The direction is solid, the music very nice, and the special effects are fun. Okay, they are relatively simple effects but still fun. Maybe it's not that scary but it sure is enjoyable. Way more entertaining than the gory CGI remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this Vintage Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually loved this movie (and so did my six year old!)..... I watched it over and over again with him! The "special effects" are quirky and funny and clearly 1960's but that was the allure of the movie to me. It was Vintage Royalty Gold and I immediately became a fan of "William Castle" Movies. I loved many of the scenes: 1. Appearance of ghosts were quite strange and quirky. 2.The Seance, with the Ouiji Board gave me the chills...which was interesting, because the special effects were quite odd. 3. Then the diabolical, attorney who's trying to get the treasure from the bowels of the house who meets an untimely demise by being "smooshed" in a canopied bed that becomes a death chamber. (OK then....). Watch it...you just might like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kitchen Sink is in Here Somewhere!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle goes all out and throws everything in, including the kitchen sink, in this story of a family inheriting a house from an eccentric uncle, just when they need a roof over their heads the most. They're in debt and need to get out from under. This was a godsend. That's what they thought before they moved in. It comes with a lot of baggage, 13 Ghosts. The production values here are campy and creepy, making this a crowd-pleaser. Another plus was the inspired casting of Margaret Hamilton, "the Wicked Witch of the West," as the housekeeper who came with the house, as she had served the previous owner, their uncle, of whom she was very loyal to. The main plot of the film, aside from the family getting used to the ghosts, is the question of what really happened to their uncle. Was he....murdered? If you want some good scares on Halloween night and some fun to go with it, then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Craptastical Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schlockmeister William Castle's "13 Ghosts" is one of his classic horror films of the late 1950s/early 1960s. Castle was known, at least during this time, for gimmicks - the gimmick for this movie was special glasses to see the ghosts.Absent-minded paleontologist Cyrus Zorba (Donald Woods), not to be confused with the Dr. Zorba played by Sam Jaffe on the Ben Casey TV show, inherits his eccentric uncle's house. His uncle Plato Zorba collected ghosts. 11 ghosts, including a killer Italian chef, a headless lion tamer and his lion that for some reason is split in half, a few flaming ghosts, and, for ghost #12, the late Plato Zorba.Uncle Plato (apparently suffocated in a canopy bed) was discovered by his housekeeper Elaine Zacharides, played by the late, great Margaret Hamilton (best known as the Wicked Witch of the West in "The Wizard of Oz". Before Uncle Plato died, he converted everything he owned into cash and hid it in the house. His attorney, Ben Rush (Martin Milner) knows that there is a substantial amount of money, but he doesn't know where it is.There are a few interesting things to ratchet up the scare factor - Ouija board that tells the Zorbas and Ben that one of them will be harmed, different ghosts causing objects to float in the air, these weird specs that light up inside the frames, a creepy housekeeper, a séance, and a hidden stash of cash.Filmed in "Illusion-O". It's not a great film and by no stretch of the imagination is this on the same level as many other films from 1960, like "Spartacus", "The Apartment", or even "The Bellboy, but it definitely has its place in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Castle directed this amusing comedy/thriller about the Zorba family, who have just inherited a house from Cyrus's(played by Donald Woods) uncle, a reclusive inventor who created a set of special goggles that enable the viewer to see the 12 ghosts said to haunt the home. So wife Hilda(played by Rosemary De Camp) daughter Madea(played by Jo Morrow) and son Buck(played by Charles Herbert) move in, to discover that the ghosts are real, and that there is a hidden treasure in the house, and that someone will kill to find it, thus creating the 13th ghost... Fun film used the "Illusion-O" gimmick of giving film goers tinted glasses so that they can also see the ghosts with the characters.

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS:Where else are you going to see a scary movie with both the incomparable Margaret Hamilton (as a good guy) and the hero of Adam-12 (as the bad guy??)This movie was an absolute staple of the yearly Halloween scary-movie marathon when I was a kid. No, it's not scary by today's standards, but it's strangely disturbing in some way, which puts it ahead of about 90% of the gorefests out there. The plot device that makes it work is extremely clever: a special pair of glasses made from a special glass that enable the view to see ghosts, while the others can't see the danger that looms over them. There's a great subtle moment that would never be found in today's hack bloodfests; the scientist who made the glasses puts them on his desk for the night, &amp; a fly buzzes over them; only to disintegrate. The embarrassing remake had Everyone wearing the glasses; so the entire suspense of being the only one that can see them is gone! The movie is directed so that the viewer has the experience of being the one wearing the special glasses; so the "Look Out Behind You!" factor is very high. If the effects weren't so campy, this would be very effective even today; and still could, in the right hands (this would've made a great idea for the X-Files or similar original show). However, some of the effects are still disturbing, it is atmospheric as heck for those who have an attention span, and you get to see a great ending that put a smile on my face (only because I love Margaret Hamilton so much). It's a crime this great actress wasn't starring in more films of high caliber; a true waste of talent. Check it out on Halloween for your kids if it isn't on TV. If they haven't been desensitized by chain saws &amp; decapitations yet, they'll like it. Then again, maybe I'm just nostalgic.</fullReview>

Then you need to see this movie. Charles Herbert is a great actor. He was also in The Fly witch is a great movie. This one is better. Jo Morrow is a great actress. Donald Woods was a great actor.

I agree time has changed everything, but the memory of being with my father &amp; younger brother ( God rest their souls) at the premiere at The Huntridge Theatre in Las Vegas, is still a monumental time of my life with family. My father hardly ever took us to the movies. My kid brother was scared shirtless. This is definitely a sign of the times in the 60's when production like this was a thriller of those times. The bigger flick of those days was Night Of The Living Dead. That one still holds up today. I miss those schoolboy chills. My dad, my mom, and brother.

		<fullReview>Cash-strapped paleontologist Cyrus Zorba (Donald Woods) inherits an old mansion from his strange, occult-obsessed Uncle Plato and immediately moves in with his family despite the house being haunted by 13 ghosts, which are only visible through a special pair of goggles.William Castle is renowned for promoting his low budget B-movies with silly gimmicks. For Macabre, he offered a $1000 life insurance policy to every viewer should they die of fright; Emergo?developed for showings of House on Haunted Hill?saw a skeleton with light-up eyes float over the audience; The Tingler employed buzzers attached to the cinema seats to shock unsuspecting viewers; Homicidal's Fright Break was designed to weed out the cowards in the theatre; and, for 13 Ghosts, we have Illusion-O, which requires the viewer to look through a special 'ghost viewer' at certain points during the film.As such, Castle's films possess a certain hokey charm, the sheer corniness of these cheap gimmicks adding a degree of novelty to proceedings. Even though 13 Ghosts is predictable haunted house cheeze, with a creepy housekeeper (played by Margaret 'Wicked Witch of the West' Hamilton), a séance, secret rooms, and a Ouija board (which Cyrus is all too happy to let his kids play with), one can't help but admire the showmanship involved (watch the film with red/blue filters if possible; it's fun to switch from red to blue, thereby making the ghosts appear and disappear).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watched this film and it passed the time, but not in House on Haunted Hill's league</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film just is not as good as House on Haunted Hill, but Vincent Price was at his very best in that one. Not that the cast in this one is bad or anything, this film just suffers from being a bit too predictable and while most of the cast was good, the kid playing the son was just annoying. The effects were about what one expects from a film from this era while the tone is a bit more comedic in tone than what I was expecting.The story has a man who works at a museum who seems to have a hard time paying his bills on time. His stuff is getting repossessed and his son wishes that they could get a house with furniture that no one can take away. As if by magic, the curator finds that he has inherited an old mansion. Of course, the catch is that he and his family has also inherited the ghosts the old man who owned the house 'collected'. A strange woman who insists on living on the premises tells the son of the ghosts as does the lawyer of the man who owned the house. Something seems suspicious, but at the same time the house does seem to be haunted as a box containing special glasses is also given to the curator and with them he sees the spirits at play.I actually watched the remake of this one well before ever viewing this one. I am surprised by how much of this one's plot did make it into the remake. I was thinking it was going to be a remake in name only and perhaps both featured 13 ghosts, but the glasses in this one made their way to the remake's plot as did the fact the family was getting kicked out of the house. I prefer the remake, only because the ghosts in this one were just not very scary mainly being more funny in nature.So I am glad I finally watched this film, if for no other reason to get another horror film under my belt. I prefer other haunted films from this era though like House on Haunted Hill, the one with Roddy McDowell and various others. This one was just a bit too cutesy as it played off a lot of the ghost encounters as funny. It started out with a bang, but after awhile it also gets repetitive and if you cannot figure out the one character's motives then you are really young or really naive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Fighting but not Freighting enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the remake of 13 ghost before I saw the original. In comparison, the remake is pretty good. It makes use of the fact that it has a bigger budget which makes the story of a man who has discovered how to capture ghost with technology more realistic. The remake also has a series of ghost that are pretty scary.The biggest issue with this movie is that the gimmick somewhat gets in the way of the scary. William Castle was known for his gimmicks and in this one he gives us a set of glasses that we need to use to see the ghost or not see them based on what you believe in. I saw the movie without this device and maybe that effected how scary I thought the ghost were.The best part was at the beginning when the opening title showed us the symbols of the ghost which was chilling. I think it was one of those films that was made for the first wave of 3D culture and became dated as a result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening shots are accompanied by screams and shrieks as the frame is filled with still shots of ghost drawings. At the heart of this story is something familiar - a child's wish. Unfortunately, despite a theme of transparency, the story gets convoluted and hazy with the wishes and desires of many other characters. The strongest element of the story is thus diluted much like the images of the ghosts themselves. The direction of Castle is nothing too spectacular either. The juxtaposition of daytime 3-pt lighting set-ups with the shadowy noir lighting setups in the haunted house are rendered disjointed through rushed ellipses in the script. The framing and staging/blocking is too tableau and renders the performances seemingly stilted. Some of the tricks are a little too cute (a fly is zapped by Zorba's "ghost viewers" why!?). Castle gets some inspiration from Margaret Hamilton who he was able to cast much better this time (Texas, Brooklyn and Heaven was a waste) and he frames her well with low angle shots and obscure lighting in the backgrounds of her shots. There are plot contrivances (as always with Castle) with the most ludicrous being that the family would stay in a house where they had all clearly witnessed a supernatural act (Dad explains that they are all just tired and therefore suggestive - doubtful the audience would relate to this sentiment). The questions raised by the audience regarding subletting are not addressed while White and Castle seem to think it is sufficient to infuse the script with a song-and-dance about potential auctioning of the house if contracts are not followed to the letter. A bunch of naive characters presumes a naive audience (never a good thing) and as mentioned above, the story would have rung truer had it focused on the possibility of a deeper connection between the ghosts and the little boy (maybe even a psychic one). The Dark Castle lot tromps through all the failures of this film to make an even bigger mess in the remake (in the remake, the little boy doesn't even care about the ghosts - not even the one of his own mother!). The effectiveness of the gimmick of Illusion-O is about as thin as their plastic you look through to see the ghosts on screen. That being said, the masses love novel souvenirs and Castle comes through on that end this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Ghosts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, there aren't many genuine scares in this. It revolves around a gimmick (unsurprisingly, being a Castle film) with a pair of glasses: look through the red if you want to see the ghosts, blue if you don't. As one discovers watching at home, you actually don't need the glasses at all if you want to see the ghosts, and besides, who the heck wouldn't want to see them? It's an amusing trick and the film is goofy fun, but if you're looking for chills, you'll be disappointed. No one seems to be taking it too seriously... Margaret Hamilton appearing as the "witch" housekeeper should give you an indication of how tongue-in-cheek it is. The film isn't quite campy enough or original enough or anything enough to leave much of an impression, but it has a few charms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is the thirteenth ghost?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Ghosts is produced and directed by William Castle and written by Robb White. It stars Charles Herbert, Jo Morrow, Rosemary DeCamp, Martin Milner, Margaret Hamilton and Donald Woods. Cinematography is by Joseph Biroc and music by Von Dexter.When the Zorba family inherit a house from the recently deceased Dr. Plato Zorba, they think their luck has turned for the better. But pretty soon it becomes evident that Plato was known to be a dabbler in the supernatural and the house is haunted by a number of ghosts??.By the time of 13 Ghosts' release, William Castle was well into his stride as a showman producer. Following on from The Tingler, one of his best films that featured his best gimmick (Percepto), he brought to his target audience Illusion-O, basically a two coloured viewer that the audience could use if they did or did not want to see the ghosts in the film, a subtitle flashed on the screen prompted use of the viewer. Unlike The Tingler, 13 Ghosts isn't a good enough film to be considered better than the gimmick that accompanied it. Yet there's a glorious sense of fun about the film, anyone under the illusion (o) that Castle was trying for a serious horror to scare the teenagers, could do with listening to Von Dexter's score for some of the ghostly goings on. Wonderfully tongue in cheek, the whole thing is played for nervous smiles rather than shrieker schlock.The effects used (red images in a black and white movie) are more than good enough for tone and purpose of this particular production, in fact if you watch in the dark in the right frame of mind, then the ghosts do have a creepy enough vibe to them. The narrative, while hardly taxing for the brain, does contain a couple of surprises, while the presence of the wonderful Margaret Hamilton (Wizard of Oz's Wicked Witch of the West) is a major plus point, especially since she closes the picture down with eyebrow shifting glee. Critics across the years have always been hard on the film, and for sure it's weak in direction, writing and a high percentage of the acting, but it was a hit at the box office. There was a market for it back then, and there still is now, you just gotta be into fun and in an undemanding horror/comedy mood.Just above average for a cheeky chiller blues lifter. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie scared me to death when I was a kid. I had sort of a drought from seeing it for many, many years. local TV station's stopped showing Saturday night mid-night horror shows. Till one day I was in a local video store and saw it was out on VHS so I had to buy it. First time I had watched it since I was a kid 35 years later and it still scared me. It was scary but fun. Then when it came out on DVD with the red and blue ghost viewer that made it even more fun. the effects are nothing by todays standards but at that time they were good and William Castle was the P.T.Barnum of "B" movies he had gimmicks for all his films Normally I don't get into paranormal movies but 13 Ghosts is the exception.

		<fullReview>Presenting yet another innovation from the overworked imagination of B-movie marketing genius William Castle, the man behind the Percepto and Emergo gimmicks, who proved P.T. Barnum's claim that there is indeed a sucker born every minute. His brainchild here is the Illusion-O process, actually an ordinary pair of red and blue 3-D glasses, which at key points during the film allows viewers a glimpse of (mostly gratuitous) ectoplasmic action on screen. Its sounds like fun, and I was lucky to see the film in its proper setting, on the big screen at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley back in 1986. But unfortunately the spirit world is more easily distinguished without the glasses (and without the eye strain), thus spoiling the one guilty pleasure in an otherwise feeble haunted house scenario. The film is a perfect Halloween distraction for undiscriminating pre-schoolers, but beware: it's an incredibly shoddy production any way you look at it.</fullReview>

It's still decent fun and has a plot that seems to work fairly well. The ghosts are hokey and the people are naive. The whole business with the hidden money draws everything to a standstill. Marty's after that money and engages the little boy in his secret plot to get it. The way it all wraps up is so uninteresting and so pat, it simply presents no message. This is really an extension of the television of the time with the nuclear family, the Ozzie and Harriet types and their squeaky clean kids who really know so much more than they do. Try it.

		<fullReview>An impoverished family -- decent, but broke dad Cyrus (solid Donald Woods), loyal, worried mom Hilda (the equally fine Rosemary De Camp), spunky, pretty daughter Medea (the adorable Jo Morrow) and precocious son Buck (cute Charles Herbert) -- inherit a large rundown house from a flaky uncle. Said abode not only turns out to be haunted, but also has a sizable fortune hidden inside of it. Capably directed by legendary huckster William Castle, with a clever script by Robb White, an elegant spooky'n'shuddery score by Von Dexter, crisp black and white cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc (the use of dissolves and split screen is especially nice), charmingly crude special effects, game acting from a sturdy cast, and a suitably eerie tone, this picture provides a good deal of infectiously sincere ooga-booga scary fun. The ghosts themselves are a really nifty bunch; my favorites are the flaming skeleton, an axe-brandishing executioner, a murderous angry Italian chef, and a headless lion tamer. Excellent supporting performances by Martin Milner as amiable lawyer Ben Rush and Margaret Hamilton as creepy housekeeper Elaine. What makes this film a complete joy to watch is its endearingly good-natured sense of pure give-the-audience-what-they-want-to-see gusto and enthusiasm. A total treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Family moves into house, and house turns out to be full of ghosts. Yeah, that plot's been used so many times that it's become a blur in the 21st century, but "13 Ghosts" is pretty neat. The family here is pretty routine, but the movie's real strength is in the casting of Margaret Hamilton (that's right: the Wicked Witch of the West!) as the housekeeper. Watching her, you half expect her to pull some magic trick - that is, if the phantasmic title characters don't do it first.As for the ghosts themselves, they look kinda corny by today's standards, but I try to imagine how it must have looked when the movie first came out (this is a William Castle movie, you must realize). Since I saw this around the time that the 2001 remake got released, there was a distinct contrast between the two versions: I recommend this one more. The only other cast member whom I recognize is Martin Milner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scarecrow reviews "13 Ghosts"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Zorbas inherit a home from a relative who "collected ghosts." Cy Zorba is a museum director(for dinosaurs)strapped financially who receives news,just after his furniture has been repossessed, that he will be given a house housing spirits collected by his dead relative who was into the occult and communicated actively with the spirit world. The relative(Dr.Plato)traveled all over the world collecting ghosts for his home study. He leaves Cy Zorba with an unusual pair of shades which can see the ghosts. We find that Elaine Zacharides, who desires desperately to work for the Zorbas, assisted with Plato in his studies. She is a guise for the viewer into Plato's methods and madness, as well as a person who gives insight into the ghosts which live within the house. She also lets us know that Plato drained his savings and wealth from the bank oddly(treasure as Buck sees the loot). Plato's lawyer, and most trusted associate, Ben Rush is the one who helps the Zorbas(along with dating daughter Medea)get moved in and lets them know about the house,etc. But, behind the smiles hides something quite sinister. Buck, the son, is the prototypical Beaver Cleaver type:all smiles and enthusiasm. The entire family would make for the prototypical Cleaver family. I think the novelty of William Castle's "13 Ghosts" was quite fresh, innovative, and appealing in 1960. But, unfortunately watching the film myself now leaves mostly a cheesy exercise I can admire in a "carnival freak show" sort of way. It's clear Castle just wants to entertain as a Hollywood type of PT Barnum using tricks(Illusion-O, in this film)to pull in the enthusiasm of youth who were frequenting the movies and shelling out the bucks for thrills. A person now would perhaps chuckle in amusement rather than the desired effect of jaw dropping awe that yesteryear's audience gave off. The idea seems interesting enough(albeit a bit wacky)with this family being fearful residing in a home housing spirits which relive acts from their tormented pasts. The "Illusion-O" process does seem to strain my nerves a bit, for the required glasses needed to see those ghosts as Castle intended are not in existence for my own personal use. There's simply an outline of ghostly apparitions and a blue- tinted screen to go by leaving me less thrilled than perhaps the droves of youths who participated in 1960. Still, there's a goofy charm that remains leaving us a reminder of what profiteers with imagination like Castle could do in an industry which would progress in the use of technology to scare and delight visually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Ghosts is a real classic haunted house style ghost story. Films like this wouldn't do very well these days (hence the reason the remake is so different) as the chills mostly come in the form of wind whistling through windows and pots being thrown off kitchen shelves; things which wouldn't scare people anymore. However, it's delightful to see a film like this - especially one directed by one of the kings of horror entertainment; William Castle. 13 Ghosts works from the assumption that its audience wants to believe in ghosts; and the result is a cheerful little flick that Castle manages to steer away from patronisation and keep firmly within the realms of the fun horror film. The story is halfway between a tale of ghosts and a story about mad science, and we follow a family who find themselves between a rock and a hard place when the repossession men take their furniture and the father's uncle dies, leaving them his house. However, he dabbled in the occult; and the house that he's left his nephew's family is filled with ghosts! Hot on the heels of his successes with Vincent Price starring films, The Tingler and House on Haunted Hill; 13 Ghosts is another gimmicky film with over the top special effects, and once again Castle does a great job of entertaining the audience. The plot doesn't have a lot of originality, but it doesn't matter because it's successful where it counts. The family are shown as the classic American set up of a father, mother, daughter and son; and they're all very easy to get on with, which makes both of the 'evil' subplots easy to buy into. The special effects are one of the most notable things about this film. William Castle clearly doesn't subscribe to the idea of 'less is more', and 13 Ghosts shows that quite clearly. The ghosts here leave nothing to the imagination, and I was very happy with that as the main reason I don't usually like ghost stories is that they take too long to get going. This one doesn't suffer from that, and although it's a bit silly at times - 13 Ghosts is a real good time, and comes highly recommended to all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~Do you remember when the fair or the carnival would come to town and they would have a haunted house that was neither a house nor was it haunted? It was just a goofy mess that was more funny than scary, but you still had a good time all the same. That's exactly what 13 Ghosts reminds me of. Director William Castle and writer Robb White have re-teamed to bring this old fashioned hokeyness to the screen. It's about a family that inherits an old mansion, a buried treasure, and 12 ghosts. The catch is, you can only see the ghosts with special viewmaster goggles. Throw in a money-grubbing lawyer and the Wicked Witch of the West and you've got yourself a movie. It tries to be scary at times, but just ends up making you laugh. That doesn't take away from the picture though, just adds to the campiness. The ghostly shenanigans are all in good fun, but it's not nearly as good as Castle and White's earlier collaboration, House on Haunted Hill. 13 Ghosts is overall a somewhat dumb idea that more or less succeeds through its ability to not take itself seriously (hey, it's better than the remake).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEADIf you like new, flashy, loud, gory horror movies, this movie isn't for you. But if you have a soft spot for old films which know how to create atmosphere, this is the one. When I was a kid the best part of Halloween after trick-or-treating was done was the all-night horror movie marathon. (And boy, did they make some sick films back then.) 13 ghosts was the least gory, but the most scary; it involves a family moving into a haunted house with 12 ghosts; the 13th we don't meet till much later. The ghosts can only be seen with a special pair of prism-like glasses. The hero of the film is a young boy who sees the ghosts not as enemies, but as friends. The villain of the film is none less than the good-guy star of the old Adam-12 t.v. series! Margaret Hamilton is marvelous as the creepy housekeeper who of course turns out to be a sweet gal. One of the best touches of the film proves that it is the small details that involve an audience, not huge special effects; at one point the special glasses are left on a table; a fly passes over them -- and disintegrates. These are some mean spectacles. They are a terrific plot device; the fact that only one pair exists means that only one person can see the ghosts at a time; and when they do, the ghosts make them wish they hadn't. In the embarrassing remake, Everyone has a pair, which makes their existance completely pointless. If everyone has a pair of these specs and can see the ghosts, why not just eliminate them entirely?The two movies have little in common; the new version is big, loud, frenetic, and the old one is quiet, atmospheric, creepy, with a much better script and plot. Check it out after trick-or-treating some Halloween night. Eight stars for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Little Ghost Story by a Master of B-Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typically, my least favorite sub-genre of horror is the ghost story. I tend to like my monsters to be more of a physical threat and don't generally go for the invisible ghosts that do nothing but knock on walls. Just not my cup of tea, ya know, but I say that to admit that this is one ghost story that I absolutely love. That's probably even more odd considering the divided opinion that I normally see on this movie, especially from younger, more modern viewers.Created by the legendary William Castle, who is probably best known for HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, this movie tells the tale of a family of four who move into an inherited house and discover that they have also inherited the ghosts "collected" by the former owner. It almost has to be said, right up front, if you know nothing about this movie DO NOT go into it expecting some terrifying chiller. I think that's probably what turns the average viewer off is they see "ghosts" in the title and expect POLTERGEIST. This is far from it. What the movie is, though, is a really fun, light-hearted horror movie. The tone reminds me a lot of an old silent film THE CAT AND THE CANARY and even more this reminds me of SCOOBY-DOO. That's probably one of the reasons that I like this so much. I grew up on that cartoon and, in many ways, it was my earliest introduction to the world of horror. I often tend to like some of these older movies that were clearly inspiration for the famous cartoon. In this movie we get ghosts of all sorts, from a headless lion tamer and his cat companion, to a grisly ghoul. None of them, though, ever seem to present a real threat to our heroes. They make noises and appear from nowhere, but like the cartoon they never actually harm any of our main characters. Much like Scooby, there is a "villain" in hiding, who is trying to use the events to unfurl his sneaky little master plan, only to be exposed in the end.Speaking of the ghosts, I have seen this movie in two different versions. The first time I ever saw it was on the DVD from the Castle Collection. This version shows the original Illusion-O ghosts. To me, this added even more to the cartoony aspect of the film and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Recently, I saw a television version without the color on the ghosts. There were merely white ghosts superimposed on the black-and-white film. If you have the opportunity, definitely track down the DVD. Even without the aid of red and blue glasses, I think seeing the ghosts in color adds to the enjoyment of the movie.All of the actors do a fine job. There are no Oscar winners here, but you have a Ward and June Cleaver set of doting parents, a pretty teenage daughter and the main star is a young boy who gets all the "good lines". There's even a cameo by the Wicked Witch of the West playing....a witch?I can't think of a modern equivalent that I could compare this movie to because Hollywood doesn't tend to make movies that are this innocent anymore. It's definitely family friendly, but there's plenty here for the horror geek to enjoy too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cozy Halloween party in which a lot of the pranks and games don't quite come off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's another delightfully dumb Castle picture, juvenile and amateurish yet an infinitely more professional production than, say, STRAIT-JACKET.A middle-class family in economic straits has been evicted yet again from their home, their furniture re-possessed (all in that lighthearted '50s way), when they learn their mysterious Uncle Plato Zorba has left them a haunted mansion in Los Angeles. Naturally, they move in without hesitation.The ghosts' enslavement is given minimal explanation, the threadbare plot makes little sense, and Martin Milner as the crooked lawyer needs a few more Stanislovski classes before his cruising down Route 66 or busting heads on the streets of L.A. will be convincing.But as a vaguely pederastic shyster, he's the creepiest thing in the movie. He is, after all,the 13th ghost!Strong points: The lovely music score and Joseph Biroc's B&amp;W cinematography give the movie more dignity than it really warrants, Margaret Hamilton always gives good witch, and Charlie Herbert is a really cute kid in an obviously Capricornian David Archuleta kind of way and an excellent child actor; I want to take him home and burp him to stave off the 40 years of drug abuse that awaits him in real life... And how do you not love Rosemary DeCamp (who played everybody's mother in nearly every TV sitcom ever made)?The movie's effectiveness is a result that eerily doomed early-'60s, JFK-era (give-or-take), end of the world, TWLIGHT-ZONE/PSYCHO, traumatized child, nursery rhyme thing. Nothing's "purer" in its innocent creepiness, even though the violence and gore are at a minimum. It's the poignance of post-war optimism mixed with utter doom, shuddery and forlornly macabre. Even when in the fumbling hands of a non-auteur like William Castle.It's hard to believe that this silly movie was once spooky as hell (I defined it, as a child, as "the second scariest movie I've ever seen", both first and second on my list having been photographed by the aptly-named Mr Biroc, though of course I didn't know that then). But the high-pitched voices of the superimposed ghosts on screen once left an indelible impression on the more naive audiences of an earlier bygone period. For years, I used to get the meat cleaver murder at the hands of the ectoplasmic chef confused with the meat cleaver murder of Bruce Dern during the plantation prologue soirée of HUSH... HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE.... I think it's the cook's toque.Again, the era helps. It feels like a cozy Halloween party, one in which a lot of the pranks and games don't quite come off, but you had a good time anyway and you're glad you went.But I've never viewed it thru the ghostly "Illusion-O" goggles. The same house, by the way, is also seen in 1944's strange little gem, THE CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE.I've also seen very little of the 13 GHOSTS remake from ~40 years later. Clearly, it's of a different sensibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These ghosts don't mess around! And neither did the writers in coming up with some silly names for the characters-Buck and Medea, the children of Hilda and Cyrus Zorba (whether or not they are actually Greek is never determined) with William Castle directing, you know there's intentional camp, and for the most part in this entry, it works, unlike most of his later films.The camp starts the minute paleontologist Donald Woods calls his wife Rosemary De Camp who is sitting in a living room being stripped of its furniture. An Igor like delivery man brings them a package from Woods' late Uncle, an eccentric who worked with paranormal activity with the help of his dour housekeeper Elaine Zacharides (Margaret Hamilton). This house on haunted hill is possessed already by twelve ghosts (including the late uncle). Who will be the 13th?"Emergency" star Martin Milner plays the uncle's lawyer, while Hamilton's housekeeper is a delightfully camp presence. Not as sinister as similarly clad housekeepers played by Gale Sondergaard and Judith Anderson, she's still a mysterious presence, even able to perform a séance. Castle gives this wonderful veteran actress several key scenes she underplays seriously, and presents her with the curtain line as well.As for the gimmicky "Illusion-O", the DVD includes some of the garish color footage previously not included on the VHS. It's funny to see Hamitlon all in blue as opposed to the green of her skin in "The Wizard of Oz", as well as the witch and broom references to her character. Without Hamilton's presence, this film would have suffered greatly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostly Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not as great for me as "House on Haunted Hill" and "The Tingler," this one still manages to be light-hearted ghostly fun. I particularly like that most of the movie is told from a child's-eye-view (and this seems to help one ignore some of the apparent logical inconsistencies), and that the kid loves ghosts ? which most of the intended audience no doubt identified with. Unlike a lot of similar thrillers of the time, there is no doubt left in the audience's mind at the end that there are, in fact, ghosts in the house, although the living appear to be nearly as bloodthirsty and at least some of the shocks are portrayed as fake (figuring out which is which is part of the fun). Margaret Hamilton was clearly beyond worrying about being typecast, and seems to have quite enjoyed being "the witch" as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Castle Master Showman Adds Another Credit to His Body of Work !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taken out of the context of the 1950's/1960's "Thirteen Ghosts" doesn't appear to be much of a film, but that wouldn't be correct. Master Showman William Castle , famous for his creative and innovative ways brings to the "Silver" Screen, this little gem of a film,another showcase for his talent. Not a "classic" in the traditional sense with a large budget or expensive production values, Castle delivers on a more personal level, and THAT is his Hallmark. While Tarantino or Bruckheimer succeed, they also have much more resources to work with.Thirteen Ghosts revolves around the Zorba family who inherit a "haunted" house from Ghost collector Uncle Plato Zorba. But before he could complete his collection he died/ or was he murdered ? That is part of the mystery.Terrific cast Elaine Zacharides(Margaret Hamilton) as the house keeper, Buck Zorba(Charles Herbert),Ben Rush(Martin Milner), Cyrus Zorba(Donald Woods), and Rosemary De Camp as Hilda Zorba.They have good chemistry and fit well together.There is also a missing fortune inside the house, and one of the cast has her/his eyes on it.But in order to collect, they must get past the "Ghosts."So , for an entertaining 82 to 85 minutes, enjoy this creepy little horror thriller, filmed in "Illusion-O" . Available on DVD, without the glasses currently, both versions Black and White and the one with Color are on one DVD. Thanks William, your legacy will endure...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"13 Ghosts" is a gimmicky film that really manages to get entertaining at the right spots.**SPOILERS**Fallen on hard times, the Zorba family, Cyrus, (Donald Woods) Hilda, (Rosemary DeCamp) Madea, (Jo Morrow) and Buck, (Charles Herbert) receives news that a distant relative has died and left his sprawling mansion to them. Warned away from the house by Ben Rush, (Martin Milner) because of the ghosts who live there, they move in anyway. Confronted with evidence that the house is haunted, they are forced to stay due to the manner they came into possession of it. The more they spend in the house, the more hauntings they witness and the more they feel like leaving. Finding out that the houses' ghosts are trying to find the thirteenth member of the group in one of the family members, they try to get out before anything happens to them.The Good News: This one has some really good stuff about it. The single best feature is undoubtedly the special effects used for the ghosts. Most of the time about them is spent seeing shadowy, translucent forms, which is what ghosts should be, and they are pulled off masterfully. These are done quite well, and while not completely flawless, are the best non-CGI created ghosts possible. The best part is that the background is still visible through them when they appear, and really helps to give a creepy feel to them. The fact that many of them are creepy looking doesn't hurt either. The few glimpses of them where we can get a clean look at them, they do look quite unsettling and a little disturbing. The fact that they also make up a large amount of screen-time, resulting in some great scenes, is quite nice. Seeing the hauntings at first are generally creepy and very spooky, and the Ouija game has some of the best shocks in the film. The best though is the encounter in the basement. This is simply incredible and really throws up some fantastic moments that really do shock and disturb. Even the séance scene has some creepy moments in it, which makes it go over well and features a lot of spectacular moves along the way. Along with a great pace and action-packed conclusion, these are the film's best moments.The Bad News: This one here didn't have a whole lot wrong with it. One of the big flaws is the presence of one of the biggest leaps of logic in movie history. This will become obvious to those who can pay attention without too much difficulty and can be spotted quite easily. The clues can be found towards the end, with all the secrets, but isn't hidden and is easily found. The other big flaw is that no attempt is made to make the house seem creepy at all. This one really could've played with the atmosphere and turned up the creep factor significantly, and it doesn't do that. Some of the effects might be considered cheesy, but on the whole, the other flaws are much more harmful.The Final Verdict: It's mostly a gimmicky film, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fun one either, which it is. This one is mostly there for those who enjoy these kind of cheesy films or who are in the mood for something fun, while those who don't have an appreciation of them won't find much in here worthwhile.Today's Rating-PG: Violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully Campy Spookiness From Master Castle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle sure was a master of macabre spooky tales. My personal favorite of Castle's films will always be the delightfully eerie "House on Haunted Hill" (1959) starring the great Vincent Price, but Castle's repertoire includes quite a bunch of other immensely entertaining gems, such as "The Tingler" (1959, also starring Vincent Price), or this "13 Ghosts" of 1960. "13 Ghosts" may be as campy as it gets, but it is nonetheless (or therefore) great fun to watch. My only regret with William Castle's films is that it is not quite possible to see them in their original greatness, as Castle always came up with ingenious gimmicks in cinemas (such as a skeleton flying through the hall, directly at the audience, in "House On Haunted Hill", for example). Seeing his films in all their glory would therefore require a film technician and cinema owner willing to restore all these gimmicks, which is unfortunately never going to happen. But even without these gimmicks, "13 Ghosts" is a great fun flick that no fan of Classic Horror films should miss. Buck Zorba, a museum employee and family man with monetary problems inherits a mansion from his eccentric uncle Cyrus. Cyrus, a scientist whose field of research was the supernatural, had the strange hobby of collecting ghosts... Even though more fun than uncanny, 13 Ghosts has several eerie scenes, especially the film's climax is quite creepy. Other than "House On Haunted Hill", however, this delightfully camp spooky tale was in for some improvements. It is therefore too bad that the 2001 remake was a missed opportunity, and more or less a piece of crap that hasn't any of the charms of the original (Even more so as the "House on Haunted Hill" remake of 1999 was basically a tribute to the original, which made it very enjoyable). My advice: Stick with the original and have great fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky Classic Horror Film, Stands Up Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family inherits a mansion owned by the father's uncle, a reclusive ghost hunter who allegedly trapped numerous ghosts from around the world in his home. Days after moving in, they are faced with two parallel narratives: how do they rid themselves of the troublesome ghosts and where is the fortune said to be hidden in the walls of the house? It may take the solution of one to find the other.Today, most viewers are probably more familiar with the remake than this William Castle classic. And that's unfortunate. The remake is scary in its own right, with some nasty bloodletting. But for the time period the original came out in, it's also creepy. I was already on edge during the opening credits where the thirteen ghosts were shown in order... some of which are rather disgusting. And when they return throughout the movie (where they can only be seen when someone puts on special goggles) they are again creepy. There's an especially tense scene with a ghostly lion who traps the son, and another with an "apparition" (somehow different from a ghost, but not explained) that's like a rotting Swamp Thing.The plot is rather good, and I was surprised with how the film blended a horror film and a family story. It was "Leave It To Beaver" gone wrong. In one scene we have ghosts throwing knives and in another there's a playful boy riding the banister. And then, completely unexpected, the father encourages the children to play the Ouija "game"... something I cannot imagine happening in real life.Interestingly, Margaret Hamilton appears as a "witch". She is probably best known for playing the Wicked Witch of the West in "Wizard of Oz". Intentional casting job?The blood of the remake is gone, as are the over-the-top ghosts. But this one is no less powerful today and in many ways has a charm that couldn't be duplicated today. At least not without losing a million dollars at the box office. No torture, no sex... just a good ghost story from a notable horror director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>re: the ghost viewer in the story context</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason why the ghost viewer is destroyed at the end (besides the obvious one of sequel-blocking). Cyrus, Hilda, and Medea are all uneasy with the whole idea of ghosts, and so would have no use for it; and Buck doesn't really seem to need it--note that he's sensitive to certain of the ghosts even without the viewer! Also, certain of the ghosts, such as Shadrack the Great and Dr. Plato Zorba, seem to be equally sensitive to Buck's presence: Shadrack, for instance, beckons to him to come closer as he tries to retrieve his head from the ghost lion, and... This is difficult to see, between the makeup and the fact that he's fading out, but if you watch VERY closely at the denouement, you can see that not only is Plato turning his head toward Buck as he fades out, but there is the beginning of a smile on his face (understandably--after all, Buck's his grandnephew, and he's just saved Buck from the bad guy!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great B Halloween Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another William Castle film who directed many horror films which were of a B quality and very low-budget with all kinds of special glasses for the audiences to use in order to view special effects on the movie screen. In this film a young couple inherit a haunted house just as this young couple are having their furniture removed from their home for non-payment of bills. There lawyer informs them that they have a haunted house on their hands and makes no bones about telling them all about it. The couple and their son moved into this house and start having all kinds of problems and also Margaret Hamilton from "The Wizard of Oz" 1939 appears in this film as the maid which adds more thrills and chills to this great Halloween Film. This film is more of a comedy than a horror film and really a very horrible B Film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual, I'm in the minority on this one. This was an atmospheric, creepy little movie with some well-placed humor scattered here and there. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't as good as the hype.The story here was inferior, in my opinion, to the remake. The remake held all the best elements from this original, except the "witch" references, that is. Those are humorous references to the Wizard of Oz. I won't say more, for those of you who haven't seen this original work.If you've nothing else to do, this is definitely worth your time, but if you haven't seen the remake, watch it after. It's bigger. It has a more involved story, generates some great atmosphere, and still delivers awesome graphic eye candy.I'd still rate this about a 7.3/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe it or not, I still have my "Ghost Viewer" from when 13 Ghosts first came out it theaters. I bought the video and was disappointed when the option to view the ghosts or not wasn't offered. A little technology, some cardboard and red and blue cellophane could have brought back a real classic. I grew up with the B pictures of the 50's. Thirteen Ghosts was always one of my favorites. I never would have imagined Martin Milner as the "bad guy." I was just a kid at the time--a kid with a canopy bed. The scene where Milner gets squashed by the descending canopy gave me something to think about. When I spotted the video it was a must have. Great memories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly fun time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happen to have grown up with this movie. In the eighties, it was a staple on the "Midnight Creature Feature" and it gave me chills. Then,come the VCR era, I happened on it at a small home town video store. Well, you can bet it came home with me. I wore out four copies of it before my son was born in the early nineties. Soon as he saw it, he too was hooked and five years later it is a staple.The story is pretty simple. A man inherits a haunted house and must discover the secret of it before time runs out. But it is so much deeper. There is the wide eyed innocent, his son, the heroine in danger, his daughter. The support, his wife, and villains that have nothing at all to do with ghosts. Plus Margaret Hamilton who is just the best at looking like she'd rather take a bite out of your face as look at you.You, a bowl of popcorn and 13 ghosts in a dark room and you too will see the brilliance of William Castle. Even without the special glasses, this movie is cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AMC recently aired this on television, no special viewer needed to see the ghosts. Even taking into account how much the special effects industry has advanced in the 41 years since this movie was filmed it was still scary. Margaret Hamilton was perfection as Elaine, the creepy housekeeper that comes with the house. The family members went all out with their lines, facial expressions and interactions with the ghosts - bottom line, it is still a scary movie but so much fun to watch and now a permanent addition to my movie collection.It may be that when this movie was new and people were seeing it for the first time the effects were quite frightening. When you watch the movie today, compared to the special effects we're used to seeing, it comes off as spectacularly cheesy, reveling in all it's glory as an icon of the times. That alone is reason enough to see it at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"13 Ghosts" Was So Scary That I Forgot To Be Scared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly can't say that I am at all impressed with William Castle as a director of low-budget horror films from the 1950s &amp; 60s.I continually find Castle's direction to be noticeably flat and, oftentimes, quite unimaginative. If you ask me, Castle seemed to possess no real distinctive directing style, whatsoever. And he certainly didn't appear to understand the genre of horror at all.I got the clear impression that Castle viewed horror as being nothing but a joke and something to be jeered and sneered at. And so, with Castle playing horror strictly for laughs that, of course, left us (the unsuspecting &amp; gullible audience) as the direct brunt of his dumb jokes.As a director, William Castle had about all of the skills (and motivation) of a used-car salesman who was knowingly selling his customers junk. In other words, Castle was a shyster as a director (and an amateur at that).From its bad pacing, to its red herrings, to its poorly executed moments of horror &amp; suspense - 13 Ghosts, pretty much, played out like a very dimwitted TV Sit-Com.Like, if this was really supposed to be a story about a house that was being haunted by 12 authentic ghosts, then it was one of the most tame and non-scary hauntings that I've ever seen.Anyways - When it comes to seriously considering William Castle as a noteworthy director - All I can see is an "Alfred Hitchcock" wannabe who obviously couldn't cut the horror-movie mustard - Not even with his lame-brained "gimmicks" as his biggest selling point.</fullReview>

Although it is nothing compared to todays graphics it is quite impressive at hiding the floating wires and what not.

		<fullReview>Cyrus Zorba works at a local museum but is having trouble providing for his wife and two children. Their furniture has been repossessed and they're not too sure what they're going to do when lawyer Ben Rush tells Buck his late uncle, Doctor Zorba, has recently died and left him his house. The doctor, they are told, had perfected a way to collect ghosts. There are currently 12 living in the house, but the doctor's diary had stated there is space for a 13th.....In the fifties, it was all suits and politeness in William Castle horror movies, and the inclusion of him giving instructions at the beginning of the movie, just adds that extra bit of absurdity to the proceedings.Back in the day, this would have been the equivalent of watching Gravity in IMAX, but now, the gimmick really hinders the narrative.The main problem is that the film just isn't scary, and the fact that they prepare you for a ghost, ruins it a little bit more.I'm not for remakes, but the update of this is much better, even if that is all flashy editing and Shannon Elizabeth, at least its entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a man is willed a house from his dead uncle, the family eagerly move in. They are told of ghosts that roam the grounds of the manor, but shrug it off. They quickly realize the ghosts are there and apparently want to hurt them, but they have nowhere to go and decide to stay... The fun times follow.OK William Castle has had his moments, but he always tried to hard. His silly gimmicks were a waste of time and suckered people into the theatres, but often let them down. Now 50 years later, its dated bad and only has the cheesy factor keeping it alive.Everything about this movie is funny and great to laugh at. The acting was so bad in this film, but not by bad actors only by instruction from a silly director. The actors are great. Charles Herbert playing the kid was something Castle insisted on, he was in so many movies back then and was a big screen kid actor everyone knew. Martin Milner was so over the top funny in this, unintentionally of course, when his character was telling young Buck about keeping secrets the look on his face was priceless, I could not stop laughing. It was also a cute and wise choice to have Margaret Hamilton as the housekeeper here, they all called her a witch and she was the wicked witch on The Wizard Of Oz in 39.The funniest thing was how the family didn't believe in ghosts, but kept seeing them and acting nonchalant about it as if they still didn't believe. A real family would've gotten out the first night.Castle always tried so hard to make good horror movies, but he always had ideas he could not pull off on screen. You have to have suspense to make it scary and he just could not grasp that concept. Silly ghost images and loud noises only came off as dumb and nothing more. This movie although many consider 3-d was actually not, it was Illusion O which had both colors saw through the same eye as opposed to 3-d having one color per eye. This gimmick made the ghosts show up a little better in theatres but you can see the ghosts with the naked eye, although you won't care.I just think that a lot of great horror movies came out with much lower budgets so there is no excuse for this one being so bad. I didn't hate it because it was cheesy and laughable but it is supposed to be a horror movie and it is far from being horrifying. Watch it for laughs and cheesy acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah. Not so good. 13 Ghosts is one of those rare times when the original was much improved upon by a remake (Thir13en Ghosts from 2001), and that's not saying much. Sometimes it's easy to get into a line of thinking that newer is better, for example, and then classics such as Gone With The Wind or It's A Wonderful Life show us that newer is definitely not always better. On the flip side, watching some of today's undeserved box office hits like Sex And The City or Beverly Hills Chihuahua make me think "I just don't think they ever got this bad in the good ole days." Well, once again it's proved that there are good movies and there are bad movies in every year since the invention of "moving pictures". Pretty bad acting and special effects plagued this movie throughout and I should have taken away more points from the Sets/Props category with those ridiculous glasses (goggles?) that they used throughout the film. Even though I very much understand that it can get much worse, this movie was just dull. If you want to see some better efforts from director William Castle, check out Strait-Jacket, The Tingler, or Homicidal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hokey Halloween scare for kids...bad acting...poor script...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You really have to have the mentality of an eight-year old to appreciate this hokey bit of nonsense from William Castle. The acting is also on a grade school level with Donald Woods giving a totally wooden performance in the leading role, looking like a worried Dana Andrews type as he confronts what seems to be a house haunted by many spirits. No wonder his career suffered after this exposure.The idea may have been made into a really plausible, tight little thriller, but such possibilities are never realized. The suspense here is hardly maintained beyond one frightening scene early on. After that, the acting and script are so bad you can hardly believe you're watching professional actors go through their paces. Even the usually reliable Rosemary de Camp is out of her element here. Martin Milner makes us see why he was never cast in another villainous role. Only the little boy has a naturalness that eludes all of the others, seeming to enjoy his make believe role.The bad acting is contagious. Poor Margaret Hamilton has a witless part to contend with. She cannot for one moment make us believe in her character. Unbelievably bad acting sinks the entire movie. A big thumbs down on this one--unless, as I said, you're a toddler. Kids will probably love it for a good Halloween scare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best of the classic William Castle "gimmick" films. As previously mentioned, this film was originally released in "Illusion-O", which meant that the ghost scenes were tinted with blue backgrounds, while the ghosts were red. Audiences were given cardboard viewers with two strips of colored celluloid. The red strip blocked the background out, and accentuated the ghosts, while the blue background blocked out the ghosts and blended them in with the background. A message at the bottom of the screen indicated when to "use" and "remove" the viewer.However, even in the standard black and white version, this is a highly enjoyable film for those looking for some mild shocks and laughs. It's a pretty juvenile story, but great fun to watch. The opening titles with the sepulchral screams and ectoplasmic images is memorable, as is the scene where Cyrus encounters the ghosts for the first time, in a hidden room. Also noteworthy is the music score by Von Dexter, who composed for many of Castle's horror films. It lends an extra air of eerieness to the whole thing. And be sure to look fast for the image of the "13th ghost" just before the door closes at the end. Definitely a fun film for those who like the genre, and especially for fans of the great William Castle.</fullReview>

The whole look of this film is not as primitive as I had imagined. And the lighting was conducive for a chill and a shiver or two. Even without the original colored viewing glasses, you get just enough glimpse of the ghosts to make the movie fulfilling.A very small cast. Some of the over acting is actually funny.

		<shortDescription>Interesting horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this back when I was 6 years old. At the time the movies were in to using gimmicks. The gimmick for this movie was a "viewer" that the audience would hold up to see the ghost. It had 2 shades a blue one for seeing the ghost and red one to avoid seeing the ghost (or visa versa). I enjoyed it very much and was lucky enough to purchase a copy of the movie on video tape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the sort of silly fun you'd expect from a William Castle horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle's horror films from the late 50s and into the 60s were generally cheesy fun. They had no illusions about being deep entertainment and the silliness was intensified by Castle's introductions to the films as well as gimmicks like Illusion-O and Percepto. To many, they are just dumb but they also brought in the crowds and resulted in films that have a certain campy charm.13 GHOSTS is cheesy fun and in this case Castle's big gimmick was Illusion-O--special lenses that supposedly let you see ghosts--just like the people in the film saw them when they wore the professor's special glasses. Subtle, it ain't--but it is pretty corny fun.The film begins with a professor and his wife lamenting about his terribly low salary. That night when the youngest is blowing out his birthday cake (in a home with almost no furniture--it's all been repossessed), he wishes for a nice furnished house. Almost immediately, they receive word that they are to inherit a haunted house owned by an uncle who they don't even know. The only stipulation is that they occupy the home for one year. But, because the house is so haunted and filled with screaming banshees and flying objects, it seems very unlikely that they'll stay for the year--let alone more than a few days.Aside from the family, the home is occupied by the housekeeper, Elaine. This part is played by Margaret Hamilton and Castle deliberately exploited her past role as the Wicked Witch of the West (in the WIZARD OF OZ) and her character is spooky and weird.There is one other major character, a lawyer played by Martin Milner. He seems like a nice guy and is the man who is the executor of the crazy uncle's estate.All in all, it's a well made film with very modest pretensions. It's not meant to be THAT scary and it sure isn't meant to be Shakespeare--just solid entertainment.By the way, this film is bundled with a Castle dud, 13 FRIGHTENED GIRLS. Ignore this film but by all means watch the many excellent DVD extras--especially the short film about Illusion-O.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad story, but Castle junks it up with his silly gimmickry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amiable William Castle thriller, portions of which are filmed in Illusion-O (a sub-par variation of 3-D), has a likable but financially-troubled modern family inheriting a haunted mansion from Dad's deceased uncle--Dr. Zorba! Seems the good doctor had "captured" 11 ghosts and was in the process of photographing them with his special equipment when he himself became Ghost #12. Pleasantly set in Los Angeles, and with Joseph Biroc's crisp black-and-white cinematography, "13 Ghosts" looks great and has a couple of funny/spooky moments. Unfortunately, Castle isn't as smooth a director as he is a film producer and his pacing tends to drag. Also, the stop-and-start momentum before the effects sequences are disappointing and amateurish, and Castle's ghosts probably looked primitive even when the film came out in 1960. Still, it's an old-fashioned creep-show, perfect for ghost-crazy youngsters, providing a moral twist and a reassuring wink at the finish line. Remade in 2001. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stultifying film about a house full of ghosts. *Dreadful* script and bad acting, even by Castle's standards. It's hard to even laugh at this one -- most unsatisfying special effects (although it'd probably be more fun if the special glasses were still needed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the Magic of "Illusion-O"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle was renowned for showman gimmicks to which he gave cheesy names, such as "Percept-O," "Fright Break," and "Emerg-O." Although some of these effects were pretty silly, some were fairly complicated--and most of them relied upon the communal nature of a theatre audience for effect. Consequently, a contemporary viewer sitting in the comfort of the living room simply doesn't have much opportunity to experience a Castle film as it was originally presented.But there is one exception. The gimmick for Castle's 13 GHOSTS was "Illusion-O," which required the audience to use color filters (available at the box office) similar to 3-D glasses to see the ghosts in the film. Until recently, all available prints of 13 GHOSTS have been shown in simple black and white with the ghosts always visible, but the recent DVD release restores the tint process, and now (assuming your DVD edition includes the glasses) you too can have the fun of a William Castle film right in your own home.Like most Castle films, the story is very basic. A financially strapped family inherits a house, and unless they actually agree to reside in it the property goes to the state. But the house is also residence to 11 ghosts "collected" by the previous owner, and his death raised the number to 12. Now all of them are out to add another to their number. Who will the victim be? The script, the design, the cinematography, and the story are just as hokey as they can be, but the cast--which includes Margaret Hamilton of "OZ" fame--plays it very straight and even without the Illusion-O process the film is a cult favorite.But Illusion-O puts the icing on top. Periodically, a caption flashes on the screen instructing you to look through the viewer. Look through the red filter, and Poof! There are ghosts galore. Look through the blue filter, and Poof! Ghosts be Gone! Now, strictly speaking, you don't actually have to look through anything to see the ghosts--they are fairly visible without squinting through that little red lense--but it does add a tremendous amount of fun to the whole thing.But don't go planning that ghost-viewing party just yet. The original DVD release included a single "ghost viewer"--and current purchasers report that later DVD editions contain none at all. Still, the viewers are fairly easy to find on the internet, and since this may be your only chance to see a William Castle film as it was intended to be seen--well, if you are a Castle fan you'll probably want to go to the trouble. Whatever the case, it's all silly, campy fun.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"13 Ghosts" is one of Mr William Castle's creakier movies. The story is just about reasonable and the acting is equally average throughout. What was drive-in fodder 45 years ago is really only of interest now because of the "Illusion-O" gimmick where the eponymous ghosts appear and disappear. These were of course just colour sequences overlaid on a static background, which required similarly coloured viewing glasses to be effective. Neat idea, but sadly most prints in circulation do not include the coloured sequences and are black-and-white throughout. As a result the film falls rather flat (although I believe the recent DVD issue restores the gimmick).If you are looking to see one of the better Castle movies, I would wholly recommend "Straitjacket" instead. No gimmicks, apart from an elderly Joan Crawford hamming it up with gusto, but a whole lot more entertaining. "13 Ghosts" is for completists only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat creepy but mostly dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An all American family (with two kids named Buck and Medea!) move into a creepy old house they inherited. It comes with a sinister housekeeper (Margaret Hamilton) and 12 ghosts. However there is going to be one more ghost added...This wowed me on TV when I was a kid. I found it silly but the sound effects and ghosts were cool--if kind of hard to see. I was lucky enough to see it back on Halloween night in 1999. A revival theatre showed it with the Illusion-o glasses! I finally saw that the ghosts were filmed in color--on TV they're in b&amp;w like the rest of the film--and you don't really need the glasses to see them. I also discovered that childhood memories die hard. I found the movie incredibly dull with bad acting and plot holes galore. The sound effects still spooked me and the color ghosts were cool--but that's only a very small part of the film. Also the print I just saw on TCM STILL has the ghosts in b&amp;w! If you can see it with the ghosts in color it's somewhat fun, but mostly this is a snoozer. I did notice one funny bit--the house they inherit was the same one used a few years later for the TV show "The Munsters"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never could figure out if this was a black comedy or a serious spook flic. Either way it was one of the goofiest, cornball attempts at film making I've seen lately. The plot was more transparent than any of the spirits. The lame acting and overdone facial expressions coupled with the 40 year old special effects made for a real yawner. This junk would give Anton Phibes nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I'd hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the acting was great but the story was boring. I'm someone who doesn't care for black and white movies because I know they will not have violence or gore This is why they have remakes because the old stuff just didn't cut. Floating fabric and flashy skeletons are not scary. Maybe they were scary for their time but they are still wack! Even though the acting was OK the characters just didn't bring me into in the movie, and I eventually just stopped caring. It wasn't worth anymore of my time. I'm glad they remade this. Also if you plan on watching the copy on here I warn you that you need the special glasses in order to somewhat enjoy it. It was hard to make out the ''scary'' images that were being shown on the house walls. Maybe that's why I thought this was a bore. You would think they would make a copy of the movie where you didn't need the 3D glasses. But I guess they didn't take THAT into consideration. Pfft!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel I must start by saying I probably will be slightly biased in this user comment, as I watched this movie on a big cinema screen, during a little festival paying homage to director William Castle where we received those original blue &amp; red "Illusion-O" spectacles in order to see and/or don't see the ghosts appear on screen. To experience a movie like this, with its original gimmicks and inside a theater chock-full of like-minded fans, inevitably leads to wildly enthusiast comments and a more forgiving attitude towards the flaws. Because, in all honesty, "13 Ghosts" is one of William Castle's lesser accomplishments, especially compared to his more substantial films like "The Tingler" and "Homicidal". This movie entirely revolves on Castle's stratagem that he introduced and explained at the beginning of the movie himself, but otherwise there's almost no plot and the characters are horribly wooden walking stereotypes. The story seemingly has so much potential frights and engaging sub plots, but Castle ignored them all in favor of jazzing up more sequences with ghosts &amp; goggles. The traditional all-American Zorba family lives on the edge of poverty when, suddenly and out of the blue, the liberating news comes that they inherited crazy uncle Zorba's gigantic mansion with all furniture included. The handsome and friendly attorney Ben Rush arranges everything for the Zorbas to go and live there ? and even seduces the pretty teenage daughter ? but nevertheless insists not to stay there for too long. For you see, old uncle Zorba "collected" ghosts as a hobby and ever since his passing the supernatural residents have become incontrollable and disruptive. In all honestly, William Castle should have put slightly more time and effort into the content instead of in the Illusion-O entertainment. Now we're staring at overlong footage of a ghostly lion tamer and his animal, while so many questions remain unanswered. What's the story with this uncle Zorba? Why 13 of them? What dark secrets has that eerie housekeeper Elaine (role of "Wicked Witch of the West" actress Margaret Hamilton!) to hide? But oh well, what else is there to complain about when you're watching an old fashioned low-budgeted, spirited and irresistibly charming ghost movie like this one? Castle managed to generate some genuine moments of suspense, most notably during the séance when Uncle Zorba emerges from a painting himself, and the optical effects were definitely truly inventive for that time. As showman Castle explains during the intro, you don't have to believe in ghosts. If you're a non-believer, just look through the blue strip and you won't suffer from any nightmares. Now that's good marketing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 GHOSTS (William Castle, 1960) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had acquired this one a long time ago as a DivX, but it had playback issues: the sound was fine, but the picture wouldn't show! Recently, it struck me to convert the defective file to DVD-R and, luckily, it worked fine ? despite the fact that the picture still froze in a couple of instances on my sensitive Pioneer DVD model?but, as usual, played without a hitch on the cheaper H&amp;B! Anyway, I had watched the 2001 remake only because my elder brother had lent it to me; like most of William Castle's films of the period, the original had a gimmick to go with it ? "Illusion-O" ? which he instructed on its use in the prologue: the spectator is presented with a ghost viewer which would enable them to choose whether to see the spirits shown in the film or not. Even if Castle says that the spectator should don the viewer whenever the previously black-and-white images turn blue, they are still prodded by on-screen titles to do so before the screen actually changes color and, once again, to remove them when the normal black-and-white images resume! I don't know if looking through the viewer would have really made the ghosts more effective but, as it is, they are barely visible and mostly resort to groans and childish pranks in the pantry! Unlike Castle's previous efforts, 13 GHOSTS emerges {sic} as a spineless {sic} horror movie which is just not scary or campy enough to provide satisfactory entertainment for 90-odd minutes; incidentally, both words followed by "sic" haven't been chosen at random, but rather are intended to evoke memories of two previous Castle creations ? namely the "Emergo" gimmick attached to HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (1958) and the body part on which THE TINGLER (1959) takes form! While the titular ghosts are "introduced" in the animated credits sequence, there is no rhyme or reason to their subsequent apparitions throughout the film, nor are they given any background or characteristics which would have made one become involved in the modern-day family's plight (by the way, the latter are hilariously named Zorba but looking as Greek as a hot dog stand!).The narrative itself is little more than a live-action version of a typical "Scooby-Doo" episode in which a friend of the family attempts to scare them off their haunted property (by dressing up in a hideous mask) in order to get his hands on hidden loot; that the friend of the family turns out to be a previously unknown dashing attorney who happened to take care of their eccentric uncle's estate and is immediately seen taking out the girl of the family on the town is all the more ludicrous. Despite all the mostly negative comments above, the film is still rendered passable enough by the welcome presence of veteran character actress Margaret Hamilton as the family's witch-medium-housekeeper(!). What's more, the film must have been commercially successful anyway ? not only in view of the remake, but also because Castle himself would eventually follow it with a similarly-titled albeit little-seen effort, 13 FRIGHTENED GIRLS (1963)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Ghosts (1960) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Fun, if minor, film from Castle has a poor family moving into an inherited house, which just happens to be haunted by twelve ghosts. The family soon learns that the spirits want a thirteenth one but there's also a fortune someone inside the house. As with a lot of Castle's other films, this one here was sold to the public with a gimmick. Here, the gimmick was some glasses that people would wear in order to see the ghosts whenever they're on the screen. This is certainly a true gimmick as you're able to see them no matter if you have the glasses or not but that doesn't take away from the charm of the picture, which is certainly Castle's best without Vincent Price. I think the film benefits the most from the attractive cast members who really fit their roles perfectly. Donald Woods and Rosemary DeCamp are both very good as the parents and their perfectly fit that "perfect parents" format that ran through television and the movies during this era. Margaret Hamilton, the witch from THE WIZARD OF OZ, is also a lot of fun in her role and the jokes aimed at her and that classic 1939 film are very nice. Charles Herbert turns in fine work as well as the young kid who isn't scared to see a ghost. I think the film could have benefited from a stronger screenplay because there's not too much going on here except for the build up to the next ghost sighting. None of the plot twists are all that shocking but this is still a fine little film that manages to keep the viewer entertained from start to finish.</fullReview>
