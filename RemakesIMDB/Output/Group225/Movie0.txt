		<shortDescription>Hitchcock tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The large part of the fun of watching A Kiss Before Dying is looking out for the number of Hitchcock movie moments the film is paying tribute to: from Psycho's shower shots and the lonesome mother's house our Norman Bates has escaped from, to the bleaching of the heroine and taking the Kim Novak role a la Vertigo with possibly lethal consequences. I was hugely amused and never mind the creaking plot. On a technical level, I loved the Technicolor hue of the film, very Hitchcock period too. I'm not sure why the lead actress, Sean Young, got a double Razzie award for her dual role. It seems undeserved. I'm sure there must have been far worse performances in 1991 to choose from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor Sean Young. Once upon a time she was an actress with such a bright future, poised, seemingly, for great stardom. She even had a quality that recalled some of the glamour and allure of the 40's and 50's. Put to good use in such films as "Blade Runner" and "No Way Out", there seemed nearly no end in sight. And then her "difficult" personality got in the way and Oliver Stone fired her from "Wall Street", in which she was to have a major part; then her alleged relationship with former co-star James Woods, and subsequent "Fatal Attraction"-style antics against him, in addition to her amusingly disturbing all-out efforts to snag the role of 'Catwoman' in the first sequel to "Batman", seemed to have a snowball effect, effectively curtailing her trajectory and reducing her to such projects as "Dr Jekyll and Ms Hyde" and numerous direct-to-cable/video duds. While "A Kiss Before Dying" has a much better pedigree than "Dr Jekyll and Ms Hyde" ever could, thanks in part to being based on a solid, little Ira Levin book and blessed with at least two respected actors (Diane Ladd and Max Von Sydow), it, too, is a near-total failure, and Sean Young is, sadly, a major factor as to 'why'. With a strong director and viable material, she has proved to be a good actor and oddly charismatic, even when the film didn't warrant it (see "Blade Runner"). She was never a GREAT actress, mind you, but had an unmistakable appeal. Here, however, even that appeal seems gone, for nothing can disguise her sleepwalking performance in a dual role as twins, one of whom is murdered (her death scene is brutal), the other of whom decides to investigate the death, never believing it was the suicide it was assumed to be. Soon after her investigation begins, she meets the man who, unbeknownst to her, murdered her sister. This man is played by Matt Dillon, who is supposed to be charming, seductive, secretive, elusive, and ruthless. While one can easily imagine an actor as physically pretty as Robert Wagner - he wasn't just 'handsome', he was 'pretty', let's face it - Matt Dillon is simply wrong, in every manner, for this part. Totally miscast, he is neither particularly charming nor seductive, and seemingly unable to register the ruthlessness and danger the part calls for. His thick, New York accent is also a distraction, at least in this role. That he and Young have absolutely no chemistry doesn't help matters any, making yet another major quibble a minor one: both seem a bit too old. In supporting roles, as Dillon's mother and Young's father, Diane Ladd and Max Von Sydow provide much-needed class to the potboiler/neo-noir proceedings, though Ladd comes off more successfully; Von Sydow is utterly wasted. ANY actor could have done his role - why choose someone SO spectacularly talented for such a thankless part? As for the screenplay, though based on the book, it seems to be stuffed with every cliché from every modern-day thriller, right down to the routine and predictable climax (apparently reshot after test audiences didn't approve) and the pointless, if limited, sex scenes, which might titillate some (thanks to mild nudity) but do nothing to further the plot or add to the tension. The direction, too, is at fault: since everything here is something you've seen before (and in much better films), and nearly each moment is telegraphed well in advance, there are practically zero chills or thrills to be had. Strong actors may have been able to smooth over these problems, but again, the film is done no service by its leads, particularly Young, who is plain AWFUL. It surely stands with Demi Moore in "The Scarlet Letter" and Elizabeth Berkley in "Showgirls" as being one of THE worst performances in a major motion picture - and, perhaps, even WORSE because Young is playing TWO parts. She rightfully won her 2 Razzies (for Worst Actress and Supporting Actress). But, as said, Dillon's not too much better. A little bit but not much. HIS line readings, at least, don't suggest a coma. Unfortunately, for the audience, a coma might just be preferable to sitting through this lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the original better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a few changes, and for reasons known only to themselves, the powers that be remade 1956's "A Kiss Before Dying" in 1991. Now the sisters are twins, and the plot is taken out further - rather than just getting engaged, Ellen now marries the killer. That's not a spoiler - we see him murder her sister in the first reel.The original of this film, with Robert Wagner, Joanne Woodward, Jeffrey Hunter, Virginia Leith and Mary Astor was much more entertaining. This update is boring and acted in a lazy manner by its stars, Sean Young I, Sean Young II, and Matt Dillon. Isn't one Sean Young bad enough, we had to have two of them? Supporting players Diane Ladd and Max von Sydow have precious little to do. The only part I liked was the scene from "Vertigo" on TV - but I do hope the director wasn't trying to compare himself to Hitchcock.I don't understand Hollywood's obsession with remakes, except that I suppose they're cheaper because the studio already owns the property. But a fresh story line here and there wouldn't hurt. On top of which, it is a rare occasion when the remake is actually better. This is not one of those cases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stolen life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read Ira Levin's novel, and having seen the original film, and now this remake, one can only conclude this was a misguided project that doesn't add anything to the basic premise, or expand on it. Director James Dearden, who adapted the material for the screen, made a tactical error in making the Carlsson sisters as identical twins. Then, whoever cast Sean Young in the pivotal role of Ellen/Dorothy needs to have his head examined. Ms. Young, who showed some promise when she started appearing in movies, is totally unconvincing in this movie.The only reason for watching the film is Matt Dillon, who is always an interesting presence on the screen. His Jonathan Corliss, the disturbed young man who resents what life had in store for him, is made to look bad from the beginning. Since Mr. Dearden starts the film at the most crucial point of the story, doesn't give the audience a cause as to why Jonathan acts the way he does. The other tactical error happens when Jonathan, who is not Jay, arrives with Dorothy by car and eliminates the young man who holds the key to the mystery and is going to show Dorothy the year book in which Corliss appears. We don't believe for a moment he was physically able to do the deed. Ditto what happens with Patricia Farren doesn't make sense at all.Mr. Dearden asks a lot from the viewer and he is not too subtle about the way he presents the material. Max Von Sydow is totally wasted and Diane Ladd has only a couple of scenes.Watch the 1956 original directed by Gerd Oswald!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the Fifties 'film noir' of the same name, this movie from the writer of "Fatal Attraction" turns out to be an entertaining and tense thriller about a young man (Matt Dillon) obsessed with a family's wealth and power. Dillon's character, Jonathan Corliss (a part that perhaps could have been played a little 'darker'), proceeds to infiltrate the family via relationships with twin sisters, played well by Sean Young.Although the ending is all too brief, and shock misused where intrigue may have been better, the plot is well handled by James Dearden; especially the first murder, which may surprise those not familiar with the book.Sunday, June 23, 1991 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent remake of the 1956 thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Meeting young Philadelphia collage student Dorothy Carlsson, Sean Young, at that city's municipal buildings marriage license bureau Jonathan Corliss, Matt Dillon, finds the office closed for lunch. Jonathan then talks the madly in love with him Dorothy into going up on the roof to see the sights until the office opens. Chit-chatting with Dorothy about their forthcoming marriage and what her authoritative father copper tycoon Thor Carlsson, Max Von Sydow,would do to her when he found about about it. Jonathan suddenly grabs a shocked Dorothy by her legs and shoves her off the roof and to her death below. Quickly leaving the building Jonathan drops a letter in the mailbox written by Dorothy that's supposed to be a suicide note that he had earlier tricked her into writing.We later learn that Dorothy was made pregnant by Jonathan and the thought of him marrying her with her father cutting Dorothy out of her sizable inheritance was not in his plans. This drove him to murder her in order to keep Mr. Carlsson from finding out about it which he did anyway. What we also learn in what's in Jonathan's sick and devious plans is to go to step two and get to know and romance Dortohy's twin sister Ellen, also played by Sean Young. In this way Jonathan can have her replace the deceased Dorothy as his very rich and future wife.Hitch-hiking to New York City where Ellen works as a volunteer at Castel House, a Covenant House-like shelter for the homeless, Jonathan is picked up Jay Faraday,Adam Horovitz, who we later find out he murdered and stole his identity. In no time at all Jonathan works his way into Ellen's heart getting a job at Castle House and working together with her driving around the drug and crime infested streets of mid-town Manhattan. The two volunteer workers pick up and give hope as well as finding a home for discarded homeless and drug-addicted youths. Unknown to Jonathan Ellen never believed that her sister Dorothy killed herself and with her going out on her own to solve Dorothy's death it will lead to uncovering who her real killer is; Ellen's future husband Jonathan, now known as Jay Faraday, Corliss!Unlike in the original "A Kiss Before Dying" in the updated version Jonathan and Ellen do get married and her finding out about him being her sister's murderer she discovers on her own. Not with the help of the ex-cop and now private investigator Dan Corelli, James Russo, whom she hired. Ellen as well as her father Thor are far more naive about her boyfriend/husband in this version of the movie then in he original with all the clues about Jonathan right in front of them. The most obvious being that Jonathan was using an assumed and stolen, from one of his murder victims, name which by not being able to find that very simple fact out was by far the biggest blunder that Thor Cralsson made in the movie. Were earlier told that Mr. Carlsson was so protective of his daughters that he had anyone who dated them investigated from head to toe. So why couldn't he find out that his future son-in-law was not only an impostor but possibly, with him assuming the name of a missing person, a murderer as well!The ending is by far the best part of the movie far better then the ending of the 1956 version. Even though overall it was not as good as the 1956 original Jonathan gets it a lot worse here in the form of a runaway diesel locomotive; where in the 1956 film he was only done in by an 18 wheeler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is a mixed bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a Matt Dillon fan, or have a curiosity about the dark side of human nature, then you'll enjoy this movie. The biggest problem with this film is there are way too many coincidences. Also, some parts are downright unbelievable. Here are some of the holes: The first murder: it's hard to believe that if you murder someone on the rooftop of a high-rise building that someone from a nearby building wouldn't have seen anything and reported it to the police. Why wouldn't the cops check for prints on the victim's shoes or purse? Why wouldn't they take a DNA sample from the fetus in order to determine the father of the unborn child? The second murder: what did Jonathan do with Jay's body? Why wouldn't the cops check for prints on Jay's car? Why wouldn't millionaire Carlsson have investigated the background of "Jay Farraday" and discovered discrepancies with Jonathan's alter-ego? The third murder: how could the killer work in New York, but find the exact moment to follow his girlfriend to Philadephia? How was he able to see what kind of car the murder victim was driving, and then go back to his own car so that he could follow him to his apartment? The fourth murder: the detective traced the victim's call to the killer's phone and could have seen how many minutes they spoke, yet did not ask for the killer's alibi. Dorothy just happened to be listening when her old acquaintance's murder was announced on the radio. Wouldn't the killer have been smart enough to weigh down the suitcase with the sliced up body and wrap it up so that it wouldn't come open in the ocean? He had an incinerator in his building. Why wouldn't he use it? The worst coincidences: the killer could murder a sister, then go to her identical twin and have her fall in love with him and marry him. What are the odds in a city of 7 million people and thousands of restaurants of Jonathan/Jay running into a former co-worker from another city at the same time that he had Dorothy with him (a rarity in itself)?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent plot, marred by awful acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For this type of thriller, this movie is entirely average. The plot and overall theme is decent enough, but the film loses any potential it might have by featuring such lousy acting. Even Max von Sydow, who is a veteran and is normally an excellent actor was disappointing in this. The only actor who did even a decent job was Matt Dillon. The film also has a bad pace, it's far too slow; in fact, it's incredibly slow and boring, for such a short film; it's just over 90 minutes, yet I can't bring myself to sit through the entire thing again(I did once, but ever since then I haven't been able to do so). The climax in the film is also below average, and flat-out boring. The supposed twist-in-the-end was lame, and not to mention far too easy to figure out. Also, the film introduces the villain far too early, in my opinion. Five minutes into the film, you knew who you were gonna root against. That's just too early. The film lacks any real surprises, as well as any great qualities. The few scenes detailing the psychopath's gruesome murders are decent, but lacks any real intensity or excitement, simply because you know exactly what will happen. As far as thrillers go, this is average and entirely forgettable. I recommend it only to the biggest of thriller fans. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Kiss Before Dying is a remake, telling the story of a driven successful executive who murders a wealthy young girl, and than plots to marry and than murder her twin sister so that he can inherit a fortune from her father's huge cooperation.Matt Dillon does a wonderful job as as the sinister youthful executive, who uses good looks, charm, and incredible manipulation to lure unsuspecting victims into his next con game. Dillon gives all the right moods and tone settings to his character. Matt makes the movie. The problem is the acting by the other characters, even the very talented Max Von Sydow is wasted and superficial. Sean Young, who plays the roles of both twin daughters doesn't bring enough suspense or energy to the part. Her vulnerabilities and weaknesses are demonstrated early on, making her even easier pray for Dillan's character.However, the movie isn't as bad as some of the other reviewers have mentioned. It's a good little mystery flick to watch once or twice when it comes on just to see Matt Dillan's excellent performance. However, the lack of energy or suspense from the other characters indicates that they would rather be somewhere else than in this picture.A Kiss Before Dying is a pretty good movie, but nowhere near what it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this film and was greatly disappointed. The plot seemed enthralling at first, but as the film progressed it seemed more like a bad tv movie than a major motion picture. A poorly developed story, actors the worst this side of green acres, and bad continuity all contributed to the movie's lackluster quality. The only attribute was Matt Dillon , who gave a nice portrayal of a nice guy/psychopath. I would only recommend this flick to moviegoers who enjoy Dillon's performances (as do I).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "a kiss before dying" couldn't even begin to do the book justice and had no magnatism to it whatsoever. Most people who read the book will probably concede it was better and if you haven't seen this movie and are thinking of it-don't read the book before hand or you will be sorely disappointed. Read it afterward and see what a mess they made of the movie.The acting here was not convincing(no offence to Matt Dillion) but how much better would this have been if Ed Norton played the psycho? The book was pretty darn scary, the movie is your typical horror-and a bad one at that.Maybe I was spoiled by the book, but even had there not been an original book this movie just didn't have anything to it to make it stand out and with the ADDED bonus of there having been a book in the first place it only succeeds in detracting from the movie's allure. Not the worst thriller ever made but far from the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one of my favorite cartoon characters once said, "It was awful. Worse than awful. It reeked. It oozed badness from every pore...Well, maybe not THAT bad, but Lord it wasn't good." Loads of bad acting. I can't imagine why. Matt Dillon is a good actor. I was actually watching to see Ben Browder (currently of Farscape). Even he was less than stellar. I'll attribute it to bad writing (Ouch! And me an aspiring writer). At any rate, the plot of the movie was acceptable. I like a good murder mystery (even if it wasn't that much of mystery to the audience). This is definitely a movie that would have benefited from a better director, writer, editor, producer, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average compact drama with dying acting ala: Young</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this average by the numbers film a couple of time. I don't think it could really be anymore predictable. You know what's gonna happen each scene after the next. Starting with a thrilling and bloody drop, what follows is a sort of melodrama packed into a movie with music themes, familiar to those used in The Silence Of The Lambs. With his mother pushing him to be a success in life, after attending college, a young budding career minded guy, Jonathan (Matt Dillon) resorts to killing his ex fiancée as becoming pregnant, as rich Daddy (a fine Max Von Sydow) will cut her out of the will, and money hungry Dillon, can't have that. Now we see he's masquerading as a lover with the sister of the deceased, who's really the only one who believes her sister's suicide was a murder instead, where she can't let go, hence creating problems for Dillon, forced to get bloody again, and you thriller fans know how it goes. Entertainment wise, I still very much enjoy AKBD, sadly the most exciting part, the start with a blood splashing drop, and some of Dillon's expressions, will send chills up your spine. What's awfully familiar here, if not surprising, is the novel was written by the same woman, who wrote the novel, Sliver, from which a bad movie spawned, with a much similar, less blood splattering opening. Dillon has always been a good actor and never lacks, and nor has he done so here. It's Young, who just lazily utilizes character acting, where here was a chance as an actress, to show how versatile she could be, and it seems, she doesn't really care here. Take a leaf out of Van Dammne's book in Double Impact, honey. As playing the two sisters, and I won't even wrack my brain, trying to remember the names. Both characters, are annoying, especially the first one, where I didn't really care much for her acting and her character in the second, prime one, I was glad to see the first go. It's Diane Ladd who stole the acting gold here as Dillon's mother. I liked the fact, James Russo was in this, and did enjoy his scenes, where too, I got the feeling as an actor, he didn't really wanna be there, though did us solid. Here's still a drama thriller to kill time, but after seeing it, may'be even you feel like dropping Young from a towering zenith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Realising his secret girlfriend Dorothy's pregnancy will sour her relations with her rich father, career-minded student Jonathan murders her, making it look like suicide. He then moves to New York to make a move on her twin Ellen, and soon, they marry.All seems to go well for him, although Ellen's continued investigations into what she is convinced was no suicide forces him to kill again......Erotic thrillers were released every week in the late eighties and nineties, and as you'd expect, there were a load of stinkers between the golden nuggets, and for every time Michael Douglas popped up, Madonna popped out in Body Of Evidence...This falls somewhere between the two, a quick remake of a classic movie to make a few million, but this, unfortunately, is woefully miscast.Dillon is usually a great actor, but as the film goes on, and he becomes increasingly more suspicious, he seems to channel the T-1000, because he just turns up at any old place, says nothing, and kills, and this is for over half of the film.Young, well she plays dual roles, and if like myself, you were relieved when one of her roles ended quickly, wait until you meet the mirror opposite sister, all quiet, timid, but never too busy to take her clothes off.Nothing's ever really explained as to why he is like he is, although it's hinted that his father may have thrown himself under a train belonging to Youngs dad, but the film is in too much of a hurry to get to the next titillating scene to give a clear enough explanation.But the film is very visceral with its portrayal of violence, and two key death scenes are extremely brutal, as these sort of films usually concentrate on the love scenes.All in all its an average affair, but watchable fluff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Kiss Before Dying neo-noir film that was a remake of the 1956 film of the same title.It stars Matt Dillon,Sean Young,Diane Ladd and Max von Sydow.The film was written and directed by James Dearden,who based it on the novel of the same name by Ira Levin.The story focuses on Jonathan Corliss,who is a poor college student with aspirations of wealth. Since childhood he has been obsessed with the fortunes of a company called Carlsson Copper. While a student at the University of Pennsylvania, he plans to ingratiate himself with the wealthy family of magnate Thor Carlsson and has begun secretly dating Carlsson's daughter Dorothy. When Dorothy learns that she's pregnant, she informs Jonathan that she'll be cut off without her inheritance when her father learns the truth. Jonathan decides to murder her, and makes it look like a suicide; then he moves to New York. There, he makes the acquaintance of Ellen Carlsson,the late Dorothy's twin sister, and begins courting her.This time he is more successful, winning Ellen's hand in marriage and a powerful position in his new father-in-law's company. However, Ellen has long been suspicious of the circumstances surrounding her twin's death, and she probes deeper into the supposed suicide. She uncovers alarming facts about some other murders and the identity of her sister's unknown lover.Although the performances of Dillon,Ladd and von Sydow should be given merit,the same could not be said of Young in her dual role as Dorothy and Ellen.Aside from that,the movie lacks suspense all throughout as the filmmakers weren't able to transfer the tension-filled story on screen.In the end,the 1991 remake fails to live up to the greatness of the 1956 movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie from start to finish. Dillon and Young have a sick chemistry that works well. Dillon is very convincing as the killer without a conscience...every movement and word he utters seems authentic. Young plays the aristocratic nonconformist very well. You actually believe she is throwing away a life of luxury to be a social worker. Dillon's manipulative ways cast everyone under his spell, but ultimately, Young's character is more than a match for him. The way Dillon's character brutally and straightforwardly kills people, so purposefully and without hesitation or compassion, is very chilling. Th film was very well-paced, tight, suspenseful, and involving. Von Sydow and the rest of the supporting cast were brilliant. The detective, who was no Kojak or Columbo, was revealed to be just a dullard, yet he was the only person Young could confide in. She didn't even need him. Excellent movie that will hold your interest throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average thriller and a fantastic Matt Dillon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when a person is so motivated to go to any lengths to achieve his dream it's depicted as a good thing. But when that person is Jonathan Corliss (Dillon), it's a nightmare for those who care about him and bloody executions for those who stand in his way.Matt Dillon's performance as a charming psychopath is what works very well in "A Kiss Before Dying". Corliss, a blue collar Philadelphia lad with huge ambitions, sets his sights on a Copper Baron's (Max Von Sydow) empire and plans to become a member of the family. When it becomes necessary to dispose of the Baron's daughter (Sean Young), Corliss (under an alias) moves on to her twin sister (Young again) and enters the family. But hiding his tracks and his former life proves quite the hassle and Corliss has no reservations with killing every one who stands in his way of greatness in the Copper business.A double doze of Sean Young is a bit too much to take; she's simply an astonishingly bad actress but Dillon more than makes up for that. His Jonathan Corliss is a very memorable psychopath. It's never made crystal clear as to why he set his sights solely on Von Sydow's empire but his journey on the way is suspenseful. It's not a very graphic film but it does have some very nasty moments and disturbing death scenes.Director Dearden makes no attempts in admitting his affection for Alfred Hitchcock and some moments here are obviously a tribute to the old master of suspense. The ending does feel a bit rushed but overall "A Kiss Before Dying" is an above average thriller with some striking and memorable set pieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For five and a half bucks, how can anyone say this is a bad movie? "A Kiss Before Dying" is a sub-par thriller which is predictable to the point of being laughable. I agree that this isn't the best movie ever made, but it's far from the worst. I was easily taken by Sean Young's performance. She did rather well for the material she was given. The same goes for Matt Dillon, this role proved that he's adept at playing a slimeball. The other name of fame is Max Von Sydow and I wasn't annoyed by his performance. He was on screen for only two or three minutes at a time. What I really liked was the instinct and persistence of Sean Young's character. She put her nose to the grindstone and did not let go of it. By the end, I was glad to see her character was finally vindicated of its nagging doubts. The ending was clunky but correct. As a few of you have stated before, the performances were stiff and Young and Dillon had little chemistry between them. I wish James Dearden and his producers could have worked out the bugs before submitting a finished product. The writing was decent since the story was easy to follow and the eventual outcomes could be predicted far in advance. By my logic, this is your standard, by-the-numbers remake of a classic thriller. The product we're given is decent but far from complete. I give it a score of six.Here ends my rant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't dwell on the badness of this film. That was evident. But as an indictment of 90s fashion I don't think this film has a peer. In fact, to those who haven't seen the film and are interested in fashion, rent it, watch it with the sound off and just enjoy the pure platonic horribleness of the clothes Sean Young wears. From the kitschy Santa Fe style jackets to the high waisted pants to the lumberjack shirts it's a non-stop parade of unflattering fashion don'ts that upstages every scene and that, obviously, is a good thing. A friend blames Ralph Lauren for the "western" look that achieved a gender-reversed funhouse mirror image of clothes men wore in the 1950s. (Not actual men of course. Just the ones you see in old shirt ads). Who knows? But clearly the costume director picked clothes they thought a wealthy young woman might find appealing at the time. What's amazing is that a relatively recent film could induce so many head-scratching, what-in-the-world were they thinking fashion moments. Afterthought: maybe it was a director's ploy to divert attention from everything else in this lame movie. Afterthought two: maybe it was the costume director's revenge on Sean Young's bad behavior during the film. And don't get me started on the hairstyles...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ambitous Matt Dillion marries wealthy Sean Young, but his intentions are murderous and he is after her money.Well done thriller is sexy, stylish, and fun and pays plenty of homage to the grand master of suspense Hitchcock. Two complaints though, Max Von Sydow's downright embarrassing perfromance and the ending feels a bit rushed. (It was changed at the last minute by the studio after the original ending didn't play well with test audiences.) My rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do they do it? Just because a film was made once in the fifties, someone thinks they need to remake it with today's hot stars. At least they could improve on the story.The most glaring hole in this version is the fact that the father (Max von Sydow) hired a private detective to investigate the boyfriend of his daughter, and yet he declined to investigate the boyfriend of his other daughter, both played by Sean Young, which would have exposed the plot.Matt Dillon plots to have it all and has to do some things that just stretch us beyond belief to get there. He just seems to be in the right place at the right time just once or twice too often for my tastes.I fell in love with Sean Young when she did No Way Out back in 1987. I haven't seen much of her lately and understand that she has not been doing so well. I thought she was good in this role and think that she has been unfairly criticized.Still, I believe film noir is best watched in films of the fifties and remakes just don't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Johnathon Corliss (Matt Dillon) uses his hidden intelligence to hatch a scheming plot. Since childhood, his gifts have gone unappreciated and, on the railtrack outside his window, he sees the Carlson company trains go rolling by and dreams of one day being as rich as him and hatches a scheming plot to worm his way into the family fortune. First, he dates Carlson's (Max Von Sydow) daughter and kills her when she becomes pregnant. But when her older sister Ellen (Sean Young) starts digging into the events surrounding her sister's death, it isn't long before he's struck up a relationship with her. But, as Ellen pieces events together, the shattering truth could end up costing her her relationship...and her life.Admittently, looking at this little thriller today there are flaws I can see in it that I might not have seen when I first saw it maybe eight years ago. The acting is of a very poor standard (not surprising that none of the stars ever went on to any bigger things!) and the plot has a number of holes in it. But it's an engaging story with an impressively dark quality to it. It may just be that it kinda stirs up some fond memories for me, but I didn't find it a totally unenjoyable watch. ***</fullReview>

Matt Dillon gets away with murder and no police are bright enough to figure out his game. I mean how exactly did he manage to hang somebody from the rafters in five minutes? How does he happen to conveniently manage to be in just the right place at just the right time?None of the characters are likable, and the whole film becomes nothing more than a "so what". This is truly a movie to avoid, because it is so insulting to the viewer. I hated everything about "A Kiss Before Dying", and do not understand how this rates a 5.3. To me it is a zero. - MERK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matt Dillon: Rotten Filthy Murderer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia, in which this tale is set, is a city with plenty of history but absolutely no flair. According to E. Digby Baltzell, that's because Philadelphia was founded by self-effacing Quakers, while Boston was founded by pompous overbearing Puritans.Take the University of Pennsylvania, from which Matt Dillon recently graduated. It's an Ivy League school chartered at about the same time as Harvard -- but who boasts of having gone to Penn? Nobody, that's who. The Main Line elite send their undergraduate sons to Princeton and only for post-graduate studies do they bring them back to Penn. Among the cognoscenti, I think the Wharton School of Finance at Penn is the equal of Harvard's Business School but so what? Quakers don't hold with prominence and celebrity. Even Benjamin Franklin, who FOUNDED the University of Pennsylvania, was born and raised in Boston. An athletic team of nearby Swarthmore once won a game. They were ashamed of it.Now I'm beginning to wonder if that isn't a little off the topic. But that leads me to wonder exactly how much attention the topic -- this film -- deserves.It's a confusing story. Dillon courts Sean Young, one of two identical twins, secretly. She's the daughter of uber-rich Max von Sydow, who hasn't got much more than a featured bit part in the movie. But then Young goes ahead and gets pregnant. Dillon's mental gears whirl. Young doesn't get along with her father to begin with. Maybe von Sydow will disinherit her if she admits she's pregnant. So Dillon does the only sensible thing.He tosses Sean Young Number One off the top of a tall building and begins courting Sean Young Number Two, the identical twin. The couple marry and after that it's all down hill as far as originality is concerned. You've seen it before in a dozen films. The upright Sean Young gradually unravels the hidden and pathological past of the man she's married to. The story ends with the requisite chase, this time through crummy back yards and railroad tracks. Dillon has been stabbed with a knife but, as in all these cliché-ridden movies, that doesn't even slow him down. He is finally run over by a train loaded with copper from Young's family. This is known in some circles as poetic justice. You know, undone by the symbol of his own ambition? In my circle, it's known as adventitious. I have a feeling, based on the clumsiness of the writing and dialog, that no symbolism was intended. Sometimes a train is just a train.Young is an interesting actress, stunningly beautiful in a Midwestern way, as if fed on corn and cream, and with a delightful little bump on the end of her model's nose, inviting a nibble. Given her off screen capers, who knows? Her voice sometimes betrays her. She sounds a little hoarse, like Debora Winger, and it comes out as phony for some reason. She has a splendid figure and was quite good in at least two films, "No Way Out" and a parody called "Fatal Instinct." Matt Dillon is interesting too. As an adult he was adequate in "To Die For" and in "Something About Mary." He had a dramatic role in the first and a comic role as a treacherous private eye in the second. Of course he's made some clunkers, including this one, where he is no more than a cardboard cut out of a homicidal psychopath. Every man has a right to give some poor performances but Dillon abuses the privilege.The direction is pedestrian, the score derivative ("Silence of the Lambs"), and the locations are partly in England and Wales.It's not an absolutely awful movie. It doesn't carry any message or insult the audience in some way. It's just not new. And if you're looking for a familiar pattern in which only a few mosaic tiles have been shifted around, you may find this soothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look! It's a zombie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a 1956 movie and I can't imagine any remake has more closely resembled a reanimated corpse than this version of A Kiss Before Dying. This lifeless husk just sort of shambles along, letting out the occasional groan, before finally being put out of its misery.The film starts with Jonathan Corliss (Matt Dillon) throwing his girlfriend Dorothy Carlsson (Sean Young) off the roof of Philadelphia's city hall. The splat Dorothy make on the marble floor where she lands is one of only three good things in this movie. The police believe Dorothy's death is a suicide, something her super rich father (Max von Sydow) is happy to go along with. Her twin sister Ellen (Sean Young, duh!) doesn't buy it though and tries to investigate on her own. Months and months go buy and to cover his tracks, Jonathan eventually kills an old boyfriend of Dorothy and frames him for her murder. That's when we discover that Jonathan has actually become Ellen's new boyfriend as part of a scheme to get a job with Ellen and Dorothy's super rich daddy. If you're wondering if Ellen ever discovers Jonathan's scheme and realizes he killed her sister?you're probably just dim enough to like A Kiss Before Dying.The crucial and glaring problem with this movie is that none of the characters have any human depth to them at all. They're nothing but nails that get pounded down by the Almighty Plot Hammer. Jonathan Corliss has absolutely no internal life. He might as well be a ticking clock or some other mechanism. Dorothy/Ellen are almost as bad, though Sean Young going topless as Ellen does grant that character a smidgen of prurient appeal. And let me be clear. Young and Matt Dillon are not at fault here. It's not that they're giving flat, uninspired performances. These actors are just trapped inside roles that make them nothing more than props. There's never a moment when either Ellen or Jonathan are real people doing real things. They're only puppets being obviously manipulated in whatever way the plot needs them to go.That plot is a less glaring but still significant problem. Maybe the idea of a guy weaving a multi-year scheme where he kills several people so he can become a rich man's personal assistant made sense in 1956, but I don't think it passes muster in 1991 and it's even dumber today. I sat through this film waiting to find out what was Jonathan's goal. Why was he doing all of this? It wasn't until about a half hour after he got the job with Ellen's dad that I realized, that was his only goal. He wasn't going to kill Ellen, he wasn't going to kill her dad, he wasn't going to try and take over or destroy her dad's company. He just wanted a job above middle management. But considering how many years he spent sociopathically devoted to his scheme, Jonathan might have been able to accomplish the same thing if he had just applied for a job in the mailroom.Oh, and the whole reason he had to kill Dorothy and start his plan over with Ellen REALLY doesn't fly in 1991. When your story turns on something that might have been shocking in 1956 but is fairly blase in 1991, you've got to change that plot point in some way to match modern sensibilities. Writer/director James Dearden tries to skip over that incongruity with a single line of dialog at the end, but it doesn't work.I did say there were two other good things in this film. One is the aforementioned topless Sean Young. The other is the very Hitchcockian shot when Ellen finally realizes the truth about Jonathan. Unfortunately, two great camera shots and Sean Young's boobs, as nice as they are, can't carry an entire film by themselves.A Kiss Before Dying has something of a reputation for being infamously bad. It doesn't live down to that expectation. There's no gross storytelling or performing incompetence on display here. There just isn't a spark or glimmer of living, breathing humanity anywhere in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what to make out of this movie. I guess its one of those movies that were MEANT to be good, but just didn't turn out to be that. What are the reasons? Well, lets see...the probably biggest reason was wrong casting of the leading lady. Sean Toung must be the most passive and expressionless actress ever, so instead of feeling sympathy for her, we only feel annoyed by her presence. Second problem is the plot: its too thin. Matt Dillon's character, tho a villain, is at first not introduced as a typical "peerless" killer type, but then as the film progresses he becomes just that. He murders both Dorrie's old boyfriend and her friend in a professional manner, without breaking a sweat. It all looks just too smooth for a guy thats not a professional killer. Also the way he just appears at the end, where he suddenly becomes DEUS EX MACHINA a'la John Ryder, it just looks unconvincing for some reason.This movie's theme is ambition, the thirst or hunger that, if big enough, can make a man possessed with it do anything. Even murder. But its at character study that this movie again fails. Despite losing her brother, sister and mother, Ellen remains on bad terms with her only remaining family member, her father. This is kinda strange, no? Even when he accepts Jonathan/Jay, she shuns his company and criticizes her fiancée/husband for spending too much time with him. Jonathan/Jay on other hand, is a sweet and nice guy who, when he's not killing, helps out Ellen in her work with drug addicts and he even helps a beaten up woman junkie/prostitute to a hospital. Ahem...this REALLY clashes with the image of a guy who kills to fulfill his ambitions, no? So what is he, a sort of Jekyll/Hyde character?? There are also just too few engaging characters in this movie and aside from Thor, Ellen's dad, there aren't ANY other major characters here, Ellen's friend from the social center being a poor candidate. Unfortunately, Max Von Sydow in the role of Thor Carlsson is not given enough time or space to really flourish in his deadpan role.So, this film just fell too short of achieving its goals because it simply had too little going for it. Even Matt Dillon, the only bright spot here, feels wasted in such a poorly conceived and unrealistic role. The plot, however thin, is the only thing that will keep you watching it and thats only because you wanna see how it ends. Although you deep down inside already know how: the wretched sister gets her revenge and gets the killer. This is a movie that wanted to show us the ugly, dark side of ambition...well, it certainly showed us that, but in a less satisfactory way than I hoped for. I give it a weak 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Kiss" is DOA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tacky murder-mystery about a twisted con-man romancing the daughter of a wealthy business tycoon shortly after murdering her lookalike sister. Writer-director James Dearden completely revamps Ira Levin's book from the 1950s (even more so than the '56 version starring Robert Wagner and Joanne Woodward), but the changes are less effectual--and the lead performances by Matt Dillon and Sean Young are unconvincing. Dearden gives the violence a visual jolt, and the movie may well pass muster for those searching for something to watch on a dull weekend, but it's incredibly sloppy around the edges. Young (in a dual role) is so determined to be taken seriously as an actress that her archness mitigates the camp-lasciviousness of her persona (she might have been slinky or kinky, but settles instead for starchy). Tellingly, this was Young's last starring role in a 'quality' production, although Dillon's career managed to survive. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonathon Corliss meets his secret girlfriend Dorothy at the registry office to find it shut. To kill time they go to the roof together. There he throws her off the roof and leaves to make it look like suicide. Dorothy's twin sister Ellen suspects murder but Jonathon covers all lose ends to hide his existence. Back at home Ellen confides in her boyfriend ? Jonathon Corliss ? and the two get engaged (she doesn't know that he had ever met her sister). However as things begin to unravel around Jonathon Ellen suspects he's hiding something.The story starts well and keeps a sense of mystery throughout. Jonathon dealing with loose ends is clever and tense, as is his seduction of Dorothy, Ellen and eventually their father Thor Carlsson (in an attempt to get rich). However the engagement of the film for me was why Jonathon was targeting the Carlsson family with such vigor. However the answer is fudged and deeply disappointing ? it took a lot away from the film for me.Matt Dillon is really good as the driven physco and has a good role. Sean Young is OK ? her best roles never seem to be better than so-so! The most distressing thing is that she has two roles! Max von Sydow adds class but only has a small role.Overall it's an enjoyable mystery and thriller ? however the mystery isn't satisfying and takes away from the thriller element.</fullReview>

Matt Dillon gives a bland performance in a film with few good moments. And... I'll have to talk about Sean Young. Here she plays twin sisters (oh! patience!) and turns both roles into pathetic, as she did in the great majority of her films. Do you remember how awful she was in "Cousins", "Ace Ventura"...? You certainly do. There are worst performers out there (Adam Sandler comes to mind), but she is really, really awful.

		<fullReview>The casting in this picture was awful. The only person who could act was Max von Sidow. The rest of the cast it was painful to watch, painfully boring. The lead, Sean Young, was the worse. All the emotional range of a zombie and the intensity of drying paint. Neither she, nor anyone else, were really 'believable' as actors. It's not surprising that everyone who was in is this picture has faded off the radar. One must criticize the directing in that the director either 1) did not inspire the cast to greater effort 2) give them enough direction 3) or failed to see they were without talent. James Dearden did direct the classic 'Fatal Attraction', and co-wrote it, too. This seems to be his only real success. The major differences: he co-wrote 'Fatal Attraction', apparently writing on his own he is not very good. And, he had a much better cast.The script fails from a fairly predictable plot (predictability is not good in a murder mystery, duh) and unconvincing motivation for the killer (his daddy left him, so he kills, what, 3 people, maybe more?? How many would he have killed with bad potty training?) Matt Dillon's performance as the killer is as unconvincing as the script.</fullReview>

The touches by Mr. Shore doing the film soundtrack are very indicative of Silence of the Lambs if you listen, with some hints of what I believe are likely the notes from the original fifties score.
