		<shortDescription>A Precursor to "Psycho"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautifully photographed, in CinemaScope and Deluxe Color, hauntingly scored, gripping thriller, with four lead actors who were, curiously, 20th Century Fox contract players, yet the film was released by United Artists. Robert Wagner gives the performance of a lifetime as the coolly handsome psychopath who loves his mother (Mary Astor) and money. In a framework similar to "Psycho" (1960), there's a long prologue featuring a sweet blonde (Joanne Woodward) who gets "into trouble" and has to meet an early demise. Her chic, savvy sister (Virginia Leith), with some help from a great-looking professor (Jeffrey Hunter) searches for a killer, almost gets done in herself in a suspenseful climax. "Psycho" similarities include two sisters, a handsome psycho, an even handsomer hero, a mother, two murders. 1950s style icons (still quite retro today) are seen in startling abundance here: shiny red convertibles, college sweaters, slinky theme song, swoop skirts, the jukebox, poodle haircuts, greasy kids stuff hairstyles, etc. Woodward is wonderful and tragic as the first sister, Hunter offers able support, George MacCready is sturdy as the girls' father, while Astor, in a handful of scenes, conveys a true picture of a slightly slatternly, doting mother. The stunning Leith basically carries the last half of the picture and acquits herself well; she never really got her due in films, but is seen in the best advantage here. Also, this movie can be seen as a companion piece to the 1950s Italy set "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1999). Chilling, very well-presented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Upscale Ed Wood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wagner as a psychopathic killer, Jeffrey Hunter as a math teacher/cop, Joanne Woodward as a clinging dishrag, Virginia Leith as a sexy prospective victim and Mary Astor as a dowdy mom? It's so strange I began to wonder if it was some kind of demented masterpiece. It starts with perky titles promising a silly romantic comedy, then has a long dialogue scene between Bob and Joanne all in one take, a tumble by a pregnant woman that *doesn't* result in a miscarriage (surely a movie first), and indescribably odd moments like a sixtyish woman in a see-through blouse sashaying through an intense dialogue scene that pauses to honor her passing, and a postal clerk whose delicate cough serves as a Pinteresque interruption to an otherwise inconsequential line. It was Gerd Oswald's first movie and as far as I can tell he never did anything of note after-wards, but he might have been an Ed Wood buried under a studio budget. It's on DVD and should be seen in its original Cinemascope glory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wagner's best film, a Hitchcockian B-Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerd Oswald's excellent film was his first and perhaps his best, as well as arguably providing Robert Wagner's finest hour. Like Tony Curtis was to do a decade later in The Boston Strangler (1968), screen pretty-boy Wagner took the role of the cunning sociopath Bud Corliss partly in an attempt to prove he could act darker parts than his fans had been used to. Taken from a novel by Ira Lewin (whose work also inspired Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives and The Boys From Brazil) the film is a well mounted, taut B-movie, albeit shot widescreen in Deluxe Color by no less a talent than Lucien Ballard, who later went on to do sterling work for such directors as Sam Peckinpah. His crisp cinematography reveals a land dressed in bright open colours, where American meritocracy is secure and, on the surface at least, all seems right. As such, it carries echoes of contemporaneous romantic fluff such as Pillow Talk as well as some of the late, luscious films by Douglas Sirk. Watching A Kiss Before Dying however is a wholly different experience from Sirk's ironic stagings of smug Eisenhower society, this despite the presence of a clean-cut, pipe smoking Professor Grant (Jeffrey Hunter). His academic character, perhaps the least convincing in the film, is more of a straightforward stereotype than the German director would ever manage, but acts as a counterweight to Corliss' callous misuse of his own good looks and intelligence. Self-satisfied and entirely free of remorse, the student is thus a much more modern figure than the academic, and his presence undermines Grant's rather ineffectual 1950s' decency. Oswald's minor classic focuses on this cold heart - an individual whose ambition, and eventual downfall, might have found its roots in such earlier films as Ulmer's Ruthless (1948), as well as it anticipates some of Hitchcock's work.Although it is only mentioned briefly, Corliss has obviously been affected by his experience in the war ("It's my side where I was wounded," he says at one point, and one of the first things we see are military photographs.) The implication, typical of noir, is that the conflict has affected his mental state. Corliss is a promising student, who lives alone with his mother (Mary Astor). As the film begins he is learning of the unexpected pregnancy of his girlfriend Dorothy (Joanne Woodward). Despite his outward concerns and pledge to marry the woman, he secretly plots to dispose of her before moving on to her sister Ellen (Virginia Leith). At the same time Ellen suspects that her sister's eventual suicide was not entirely as it seemed and does some investigating with the help of the obliging Grant...As others have noticed, there are certain intriguing similarities between A Kiss Before Dying and the plot of Psycho which came four years later: both films begin with furtive discussion of lovers discussing the implications of illicit sex, go on to feature the premature demise of a blonde and then, in a second half, the investigation of mystery by a determined female relative. There are echoes of Vertigo (1958) too in the dangerous heights of City Hall where Budd finally commits his heinous crime, and more than a taste of Hitchcock in some of the of the suspenseful machinations of the plot - most especially in the chemistry supply room scene where Corliss furtively steals his poisons, or during the tense roof scene. It's somehow apt that Mary Astor, who played the calculating Brigid O'Shaughnessy in The Maltese Falcon (1941), should be cast as Corliss' mother in the present film - although even she is much reduced and manipulated by him, facing a final humiliation on the doorstep of the Kingship residence. Her son is at heart a ruthless social climber, for whom the earlier 'problem' posed by Dorothy was just another obstacle to his inevitable rise to social success, just as his mother's dress sense is then another. As a schemer he leaves little to chance, as is evidenced by his careful arrangement of events in the first half of the film and detailed knowledge of the Kingship mining operation he casually reveals at the close. When he is undone, it is by misfortune rather than carelessness - a fact that makes his success all the more frightening as it is compromised by chain of chance more than anything else. As Corliss, Wagner is entirely convincing in a ruthless part that, at first sight, would have been ideal casting for Dennis Hopper. Beneath the familiar clean-cut image lies a calculating, black heart, and he suggests this by effective mannerisms, such as the throwaway, amoral shrug reflected in the jeweller's shop window at the end of his second meeting with Dorothy, or by holding his arms high and clear, as if in supplication to his own genius, as she makes her final descent. Years down the line, after the amiable dross of such later work as Hart To Hart (1980-5), it is a shock to see the actor create such an impact in what was a unique role for him. Oswald's direction is frequently distinguished by the use of long takes: the first scene for instance, which contains a fair chunk of dialogue, consists just of a pan over some photographs and one other extended set up. Part of this can be put down to necessary economies of shooting. In some scenes, especially those alone between Corliss and Dorothy, the refusal to cut away acts as if to trap the participants in their own moral universe, while the unflinching lens demands that the viewer make judgement. (There are sly visual jokes contained within shots too, as when at the conclusion of Corliss' second meeting at the sports ground, after her 'trip' down the bleachers, he is framed under a 'speed kills' road sign, or when Corliss and Ellen later flirt and in the wrap up shot the camera reveals they have been chatting under a tombstone-shaped rock.) This is not altogether to the film's advantage; in the middle section of the film, when Corliss is largely absent, some scenes drag a little. Occasionally Oswald changes pace, such as when he uses a fast dolly-in on the suicide note. But one senses that here the exposition would have benefited from shorter cutting, as the earnest Ellen and nice-but-dull Grant are not a very dynamic couple when alone on screen. However this is a minor quibble in a film that relishes a broad mise-en-sc?ne, typical of 1950s' melodrama. George Macreedy, who plays Leo Kingship, gives excellent, grouchy support. It is his character that undergoes the only real metamorphosis in the film. His daughter of course learns that things are not really what they seem, as she discovers what Budd is really like under the tailored surface. Kingship Senior's education is far more profound, as he almost loses her through his over-protectiveness and intransigence. In one respect he is like Corliss: both have seen the nexus of family ties fray, leading to personality problems. At the end of the film, as he escorts his daughter away from the last encounter, Kingship does so more in sorrow than with the anger he would have earlier displayed. Here, as events take a final turn, the desolation of the mines provides a physical corollary for the stark moral drama being played out between the principals. A Kiss Before Dying was remade by James Dearden in 1991, an unsatisfactorily production that entirely missed the period intensity and compulsiveness of the original. The DVD offers little other but a trailer, although the widescreen transfer is splendid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for an adaptation of the Ira Levin book--this isn't it. Also the book would be impossible to film. That aside this is OK murder mystery-thriller. I was lucky enough to see it letter-boxed on TCM--it looks great! However a film dealing with a psycho and murders he commits does NOT need a theme song! Acting is OK--not good, not bad, just OK. The cast is attractive, the film is beautiful to look at and it's an interesting diversion for 1 1/2 hours. So, an OK thriller--nothing really inventive or different about it. At all costs, AVOID the terrible 1991 remake! That one is a TOTAL waste of time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentic Look at a Popular 1950's Location</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True, the story line is a bit noir for a Technicolor Cinemascope production, but when one realizes that Tucson was at the time a popular and inexpensive location for John Wayne films and the musical Oklahoma! also in glorious color under the blazing Arizona sun, it begins to make sense -- at least in terms of getting out of nearby California where the visible smog at the time was far greater than it is even today.I saw several of the exterior scenes of this film being made, and wondered whether the final cut would amount to much of anything. Robert Wagner seemed very young for the part, and almost frighteningly thin in stature. Moreover, his acting ability had not yet developed to the extent of that displayed by his contemporary Joanne Woodward. But it was obvious to all that the production itself and the supporting cast were professional to the core.Author Ira Levin was very popular at the time, something of the sort of writer one reads today in Robin Cook, Jonathan Kellerman, Stuart Woods, etc. In other words, not really a Raymond Chandler or even a Michael Connelly. That explains why so many recent viewers seem able to catch the adumbrations in the film early on. Potboilers lack the complexity of truly great detective fiction because the characters are stock heroes and heavys.The view looking down from the top of the old 12-story Valley National Bank building (portrayed in the film as the city hall), even though insignificant by today's height standards, is just as scary as it was then. Many of the other locations like the resort portrayed as a grand estate have been transformed or have simply disappeared. And those really cool "rides" are now languishing in automobile museums.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Are Those Girls Gonna Be Surprised!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An evil young man resorts to murder in his efforts to get his hands on an heiress's fortune. Unluckily for him, the heiress's sister and a smart young college lecturer smell a rat ...This is a sumptuous mid-50's all-American movie, set in a world of sorority houses, open-top cars and drug stores. The boys have shiny, well-oiled hair and the girls wear big skirts. Courting couples meet on the bleachers at the football field between classes.Shot in cinemascope, the film's aspect ratio means that television (where I saw it) does it a disservice: all too often, dialogues are conducted between two noses at either extreme of the screen. The colour is 'de luxe', so the credits tell us, and indeed the look of the film is rich and bright.The film is a standard thriller, based on an Ira Levin novel. It is well put together, and has a nice, slinky jazz score, including the theme song (playing on the juke box during one of Bud's dates with Dory).The opening is impressive. The camera pans around a student's bedroom, neatly setting the scene for us. We hear (but do not see) a girl crying. Gradually, as the characters are revealed, we get the message - Dory has found out that she is pregnant by Bud. She has a wealthy father, but is prepared to forego comfort if the man she loves will marry her. Bud is much more interested in the family money.Even though Bud is despicable, we find ourselves wanting his scheme to succeed, so cleverly are we drawn into his plan. He surreptitiously studies poisons in the university library, then by a cunning ploy gains access to the chemistry lab. He composes a note in Spanish, ostensibly a piece he needs to translate for his class, then gets Dory to write out the English for him. She doesn't realise it, but she is writing her own 'suicide note'. Gerd Oswald's direction is strong on body language throughout the movie, and we cannot help but see the significance when Dory (played by Joanne Woodward) goes to kiss Bud, and he flinches.A very young Robert Wagner portrays Bud as a slick, incredibly handsome villain with no feelings. He feigns affection for women, but is capable of none. When he cajoles his mother (Mary Astor) into choosing a tie for him, he craftily changes it for a preferred one when her back is turned.The director is adept at conveying information without words. When Bud looks at the municipal building and marvels at its height, we know straight away what he is planning. When he is on the roof, the tension is sustained commendably.Victoria Leith plays Ellen, Dory's sister. In another fine 'body language' moment, we see her subtly shrugging off her father's attempt to comfort her. We gather from this that Ellen blames him for what happened to Dory.The plot contains some elements which stretch our credulity. If the ending is contrived and highly improbable, at least the incremental steps by which doubt invades Ellen's awareness are cleverly done.Is it a coincidence that Jeff Hunter (Gordon Grant) and Robert Wagner look so alike? Or are they meant to represent two facets of intelligence - one cold and selfish, the other beneficent and altruistic? In the scene just before the engagement party, they are even dressed identically.Verdict - A cleverly-executed murder flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, B-Grade Noir Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scheming college guy, played by a youthful Robert Wagner, tries to marry into wealth. Complications result in murder. Because of the murder angle, and because the plot centers on Wagner's sly and cunning character, the film reminds me a little of "Dial M For Murder". But, to its credit, "A Kiss Before Dying" has a darker, more brooding, noir-like quality, helped along by a 50's music score that is jazzy and slightly mournful.Wagner's acting, if not Oscar-worthy, is at least acceptable. But Jeffrey Hunter is miscast, and therefore not convincing, as the pipe-smoking professor/detective. And Joanne Woodward gives a clinging, and altogether too whiny, performance, as the damsel in distress. A couple of interesting, if somewhat implausible, plot twists add impact to the screenplay. The film's conclusion, however, is predictable and just a tad melodramatic.Overall, "A Kiss Before Dying" comes across as a stylish, very 1950ish, wanna-be classic. It doesn't quite succeed, but is nonetheless worth watching at least once, especially for viewers who like dark, brooding, twist-laden thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-delivered clash between genres and expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his girlfriend Dorie becomes pregnant, Bud Corliss knows that he will be trapped into a marriage and a child that he didn't want. Telling her to keep the whole thing a secret, Bud fools Dorie up onto the roof of a civic building before pushing her to her death and making it look like suicide. The police see it as open and shut but Dorie's sister smells a rat and believes that Dorie was going to the building to be married and that her intended groom was the one that killed her.Opening with a theme music and bright colours that suggested a 1950's comedy, I was worried that I had been misled by the title that suggested much darker fare. However the story quickly unfolds with a young couple in trouble, suggesting it would be a dated melodrama; but as the story progresses it does become more sinister and much more of a dark thriller. The story doesn't always ring true but it is more than enough to engage and makes for a good base for the film even if it is other aspects that make it stronger.Oswald's direction is a big plus because he mixes styles and genres well. He uses the colours and sets of a typically 1950's melodrama but at times the lighting, shot framing and music of a noir of sorts. The clash of genres works well, complimenting one another and making it seem more tense for being such a tough story within such a colourful and homely world of college students. The performances are roundly good. Wagner steals the show of course with a ruthless and selfish performance that could easily have been an one-note affair were it not for the script and Wagner's ability to bring out character in a couple of strong scenes (including an excellent one with his mother at a pool party). Woodward is convincingly na?ve and works well with her character but I didn't think Leith suited Ellen that well, although I didn't totally buy her character either. Hunter is solid if uninspiring and the support cast are pretty much the same.Overall this is an enjoyable film that works thanks to strength in several areas. The story is engaging enough but it was the direction, visual style and use of music that impressed me more. Add to this a dominating central performance from Wagner and you have a film that is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Set the pace for modern thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set against the backdrop of the shiny 1950s, "A Kiss Before Dying" is a taunt thriller that can arguably be voted the predecessor of many modern thrillers.When the film starts, it looks like a glamorous, teenybopper flick. The opening song compliments this heavily, as does the numerous logos and neon colours used in the opening credits. Thinking back on it now, I find it to be a very unusual, brilliant style of film-making that isn't seen very often. It tricks the viewer into something it is not. It is not a 1950s college comedy, but a relentless thriller with lots of unexpected twists and turns. I thought this movie was going to be tame, being a 1950s film and all, but I was pleasantly surprised in how raw the plot was in some places.A young Robert Wagner portrays Bud Corliss, a darkly handsome college student with an obsessive taste for riches and fine dining. Bud is a trouble 25 year-old man who still lives at home with his aging widowed mother (Mary Astor). He feels unfulfilled in his life and a little uncertain about his future. Dorothy Kingship (Joanne Woodward), a girl with whom he is having a secret relationship with, may be the only glimmer of hope that will lift him up out of his bland, disappointing life. Dorothy's father is incredibly wealthy, and Bud knows this. However, Dorie falls pregnant and Bud is threatened with disinheritance and the inevitable prospect of working as a gas station attendant in order to pay the bills for his wife a baby. This is where the film really takes off and we get to see how dark, desperate and evil Bud really is.Bud devises a plan: stage his girlfriends suicide. The plan seems simple enough and actually works in Bud's favour. He is free of Dorie and the prospect of disinheritance, and is now able to court Dorie's older sister, Ellen (Virginia Leith), who is totally oblivious of the fact that Bud is Dorie's old flame (and murderer). Enter rookie detective Gordon Grant (Jeffrey Hunter), an intelligent young man who questions the circumstances surrounding Dorie's death, as well as the integrity of Ellen's new lover, Bud. He just has to put the gruesome pieces together to solve the complex puzzle of deceit and murder.I recommend this movie to fans of the thriller genre, as well as those who want to take a trip down memory lane. Great film with top performance by all. Kudos to Jeffrey Hunter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ira Levin, an accomplished mystery writer, wrote the book in which this picture was based. The adaptation, by Lawrence Roman, works as a movie. Gerd Oswald, whose second movie this was, shows he wasn't up to the task of directing it. Perhaps with another director, a more satisfying film could have emerged.If you haven't seen the movie, please stop reading here.The film presents us a situation that was a classic dilemma for the times in which it was filmed: an unexpected pregnancy. It was a social issue that had more impact in those days than presently. This is a story of a young, naive coed that finds out to her horror, she is in the family way. The handsome boy that is responsible for it, goes into a state of panic, as he doesn't want any part of this situation.The young woman is killed in front of our eyes, so there is no suspense in the fact, since we know who did it. The crime is exacerbated because the sister of the dead girl smells a rat in the way her sister, supposedly committed suicide. She starts digging into the past. The complicating factor is that Ellen, the kind sister has fallen for a hunk that hides from her the key for solving the crime.The casting of the film was unusual in that Robert Wagner is cast as the evil Bud Corliss. Mr. Wagner with his good looks presents a facade of being what he is not. This duplicity makes us hate him. Virginia Leith, on the other hand, as the good sister, Ellen, is totally miscast. Perhaps another actress and a better direction would have made her more appealing. Joanne Woodward, as the doomed girl, makes a believable Dory. Jeffrey Hunter, as the man who discovers the mystery, makes a good impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young woman attempts to solve the mysterious death of her sister, which was ruled a suicide. Unfortunately, this is no delicious, Nancy Drew-styled mystery, for the sleuthing is done almost entirely off-screen, and the details we're privy to (like the fact her sister was wearing something old-new-borrowed-&amp; blue when she died) are skimmed over second-hand. The main focus is on Robert Wagner's sociopath, but we don't get much background information on him. Director Gerd Oswald sets up a long sequence in a college chemistry supply lab which goes no place, skirting major plot-issues and personality points in the meantime. The script, based upon Ira Levin's far-fetched novel, eliminates an entire third sister and rushes along Levin's carefully-mounted scenario until it becomes nothing more than a summary of the book. The small town college landscape is vividly captured however, and Lucien Ballard's cinematography is rich (despite a slim budget). Later remade with Matt Dillon and Sean Young--whom Virginia Leith (here playing Ellen) eerily resembles! ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behind the Pretty Boy Mask</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He may not have been James Dean, but Robert Wagner delivers a career performance in this sorely neglected sleeper from 1956. The first half is a beautifully shaded dance of death as Wagner plots to rid himself of the inconveniently pregnant Joanne Woodward. He's all sincere insincerity from one rendezvous to the next, while she wants desperately to believe, even against all odds. Has there ever been a more cold-hearted manipulator of vulnerable feminine desires. Dory (Woodward) is all whiney expectations, while Wagner conceals ruthless ambition behind a pretty boy mask. Director Gerd Oswald's staging of the first half is little short of brilliant, and had the filming been in appropriate black and white, a latter day noir classic would have resulted. Notice how subtly Woodward expects to be kissed atop the municipal building, the pinnacle of her girlish dreams, while Bud (Wagner) callously lights a cigarette, defiant of normal expectations. And what a gripping piece of morbid psychopathology is Wagner's slip-sliding through the chemistry lab as he prepares a toxic.potion for his lady love. Maybe in the last analysis, Bud's problem lies with his mother. The fixation is certainly not normal, as she senses in putting off his request for a "date". Yet Bud's social climbing ambitions are made tellingly clear that they are for mom as well as for himself. Unfortunately, the second half reverts to standard Hollywood convention, the suspense subsiding along with the first-rate mood music. Putting a pipe in the callow Jeffrey Hunter's mouth and making him a college professor amounts to a crippling miscalculation on someone's part. Hunter's simply not the type, nor does he have the gravitas to carry the plot forward. The end result is a hybrid of first-half brilliance and second-half mediocrity. Too bad. The ending is appropriate, however, as the monster truck bears down like the hand of pre-destination that Bud should have taken note of in that literature class. There is a point to Dory's unfortunate life, after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They should have made the director watch some Hitchcocks before making this poor attempt at a thriller. He obviously hadn't the shadow of a clue how to make this exciting or create the right tension. The garish color photography and snazzy jazz score don't help either. " A kiss before dying, bababie bababoo". Really gets you in the right mood. The against-type casting of Robert Wagner as the socially ambitious killer was an interesting move, but doesn't pay off because of his total lack of acting skills. The moral ambiguity this role needs to work is completely absent in his performance. Not that the other actors are much better, in fact they're worse. My personal Razzie goes to the ludicrously stilted father figure, although the bookish college don complete with pipe and glasses is hot on his heels. Only Joanne Woodward's character earns some sympathy, but maybe that's because you know she's gonna get bumped off. This movie limps from one ludicrous scene to the next. For fans of cheesy movies i especially recommend the scene in which the killer forces another guy to sit down and have his head blown off, only to have the victim oblige without so much as an attempt at attacking his murderer. Maybe they actually were more polite in the Fifties. The final scene is also unforgettably corny and.... oh well, i've wasted enough time in both watching and complaining about this overcooked turkey. Not bad enough to be campy, but worse: just plain bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(POSSIBLE SPOILER) Noir thriller doesn't live up to its potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where is Alfred Hitchcock when you need him? This is an Ira Levin story that would have been perfect for Hitch and his B&amp;W camera crew--it even has a storyline similar to PSYCHO where one of the leads is sacrificed early on and the other lesser known actress has to carry out the detective work. Unfortunately, the tricky plot gets a little too contrived for comfort before the plot is resolved and all the pieces fit.Given a better, more experienced director, ROBERT WAGNER might have given a more full-bodied performance as the psychopath at the center of the story. Although he does an OK job in a sketchy role, he never quite suggests the darker side of his character in a forceful enough way.JOANNE WOODWARD merely gives another one of her whiny performances in the sort of role Shelley Winters would have played a decade earlier. It's almost a relief when her character "disappears".The whole concept of the film as a CinemaScope film noir only defeats the purpose of what could have been a more intimate look at the characters and situations and with a tighter, more forceful presentation of the script if the film had been done in normal ratio and in B&amp;W.Nor does it do any good to have an innocuous jukebox song called "A Kiss Before Dying" play under the opening scene which sets up the situation between Wagner and Woodward. A sense of urgency and danger is not developed early on because of this.The relatively unknown VIRGINIA LEITH makes little impression, billed as she is over Joanne Woodward. JEFFREY HUNTER, handsome as ever, is competent as the detective. The usually reliable GEORGE MACREADY has a supporting role of little substance as the proud, stubborn father of Leith and Woodward.This is the kind of material that could have clicked in a big way, given a tighter script and a director like Hitch. As it is, the CinemaScope lensing gives it a flat affect because there is a scarcity of intimate close-ups that would have revealed more forcefully the thoughts and intentions of the characters. Also, there are long dialog scenes that are photographed from only one angle when sharper editing (including close-ups) would have gained more interest.Summing up: A noir thriller that doesn't live up to its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How About a Lesson Before Acting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Levin bestseller about a cold-blooded social climber becomes an ineffective film. This was the first film that Oswald directed and his inexperience (or lack of talent) shows in the melodramatic presentation and poor acting. With this film Wagner tried to branch out into meatier roles, but his wooden performance clearly shows his limitations as an actor. His acting is so unnatural that one can almost see him thinking before delivering his lines. Leith is even worse as the heiress he pursues. Faring better is Woodward, in only her second film, managing to make her whiny character sympathetic. Hunter also does OK as a police detective. The score is loud and distracting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peculiar but entertaining mixture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read Ira Levin's book when I was young, sometime in the 1960s, and loved it. It's very chilling, and I think as good as Rosemary's Baby. Better than the Stepford Wives and Boys from Brazil.This film is a quite bizarre mixture of the chilling and the comical. Someone above has mentioned the scene where Bud and Dorie are having an intense conversation when suddenly a middle-aged woman in a completely see-through blouse with a great big bra underneath walks between them and halts the conversation; she has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot, and when it happened I literally burst out laughing at the incongruousness of it. I also laughed at Jeffrey Hunter's ridiculous attempts to manipulate heavy Clark Kent spectacles and an unlit pipe in a vain attempt to appear mature. The good points about the film are the plot, which is gripping even though it's been shortened markedly from the book, and some of the acting, particularly Robert Wagner and Joanne Woodward -- and I also enjoyed George Macready as the father of Dorie and Ellen. The fact is that I was consistently interested or amused or gripped by something or other for the whole of the film. You can't really ask for much more from a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, how to resolve the age-old problem of accidentally getting your girlfriend preggers? Well, if you're a good-looking, psychopathic college boy, as portrayed by Robert Wagner in the 1956 thriller "A Kiss Before Dying," the answer is fairly simple: Just knock her off and hope for the best...and pray that her snoopy sister won't start nosing around! Anyway, that's the setup for what turns out to be in essence a poor man's "A Place in the Sun" (1951), but nevertheless a film that remains quite entertaining in its own right. Based on an Ira Levin novel, directed by cult favorite Gerd Oswald, and featuring beautiful, wide-screen color filming (shown to good advantage on the DVD that I just watched), the film certainly does impress. Joanne Woodward comes off very sympathetically here in her third film, and supporting players Mary Astor (a 50-year-old redhead in this picture), George Macready (less hissable than usual) and Jeffrey Hunter (who will ALWAYS be Capt. Pike to me!) are all very fine. But Wagner certainly does steal the show as the pretty-boy whacko. Storywise, I'd say that the plot is a wee bit on the far-fetched side, but never absurdly so, and that most viewers will easily foresee how Wagner will slip up in the end. Still, the film remains suspenseful throughout and concludes most satisfactorily. Strange that the "abortion" word is never brought up, though. Could Wagner's character be a pro-lifer who's into murder? He wouldn't be the first!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seen for the first time close to sixty years after it was made this film fails to register on almost every level and it's yet another movie where a cast comprising several 'names' of the day appear to be reading from different hymn books. The starring role, a social-climbing sociopath, goes to Robert Wagner, a Fox contractee who'd been groomed for stardom via a series of 'pretty boy' roles until, presumably having attained some clout, he persuaded his studio to let him have a stab at something more substantial. Joanne Woodward, an excellent actress, who had slowly but surely carving a reputation, turned in arguably the worst performance of her career as the first victim, whilst Jeffrey Hunter doesn't really cut it as a pipe-smoking academic. If you think these last two were miscast get a load of George Macready as Daddy Gotrocks, father of both Joanne Woodward and Virginia Leith, the next prey in Wagner's sights. It's watchable but only just.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rocky Road To Riches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Kiss Before Dying" is a tense crime thriller in which a cold, calculating, psychopathic student, who is determined to be rich, ruthlessly pursues his goal without any concern for those who suffer as a result of his actions.Bud Corliss (Robert Wagner) is the son of an absent father who never did well financially and is powerfully driven to take a different route and become wealthy. Having carried out some research on a local mining company, he pursues a plan to make a fortune by becoming a part of the family who own the business. To this end, he has been courting Dorothy (Dorie)Kingship (Joanne Woodward), but a problem arises when she becomes pregnant and marriage is not a viable proposition because her stern, puritanical father would be certain to disinherit her. Dorie doesn't care about being disowned by her father and quite relishes breaking away from his influence but for Bud, this would defeat the purpose of his relationship with her. Bud pretends to be equally keen to go ahead and marry but murders Dorie in a spectacular fashion after having tricked her into writing a note which gives the impression that she's committed suicide.A little time after Dorie's "suicide", Bud starts to court her sister Ellen (Virginia Leith). This is possible because his relationship with Dorie had always been carried on in secret. Unfortunately for Bud, Ellen has never been fully convinced that her sister would have taken her own life and she starts to come across further information which supports that view. When she is led to believe that Bud knew Dorie, her doubts about him grow.Corliss is intense, crafty and full of guile and at the same time lacks any sincerity, passion or spontaneity. Robert Wagner in one of his early screen roles, portrays this complex mixture of qualities well and it's perfectly understandable that his rather dour, downbeat, demeanour would seem quite acceptable to Dorie because of her father's similarly cold nature. Joanne Woodward (also in one of her early roles) is convincingly naive, vulnerable and gullible. It's also rather ironical that a conflict between the two characters should exist in a situation where both are attracted to the idea of marriage to the other because such a move would remove them from their existing circumstances.The scene at the sports field where Bud and Dorie are in the seated area discussing their predicament is visually quite striking as the almost abstract background seems to be closing in on them and in so doing, reinforces the strong sense of despair and entrapment which Bud is feeling at that time. The manner in which Bud is visually revealed as Ellen's new boyfriend and the way in which Dorie's murder is depicted, are just two further highlights of this interesting and absorbing melodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Cinemascope Technicolor murder drama from 1955 is a great looking film with perfect 50s visuals to carry it well in 2008. In retrospect, I can see the source for both PEEPING TOM and PSYCHO both in 1960 offering the 'shocking' image of a square cut handsome young man as a cruel killer. Of course that idea alone is really a flip on MONSIEUR VERDOUX with Chaplin as the ageing dandy/ dapper killer and even the comedy ARSENIC AND OLD LACE again with the least suspecting type as killers. This version of KISS now-days is reflected in MR RIPLEY too. While it is not up the caliber of that film either, these films all form a group of murder mysteries depicting unassuming types revealed to be murderers. A KISS BEFORE DYING has the very handsome Robert Wagner and equally good looking Jeffrey Hunter pitched front and center for what must have been wild female audience reaction. One scene late in the film set in the desert features Wagner in the tightest jeans imaginable looking like a gay denim version of James Dean. It is all a bit silly in its storyline (university campus killer and rich girl family dramas) but visually it is a real 50s treat. Remade clumsily as a Matt Dillon thriller in 1991, this really is the better version completely because of the great looking cast (incl Joanne Woodward and Mary Astor) and the immensely enjoyable Cinemascope 50s set design and art direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If RJ has the kiss of death, I wish he'da smooched me ten minutes in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lured in by the handsome jacket photo of Robert Wagner and, moreso, by the promise of Joanne Woodward's phenomenal acting, I rented 'A Kiss Before Dying', certain that I was discovering a long-lost gem of cinema that would soon become a favorite among other esoteric movies of the '50's and '60's. What actually happened, though, was my having to endure a drawn-out, slightly confusing, tiresome film that just smacks of 'struggling to be Hitchcock' while never managing to achieve the tension, drama or self-importance necessary to be a memorable film.While Robert Wagner is somewhat an attractive novelty in most films, never really embodying an actor or the capabilities and depths which an actor should strive for, Joanne Woodward is of the most solid performers of her generation. So in light of the fact that two of J-Wood's strongest and critically best-received films - 'Three Faces of Eve' and 'The Long, Hot Summer' - were released within two years of this atrocity, 'Kiss' becomes almost laughable in its extreme, unjustified violence, glaringly unsolved crimes, and the general lack of depth of any of its characters. What irritated me most was the script's lame and futile attempts - lacking clear motivation, nonetheless - to drill emotion from Dorothy and Ellen's crusty, rich father at random points in the film. His place in the plot is clumsily made understood through tiny blurbs in conversations throughout, so when he actually appears, there is no distinction as to who he is (and by this point in the film you'll be wondering if it matters and, how many minutes does this run? Seriously.) I was even more confused by the general misplacement of what I would assume would be 'proper emotion': remorse for murder; inconsolable sadness and grief at the death of a child and sibling; rage at at suspected murderer; suspicion towards guilty, sneaking faces. It is Ellen's and Mr. Kingship's quick verbal barbs that were supposed to increase the tension, further the plot and reveal motives - but they truly only bore and annoy. And confuse, too.Beyond all of this, though, the storyline remains relatively uninteresting, and the means by which the characters endeavor to solve the various crimes themselves is dangerous, nonsensical, and truly stupid. I know the mid-1950's were a far cry from today's specialized crime units and DNA testing, etc., but Ellen Kingship's organizing meetings with criminals by herself is ridiculous. And our protagonists are simply not well-defined. We get little background on any one character and as a result, as a viewer there is little consequence in their deaths, surprising secrets, disappointments, losses, or triumphs.'A Kiss Before Dying' starts out promisingly enough, what with its attractive, talented leads, its intriguing premise and the added allure of the indecent, amoral plot line (what a stir this must've made in 1956!). But when all is said and done, this big-screen drama is a big-time disappointment. (Joanne is still phenomenal, though!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wagner plays Bud Corliss, a pathologically ambitious young college student at "Stoddard U." Bud is twenty-five years old, living at home with his mother. From a newspaper article mounted in a picture frame in his room, shell casings on his desk, and a reference to his being wounded, it is implied that Corliss is a decorated Korean War veteran. It was never clear to me what significance this war hero business had, unless a reason had to be given for Wagner's being a little old to be a college student. I don't see it going to motivation. Corliss sees a path to riches by taking up with Dorothy (Joanne Woodward), the daughter of a rich copper mine owner, but his intentions are thwarted by an unwanted pregnancy that he knows Dorothy's father will not accept. Not to be deterred, Corliss will do anything to achieve his goal, yes even murder.With many recent movies setting their stories in the 1950s ("Far from Heaven," "Pleasantville," "Revolutionary Road," and so forth) it is refreshing to see the real thing. Instead of wondering where they got that pristine 1955 Ford Thunderbird, or all of the other old cars, you know that they are for real. This was filmed in and around Tucson, Arizona and that, together with the clothing (did men really wear coats and ties to their classes in the 50s?) and hair styles, makes for an authentic feeling. The production in color CinemaScope is lush, although the color balance on the DVD I watched shifted on occasion.All of the things this had going for it, including having the two attractive young stars on board, should have amounted to something special, but the whole is less than the sum of its parts. I know that love can blind you, but Dorothy is so naive as to be unbelievable. Wagner plays Corliss as quite emotionless, which I suppose is in keeping with his character, but he never creates any sense of menace that I think is necessary to involve us in such a story (consider Anthony Perkins in "Psycho"). The music tries to compensate for Wagner's lack of menace with its ominous fulminations, but it came across as overly intrusive to me. I could never get beyond the feeling that the actors were acting.We are in Hitchcock territory here and I think that under his direction this might have been memorable movie rather than the modest entertainment it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Folks, this is NOT a "noir"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, one of the most abused terms on IMDb has become "noir." If a film exhibits any type of sinister plot involving a male and female, and it is pre-1960, it is immediately thought to fall into that very DISTINCT genre.Killing girlfriends/wives was a plot device long before "noir" came along. This melodrama also bears little resemblance to Hitchcock.All leads perform well, although I am not ready to "buy into" Wagner's performance as easily as others apparently have.Also, the behavior of some characters is completely unbelievable, including the second victim's unwillingness to take any action to prevent his own murder. A woman falls from a twelve-story building, in downtown, and nobody looks up to see Wagner, pausing for a ridiculous amount of time, in broad daylight? The police don't ask more detailed questions - accepting everything at face value? Amnesia appears to have set in the entire campus regarding the relationship between Wagner and Woodward? (True, every scene shows them alone, sort of, but COME ON!) Location filming is attractive, though, and the color is at its mid-century best.Yes, the film is certainly worth watching, but it is not a "noir," and should not be continually addressed as such. Being an Ira Levin fan, I will now track down his original novel, and discover if it is more in tune with what I expect, when enjoying one of his creations.(And the opening credits theme music!! Good grief - it belongs with a glossy Douglas Sirk flick.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time he made this Robert Wagner may have been one of the most beautiful men on the planet, but despite being given a decent, meaty role, (as a college student who murders his pregnant girlfriend), he was severely limited as an actor. But this handicap dosen't prevent Gerd Oswald's perverse murder movie from being anything less than highly entertaining.The girlfriend who gets it is Joanne Woodward and she's bland and uninteresting. You can see why Wagner wants rid of her, (hard to believe that a year later she was going to win the Oscar as Best Actress). Wagner's nemesis are two other attractive clothes horses of the day, Jeffrey Hunter and Virginia Leith, and his mother is Mary Astor with hideously cropped red hair and a little too much make up and not a lot to do. But despite the inadequacy of the cast and a formulaic script, Oswald gives the film real zip and Lucien Ballard's widescreen cinematography gives it the look of a film noir in colour and ensures it is never less than handsome on the eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie as I always like watching everything Joanne Woodward starred in and had not seen this one before. Although it was not her best, it was an early role and she was quite young, as were the others. I was especially surprised when in the hotel lobby scene about 2/3 through the movie an extra, a woman walked past and then was seated at a booth and the blouse she was wearing was completely "see through" and all you could see was her bra. This was not customary for the 1950s when this was filmed and ones eye was totally taken off the stars and onto this "extra". I was surprised. Even though there were no surprises in the movie as everyone knew who the murderer was, I still enjoyed this 50s version that has been since remade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Kiss Before Dying is directed by Gerd Oswald and adapted to screenplay by Lawrence Roman from the novel of the same name written by Ira Levin. It stars Robert Wagner, Joanne Woodward, Virginia Leith, Jeffrey Hunter and Mary Astor. A CinemaScope/De Luxe Color production, music is by Lionel Newman and cinematography by Lucien Ballard.Plot basically finds Wagner as a scheming pretty boy willing to commit murder in order to reach the riches of an inheritance. Story bubbles away nicely as Bud Corlis (Wagner) and Dorothy Kingship (Woodward), he sly and distant - she vulnerable and love struck, both hold court with performances of merit. The spiky edge comes by way of knowing what Bud is up to, and that poor Dorothy is completely oblivious, and when the key moment comes, it's shocking and really perches ones expectation levels to the edge of the seat.Sadly the second half of the movie doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first, for here the focus shifts from a twist into an investigation by Dorothy's sister, Ellen (Leith), who refuses to accept the official party line surrounding her sister. It's all very competently mounted, but the pervading sense of menace has dissipated and in place is just an average murder mystery.Wagner and Woodward are very good, Leith not so much, while Hunter as a pipe smoking professor is badly miscast and Astor is under used. Oswald's direction is fine, with some nifty long takes and some very cheeky visual jokes that only become apparent once story has run its course. Ballard's Scope photography is impressive, managing to make the bright colourful city surrounds always appear as threatening, and Newman's musical arrangements are indicative of the murder mystery splinter of 50s film noir.The themes at the core of the picture are daring and interesting, though more should have been made of the hinted at fact that Bud is a troubled war veteran. It's not all that it can be, the second half diluting the whole as it were, but this is still a tasty noir thriller worthy of catching. 7/10</fullReview>

Everything here, while attractive and colorful, is layered with a coating of calm and melancholy. The sort of ambiance that exuded in the safe and sterile Fifties.This was not conducive to Thrillers so much as Romantic Comedies and Farce, Musicals and Westerns. It is given a good try by the Filmmakers but in the end it is an unsatisfying affair that is only so much presentation. Robert Wagner is a fitting Stiff as the lack of emoting is rather indicative of His chilly, heartless Character. The other Actors are placed throughout as so many Pawns, void of much personality and as boring as Hell.There is a lot of eye-candy and it is a pretty Picture. But it is a framing that very rarely works unleashing Mystery or mayhem, with Psychos and Detectives. In fact, one could point at the ridiculous Police procedures and personnel (contrived to a part-time Nephew "on the case"). Only in the most accepting of Fiction could this be considered normal.Overall, this is worth a view as an antique. A Hollywood showpiece of the Mid-Fifties with its Color, Cinemascope, dress-up clothes, and ultra-attractive People all presented with an inordinate amount of adornment and shine.</fullReview>

Her sister sets out to prove she was murdered and enlists the help of a professor (Hunter).Of interest, the murdered girl is a very young Joanne Woodward and an older Mary Astor plays Wagner's mother. Wagner himself is quite wooden, though smooth.There is a college town/youthful atmosphere that pervades this film and makes for fun watching (it was filmed at the University of Arizona) - also, the finale was filmed at a real copper mine. Because of its nostalgia value, I prefer this over the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technicolor film noir?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This brilliant adaptation of Ira Levin's suspense novel casts a young Robert Wagner against type as a cold-blooded social climber using the daughters of an industrialist as a career path. This has most of the elements of a noir thriller - Wagner is the focal character in the first part of the film, manipulating the daylights out of poor, mousy Joanne Woodward, whom he has inadvertently put in a family way. Since his plan to infiltrate her family does not include premature marriage and social disgrace (this IS the early fifties), he craftily executes her murder. And I found myself nervous for him when things don't go as planned! Since I do not advocate murder under any circumstance, this is a stunning combination of writing and directing.Then we do an abrupt 180 in mid-film, when the focus shifts to the dead girl's older sister. She's dating a wonderful guy, and her formerly domineering father is making an effort to be more caring after the tragic suicide of his only other child...but she still can't accept that her younger sister committed suicide. As she uncovers clues toward what really happened, our sympathies shift and we're cheering her on...until we learn the identity of her charming new boyfriend, and the film races mercilessly to its climax.So we've got the antihero in Wagner, and the sordid backdrop of unwed pregnancy, seedy college hang-outs and rigid, authoritarian parenting. Cinemascope and eye-watering Technicolor rob the film of any physical darkness, but the patient yet ever-escalating pace and the clever sidestepping of the Hayes Code more than make up for it. An excellent film that pales its 1980s update into obscurity.Also of note is novelist Ira Levin, whose tales of suspense and intrigue seem ready-made for the screen. Levin would later bring us "Rosemary's Baby", "The Boys From Brazil", "Sliver" and "The Stepford Wives."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this movie is done well enough where I don't dislike it, but it feels like a missed opportunity. The saturated colors, the arid locations, and the overall flat acting give it a weirdly appealing vibe. But it feels like the characters should be more developed. The 1950s produced more handsomely bland actors than any other decade and if I liked Robert Wagner in this film it might be due to the fact that he gets to play a killer. In the directorial hands of someone like Hitchcock, he may have had us hoping in a twisted way that Wagner's character wouldn't get caught. I enjoyed Wagner's demise, but like the movie as a whole, it seemed like more tension could have been squeezed out of the last part of the film. I also think Joanne Woodward should make the all time actors falling from a great height award. Her scream was very chilling.</fullReview>

The "lead-up" to the murder was very well done - you just cannot believe he's going to push her off the roof until the second it actually happens. The film is made all the more powerful by the fact that Robert Wagner has such an angelic face, that it's all the more horrifying to see him plan and perpetrate his crime.It's also nice to see a film made on beautiful sets, with the university atmosphere and taking place in broad daylight ( I dislike films which are mostly set in the dark and at night - it's as though they're trying to hide something - and after all, night is the time when most of us are supposed to be sleeping ).Since buying the DVD, I have watched the film three times and each viewing makes me like it more. If I had to complain about something, I would only say that I would have liked the end to be a little more dramatic - the first half of the film, where the murder is being planned - is actually better than the second half - where the murder is actually elucidated. The way it is elucidated is not as convincingly done as the way it was planned ! Perhaps Hitchcock would have done a better job on that bit, I don't't know.Anyway a film definitely worth viewing - shivers guaranteed !</fullReview>

His character was supposedly mentally unstable because of his experience with death in the war.

		<fullReview>This is not your average 50's noir. Instead we have a low-down manipulative killer (Robert Wagner as Bud) set against the leafy backdrop of a college campus instead of the usual grimy cheapjack one. And from the clothes and cars down to the shotgun wedding ethic, it practically screams mid 1950s. Mary Astor is Bud's predatory mother who wants her son to marry into wealth and social position, and Joanne Woodward is Dorie, Bud's sweet and naive girlfriend who believes he really loves her and wants to marry her. But Dorie gets pregnant and dad is the unforgiving type, and Bud is afraid Dorie will be disinherited and Bud will become just another schlemiel working his way through college with a wife and baby in tow with no dough. Thus since Bud actually is in love with Dorie's dad's fortune, Dorie must go, and I don't mean to another college. But Bud is careful. He is clever and makes Dorie's death look like a suicide - poor girl never saw it coming. And since Bud has learned so much about Dorie's sister, Ellen, from Dorie, that is his next romantic stop. But like so many killers, Bud has overlooked some things. For one thing Dorie wrote Ellen right before her "suicide" saying that she had met somebody and was very happy. Thus Ellen is just not buying the suicide angle and goes looking for the truth, even though the killer is now her boyfriend! How will all of this work out? Watch and find out. George McReady is Dorie's and Ellen's rich father who is willing to believe the worst of anybody, especially his own children, and he is great as always. I recommend this one if it ever comes your way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A striking cross between gritty Noir and colorful-if-sad '50s family melodrama, this is a unique and, I think, rather complex Hollywood movie. The sociopathic anti-hero (protagonist-villain?) seems to be a wholesome stud-muffin who wants the American dream: financial independence, indeed wealth. A dark variation on the Rebel Without a Cause, he is fatherless and the Oedipal tension with his mother is not subtle. Indeed, the first of his girlfriends that we meet has a striking similarity to Mom. His chosen path to affluence is to marry into money, and each time the rich chicks he dates do something that alienates their wealthy families, like getting pregnant out of wedlock, he kills them in retaliation. His murders are not a way to procure wealth but a way to free himself from romantic obligations that will not bring wealth. Thus, his criminal actions can be seen as a result of social prohibitions on divorce and abortion, at least as much as of misogyny. The killer is then simultaneously a patriarchal abuser and a rebel against patriarchal morality. The killer is brought down by a group of conspirators working with one of the victim's viciously patriarchal, capitalist father. He dies in a subterranean excavation in the dessert and his crimes, and the embarrassment to a "proper family" that would come with their revelation, are buried with him. The ending is "happy" exactly because all the horror of American society remains hidden behind the face of patriarchal "normalcy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Ira Levin story about a bad man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this today because the story is written by Ira Levin, and, I've always enjoyed his novels and the movies made from them - "Rosemary's Baby;" "Sliver;" "The Boys From Brazil;" etc.The protagonist is a mean, selfish, and, ruthless young man, but, very clever in a self-serving way.The victim is a sweet and beautiful young lady who became involved with the wrong man.The victim's sister is a smart, beautiful, and, determined young lady who doesn't see her sister's demise as do the police.This is a very good movie of selfish love and lust, and, doing anything and everything it takes to marry into a wealthy family...much like in "A Place in the Sun" (1951).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sensational use of cinemascope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite a surprise this as I picked the DVD up very cheaply half expecting something noirish. The credits come on and the bright colours and twinkling music suggest romantic comedy, then after briefly looking like another West Side Story, the music is working up a spell and the sensational use of cinemascope and the beautiful colour that was 'DeLuxe' has me spellbound. Not an inappropriate word that here either, 'spellbound', because there is more than a little Hitchcock here. The swirling romantic/menacing music and the boyish charm of the oh so confident, too determined, Bud Corliss, played very well by Robert Wagner. 'I'm twenty-five, Mum' he implores, and he was. Well paced, good looking and if the thrills are few, there is a fine momentum maintained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil young and pretty Robert Wagner---copper colored ticker tape machine.... 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wagner in his youthful handsomeness days plays an evil sociopath bent on marrying money, he kills one sister Dorothy because she would be disowned by her puritanical father for getting pregnant and goes after the other Ellen. His motive is to get his hands on their father's huge copper mine in Arizona.It was obvious to me that Ellen's boyfriend would be Wagner the minute she mentioned she had a boyfriend....also it was obvious Wagner would be pushed off into the mine at the end. However there are plenty of other twists and surprises that I didn't see coming.A couple odd items no one mentioned...Dorothy's 1957 Thunderbird convertible is copper colored as are the phones and ticker tape machine in the family mansion. There are visual "cues" everywhere commenting on what just happened or what is going to happen. After Dorothy falls down the bleachers (given a helpful push by Wagner) you see a street sign saying SPEED KILLS. I laughed at the reviewer who said this tumble down the bleachers must have been a first for the film industry where a pregnant woman didn't have a miscarriage.The movie holds your interest as it is fast paced with lots of red herrings being fired at you all the time--most fizzle quickly like Wagner about to leave his notebook in the arsenic store room--but not all.Much more knowledgeable reviews exist for this period piece. It was a B grade movie (boiler plate for double features) but a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely rank a film as high as an 8 but Joanne Woodward's work here merits it.She is amazingly touching and convincing as a naive and idealistic pregnant coed who would like to believe her boyfriend loves her for who she is, and not for her father's fortune.It's painful to watch as Robert Wagner says things that belie his true, predatory nature, and Dorie takes each subtle blow with silent consternation. Suspense builds inexorably until the trusting Dorie finds herself perched on that rooftop, the ultimate sitting duck. Bud's push must constitute a classic moment of film horror.Also compelling was Robert Quarry as an innocent man -- looking far too old to be a collegian bunking in a dorm -- who plays perfectly into Bud's machinations.Several puzzling questions distracted from the film's overall fine quality. I questioned Dorie's reaction to having tumbled down the bleacher steps. Clearly she was lovesick and gullible; however, it strained credulity for her not to notice that something had been just a tad suspicious. (And she pulled herself together too easily from what would have been a significant body blow.) Nor did I get how Bud entered into the surviving sister's life, without so much as mentioning that he had known Dorie. This was a superb thriller and it leaves me curious to see more of both Ms. Woodward and Wagner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would you murder for money? Would you murder to get ahead? Would you marry someone you don't love for a piece of the pie? Robert Wagner is only too eager to do something, anything to get what he wants. What does he want? Mary Astor is his mother, who thinks he's a genius. Joanne Woodward thinks he's sweet and a nice person. Jeffrey Hunter tries to help the police unravel the puzzle that lets victims fall where they will. "A Kiss Before Dying" is a tale of one who thinks he's above suspicion, above the law. This suspenseful and lavishly produced film is a cross between a melodrama and horror, as you're taken on a ride, you can't get off until the end and leaves you wondering, was it all worth it? All we want out of life is security and happiness, but at what price? Forget plausibility and forgive the loopholes. "A Kiss Before Dying" is one movie that you should learn from or else....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Wagner as a cold-blooded killer?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an entertaining but strange film, as a skinny, polite and clean-cut young man turns out to be a killing psycho. Robert Wagner of all people is the killer and he looks about as menacing as Tinky-Winkie--which is why the movie works so well. After all, if killers all looked crazy and dangerous they would all be identified early on and have little chance to do their dirty work! Wagner is a bad boy. His girlfriend is pregnant and that will spoil his plans to meet and marry a rich girl (which she is not). So, he murders the lady in order to act out his twisted dream. The girl's sister investigates herself and the tension mounts! This is a well-acted and interesting film. While far from perfect, it's a good film guaranteed to keep your interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I taped A Kiss Before Dying on BBC 2 when it was on afternoon recently as I was on holiday. I found this very gripping.A murderous student is fed up with his girlfriend, so he tries to poison her. After she don't have the poisoned drink, he panics and takes her to the top of a tall building and pushes her off to her death. He then makes out she committed suicide and then shoots a man dead. He then falls in love with the girl's sister and attempts to murder her at dad's copper mine but ends up dead himself...A Kiss Before Dying is shot well in colour and has some good location photography, especially at the mine. There is a thunderous score too, which helps to keep it moving along nicely.The cast includes Robert Wagner as the student, Mary Aster, Joanne Woodward, Virginia Leith, George Macready and Robert Qaurry. Excellent parts from all.Watch this if you get the chance. Brilliant.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still not the book, but it was a good adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, to begin with, nobody should try and turn a title like "A Kiss Before Dying" into a song. It's not a good idea. Within the first frames of the opening credits a film that could be a stylish bit of neo-noir is turned into 50s fluff. Too bad. Fortunately, the film makes up for the credits.Filmed on location, this has some beautiful scenery and the cinematography alone is worth the price of the DVD. The story is pretty faithful to the book, which is one of my favorite of Ira Levin's. True, it's no Rosemary's Baby or Stepford Wives, but it's a good bubble-bath read. A little predictable, but I enjoyed it. The same can be said for this film. A little predictable, but enjoyable.As a leading man Robert Wagner was a little green for this part. He didn't seem quite comfortable yet. A shame because he's become such a fine actor in later years. On the flip side we have Mary Astor playing his mother which just seems a very strange choice. Sure, Mary Astor's played a mother so many times - but to Robert Wagner? It just didn't work. Perhaps she's too intelligent-looking to be believable as the sweet, dull mom. She just comes across as wasted here.The younger actresses here are both fantastic. We have the legendary Joanne Woodward playing Dorothy who does a beautiful job of making her character sadly sympathetic. Joanne was so young in this her accent still sticks out left and right, but that's not too distracting. For me the real surprise was Virigina Leith playing Ellen. I'd never heard of this actress before or since, but she turned in a surprisingly strong performance as the younger sister. My main gripe is that my favorite sister, Marian, is completely left out of the movie. Or to be more specific, they merged the older two sisters Marian and Ellen into one character. It's understandable - the film can only be so long - but irritating none the less.I like the film as a whole, I just thought it would be better. What I do have to say is stay away from the 90s remake with Sean Young playing both Dorothy and Ellen. Now that was terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film Stymied by a Great Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film very much of its time and it is almost impossible to convey the surprise it would have engendered back then in audiences when it gave us Robert Wagner as a cold-bloodied psychopath, Mr. Wagner having previously been cast, usually to excellent effect, only as admirable and good-looking (very) young men. Reviewers keep comparing its story line to PSYCHO's, but that is pure nonsense. First viewing PSYCHO when it came out, you had no idea that teen semi-idol Anthony Perkins was the killer; the only non-narrative shock element in it was having star Janet Leigh killed off by the end of the film's first half. Seeing Wagner as a psychopath back in 1956 had that same kind of stunning non-narrative shock for viewers, especially since we know he's the bad guy almost from the opening frame. Also, although the story is pretty dark, it is not a noir because noirs almost always depend on an innocent, or at least anti-heroic, male lead who gets into trouble because of, and is often destroyed by, a femme fatale. In this film, there is only one fatal character and it is the male lead. Wagner does it very well, Joanne Woodward is moving as his (first) victim, and even beautiful Virginia Leith comes over pretty well. Jeffrey Hunter as a young, pipe-smoking college professor comes over basically, given his later career identification, as a young pipe-smoking and beardless Jesus Christ, with glasses! But the film is quite good. What keeps it from being truly memorable or even great is that it is based on one of the very great mystery novels of the period by Ira Levin (his first success, and long before ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE STEPFORD WIVES and THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL, it quite literally made his name), and that novel has one of the greatest of all surprises in a mystery novel midway through it, one that could make you drop the book in shock while exclaiming, "Oh, my God!", but it is that effective because you are reading a narrative in which the author can disguise certain plot elements in words, and the shock cannot be duplicated on the screen by virtue of the fact that you can actually SEE the characters going through all their machinations, so that such surprise elements cannot be hidden from the viewer. Too bad, though, because if a writer/director could come up with a way to duplicate Levin's written surprise, he might have a totally brilliant mystery film to offer. In fact, it's nearest relationship to many of Hitchcock's later films is that it is a beautifully filmed daylight thriller. Indeed, most of the worst things in the film happen around noontime, in broad daylight and in glorious Technicolor, and that can be hard to pull off. It is pulled off very well here, indeed. Finally, since I am of the film's period, I can attest to the fact that this movie really does provide a legitimate 1950s atmosphere - visually, ethically and morally. You wouldn't really be all that surprised to see Dwight D. Eisenhower walking through Robert Wagner's college campus!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Wagner knocks Joanne Woodward up for Oswald &amp; Levin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Handsome college student Robert Wagner (as Bud Corliss) gets his heiress fiance, Joanne Woodward (as Dorothy "Dorrie" Kingship), "in trouble". Unfortunately, this means Mr. Wagner can't marry the two months pregnant Ms. Woodward - because her savvy father George Macready (as Leo Kingship) frowns on sex before marriage. Wagner realizes he will have to drop out of school, and support his disinherited love child, unless he can come up with another solution? When Woodward gets up unscathed, after her fall on the bleachers, it's almost like you're watching a cartoon. She suffers nary a scratch, and is too stupid to ask why Wagner expressed so little concern. Still, it's fun to watch 25-year-old Wagner try to get away with it; his is a cool, subliminal performance. And, just when you thought the film couldn't get any better looking, Jeffrey Hunter (as Gordon Grant) and Virginia Leith (as Ellen Kingship) enter the storyline. Director Gerd Oswald gets in some good Hitchcock-like licks; and, Mary Astor (as mother Corliss) dresses up well.****** A Kiss Before Dying (1956) Gerd Oswald ~ Robert Wagner, Joanne Woodward, Virginia Leith</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason I missed viewing this film and was taken by surprise at how very young Robert Wagner was in this picture. Wagner plays the role as a playboy looking for a rich young girl with a father who has plenty of money. Wagner is very tricky about his plans and at the same time makes some very big mistakes. Wagner finds himself with two girls who he has on the hook and he finds himself in a deep trap until he goes to the municipal building in town for a marriage license and at this point the film becomes a triller and we begin to become very interested in the plot and just how will it end. Enjoy a young Wagner, he was so young I did not recognize him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who wrote the musical score for this film? When the opening credits are given, the music played makes it appear that you will never be in for such a picture.Nevertheless, this is a good one with Robert Wagner as a 25 year old veteran in college, with much more than studying on his mind. Joanne Woodward is good in a totally supporting role as his first victim. As is the case with murder, once you start it can never stop and Wagner follows through with a second victim-to make the suicide theory look good.The next phase of the film is a real surprise when we see who Wagner really liked. George MacReady is not his usual sinister self. Here, he plays an embittered father who doesn't trust women. Surprised to see that Mary Astor was in such a rather benign role, but it's 1956 and her career was evidently on the wane.This is a good thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charming Killer And Two Sisters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1956 marks the year Robert Wagner went over to the dark side. In The Mountain he plays Spencer Tracy's spoiled younger brother and in A Kiss Before Dying, Wagner is a charming, but quite ruthless young man looking to better himself through bedroom skills.In fact impregnating Joanne Woodward might have done the trick in many cases. Normally they'd have gotten married and a reluctant father would have been happy just to protect his daughter's good name. However in Joanne's case and in her sister Virginia Leith's case, their father is puritanical George MacReady who long ago tossed their mom on the street because of an ancient indiscretion. Joanne knows full well that this could be her fate. Wagner knows if he's exposed as the dirty dog who knocked her up, MacReady will give him problems too.So to extricate himself Wagner plans a quite deliberate murder of Woodward. When it happens Leith isn't convinced its suicide even with a cryptic note. But young police detective Jeffrey Hunter likes her anyway. The story begins when Leith begins her own investigation and Wagner starts courting Leith.Robert Wagner shows his acting chops in this film. He was like that other contract player at 20th Century Fox Tyrone Power who kept pressing for roles to show what he could do as well. Both of course eventually got them. Joanne Woodward is a year away from her career breakthrough in The Three Faces Of Eve and she's sweet and tender as the naive kid in the clutches of a ruthless charmer. And George MacReady can be as evil as a puritan as well as the most diabolical of villains in which he's usually cast.A Kiss Before Dying is not a bad film, but with someone like an Alfred Hitchcock directing it would have been great. As it is, it's entertaining, but falls short of being a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Effective little psychological thriller that despite a number of major plot holes hold your attention from start to finish. Young handsome and very ambitious collage student Bud Corliss, Robert Wagner, had been planning to leave the depressing world that he's been brought up in as an only son to a single and middle-class mother,played by Mary Astor, for a life of money and power.Having a serious love affair with fellow student Dorothy, or Dorie as Bud calls her, Kingship ,Joanne Woodward, Bud is shocked to find that she's two months pregnant with his child. The fact that Dorothy's father copper tycoon Leo Kingship, George Macready, is such a strict blue-nose disciplinarian that the thought of his daughter marrying someone like Bud who's not only of a member of the lower classes but who didn't even respect Dorothy by having sex with her out of marriage would have him cut her out of her inheritance. That would leave Bud, together with Dorothy, out in the cold without as much as a cent to buy a pack of Bazooka Chewing Gum. With his brain working overtime Bud comes up with a plan to have Dorothy murdered! You wonder why would Bud wan't to kill Dorothy, or anyone else for that matter! she's madly in love with him and would walk through the valley of death for the handsome but very emotionally-unstable heel. Even worse why risk setting himself on the road to a one-way trip to the state gas chamber for a minor, even though to some like Mr. Kingship it may be a very major, youthful indiscretion?Planning to have Dorothy swallow some lethal pills that he stole out of the school supply room the plan backfires on the scheming Bud with Dorothy backing off at the very last moment from taking them. Bud was also a bit premature to send a suicide note, that he tricked Dorothy into writing, explaining how depressed she was and how life was no longer worth living. It's here where Bud has Dorothy see him at the county court house's marriage licenses bureau to finally tie the knot. As fate would have it, or was this all known in advance by Bud, the office was closed. Bud then talks Dorothy up to go on the roof of the building, that's some 15 stories high, for a quick smooch as well as to see the sunset. It turned out to be the very last view that Dorothy would ever see as she's thrown to her death by this sneering and murderous psycho.The second half of the movie "A Kiss Before Dying" drags on a bit but is also more interesting. Bud gets involved with the late Dorothy's sister Ellen, Virginia Leith, who doesn't believe that she killed herself. Ellen goes on to investigate who was responsible for Dorothy's death not knowing that the person who killed her is her fa?ence and future husband Bud Corliss! In her searching for her sisters murderer Ellen tracks down one of her boyfriends in collage Dwight Powell,Robert Quarry. Dwight who besides going out with Dorothy a few times knew that she was also dating Bud. Before Dwight could tell her what he knows about what he knows he's***SPOILER*** also murdered by Bud in his dorm room with Bud making it look like a suicide by leaving a suicide note on his typewriter. Bud acting as if he never knew Dorothy is quickly found to be lying when Gordon Grant, Jeffrey Hunter, a friend of the family unexpectedly shows up at a party given by Mr. Kingship for his future son-in-law, Bud Corliss. Gordon who works for the local police department recognized Bud as being the late Dorothy's former boyfriend. Doing some investigation on his own Gordon also finds out that her admitted killer the deceased Dwight Powell was actually in Mexico City at a tennis tournament the very day that Dorothy was supposed to have been murdered by him!Slam-bang ending that takes place at the massive Kingship strip mining site with Ellen confronting Bud with the evidence of his murdering her sister and him, as crazy as ever, at the same time trying to do her in just like he did Dorothy. But this time around it's Bud not his intended victim that ends up getting the shaft. Bud Corliss was not only a psychotic and murderer in the movie but also not very bright, even though he thought the world of himself, by his crazy and murderous actions. Why would Bud kill a girl who was sincerely in love with him just because he got her pregnant? It wasn't a crime that would put him behind bars or in the death house awaiting execution. Yet he risk both his freedom and life by doing it! Bud's attempt to later murder Ellen was even more insane then his murdering her sister. What did he think he would have gained by doing that? Show that he dated both Dorothy and her sister Ellen who both ended up dead! And in the case of Ellen he didn't even have time to fake a suicide note thus showing beyond a shadow of a doubt that he murdered her and very possibly her sister Dorothy as well? Bud sudden and dramatic demise put an end to his insane scheme of achieving money and power which would have proved to be just a pipe dream and life behind bars even if he succeeded in murdering Ellen which fortunately he didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See both versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be difficult to determine which is better, "A Kiss Before Dying" 1956, or "A Kiss Before Dying" 1991. It would benefit the viewer to rent them both because the 1991 version gives the same story a different perspective. Both are worthwhile and to be enjoyed by fans of the suspense genre.The story involves greed and misdirected love based on a novel by Ira Levin, later gaining notoriety with "The Stepford Wives." Bud Corliss (as in core-less)(Robert Wagner) is not so much dominated by his mother, as is Norman Bates in the later "Psycho," but tends to dominate his mother, played knowingly by the fine actress Mary Astor. Corliss continually criticizes his mother for the way she dresses and even invites her out on a dinner date with him, indicating a latent incestuous relationship. Corliss is presented as a callous egomaniac who murders his pregnant girlfriend, Dorie (Joanne Woodward), when he discovers that her rich father (George Macready) may reject him for his indiscretion. He then turns to Dorie's sister, Ellen (Virginia Leith), who is conducting her own investigation into her sister's strange demise. Ellen is assisted in her quest for justice by Gordon Grant (Jeffrey Hunter), who works with the police. Grant once had a glimpse of Corliss and Dorie together. Tension mounts as the pieces to the puzzle begin to fall into place leading to an exciting conclusion.Robert Wagner gives the best performance of his career, showing the cinema world that he was not just another pretty face. Unfortunately, after revealing himself as an actor of great potential in this film, he slipped back into his pretty face image. Even today in his mid-seventies, Robert Wagner continues to dazzle the women while often giving lackluster performances before the camera. Though Virginia Leith is a bit bland as Dorie's inquisitive sister, Joanne Woodward shines as Corliss' doomed girlfriend.Perhaps too much time is spent at the beginning of the film building up the house of cards, but the actual killing scene atop the municipal building is handled with skill by German-born director Gerd Oswald. The audience is led to anticipate the fall for what seems to be several minutes with the suspense becoming almost unbearable. The cinematography is exceptional, especially the last scene at the smelter. By all means, see this one in wide screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Each kiss a prelude to?.DEATH!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always thought Robert Wagner deserved a better film career than he got, as he's an excellent actor and did a number of movies, including All the Fine Young Cannibals (1960), and The Longest Day (1962), before transitioning to television in the late 60's working on shows like It Takes A Thief and his signature role as Jonathan Hart of the Hart to Hart series. Remember, back in the day it was looked as a major step down to go from films to television, a similar, contemporary comparison being that of working in theatrical releases and then finding yourself in direct to video market hell (Lou Diamond Phillips) or voice-overs for video games (Ray Liotta). Work is work, I suppose, and A Kiss Before Dying (1956) is certainly one of Wagner's finer film roles, in my opinion.Based on a novel by Ira Levin (Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives), A Kiss Before Dying was directed by Gerd Oswald, one of the more prominent directors in the early days of television, working on such shows as Rawhide, Bonanza, The Outer Limits, The Fugitive, and Star Trek, to name a few. The film stars, as I mentioned before, a very young Robert Wagner, Joanne Woodward, her next being The Three Faces of Eve (1957), Mary Astor (The Maltese Falcon), Jeffrey Hunter (The Searchers), George Macready (The Big Clock), and Virginia Leith, who saw her career bottom out six years later in the seminal sci-fi schlocker The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1962). Also appearing is Robert Quarry, who would later achieve a cult-like following for his starring role in Count Yorga, Vampire (1970) and its' follow up, The Return of Count Yorga (1971).The film opens on a young couple in a small room, the woman weeping softly on the bed, and the man looking as if to console her. The woman's name is Dorothy Kingship (Woodward), and the man is Bud Corliss (Wagner). As the scene presented itself, I took a wild stab in my mind as to what was going on, and I was right?the girl has learned she's pregnant, and now she's broken the news to her boyfriend. Bud seems to offer his reassurances that he'll do right by her, and she accepts them, but to the viewer his words (and actions) seemed to be tinged by a sinister quality, one someone who is blinded by love may not notice. We later find out Dorothy comes from money, and her father (Macready), a stern man, would look poorly on her condition, cutting off any financial support. We later learn Bud's not so much in love with Dorothy, but the wealth her family could provide, and now that the milk from his potential cash cow has soured, due to Dorothy's condition, he must find a way to extricate himself from this situation (can you say murder?), and does so, with a great deal of meticulous, planning. Soon Dorothy's sister, Ellen, who's not convinced the evidence around her sister's death is as clear cut as the police would believe (they thought it suicide), looks into the matter herself, uncovering the well hidden tracks of a cold, ruthless killer, one who's aware of her every move, and won't let anything stand between him and what he believes is rightfully his? I really enjoyed this film?the contrast between Robert Wagner's boyish, all-American good looks and his characters' cold, relentless malevolent drive in achieving his goals was really creepy. He was smart, charming, always seemed to know the right thing to say, and incredibly focused on the details, wary of leaving anything that might lead back to himself. His willingness to do whatever he has to in maintaining his deception is beyond what many could even begin to fathom, even managing to keep his own mother in the dark (which is no easy task, for any of you out there with a mother should be able to attest). Rarely have I seen such an ugly, rotten-to-the-core being hidden by such a handsome and absorbing faade, except maybe in the Omen films (especially the last one with Sam Neill). Everyone else did reasonably well, although I felt casting Macready as the father seemed a bit too obvious, and Hunter's character, as the tutor/junior police investigator, seemed more of a plot contrivance rather than a character. Oswald does a wonderful job directing, and while the story is slow moving at first, it worked well to allow us to really study Wagner's character, the depths of his roguish villainy, and also to set up Woodward's character for a spectacularly shocking demise (don't watch the trailer prior to watching the film, as it will spoil this). Ahhh, but even the most meticulous of plans can come unraveled, especially those based on deception, and soon Bud finds certain loose threads may be his undoing. The ending was theatrically sensational, although I've read that some felt it was a little too over-the-top, ill-befitting the subtle nature of the story, but I thought it was aptly appropriate given the diabolical nature of Wagner's character. One thing that kind of puzzled me is based on Wagner's character's nature for meticulousness, I thought it strange that he should flub his initial, carefully crafted efforts by getting Dorothy pregnant. I know sex ed wasn't focused on as much in the 50's as it may be now, but seeing as how Bud's cousin worked in a pharmacy, I would have thought obtaining prophylactics wouldn't have been that big of a deal?oh well?Cookieman108</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The origin of "Columbo"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half or so of this movie is just like the set-up to the murder in a "Columbo" episode. "Grant" is clearly what became Columbo, with a pipe instead of a cigar.The California setting is virtually identical with that in Columbo episodes, along with the rich life-style (here in the background for some time). With a little refection I think my point will become clear.The essential similarity with Columbo, from a plot point of view, is that the protagonist, Bud Corliss, resolves a crisis in his life by resorting to murder; a resolution, as the plot develops, that should result in a perfect crime (in his mind and the viewers'). But the murderer over-reaches and there are clues--but not as many as in a Columbo episode.Besides leading to a great TV series, the movie itself is damn good.Mark Ottawa</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Kiss Before Dying, what can I say? Even the title is creepy and suggestive. In this classic 1956 thriller, we learn just how far a greedy, smooth-talking pretty-boy will go to get what he wants. When Bud Corliss, Korean War veteran and college man, learns his lover, Dorie Kingship is expected a child out of wedlock by him, a fatal series of schemes, lies, and murders is set in motion. Why? Because Bud is simply charming sweet, but all-too trusting Dorie in order to get ahead in her father's lucrative copper business by marrying her. Since this happens in the mid-fifties, her pregnancy means the end to his dreams of wealth and prestige. Dorie's cold, strict father would throw them both on their ears. So in order to save his reputation and future, Bud decides to kill Dorie and make it seem like suicide based on shame and guilt over the pregnancy. His plan is clever, simple, and goes perfectly, or so he thinks. He shoves Dorie off the roof of a high building and calmly walks away. However, her sister Ellen has suspicions, and plays amateur detective, indirectly prompting Bud to fake another suicide to silence a witness. Tension builds to a breaking point you'll be shocked by. Is it dated? Yes. Corny? At times. Melodramatic? You had better believe it. But is it worth watching? Extremely. Robert Wagner gives a chilling portrayal of a truly evil young man, and Virginia Leith shines as the relentless bringer of justice for her tragic sister. This is a "Kiss" that will take your breath away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Wagner, a handsome and clever young student at an Arizona university, takes up with desperately lonely and prodigiously mousy Joanne Woodward. She's the daughter of George Macready, who is filthy rich. But the feckless Woodward becomes pregnant, which doesn't auger well for the couple's being blessed by straight-laced Dad. That is, if she gets knocked up and elopes in violation of the norms of the rich, she's disenfranchised.So Wagner sensibly takes his adoring girl friend to the Marriage License Bureau and then, finding the office closed for lunch, guides her to the roof and flings her off.If at first you don't succeed, try, try again, they say, so Wagner, oozing a sleazy charm, pitches woo at Macready's OTHER young daughter, Virginia Leith, and courts her properly.Leith, though, suspects that her sister's death is murder, not the suicide it appears to be. She seeks out one of Woodward's former beaux. He is sympathetic and is about to give Leith the identity of another of Woodward's boyfriends, namely Wagner himself, but Wagner shoots him dead and plants a suicide note on him.Meanwhile, in the background of all these machinations, detective Jeffrey Hunter is prowling around trying to uncover the truth. Finally he settles on Wagner. At the end, standing on the lip of a deep mining pit, Leith has determined that Wagner is the guilty party because she catches him in a not-quite inculpating fib. She accuses him. He confesses instead of sticking to his story. She doesn't believe him. So he tries to throw HER off the cliff -- but she's rescued at the last minute by Hunter and Macready, and Wagner falls to his well-deserved doom.It's a pretty decent murder story with no outstanding elements except Wagner's character. "Psychopath" was a much overused term a generation or two ago, so the shrink industry has tried to refine it, going through "sociopath" to the current "anti-social personality," which doesn't quite fit the template of a psychopathic personality. These are guys (mostly) who have no moral qualms, who think only about themselves, experience no anxiety except the most shallow, and don't know the meaning of the word remorse. Wagner's character is close to perfect, at least in the area of using his good looks, charm, and pheromones for pecuniary purposes.His performance is adequate, as always, and perhaps better than that. The use of that boyish smile to get him out of tight spots contrasts nicely with his self-interested blank when he's alone. Ditto for the other principals. Macready's facial and vocal default position is icy disdain. When he talks in his sleep it sounds haughty. Now, when he actually tries to PROJECT icy disdain, he comes across like Alice's Red Queen. Virginia Leith is attractive and elegant and can't act. The sound is tinny and the photography has the flat values of a television movie.The direction by Gerd Oswald is functional and avoids some of the usual clichs. Two examples: (1) Wagner, all smiles, wants to coax something out of his loving mother so he invites her to choose the tie he's going to wear today. When she gives him what he wants and then leaves, his smile disappears and he matter-of-factly replaces the tie she's picked with another of his own choosing. (2) Wagner walks up to a face mirror, the camera shooting over his shoulder, and grooms himself -- and the mirror is NOT set at an oblique angle, so we do NOT see Wagner's face staring directly at the audience. I wanted to applaud, but then it occurred to me -- unless -- unless -- is Gerd Oswald such a newbie, such a clumsy and innocent tyro, that he's unaware of the clich and just hasn't THOUGHT of it? Lord, I hope not. I hope he thought it through and came out the other side. At the same time, I can't help imagining what Hitchcock would have done with Ira Levin's plot. In superficial ways it resembles "Psycho" and is reminiscent of "Shadow of a Doubt."Robert Wagner is a nice guy. To his friends he's "R.J." He was my supporting player in the superlative and unjustly vilified miniseries "Windmills of the Gods." Oh, I tried to teach the kid a few thespian tricks but I never really got the chance because the closest I came to him was brushing shoulders. What a long resume he has. George Macready, too, had a long and fruitful career on the screen, always more or less the same character, but we need those kinds of actors. It's reassuring to see them. They're fixed points in a changing and baffling universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiss Before Dying, A (1956) *** (out of 4) Flawed but suspenseful thriller has Robert Wagner playing a fortune hunter who will stop at nothing to marry into a rich family. I've been meaning to watch this for quite sometime now but just finally got around to it. The film works on many levels but also comes off very childish on others. The best thing about the film are the performances from the entire cast. Wagner is perfectly twisted as the money hungry killer and he comes off very well and it's easy to see why these woman would fall for him. Jeffrey Hunter is good as the cop investigating the murder, Joanne Woodward is terrific as the younger sister and Virginia Leith is very strong in her role. There some nice suspense during the murder sequences as well as the ending, which makes you forgot several childish plot twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Super-Suspenseful Re-Working of an Unfilmable Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always thought this was a 20th Century-Fox production. All the stars were under contract to Fox at the time and so were most of the technical personnel. Gerd Oswald does a great job, building suspense to breaking point and making most effective use of the wide screen to pointedly capture his locations in Tucson and elsewhere in Arizona, and yet emphasize the disturbing emotional distance between his players by often placing them right against opposing frame lines (a clever device that has been outlawed since the mid-1970s because of the demands of TV syndication). True, Oswald had never directed a cinema movie before, although he did have extensive experience as an assistant director and had directed two TV episodes.Robert Wagner gives a startlingly compelling performance as the killer (he is identified right from the start) and receives outstanding support from the lovely Virginia Leith. Also most effectively cast is Joanne Woodward, and in a minor role but key scene, Robert Quarry. Like Wagner, Jeffrey Hunter is also cast against type, but he is less impressive and tends to over-use his prop spectacles.Although Lionel Newman's score and his title song (lyrics by Carroll Coates, sung by Dolores Hawkins) have been criticized, I found both very suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Unseen hot sex and nudity but you know it's there. No blood and guts but you know it's there. The acting was great and the storyline was believable. Any remake should stick to the original theme and essence of the movie. I'd like to see our forensic style of investigation in any remake and would like the villain to go to jail instead of dying. JoAnn Woodward is such a great actress that I almost wish she had the part of her sister so I could have seen more of her. I think Jeffrey Hunter was good but someone with a more serious face (maybe not so good-looking) might have been better for that part. We've come a long way. Audiences are more educated now and not easily spoofed. The remake should be judged by the original version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways it has the feel of a medium budget B-flim, though it is shot in color and widescreen -- not characteristic features for B films of the mid-50s. This feeling is undoubtedly the result of a script (by Ira Levin) that doesn't do justice to Lawrence Roman's thriller novel. The somewhat routine direction by Gerd Oswald doesn't help matters either. What elevates this film is the work of Robert Wagner, arguably the finest of his career. A full and complete characterization is realized by Wagner, who deliniates a complex pathological killer. Wagner is supported by a host of most talented actors, including Joanne Woodward, Mary Astor and George Macready. It is interesting to see Jeffrey Hunter playing opposite Wagner here as well. These two were often competitors for the same leading male role in many films during this period, with Wagner slightly edging out Hunter. With a little more polish, style and imagination "A Kiss Before Dying" could have been a noir classic; as it is, it's just a interesting example of slick, big studio film making from the 50s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..A Kiss before Dying" almost killed me..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerd Oswalk made a "pretty" picture, but it certainly wasn't a "thriller", to me. So predictable ! If the story had been good, I'd have overlooked that.The "brilliant" comments before mine makes me wonder if we all saw the same movie. BUT, Robert Wagner ("Bud Corliss") DEFINITELY was not the "noir"-type actor, nor was Jeffrey Hunter ("Prof Grant") anything near the role he was assigned. Both of those guys were TOO pretty for their roles....guess that's why Hunter was wearing glasses most of the time. I thought Joanne Woodward ("Dory") was ridiculous and not nearly pretty enough; Virginia Leith ("Ellen") was lovely, but an actress?? Guess that's why we didn't see her again...........someone compared this film as a companion-piece to "The Talented Mr. Ripley" WHAT ?? I have no idea how this film ended, but I guess Wagner got caught, huh? The scene in the "supply"-room was a hoot - and those rubber-gloves he ALWAYS had with him. AND, he even typed "Dory's" suicide-note on his own typewriter !! That was it for me. WOULD THAT STRONG, YOUNG MAN JUST SIT AT HIS DESK WAITING FOR WAGNER TO PULL THE TRIGGER ??? ...I left this film half-way....it looked beautiful, with all the stylish clothes the main character-guys wore (everyone else wore shirts) and the lovely autos, etc...ANYONE who compares this film to "Ripley" should be doomed to watch "Kiss" a jillion times. Double Boo !!</fullReview>
