		<shortDescription>A golden classic of British comedy cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When film studios are churning out rubbish like 'The Full Monty' and 'American Pie' under the heading of comedy, you have to wonder what sort of brainless morons are filling cinemas with laughter. It is nothing short of tragic that gargantuan amounts of cash are being expended on useless blow-outs like Titanic,Star Wars- The Phantom Menace, and just lately, The Beach. When Ealing Studios ceased production, the cinema world was suddenly very much poorer.The Ladykillers is undoubtedly one of the finest comedies ever made, certainly the best Ealing film of them all. Here is a film from the golden age of British cinema that will forever amuse and entertain. It is easy to be nostalgic about these old films but they are still held in high regard for a good reason-they were made by people who knew the art of film making. Moreover, they were made at a time when a trip to the cinema was still a special occasion. So they were made with love and care and with respect for the audience.The Ladykillers is unusual for an Ealing comedy, being made in colour. It would have worked just as well in black and white, possibly even etter.( I have watched it in black and white on TV by turning the colour controls off!) The location shots, which were done around the back of King's Cross station in London, capture forever something of the old London I used to know as a child.I suppose they best description for this film is a comedy of a bank robbery gone wrong. The ensemble acting is of the highest order; Katie Johnson as Mrs. Wilberforce just about steals the film from Alec Guinness. The hilarious script leaves you wanting more, even though a lot of the comedy is based on sight gags; the extended scene when the supposed 'musicians' come downstairs one by one while the Boccherini Quintet continues playing is wonderful, as are the moments involving General Gordon the parrot. The cinematography is beautifully realised and so British.Having read all of the comments on this film, I was suprised that so many American film lovers liked this film - British comedy like this doesn't usually travel well across the water. So a sincere big thank you to all of you guys over there who commented favourably on The Ladykillers.I don't think that we will ever see the return of institutions like Ealing Studios again, so The Ladykillers should be watched, enjoyed and loved by generations of film lovers to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mrs. Wilberforce, a senile old biddy living with her parrot in a ramshackle Victorian townhouse, is just sitting down to take her lonesome afternoon tea when she hears the bell ring. Rare occasion. She opens the door to reveal a striking-looking gentleman with lank hair and an air of indefinable loucheness. "Hello," he says, smiling graciously and instantly defining his loucheness -- his atrocious teeth. "I understand you have rooms to let."The prospective tenant is played by Alec Guinness, a long time before he attained the respectable old age that would make him such a convincing guru in Star Wars. Here he's in his lusty comedic prime, and from the moment he makes his unforgettable entrance, you know The Ladykillers is going to be a classic. Somehow, despite the silly cartoonishness of the story -- a meddlesome old lady foils the well-laid plans of a group of a bumbling bank robbers -- this is an ultra-sophisticated film. And despite the track record of director Alexander MacKendrick, despite the inspired performances he elicits from his cast, chief credit for its success must go to screenwriter William Rose. Most other comedies of the era, even those MacKendrick directed, suffer from forced repartee and obvious one-liners, making the viewer feel like an anchor is resting atop his head. Rose -- living up to his name -- has a lighter touch, reminiscent of the best comedies of recent years ( namely Rushmore. ) He invests each and every scene with a memorable hook, while at the same time forswearing even the least contrivance.For an example, take the scene where Mrs. Wilberforce confiscates the crooks' cello case full of "lolly" and stashes it in a locked closet. In almost any other movie, this emergency would be used as set-up, a new problem to solve, an excuse to pad the running time. In The Ladykillers, however, the crooks simply wait a few seconds until the old bat is gone, at which point one of them, the beefy one, rolls his eyes, raises his right arm, and negligently -- it's such a dainty little lock -- staves the closet in. Now that may not sound like much written here, it may not even sound very amusing, but when every scene in the movie boasts a similar surprise, the cumulative effect is exhilarating. Whether or not you enjoy the individual gags.For some reason, The Ladykillers is never screened, and written about even less. I can ALMOST understand the latter kind of neglect -- it's a hard movie to write about because, for all the talent and skill of its creators, it doesn't give you a lot to chew on. But while you're watching, it's an incomparable entertainment, one of those movies where every line of dialogue, every camera angle, every twist and turn in the story is felicitously, rapturously perfect. A true addiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic crime comedy that evidently can't be updated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The humor in this movie is not only British, which is notoriously misunderstood by American audiences (and vice versa), which is odd because both the writer and director were American, but it is also now five decades old. Only the best American comedies have lasted anywhere near that long (consider, for example, the sad fate of many of the movies that people thought were really funny in the 80s ? Police Academy, anyone?). The reason The Ladykillers has not only survived but has now been remade is because the comedy in it is not only effective, but it is intelligent, and it is very difficult not to be impressed by a comedy with a brain.Alec Guinness is in top form as the leader of the gang, whose members reflects criminals of all walks of life. The ingenious plan is to rent out a room from a sweet old lady while they pull off a heist. The comedy, for me, lies in the difference between what is planned and what is played out, particularly in the difficulties that the gang of criminals have in outsmarting a sweet old lady who acts like a grandmother supervising a group of unruly grandchildren.The problem that the movie has is that the pace is very slow and much of the comedy has faded over the years, but structurally and intellectually it remains a respectable film, even more now in comparison to its disastrous remake. What went wrong in the remake is that they did not maintain who the character of Mrs. Wilberforce was, because it was the juxtaposition of her as a frail old woman surrounded by toughened criminals that made it funny when things kept going wrong in their plan. In the remake she is replaced by Mrs. Munson, a tough-talking woman who was to be feared from the outset. There is no irony in being overpowered by someone more powerful than yourself from the outset, which I imagine is why the remake also featured Marlon Wayans and a case of irritable bowel syndrome, which I have never seen used in an even remotely amusing way.While the original film may be a bit too slow for modern audiences, it is indeed charming the way 87-year-old Mrs. Wilberforce continually foils their carefully thought out plans, many times inadvertently. Alec Guinness is wonderful as the band's leader, wearing outrageous false teeth, nearly rivaling Lon Chaney as the man of a thousand faces, and Peter Sellers is one of the criminals as well. I'm no expert about British comedies or Alec Guinness' early works, but I can certainly tell enough from watching this movie that the Coen Brothers' remake did nothing to impress the British about Hollywood's respect for the classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant. Absolutely Brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where did they dig up Katie Johnson? How she balances the act of a sweet old lady who is respected yet still patronized with the toughness of a strong woman who upholds justice is a joy to watch. All the while completely unawares of the true danger surrounding her. Her performance is simply great and side-splittingly funny. The rest of the cast display their usual talents, particularly the fumbling of Cecil Parker and the mean looking Herbert Lom. It's also interesting to see a very young Peter Sellers who would soon hit his stride a few years later. The dark lighting and moody scenes are perfect for this comedy and are very typical of British films of the era, so the look is familiar right away as you begin to watch. The "Tea Party" scene is just a riot. Odd to see so many negative comments on the film - it's one of if not the best Ealing film and deservedly regarded as one the best comedies of all time. They just dont make them like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic dark comedy with lots of mood and style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soon after this atmospheric black comedy begins, aged widow Johnson putters around her house (situated near a railyard) as an imposing shadow seems to peer at her from every window (accented by dramatic music.) When she opens the door, there stands Guinness, in one of his amusingly creepy personas. He rents a room from the lady and arranges to have his cronies come over to practice their quintet. Unfortunately, he has something else in mind and the quintet is merely a cover for a greater plan. The film has detail, wit and character to spare. Guinness (and his friends, played by legendary character actors like Sellars and Lom) are a funny, motley lot. However, the story really belongs to Johnson. Shamefully underbilled and unsung, she perfectly embodies the role at hand and is incredibly memorable in her understated sweetness and supposed vulnerability. This is a woman who looks for the best in everything and everyone and fights injustice whenever she encounters it. Johnson gives a quiet, yet towering performance and it is astonishing how disrespectful her billing is in the film and how little she's been given even in recent packaging. There is nothing wrong with Guinness's work, but this is Johnson's film. (Ironically, according to Robert Osborne, a younger actress was cast in the film, to be made up as older, because the producers felt that the sometimes demanding director would be too much for Johnson to bear. However, that actress died before filming, so Johnson was used and got on fine!) It is truly the type of film that won't be made again. (It may be RE-made, but never with the same quaint, understated style, nor with such polished actors.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not just the perfect comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the Ealing studio's finest achievements, this immensely entertaining crime caper looks at first glance to be pure, inconsequential entertainment. But it doubles as a sly, subtle rummage around the psychology of the respectable, old-fashioned middle classes, with Katie Johnson deserving top billing alongside Alec Guinness (she doesn't get it) for her remarkable turn as the lady in question, the redoubtable Mrs Wilberforce.No less than the not-quite-ruthless-enough gang of criminals who scheme in her house, she lives in her own private universe with its own particular rules and values. Though she begins the film as the stereotype of a maddeningly officious pillar of local society, it gradually emerges that there is a freer as well as shrewder spirit locked in there than meets the eye. The umbrella she is always losing (she herself suggests that she unconsciously _wants_ to lose it), the escapologist parrot, and most poignantly the memory of a 21st birthday party interrupted by the end of the Victorian age, all hint at an inner life that the comic plot could easily have done without. The screenplay, deservedly Oscar-nominated, has the genius and economy to provide us with all these hints without ever slowing down a tightly-edited and superbly directed narrative.The other characters are a good deal simpler, but Alec Guinness is in impressively seedy form as 'Professor' Marcus and Cecil Parker makes an appealing Major. Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom don't have a great deal to do and don't try to hog the limelight, but there's a nice cameo from Frankie Howerd. Ealing went out on a high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alec Guiness has to be one of the greatest actors of all time, and his role in The Lady Killers does not buck the trend. From the first moment I saw his dark shape looming through the doorway, I knew the character would be well creepy. And boy was it! With that horrible grin, those horrible teeth and that horrible laugh, it's little wonder that even the grim Herbert Lom starts to get a little freaked out.Nevertheless, Katie Johnson as the infuriating Mrs Wilberforce almost succeeds in stealing the show. There cannot be a more annoying person in the world, from the point of view of policemen, criminals and baggage handlers alike.The best scene of all, in my opinion, is the very last one, but I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it. I haven't actually watched the re-make of the film, and I'm certainly a big Tom Hanks fan, but I think it must be hard-pressed to beat this hilarious original. 8 out of 10. Obviously, it's rather old-fashioned and might not appeal to everyone's sense of humour. Ko, Izzy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go on about this, but I think this is one of the funniest comedies I've ever watched. So did my ten-year-old, with whom I've watched it many times on tape. I say "one of the funniest" deliberately because this is about as good as it gets, and other comedies have reached that same asymptotic height -- "Dr. Strangelove," for instance, or "Some Like it Hot," -- but none have, or is ever likely to, exceed it. Most of what can be said about this Ealing Comedy has already been said and I won't repeat it. I will add, however, one generally overlooked point. The principal cockatoo, "General Gordon," sees Professor Marcus's shadow on the door and squawks "SOS" in Morse code. One of the scenes I find most amusing, in a film filled with amusing scenes, is when Peter Sellers returns to the old house to find his four thuggish friends trapped in a room full of chirping old ladies in lavender and frothy lace. The thieves hold a cup of tea in one hand and a pastry in the other, except for Guiness who is draped scowling over a player piano that is tinkling out "Silver Threads Among the Gold." If you feel yourself falling into a funk, this is the one to watch. Well, okay, it's the one to watch anyway. A non pareil, light years better than my spelling of French.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant early dark comedy; much better than the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>London, 1955. Professor Marcus (Alex Guinness) plans to rob two armored cars with the help of a gang of crooks, played by an ensemble group of actors. They include: Louis (Herbert Lom), The Mayor (Cecil Parker), One-Round (Danny Green) and Harry (Peter Sellers). None of the men have previously met each other, but join together for the single heist.Their strategic planning takes place in the upstairs of a Victorian home owned by Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson), a somewhat eccentric older woman who is under the impression that Professor Marcus and his "friends" are part of a music orchestra and unite daily to rehearse. This leads to a film comprised of misconceptions, confusion, and bumbling antics, as the Professor has to spend more of his time keeping Mrs. Wilberforce off their backs than devoting it to planning the robbery.The film shares resemblance to Danny DeVito's "Duplex" in the scenes where Mrs. Wilberforce continuously interrupts the criminals' scheming, asking them to run errands for her. They reluctantly put up with her constant irritating questions and demands, since she is unknowingly a vital ingredient of their plan. They must use Mrs. Wilberforce in their robbery, and after a while she realizes this, then demands that they return the money, which leads them to the conclusion that they must kill the old woman or else risk losing their entire fortune. However, their constant mistakes and arguments only postpone the inevitable, and it soon seems that the group of tough guys aren't so tough after all. "I can't! I can't!" screams one of the criminals when he pulls the shortest toothpick and is handed the task of "whacking" the poor sweet lady.All actors are at their peeks here -- Guinness as the Professor is superb, but Sellers in his screen debut is especially noteworthy. The script by William Rose relies on macabre humor rather than constant slapstick. Admittedly, I expected the former when I sat down to see the film, although I came away rather surprised at its sophistication.The Coen Brothers remade the film in 2004, although the remake failed to capture the essence of this dark comedy. Made before political correctness (in the Coens' version there is the token black character of course), this is a delightfully irreverent black comedy. To be fair, most of the jokes don't hold up as well nowadays. It does not deliver a constant barrage of jokes, but rather a steady mix of black humor and plot -- a very good plot, too. One that keeps our interest and quite often manages to make us smile. "The Ladykillers" is a rare treat, better than the remake, a classic of the genre, and something that will be remembered years from now. It's a real gem of a movie, hard to devote long paragraphs to, much easier to devote 100 minutes of your life to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fortunate that Channel 4 in the UK showed this original classic film at the same time the new remake was about to hit the cinema screens. Many thanks therefore for providing two hours of classic cinema that showed clearly why Americans should not bother with naff remakes.A classic ensemble of some of the UK's finest acting talent o the time pull of a heist in the centre of London but when their landlady finds out what they are up to, a bizarre sequence of events leads the gang to turn on each other in a brilliant and amusingly written, directed and produced film.Whilst railway nostalgists will be wondering at the vintage footage of steam hauled trains coming out of St Pancras station and goods yard, others will be marvelling at the brilliant characterisations and script that makes this a timeless classic from Ealing studios.And then the Americans decide on an Americanised remake ? WHY?!? Apparently we are promised [unnecessary] remakes of all of the Ealing comedy classics ? can't wait for the Titfield Thunderbolt to be remade with a Class 66 and a 4-VEP then!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSOnce upon a time the British produced some of the finest comedy in the world. With legends like Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness and Frankie Howard, the country churned wonderful films out at an extraordinary rate. One of the finest of these was the Ealing production of "The Ladykillers".Little old Mrs Wilberforce (Katie Johnson) is looking for a tenant for her spare rooms. Turning up one day, the room is taken by the mysterious Professor Marcus (Alec Guinness). Telling Mrs Wilberforce that he and his friends are an amateur band, the Professor is in fact planning a robbery. Not taking account of the people human factor though, he doesn't take account of the involvement of Mrs Wilberforce.It's with films like this that we are shown just how things were done better in the old days. Recently remade into a modern American version, this original of the film is vastly superior with a better cast and a considerably darker feel. This is helped in particular by an absolutely stunning turn by Guinness as the criminal genius. He's not alone however. Aided by his gang of criminals, including Peter Sellers and Cecil Parker, Guinness is also aided in the film by some great cameos by Frankie Howard and Kenneth Connor.Aside from the cast, the true beauty of this film is the script and the plot. The way events turn against the gang and life gets increasingly uncomfortable is superbly handled, and the final Alec Guinness resolution is a moment to be remembered. All in all, it's films like "The Ladykillers" which remind us of just how good comedy should be. At only just over 90minutes, the film never drags and entertains from start to finish. Most modern comedians seem to rely on one joke repeated constantly. As a result, it's nice to see a film which still feels fresh and funny, fifty years after it was first released. If you want to watch a good comedy, ignore the modern stuff and go for this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sarcastic Black Humor British Comedy, With Five Elegant Small-Time Thieves and an Irritating Old Lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson) lodges five elegant men (Alec Guinness, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, Peter Sellers and Danny Green) in her home, who intend to rehearse string quintet music. Indeed, they are five small-time thieves having a very well planned strategy to robber an armored car. They use the naive Mrs. Wilberforce to bring the stolen money to her home. When they are leaving the house, an incident with the dumb One-Round (Danny Green) reveals the plan to the old lady. The success of the robbery fails due to the human element. The gang decides that she must be eliminated, but none of them has courage for killing her. A very funny end closes this great sarcastic black humor British comedy. Maybe what it is more amazing is that this film was made in 1955, and in 2003 it remains very funny and has not aged. The performance of the cast and the direction are fantastic in this movie. Katie Johnson is very irritating with her naive logic and procedures. An enjoyable classic in the genre, indicated for all public. As another user commented in IMDB, "a comedy that will live forever". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `O Quinteto da Morte' (`The Quintet of the Death')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, unsettling, rarely all that funny...and yet still a great comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're going to call this film funny, it might be better to think of the word as meaning strange, rather than amusing. In truth The Ladykillers rarely provokes laugh-out-loud moments, but that doesn't make it a failure in its own terms as I would argue that it sets out to use humour for a different purpose. This film isn't a comedy; it's an absurdity.Take away the comedic elements that have dated slightly ? Katie Johnson's story of alien visitors at the beginning seems rather twee now ? and we're left with a core of dark humour that gives the film a very unsettling tone. In fact, it's the film's status as a black comedy that saves it for a modern audience, as it transforms it from a caper movie ? it would seem very dated today ? into something else entirely.This is obvious from Alec Guinness's make-up and performance. On the one hand all the elements that make up his character are traditionally funny: the false overbite, for example, his permanent smile, and his upper-class obsequiousness towards his landlady should be funny. They're contrasted though with a pallid complexion and thinning hair to emphasise a malnourished, gaunt appearance that looks as if he's recently done a lengthy stretch at Her Majesty's pleasure. So, when we first see him at her door, dramatically lowering his hat to reveal his face, it looks as if the doddering old lady has been visited by something that's just come tottering out of a graveyard.The rest of the gang contrast off each other ? the size of the gang is crucial, since when Guinness is taken away we are left with an even number of thieves who can therefore be paired off against each other. As a consequence the humour of the fawning, inept major and the dumb, lovable oaf is offset and undermined by Herbert Lom's snarling gangster and Peter Sellers's amoral wideboy. By placing such disparate elements together on screen the fear of the less pleasant characters is offset, but also the comedy is drained from the funny characters and therefore the humour seems strange and slightly disturbing. This particularly affects the climax: the violence is slapstick, and yet at the same time it somehow isn't. Supposedly comic set-pieces, such as when the criminals are forced to endure a tea-party and sing-song around a piano become absurd ? and from the moment we're told that the crime is now "a hanging matter" it becomes clear that this film cannot end in the cosy way that you might expect a comedy caper to.This works because of the quality of the acting, as Katie Johnson's performance as Mrs Wilberforce ? despite being a comic exaggeration ? keeps the film grounded in reality enough to offset the five grotesques that plot a robbery under her lopsided roof (even the main location of the film is distorted in a slightly spooky way, and the motif of attempting to straighten the pictures is continued throughout the film to emphasise discomfort at this peculiar place). Meanwhile the five criminal characters are played with conviction that immerses the viewer in their world, creating a series of believable caricatures that further create the atmosphere of the film.The Ladykillers is a classic film, and uses comedy in a way that's about as sophisticated as anything I've ever seen. Just don't expect to actually laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Indominable Mrs. Wilberforce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I was somewhat amazed by what appeared to be a lazy construction. The first half of it, leading to the armored car robbery, was fairly straightforward, as "Professor" Marcus and his cronies put together their plan, and carry it out, with little Mrs. Wilberforce used as an unwitting courier of the cash. But from the end of the robbery to the conclusion the film seems to straggle on. It is only upon watching it three or four times that the mutual destruction of the criminals makes more and more sense, and the permanent victory of the little old lady caps off the film very satisfactorily indeed.Mrs. Wilberforce, elderly, crotchety (but in a gentle and genteel way), and very moral, is the personification of an earlier Britain - the Victorian/Edwardian period, where right was right and wrong was wrong. She is able to survive in her little corner of London because she is frail and the local authorities (the police represented by Jack Warner and Philip Stainton) "control her" by showing a degree of respect for her feelings and opinions. At the beginning of the film she is shown making her complaint (a daily occurrence) which they know are a nuisance and time-waster, but which they allow her the luxury to bring up. In her costume throughout the film, her real symbol is her umbrella. She always carries it, even when it is sunny out. The umbrella is a symbol of respect too - in one scene a police officer stops her to return the umbrella when she leaves it behind accidentally. Umbrellas are for protection, like Victorian morality is supposed to be. Interestingly enough, at the tail end of the film, when she is convinced by the police (who don't realize it) to keep the stolen money, her morality is dented, and she abandons her old umbrella.Professor Marcus and his gang invade her home (peacefully, to be sure, as amateur musicians). They represent more modern times. Major Claude Courtney (Cecil Parker) is the military man, no longer a figure of respect but of shriveled honor - a comment (maybe) of the decline of the military and aristocracy and upper classes in 20th Century England. One Round and Harry are the urban proletariat - the uneducated lugs (although with a struggling morality that surprises them) and the "teddy boys" ready to break down society for fun and profit. Louis, with his vague foreign appearance and menace, is the waves of immigrants who have entered Britain, changing it's old courtesies and tolerance for age, honor, and justice. And Professor Marcus - he is a variant in the intelligentsia - an opportunist ready to get ahead by subterfuges (like pretending to play "Boccherini" quintets), and always ready with some sophistry as an argument (like his argument about the robbery boils down to some pittance added to the insurance premiums of England). They don't represent all of 20th Century England, but it is an intriguing cross section.The film has lovely, unexpected charms to it. In the middle of planning the demise of Mrs. Wilberforce, Marcus and his cohorts (and Mrs. W.) find her elderly friends have come over for a weekly visit. For at least an hour or two these guests are in the house. Mrs. Wilberforce is as upset about it as Marcus and his gang, but her anger is at the thieves - she insists (as though they were going to do so) that they refrain from doing anything that would embarrass her before her oldest friends. Louis, the only one who is not there (he's parking the getaway car on a side street) returns to be handed a teacup, and to watch the others assisting the old ladies in the singing of "Silver Threads Among the Gold". Guinness's look of helplessness at the player piano is a sight to behold.There are small treasures. When (at a moment of fear and excitement) Marcus , the Major, One Round, and Harry leave the bedroom, they accidentally leave the "Boccherini" piece playing on the record player. Louis has no intention of leaving to assist them (in feeding medicine to Mrs. Wilberforce's parrot), but just sits staring angrily into space, as the record continues playing. Then it starts skipping. Louis picks it up, looks at the label, and smashes the record he's come to hate.Another great moment is when Mrs. Wilberforce starts reminiscing to the others of her coming out party on January 22, 1901. She describes how she was finely dressed up, and all her friends came, and they had a splendid time dancing and eating. Then came word from her father they had to end, because the old queen died. And everyone left. Miss Johnson relays that dialog with as sweet softness, which her age makes one momentarily remember the end of the Victorian age (for it is the death of Queen Victoria that ended her party). But after she leaves the room the entire effect is marvelously punctured by Danny Green (One-Round). Looking totally baffled, he turns to the others and asks, "What is she talking about? Old Queen Who?" The film may not be the best "black comedy" in cinema (MONSIEUR VERDOUX and KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS are just as good choices for that slot) but it is in the top ten films of that type. And ten is what I give it here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy That Will Live Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy from another place and another time, that right now seems so long ago and far away, `The Ladykillers,' directed by Alexander Mackendrick, stars Alec Guinness, Cecil Parker, Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom, and stands as a perfect example of how charming, delightful, civilized and yes, `funny,' a film can be when approached with intelligence and respect for the audience. Guinness plays Professor Marcus, who puts together a gang to pull off the `perfect' robbery he has concocted. But, as it always is with all things `perfect,' it quickly goes awry for the gang, thanks to the involvement of an old lady (Katie Johnson), in whose house Marcus has taken rooms. And as the situation in which the gang finds themselves escalates as they try to put things to rights, the audience is treated to an exemplary piece of truly humorous and memorable cinema. Guinness anchors the farce with a superb characterization (even to altering his appearance with false teeth) of the Professor. It's a prime example of just how great a character actor Guinness was; as in all of his films, he creates a total character of Marcus, inside and out, beginning with the attitude and right on down to the smallest details that many actors would deem insignificant. There is a studied consistency he maintains throughout the film that would stand up to the closest scrutiny; it is not by accident that he is considered by many to be one of greatest actors of our times. And how great to see the youthful Peter Sellers in one of his earliest roles. Watch closely and you can see traces of the unique mannerisms that would mark his career; the slight hesitations, the inward, subtle consideration of the status quo and the sense he conveys in a split second that Murphy's Law is about to go into effect. He makes Harry, a member of the hapless gang, a memorable character. Herbert Lom (as Louis, in this precursor to his pairing with Sellers some twenty years later in the `Pink Panther' movies), Parker (Major Courtney) and Danny Green (One-Round) round out the gang, the likes of which you have never seen before, nor in all probability will ever see again, because-- as the saying goes-- they just don't make ?em like this any more. The supporting cast includes Jack Warner (The Superintendent), Philip Stainton (Sergeant), Kenneth Connor (Cab Driver) and Ewan Roberts (Constable). Clever and sophisticated, `The Ladykillers' is a testimony to just how grand and uplifting comedy can be, without resorting to the gross and often unpalatable `humor' upon which so many of today's contemporary comedies seem to depend. Not to say that today's comedies are no good; it's just that they so often lack the esteem and the `humanity'-- not to mention the longevity-- which lends itself to a film such as this one. Movies like this will be around long after most of the addle-brained Saturday Night Live induced fare is gone and forgotten. With the added bonus of having Guinness and Sellers together, this is a true classic in every sense of the word. This is what the magic of the movies is really all about. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best ever Ealing comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you had to choose a film that represented British Cinema at its best, you'd be hard-pressed to find one better than "The Ladykillers". The story, the sets, the actors, the photography, the humour, are all perfect. There isn't a bad performance anywhere, and that goes for everyone, including those who only briefly appear. The ladies who arrive for an afternoon tea party are all wonderful. Even the parrot, who creates mayhem amongst the thieves by escaping and flying around the room, puts in a perfect performance. Curiously the story is by an American, yet he has managed to portray all the idiosyncrasies that makes British humour what is is. The wonderful thing about the bunch of thieves is that they are all equally excellent. Alec Guinness with his crooked teeth, Peter Sellers' spiv, Herbert Lom's dark psychopath, Cecil Parker's colonel character and Danny Green's dumb heavyweight - with the wonderful nickname of one-round. The cameo performances of people like Frankie Howerd, Jack Warner, just add to the completeness of the film. But Katie Johnson is absolutely superb and the house she lives in, a fantastic creation of a Victorian house precariously sitting on top of a railway tunnel. The ending is incredible and if you thought that it might tail off here, well it doesn't. I cannot recommend it enough. Any student of British Cinema or those just wanting a really good laugh, this is the film to start with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very possibly the best thing to come out of the Ealing Studios. This sardonic gem ranks up with Casino Royale as one of the Perfect Storms of British comedy, and fifty years after it was released, it inspired a much less funny big-budget Hollywood remake (in which Tom Hanks showed us he's no Sir Alec Guinness).I bring up the contrast between Tom Hanks and Alec Guinness because it's central to why the Ealing Studios, modest-budget British original production is so much better than its 21st century remake. Alec Guinness plays a low-key, understated fake British professor and amateur criminal kingpin and still manages to be funnier than Tom Hanks' over-the-top, wildly over-acted caricature of a caricature of a "professor" from the Southern US.Guinness's deft comedic touch demonstrates his versatility as an actor - very careful asides by modern cinematic standards (British or American) distinguish his performance and contribute to the classic character of the original version of Ladykillers. Guinness's use of subtle incongruities in his character's persona do the comedic work, in contrast to the other characters' enjoyably absurd dialogue and the slapstick which winds through the plot.Herbert Lom and the other actors portraying the "musicians" of the gang all pull their oars, delivering professional and hilarious performances (and again, much less over-the-top than the modern, American interpretation of the film).Without spoiling the movie for anyone, I can say that the comedic timing and (for the time and technology) good production values are spot on, and this film's reputation as a classic of dark comedy is wholly deserved. This is one of the movies people should study before setting out to film comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to comedy, my favourite source is fast becoming the Ealing Studios films of the late 1940s and 1950s. The British have a certain down-to-earth and somewhat-warped sense of humour, and 'The Ladykillers' is the most excellent example I've yet come across. The first Ealing movie filmed in technicolour, and the final effort of director Alexander Mackendrick ('The Man in the White Suit,' 'Whisky Galore!') before he moved to Hollywood, 'The Ladykillers' is a delightfully black crime caper of murder and betrayal, the darkest comedy since Charles Chaplin turned wife-killer in 'Monsieur Verdoux (1947)' {interestingly, the working title of the latter was "The Ladykiller"}. In the urban jungle of post-War London, a gang of five criminals ? headed by the evil mastermind, Professor Marcus (Alec Guinness) ? plan the theft of ?60,000, masquerading as a rehearsing string quintet to fool their sweet, proper and slightly senile old landlord (Katie Johnson). After a seemingly-successful heist, the old woman happens upon the stolen "lolly," and her confused mind, not quite comprehending the gravity of her situation, insists that the men return the money. Fearing that she will bring their entire plan crumbling down, the five conspirators agree that the death of old Mrs. Wilberforce is an unavoidable necessity, and yet none of them can quite bring themselves to do it.Above all else, what makes 'The Ladykillers' such a classic is its impeccable casting. Alec Guinness is almost unrecognisable as Professor Marcus, with the brilliant actor somehow finding a perfect balance of polite gentleman, calculating genius and cackling mad-man. The remainder of the criminal team comprises of the polite and civil Major Courtney (Cecil Parker), a no-nonsense foreign gangster (Herbert Lom), a child-like muscle-man with a warm heart (Danny Green) and an impatient Cockney Teddy boy (Peter Sellers, in one of his first major roles). Of course, the limelight is arguably stolen by the delightful Katie Johnson as the sweet, well-meaning grandmother who unknowingly resists all attempts to have her killed. Johnson, aged around 80 years at the time, won a BAFTA for her role, and plays her character with such warmth and innocence that you can't comprehend how anybody could even entertain the notion of knocking her off. The contrast and conflict between all the main characters provides the film's wacky core, and each man's inability to carry out the homicide leads to numerous thefts, betrayals and murders. Writer William Rose (and an uncredited Jimmy O'Connor) engineered the Oscar-nominated screenplay, the idea for which reportedly came to Rose in a dream.Mackendrick certainly had an inimitable style of comedy, and various little film-making quirks make 'The Ladykillers' particularly unique and memorable. Most of the violence is implied off-screen, and I absolutely loved the use of the approaching trains to signal that something unsavoury was about to take place. The blinding cloud of steam that accompanied each passing locomotive not only served to shield the audience from any unwanted violence, but also created a stifling atmosphere of the dreaded unknown; after all, the most unsettling thing is that which we can't see. In 2004, the talented Coen brothers attempted a remake of this black comedy classic, starring Tom Hanks, which was decent enough but ultimately disappointing. It makes you think: when two of Hollywood's greatest modern minds can't even come close to this Ealing gem, it really does allow you to appreciate what an outstanding cinematic achievement it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so I like it. Why? Well it is that intoxicating combination of dry black humour, pathos and perhaps a pleasing inevitability that whatever twist the film takes, you know it should be no other way.I cannot fault the cast, I regretted as a kid that I did not see Katie Johnson again (I know she made many other films, but I have never collided with them), whereas Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers were often featured on a Saturday Matinee.I am, however, pleasantly surprised at how well this film is rated by IMDb! Of course I would give it high marks, but it is very interesting to see how many other people from other nations both 'get it' and appreciate it. It is perhaps, these days, just a gentle farce with black edges where naivety blends in with irony, and I am not claiming that it makes me LoL the whole time. But it is eminently watchable and re-watchable and I would never hesitate to recommend it; indeed those who do not like it would probably not 'get me' either!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This fantastic film is one of Ealing Studio's finest. Starring Alec Guinness at his finest, this funny, but not slapstick comedy is totally entertaining.For once, I am happy that my parents encouraged me to watch a film from days gone by. This, along with Fail Safe, and any Cagney film, are marvelous, and this could easily entertain today's kids too.And now, it IS available from DVD, as part of the Ealing Studios Comedy Collection, it has four titles, all on separate discs, with collectors postcards too. ?30 is a small price to pay for this, the Lavender Hill Mob, Kind Hearts &amp; Coronets and The Man In The White Suit (which I found very disappointing).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic of British comedy - 82%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every New Years Eve, I promise myself that I will watch more older movies over the course of the forthcoming 12 months. And, like most New Year's Resolutions, it's forgotten about after a mere three weeks. But it turns out Fate doesn't quit so easily - I kept missing this when it kept popping up on Freeview a few weeks back and lo and behold, my Better Half tracks down the DVD and surprises me with it. So it was that I found myself enjoying this veritable comedy classic from the greatly missing Ealing Studios which, despite a fairly recent Hollywood makeover, still holds its own against its contemporaries thanks to tight scripting, brilliant performances and a wickedly simple story that can't help but entertain.Just around the corner from Kings Cross station in London lives aging spinster Mrs Wilberforce (Katie Johnson) who is in sore need of company and advertises the rooms in her secluded house to let. Which is ideal for master criminal Professor Marcus (Alec Guinness) who is planning a heist and needs somewhere for his cohorts to hide after the job. Duping Mrs Wilberforce into thinking they are practising musicians, it seems like the perfect plan... but plans always have a flaw and sometimes, they can be fatal.The original version of "The Ladykillers" is a superb example of how to make a comic thriller that doesn't rely on anything other than the script and the actors. Guinness, as far removed from Obi Wan as you can imagine, excels as the charismatic charmer but each member of the cast holds their own including a young Peter Sellers and his "Pink Panther" co-star Herbert Lom. Johnson, however, is the true star - being both vulnerable and innocent yet steely and determined when need be. Credit must also go to screenwriter William Rose for an absolute peach of a story - it does feel a little theatrical at times but it has a charm and heart behind it, mocking the criminal's dim choice of plan as well as the system, manifesting as disbelieving police officer Jack Warner of "Dixon Of Dock Green" fame. At a little over 90 minutes duration, modern film fans may feel a little short-changed but any extra material that could have been squeezed out of the material would have felt like filler - a point proved by the Coens in 2004 when their version didn't exactly set the world alight.Of course the technical aspects of the film haven't survived too well - obvious blue-screening (not green) and lousy stunt mannequins are to be expected but they do detract slightly from what is otherwise an excellent picture. I defy anyone who can find it not to laugh at a film which is both funny and tense at the same time. It might be old-fashioned but this murderously macabre masterpiece is a true landmark picture in British cinema and remains one of the all-time greats. Even more surprising is how it manages to be better than a fistful of recent films I could mention, despite being nearly sixty years old. Imagine Jesse Owens beating Usain Bolt in the 100m final - true class never fades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're As 'Ot As The Rest Of Us Ma'am !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mrs Wilberforce is an elderly woman who lives just outside Kings Cross Railway Station in London. She rents two rooms to the mysterious Professor Marcus, who would like to rehearse with his amateur string quintet. Little does she know that the men are a gang of desperate criminals planning a train robbery in which she will play a key part ?This is perhaps the last great picture by the charming Ealing Studios (my favourite of which is Kind Hearts And Coronets) made during producer Michael Balcon's classic tenure, and it typifies their delightful black comedy style, fabulous writing and top-notch performances. As with all comedy, it's this latter quality which is particularly impressive, especially in the form of Johnson, who gives perhaps the best deadpan performance in cinema history (rivalled only by Margaret Dumont). At the age of eighty, with no major camera experience, she manages to convince us that she (the actress) is not quite savvy to what's happening, plays a straight foil to the men (three of whom were acting geniuses), delivers the richest performance in the film and sells the entire story. Guinness gives one of his funniest deliveries - his crooked teeth alone are hilarious - and it's fun to watch Sellers and Lom (in pre-Pink Panther days) giving equally brilliant but totally contrasting performances (Sellers milks every comic moment, Lom plays it completely straight and both are terrific). Brilliantly written by William Rose (an American, who also wrote The Russians Are Coming The Russians Are Coming) and full of delicious scenes (Marcus' sinister appearance, the numerous forgotten brolly gags, the recurring use of Luigi Boccherini's String Quintet in E Major, General Gordon's medicine, the old ladies' tea-party, drawing the short straw, the final gag with the train signal). Gifted director Mackendrick (why didn't he make more movies ?) deftly handles the engaging plot, the comic nuances of the characters and the excellent visual style. It's a Hitchcock thriller turned upside down and a drawing room farce given a deliciously sinister edge. Ill-advisedly remade by the Coen Brothers in 2004 - see that one just to witness how much better the original version is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine Ealing comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A much over-used expression, but this *is* a classic British comedy from Ealing Studios. It has a fine cast, although Alex Guiness seemed to be doing an Alistair Sim impersonation. Herbert Lom is miscast and a disappointment; he seems to be a refugee from a US gangster film and is quite unfunny.The prize must go to Katie Johnson as Mrs Wilberforce. This is a masterpiece of understatement that could easily have degraded into pathos but doesn't. Far from being senile, Mrs Wilberforce is merely naive and an innocent; a refugue from kinder, gentler times. She is the widow of a gentlemen, now down on her luck and living in a run-down Edwardian house over a railway viaduct. The scenes of her in the back of a taxi are gems.Some minor uncredited parts are terrific, particularly Kenneth Connor as the taxi driver. Frankie Howerd makes an all-to-brief appearance a costermonger -- his usual bumptious self.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The remake can not hold a candle to this treasure. It cost me a fortune on Blu Ray and it was worth every penny. I cannot tell you how many rooms full of existentially disparate people, different sexes and ages with everybody laughing all through the movie. She is such a treasure; often, the look on her face is sufficient to make you die laughing. That little tap on the door, with the tea tray as they have to rush back into the room with their musical instruments. What a cast of actors, Guiness, Sellers and Lom, Katie Johnson steals the movie. She is always endearing even as she is laying waste to their plans. The movie starts almost at once without any slow period at all. Guiness gives a great performance with that Satanic smile that oozes corruption and chicanery. Lom, who I had never seen as a villain, plays the hood of the group quite well. The writing is also the hidden star of the movie. The problem with the remake was with Tom Hanks. The lady was fine; in the remake, Hanks is so verbose that people were yelling Shut Up in the theater. The Coen's evidently think that intellectuals never stop talking and wrote Hank's professor as a never ceasing motor mouth that wrecked the movie.The way she wrecks their plans is often accidental but there is the same intimation that the Deity is watching over her. I love Guiness' line," Oh, not with Mrs. Wilberforce, we would have needed many more men. With her, ten or twenty would barely have been enough." Unlike the remake, she has several large, loud annoying birds that are always wrecking havoc on the criminals. I did prefer her she is much more subdued and quiet. She looks so innocuous and harmless. Notice when she tries to talk to the baby, it cries loudly. The police officers visibly cringe whenever she comes into the station. They never hear a word she says, they are so used to ignoring her while placating. This gives the ending much more realism than the remake. In the remake, the lady is more lucid and the officers do interact with her like a normal person. This made the ending have less verisimilitude. Here, she is treated as someone they do not even listen to whilst pretending they are. The main thing is better writing, better acting and frankly, a much better little old ladyIt costs a fortune even just on DVD much less Blu Ray. I am not kidding you, the most different people on earth all died laughing at this movie. This is a sure fire crowd pleaser if you are showing people movies. Enjoy This Old Gem!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most classic comedies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying it that the 1955 "The Ladykillers" is among the best known and most classic comedies, made after the silent movie period. And it's a movie that truly deserves its status.The movie has always been a very fun and entertaining one to watch. Even though it's over 50 years old already, it doesn't feel like it has aged badly or has become outdated as a movie. The humor of the movie is simply irresistible, at any day and age.Even though it's a star filled production it's perhaps the script that is the biggest star of the movie. It's a real fine comedy script, that is filled with the one gone wrong event after the other. The 5 criminals get themselves more and more in trouble, not because the police is hot on their tail but because they have increasing difficulties hiding their crime from old little Mrs. Wilberforce, who's house they are staying at and using as a cover for their heist. It's really great how the story is constantly progressing and building up to a point that you don't think it can get any crazier and escapable from for the 5 main criminals of the movie.The movie could also not had worked out so great and effective without a woman playing the old lady so likable. It's a very naive little lady, who is sweet but obviously has a little screw loose as well. It was one of the last roles for the then already 77 years old Katie Johnson and it will be the roles she'll always gets remembered for. It was also the only movie role that earned her an award; the BAFTA for best British actress (yes, that actually was still a category back then).But Katie Johnson is obviously not the biggest name in the movie. The cast list also has Alec Guinness, Herbert Lom and Peter Sellers on them, among others. It was such a great and memorable comedy role by Alec Guinness, who I think was always really in his element playing roles like this one. It were the type of comedy character roles Peter Sellers would later become well known and acclaimed for. Ironically enough he still possibly plays the least comical character within this movie. Herbert Lom still plays a more serious character but through his serious and toughness he still becomes a comical character within this screwball movie.The movie also managed to create the right visual atmosphere. It has a bit of a surreal look over it, with the old lady's old Victorion house being located in the midst of a big building block and a railroad. In the house itself everything is awry and old and frail looking, just like the old lady herself. The humor and comedy of the movie is more dark than anything else really. It's no slapstick and not a movie that tries to be hilarious and make you laugh constantly. The movie is more funny with it's subtle things, such as with its characters, the odd events, it's overall atmosphere and its greatly written and constructed story.A great classic comedy, that never gets old and you never grow tired off.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ealing's ensemble masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ladykillers is one of the genuine classics of British cinema. Indeed it's held in such high regard its often known as the best thing Ealing Studios ever put their money into. And its not hard to see why. Even now, 53 years later, the film has lost nothing. Its still as smooth, funny and deceptively sinister as the day it was made. My favourite comedy of the 50s.The Ladykillers is quite a black film at heart. Beneath the cosy, familial exterior beats the heart of a sadistic crime thriller. Something you may not pick up on right away. But you should. Director Alexander Mackendrick gleefully sets the tone right from the very first frame when Mrs Wilberforce (a blissfully naive Katie Johnson), a sweet little old lady stops to admire a baby in its pram. Suddenly the baby starts bawling its eyes out. Surely one of the most outrageous images ever to feature in a 50s British film.Just about everyone knows the story to The Ladykillers, but for those who live in ignorance of this wonderful film, here goes. Mrs Wilberforce is a kindly old lady who wouldn't hurt a fly. At least not on purpose. She's a walking disaster area, who lives in blissful innocence of the chaos she causes all around her.When she rents out a room in her home, its snapped up by silky devil Professor Marcus (Alec Guinness on fine scene-stealing form). Convincing Mrs Wilberforce he is part of an orchestral quintet, what Marcus and his merry band are really up to is a bank job, with Mrs Wilberforce as the lynch-pin.She will ensure the money is transported to the house without anyone even knowing Guinness's gang were involved. But through a careless mistake, she finds the money, and when it becomes clear she won't keep her mouth shut, the gang plot to bump her off.The Ladykillers is one of the greatest crime capers ever to emerge from the UK. The blackly hysterical chain of events that make up the film's 90 minutes are supremely funny, and oh so entertaining to follow. Ealing Studios turned out some classy stuff over the years, but The Ladykillers really was they're very best work.In some ways, the film has an almost straightforward robbery to carry it forward. But its the superb cast and they're excellent ensemble playing that really makes the film and turns it into an undisputed classic.Frequent Ealing collaborator Alec Guinness probably performed his best work for the studio with this film, along with his extraordinary tour-de-force in Kind Hearts and Coronets. The moment Professor Marcus shows up on Mrs Wilberforce's doorstep, he catches the attention. A knowing look, pale features and scary looking dental work, he looks for all the world a ghoul. In fact if the film had been made in B&amp;W, Guinness would have looked even more ghoulish, one suspects.Known for his ease at playing multiple roles, he so completely disappears into the character of Professor Marcus that after a while you begin to forget you're watching Alec Guinness at all. Its one of the most carefully embodied and impeccably acted performances he's ever given. This is a man who is the brains behind a perfectly thought out masterplan. And as everything begins to go horribly wrong right before his very eyes, his thinking becomes increasingly desperate. On the one hand trying to keep a cool head, but on the other he's bending under a tremendous amount of pressure. And as it continues to build, that rictus grin of his becomes very strained indeed.Mackendrick has also supported Guinness with a really exceptional ensemble cast. Fellow mimic Peter Sellers is also present and correct. A film must be something special if it manages to attract two actors able to play a wide variety of different characters. Still, I do feel Sellers is maybe a little underutilised. He's never really allowed to stand out from the crowd and make any one scene his own.Herbet Lom, Danny Green and Cecil Parker all impress in their own way. A hood, a muscle-man and a gentleman thief. Watching these mismatched men bicker and banter their way through the (im)perfect crime is gloriously entertaining. But although people say Alec Guinness stole the show, for me I felt that honour went to Katie Johnson's delightful turn as Mrs Wilberforce. She gives the film its heart. And without her, The Ladykillers would still be funny perhaps, but maybe a more hollow film.Every scene with her is a treat. She lives in a complete, unflappable world. Nothing seems to faze her. Except when confronted with less than upstanding citizens. Naturally very affronted, she takes steps to rectify it. Causing no end of problems. She's the reason Marcus' plan begins to spin out of control. And when she catches onto it (a wonderful moment where her facial expression says more than words ever could), her innate righteousness brings out the ugliness in those around her.Its at this point in the film where Mackendrick's direction really pays off. Paranoia and desperation begins to work its way through the cast until they become more interested in fighting each other than solving they're immediate problem. All the gang wind up dead in an intricately plotted final half-hour that Hitchcock would have been proud of. All blackly spiralling errors, mix-ups and misunderstandings. And hilarious as hell!The Coens' remake was the lesser but not altogether unenjoyable film. But the original is the classic. Funny. Thrilling. A wonderfully poetic climax, The Ladykillers is an addictive, untarnished gem of British cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London - A gang of thieves rents a room in a pivotal location from a dotty old hen whose lonely, social instincts are a source of constant irritation to everyone. Director Alexander MacKendrick's strength is to supply a very clear sense of space to the movie, which continually pays out dividends. The location filming here is both picturesque, and supportive; as in the God's-eye view that begins the movie. The shot joins the locations the characters will need for the entire plot - a train terminal, a dead end street, a granny cottage, an untrafficked no-man's land behind some residences, and a bunch of traintracks. It gives viewers a very precise spatial logic which will be exploited for the rest of the movie. It's also decorated with opportune, real-life architectural/urban events; an imposing late Victorian water tower watches over the heist, the loopy disorder of Kings Cross provides an engaging maze for the shenanigans. The heist itself is physicalized and depends on the elbow turns of Kings Cross. MacKendrick is either a genius of storyboarding, or extremely original on a set, incorporating little details when he sees the chance. I can't imagine this film being half as good without this sense of location.Just where you might expect the movie to run out of energy, or hit the wall, the climax arrives and it's even better than everything before it. The sequence, with characters running around yards and a hillock dispatching bodies and trying to kill each other, makes the movie almost like a Euro-noir. The wheel-barrel commute of the first body to the trainyard is an awesome composition. The shot of a doomed hood falling to his death on a ladder (into a cloud of steam) but determined to get off one last shot, will stay with me for a long time. The compositions aren't simply beautiful, but smart &amp; striking; which is pretty rare for a comedy.After a recent viewing of The Lavender Hill Mob, I popped this in dutifully, expecting that it had aged badly also. I definitely preferred this. It has much more humor; some is good (ripping the headlights off a car), some is weak (the phone booth gag). But at least it's trying, and you can recognize it's a comedy. I think Lavender Hill Mob got one laugh out of me. Ladykillers breaks up nicely into about 5 major movements. If you don't care for any particular space/segment, you only have to wait - at most - twenty minutes for the next one to begin. Thus, the heist which is clever enough, is over mercifully fast before it can hog the film (I hate elaborate heist flicks). In this case some plot-points are missed, but I didn't care. I've never been sold on a heist because of its persuasive setup. MacKendrick is terrific at inserting subtly-observed silliness which had me laughing out loud; the final, half-hearted cosh on Lawson's head with a blackjack, or the nuisance of a too-long scarf. The only strike against the film is that the color process looks like a hangover feels. And an insert shot of a cop on a rear-projected street at night may be the ugliest visual I've ever seen. The setup is similar to Arsenic and Old Lace except that it's actually funny. Alec Guiness's voice here sounds remarkably like the Grinch (Boris Karloff). You can anticipate the London the Beatles will be tearing up in '64 in A Hard Days Night. After having little interest in England my whole life, the specificity of this geography made me want to go explore. This is the best thing I've seen in months. Fabulous movie. So clever it reminds me of Blood Simple, or, given that the Coens made a terrible remake of The Ladykillers, they borrowed from this to make the somewhat similar Blood Simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Series Finishes on a High Note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the second Ealing Comedy to be made in colour. It is, however, very different in tone- both literally and metaphorically- to the only other colour film in the series, "The Titfield Thunderbolt". That was a bright, sunlit and cheerful comedy set against a verdant English countryside. "The Ladykillers", by contrast, is an urban black comedy characterised by muted colours. The setting is the area around Kings Cross and St Pancras stations in North London, which at this time appears to have been an area of genteel poverty, of once-elegant Victorian mansions which had become very run-down. The mid-fifties were the period in modern British history when the austerity of the immediate post-war years (depicted in some of the earlier Ealing comedies such as "Passport to Pimlico" and "The Lavender Hill Mob") was giving way to the hedonistic, never-had-it-so-good era of the late fifties and early sixties, although some pockets of poverty remained. One thing the two films have in common is that railways play an important part in both.The central character is Mrs Louisa Wilberforce, the elderly widow of a sea-captain, who lives in one of these ramshackle mansions, still furnished in the late Victorian/Edwardian style of her youth, down to the aspidistra and the sepia photographs on the walls. We learn that Mrs Wilberforce celebrated her twenty-first birthday on the day Queen Victoria died in January 1901, which means that she must be 75 years old in 1955 (not 87 as another reviewer stated). She dresses in what was, at least in comedies and cartoons (think of Giles's Grandma), regarded as the uniform of the old lady in the fifties and sixties- long dress, broad-brimmed flowery hat and an umbrella even in fine weather.Mrs Wilberforce has a lodger, a Professor Marcus, who is a keen musician and regularly invites his friends round to perform in a string quintet. At least, that is what she believes. In reality, Marcus and his friends are a gang of robbers who are planning a raid on a security van and use their musical evenings as a front for their criminal activities. There are similarities to "The Lavender Hill Mob", which also starred Alec Guinness as an outwardly-respectable citizen who planned a daring robbery. The plan goes ahead, apparently successfully, although there are farcical moments when Mrs Wilberforce who is unwittingly helping the gang by bringing the stolen loot home in a taxi, inadvertently threatens them with disaster by returning to recover her mislaid umbrella and stopping to berate a market trader (Frankie Howerd in an early film appearance) whom she believes is mistreating a horse.Eventually, disaster does strike. The gang's muscleman, the brainless One-Round, accidentally shows the stolen money to Mrs Wilberforce, and when she sees a newspaper headline about the crime she realises the true identity of the men. At this point, about halfway through the film, it changes from farce to black comedy. The term "ladykiller" in colloquial English normally means a handsome, charming man who is a practised seducer. In this film, however, the term is used absolutely literally; the men involved have in mind not seduction but murder.Unlike most of the other Ealing comedies, "The Ladykillers" does not deal with the theme of the little man against the system. It deals, in a detached, ironic way, with the theme that crime does not pay. In a twist that owes something to Chaucer's "Pardoner's Tale", the agents of retribution are not the police or the courts, but the criminals themselves. The gang decide that the only way to avoid detection is to murder the old lady, but owing to disagreements about how, and by whom, this is to be done and about the division of the proceeds of their crime, they end up killing each other, leaving her unscathed. If the early part of the film recalled "The Lavender Hill Mob", the second half is closer to "Kind Hearts and Coronets", another black Ealing comedy which treated murder as a subject for grim amusement.The success of this film is due to two factors. It has a sardonically witty script and it is superbly acted. The gang members are all individualised- Alec Guinness's toothy, seedily respectable Marcus, a man who seems menacing even when he is oozing an oily civility, Cecil Parker's cowardly bogus Major, Danny Green's One-Round (a man who, for all his stupidity, retains a certain basic decency), Peter Sellers's Cockney wide-boy and Herbert Lom's sinister, pitiless Louis. (Sellers and Lom were later to be reunited in the "Pink Panther" films). The real star, however, is Katie Johnson's loveably dotty old lady, eccentric but possessed of an innocent goodness. (Johnson was 77 when the film was made, and had only another two years to live)."The Ladykillers" was the last of the Ealing comedies, but it is one of the best and meant that the series finished on a high note. (In my view only "Passport to Pimlico" and "Kind Hearts" are better). The British film industry would never again see a comedy series of this quality, and would not see any individual film comedies to compare until the Pythons started turning their attention to the cinema in the late seventies and eighties. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A word on the DVD...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ladykillers" is quite simply a cinema masterpiece which represents the epitome of England's Golden Age of comedy from Ealing Studios. It's film noir mixed with a healthy dose of Tex Avery antics and dry wit. I much admired the remake, which I saw first, but I must admit it pales somewhat compared to the original. This film has come out on DVD in 2002 in Region 1 and is sold on its own as well as part of an "Alec Guinness Collection" (which also includes "The Man in the White Suit", "The Lavender Hill Mob", "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and "The Captain's Paradise"). It is not included in "The Ealing Studio Comedy Collection" (which includes "The Maggie", "A Run for Your Money", "Titfield Thunderbolt", "Whisky Galore!" and "Passport to Pimlico".) Like many other British films of the period (e.g.: the films in the "Peter Sellers Collection"), this film is presented in an absolutely pristine copy whose aspect ratio of 1.66:1 has been reduced to 1.70:1 in a way that the letterboxed picture will appear slightly pillarboxed on a normal set (in interlaced scanning mode) and will exactly fit a widescreen set without overscanning. (It has been enhanced for widescreen TVs.) The DVD edition compensates its lack of extras (other than a Guinness text bio) with an absolutely perfect colour transfer that renders every nuance of the much more subtle English Technicolor process. The sound is also uniformly excellent. Although the film was originally 97 minutes, this DVD has a running time of 91 minutes, which makes it "the American version". It would be interesting to know what happened to the six missing minutes. Could it be just a question of mistaking the "1" in "91" for a "7"? It remains a highly recommended purchase, like most other British comedies of the period available on DVD from the Canal + Image label.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps Ealing Studio's greatest comedy, The Ladykillers is a morality tale of darkly hilarious proportions. Shot by cinematographer Otto Heller in muted Technicolor and expressionistic shadow it combines actuality with neo-fantasy, successfully creating a dreamlike climate in which a grotesque series of murders can still appear to be funny. Literally dreamt up by American William Rose and directed by Alexander Mackendrick, who although raised in Scotland was also born in America, The Ladykillers is a clear crystallisation of the foreigner's perspective of ?Englishness'. This manifests itself in the creation of a world inhabited by a gang of colourful criminal caricatures. Danny Green is a moronic heavyweight, Cecil Parker an ex-officer/confidence trickster, Peter Sellers a teddy boy crook, Herbert Lom a ruthless Soho-foreign gangster and master comic Alec Guinness offers a tour de force as the professor, the insane mastermind behind the whole thing. From the moment Guinness makes his entrance, parodying the German Expressionism of Fritz Lang, it is obvious that this will be another of his British classics. However, it is Katie Johnson who steals the show as Mrs Wilberforce, treating the gang of criminals as if they were naughty children, filling them with tea whilst they plot to kill her. Jim Morahan, who also worked with Mackendrick and Guinness in The Man in the White Suit, does superb in his art direction. His lop-sided house oozes faded Victorian charm, complete with crooked pictures, a portrait of the departed Captain Wilberforce and a parrot named General Gordon. The real credit for The Ladykillers, however, must go to Rose for his fresh and innovative script that avoids the laboured formulaic plotting of many of the era's other comedies. Refusing to rely solely on witty one-liners and sterile satire, Rose keeps the pace quick, shocking his audience with twist after hilarious twist. His characters may all be stereotypes, but there is nothing stereotypical about his script. A razor sharp black comedy, this British classic goes much deeper than conventional capers. By contrasting crooks with old ladies, The Ladykillers slyly highlights the long lasting effects of Britain's illustrious Victorian past. Throughout the film numerous references to the past are made, all hinting that the times before the `Old Queen had past away' were a lot better. `We seem so terribly overcrowded already, don't we?' Mrs Wilberforce says, `It was different when I was a girl, quite different.' Though no where is this difference made more obvious than when she stops to smile at a baby in the street, who then begins to cry. The baby, symbolically representing the future, cries when it sees Mrs Wilberforce for it is reminded of Britain's past glory. In a similar way One Round, with his child's perspective on life, calls Mrs Wilberforce `Mum', wanting to protect her from the others he also sees something better in her. This also accounts for his constant bickering with Louis. `I tell you I don't like old ladies, I don't like having them around,' complains Louis `I can't stand them.' As the only foreigner in the gang, Louis hates Mrs Wilberforce more than anyone else because he has the most to lose through the survival of what she represents. For those who have accused British cinema of being parochial, insipid, self-satisfied rubbish The Ladykillers compels them to reconsider.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Special Providence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Otto Von Bismarck once remarked about the special providence God has for drunks, babes, and the United States of America. If he had ever seen The Ladykillers he might well have added daft little old ladies who are in a world all their own.This was sadly remade by Tom Hanks a few years ago, and the remake wasn't necessary. The charm of this comedy is its British origin and characters, a little old lady whose coming out debut coincided with the death of Queen Victoria, clashing with a gang of crooks all of whom are quite modern characters circa 1955.One of the crooks Alec Guinness rents a room from Katie Johnson who was 77 at the time this film was made. He brings his fellow heist accomplices over to plan an armored car robbery, similar to what he did as an amateur crook in The Lavendar Hill Mob.But as the final touch to his plan, Guinness involves Johnson in the plot as a dupe in which she goes to pick up a trunk where the money has been stashed. Against the advice of some of his gang, particularly Herbert Lom. But Guinness has his way and soon regrets it.Other members in the Guinness gang are Danny Green, Cecil Parker, and a young Peter Sellers. All I can say is it is a special providence indeed that protected Katie Johnson from these criminals and come out the way she did at the end of The Ladykillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misfit band attempts a great robbing , but their scheme is foiled by an allegedly innocent old lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent droll black comedy and featured by a British all-star-cast such as Alec Guinnes , Herbert Lom and Peter Sellers and originally written by Willian Rose ; being produced during the golden decade of Ealing studio . It deals with an eccentric man named professor Marcus , (Alec Guinness who had said that he based his characterisation on theatre critic) , actually a robber , and his crew called Major Courtney (Cecil Parker) , Mr. Harvey (Herbert Lom) , Mr. Robinson (Peter Sellers , though Richard Attenborough was originally considered for this role) and One-Round (Danny Green, though Tommy Cooper was suggested for the role but stage commitments prevented him from auditioning) pose as a band in order to rob an armored truck , all under the nose of his unsuspecting landlord , a sharp old woman (Katie Johnson) . The robbery took place in Cheney Street near its junction with Battle Bridge Road, immediately to the west of Kings Cross station . Then they rent a room in an old woman's house, but soon she discovers the plot and they must kill her, a task that is more difficult than it seems . The greatest criminal minds of all time have finally met their match.The picture is a funny and droll comedy especially in the parts happen the antics and flops one time the robbery was committed . Interesting and fun story by William Rose who claimed to have dreamed the entire story from start to finish . The laughters and chuckles are varied and giggles are based on diverse personalities and differences among protagonists . It's an agreeable movie for the youth and old people who will enjoy enormously and with lots of fun . This is a top-drawer comedy with a rather darker, more satirical edge to them than the rather cosy and parochial British comedy more typical of the era . Alec Guinness -in similar role to Tom Hanks many years later- is terrific as the leader , if you like Guinness manic performance , you'll enjoy this one . Special mention to Katie Johnson as the old landlady , though the producers originally rejected director Alexander Mackendrick's choice of Katie Johnson for the role of Mrs. Wilberforce on the grounds that she might be too frail for the project, and so they cast a younger actress -who died before filming began . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Otto Heller . Enjoyable musical score by Tristram Cary , adding the Minuet from Luigi Boccherini's "Quintet in E major, Opus 11, Number 5" , each time one of the gang members is killed, the arrangement of the music changes from quintet to quartet to trio etc, as if it is being played only by the surviving members of the gang . The motion picture was masterfully directed by Alexander Mackendrick who directed excellent films ; as he debuted in 1948 with the Ealing comedy classic Whisky Galore! (1949) and went on shooting : The man in the white suit , The 'Maggie' , Sammy Going South , A High Wind in Jamaica and Sweet Smell of Success . The flick will appeal to Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers fans and black comedy buffs . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile seeing , and it has been voted as one of "The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time". Plans to remake Ladykillers (1955) date back to 1998 when Robert Harling was attached to direct. Modern adaptation lso titled Ladykillers was directed by Cohen Brothers , Joel and Ethan , in 2004 , being a remake of the 1955 comedy ,this new version of the classic movie results to be as entertaining and amusing as the British film ; the story revolves again around professor who puts together a group of thieves to rob a loot, being starred by Tom Hanks , Irma P Hall , Tzi Ma , Marlon Wayans , Ryan Hurst , Tzi Ma and J.K. Simmons . Prior to filming, Tom Hanks as a Southern professor had not seen Ladykillers (1955) as he did not want it to prejudice the way he acted in the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful black Ealing comedy which like all the best darkly humorous movies I've ever seen is all the better for starting out innocently, even whimsically before gradually descending into deeper territory, while retaining enough good sense to turn back on itself in the final reel.The cinematography and general camera set-ups are imaginative in the first place (bar a few very-much-of-their-time rather garish process shots, which even Hitchcock wasn't above using). There's superb characterisation all the way down the cast-list, especially Katie Johnston as Mrs Wilberforce and Alec Guinness as the buck-toothed criminal mastermind whose best laid plans fall apart the minute the redoubtable petite-dame gets wind of her boarders' real intentions.The acting across the board is marvellous, from Guinness's creepy kingpin, to Peter Sellers' spivvy Teddy Boy and Herbert Lom's (whose path would of course cross with Sellers' again many times in the future, usually over bungled robberies too) near-psychopathic hit-man, but who baulks at dispatching the troublesome little old lady who threatens to disrupt the gang's escape, while of course the whole thing is set up for Johnston to steal the show which she does, with both hands.In a film of many humorous moments, surely none is more so than Guinness' last-man-standing demise at the railway which has served him so well up till then, but where he now literally gets his signals wrong.It would be easy to think of the Ealing comedies as quaint and quirky, but they often had a macabre undertow too, making them all the more intriguing and long-lasting in the memory. This sparkling movie is as fresh today as it ever was and thoroughly deserves its high rating here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a swift and somehow creepy way, a man casually sneaks after an sweet innocent old lady, (Mrs. Wilberforce). The old lady have just been in the local town, just doing her normal routine and right now she is heading home, she opens the door to her house and goes in, not knowing that she's been followed, and that the mysterious man himself is standing right outside on the doorsteps to her lopsided house. The doorbell is heard and the old lady curiously opens the door to be met by a joker-ish face, (Professor Marcus). His intentions seems innocent and he just want to rent a room, where he can practice with his amateurish orchestra band, which consists of Major Courtney, Mr. Harvey, Mr. Robinson and One-Round, but Marcus and his companions real intentions is to make a genius robbery, and use Mrs. W's old house as an disguise, because the police will never suspect them to be hiding in there, and best of all, Mrs. W will never notice a thing... or will she?This is... as said many times before, an outstanding performance of both acting and writing, a culmination of wonderful British actors and a touch of Ealing Studios, with other words, this movie kills me every time. The characters alone could make this movie work, because it offers maybe the best set of thieves filmed in movie history, and maybe also the funniest. As said, in this movie we get a good set of classic characters, we have the coward, the temperamental, the unlucky, the dumb and finally the clever one, and then we get the most sweet little old lady set on this earth, what a good job you did there Katie Johnson.This movie was also the first quality picture Peter Sellers was in, but not the movie where he gets the big leading role. His role as "Mr. Robinson" is by the way, just unbelievable good and so entertaining, even if the role is little he always manage to plant his acting mark. It's like this movie is remembered most by Sellers performance, and not all the other good stuff we get, and here I especially think about Katie Johnson's and Alec Guinness's characters, but thats just the way Sellers acting works - he always outshines the others. Watch this wonderfully dark comedy immediately, you wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alec Guinness is absolutely insane-looking in this movie, with his carnivorous teeth, black-rimmed eyes, and wild hair. He's got a cardigan draped over his shoulders and an ultra-long scarf, does dotty old Professor Marcus, so one would never suspect he's really a smooth-talking conman. He's planned a caper that is bound to succeed. He's rented rooms from Mrs. Wilberforce, an old dear who's widowed and lives in a crazily lopsided house above a railway line. He and his criminal cronies (including a young Peter Sellers and his future nemesis in the Pink Panther series, Herbert Lom) pose as a musical quintet who need rooms to practice in. Mrs. W. is delighted to oblige. They lock the door and put a record on the phonograph and plan their job on a cash heist. To their annoyance, however, the old lady is ever-so solicitous, knocking often and offering tea and praise for their beautiful music.The caper goes off as planned, with daffy Mrs. W. inadvertently having the "lolly" delivered directly to the house. The criminal's bumbling at the last minute tips her off to the goings-on before the gang can get away with the loot, and suddenly Professor Marcus has a lot of 'splaining to do. The group decides she must be gotten rid of (hence the title), and from there the fun begins.This film is great fun from start to finish, with fine performances by all. Sellers is brilliant as usual, Guinness is creepy and hilarious at the same time (much like another favorite movie of mine, "Murder by Death," where he's the blind butler). The odious Hollywood remake of several years ago cannot hold a candle to this one. Of course, film-makers have been dressing up an old, tired pig in new lipstick since film began, so it's not a new phenomenon. But to remake something as perfect as this movie is just pointless.Not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bright performances in a dark comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a marvel this film is, with stellar performances by great actors at very different points in their careers. Alec Guinness is every bit as quirky and disconcerting playing "Professor Markus" as Katie Johnson is serene and naive in the role of Mrs Wilberforce. Apparently, this film marked the debut of Peter Sellers. Guinness was in full stride in the middle of his brilliant career and dear little ol' Katie Johnson received the BAFTA Best Female Actress for this role only to die in 1957.Dark? Yes. Funny? You bet. Slapstick? Only occasionally. However, the screenplay is fabulous, justly receiving the BAFTA award for that category.I had seen a review of the recent remake in which this, the original, received endorsement.

		<shortDescription>Superb and immensely enjoyable Ealing comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ealing studios are well known for creating brilliantly witty comedies, and this is surely one of the best of them! The Ladykillers follows Alec Guinness and his band of crooks as they infiltrate an old woman's home and attempt to rob a bank in the process. Guinness' plan is so brilliant that the old dear herself is included in the plot - but nothing is ever that simple, especially not when your cohorts aren't the sharpest tools in the shed. The film works from a backbone consisting of very dry black humour and some slapstick thrown in for good measure, and the result is a film that is as easy to like as it is hilariously enjoyable. Despite a recent remake, they don't make films like this anymore and seeing the dark, but still good willed humour in this film is very refreshing indeed. What the film portrays is, in a way, quite horrifying, but the way that it's done is so well timed comically that it's hard to be frightened or disgusted by the idea of a lodgers not being quite what they seem, and far easier - and more enjoyable - to simply go along with the ensemble of brilliant characters that Ealing studios had put together! It's quite a cast that this movie has. Just being lead by Alec Guinness is impressive enough, but when you throw in the likes of Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom to help him out, the cast becomes one of the film's main assets. Guinness puts in a superb performance, which excellently sums up the movie in the way that it straddles the line between creepiness and comedy. Herbert Lom is my pick of the supporting players. He steals every scene he's in, and his "no-nonsense" persona bodes brilliantly with the film and the characters that he's surrounded by. The characters can easily be called clich - we've got the big dumb crook, the dippy old lady etc; but it's the way that the actors delve into the clichs that makes the performances memorable and the film a winner. Most of the laughs come about as a result of the characters and the way that they act - while the film's running joke, and the trademark Ealing ironic climax - come about through the plot. The Ladykillers is an all time classic and a film that will be enjoyed for many decades to come for that reason - it's judged it's plot and it's characters perfectly, and it's very hard on the whole to find anything wrong with this film at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a just about perfect little comedy.Perfect cast, for one thing. Alec Guinness strikes a balance of sinister and silly that can't be touched. His Karloffian Professor makes you giggle from the moment you get a good look at him, and yet somehow you still get a small prickly chill when Herbert Lom suggests he's crazy and Guinness, in a rage, slowly turns to face him. His supporting team, Lom, Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, and most especially Danny Green ("One-Round") are hilariously shady. And then of course there's sweet little Katie Johnson, as Mrs. Wilberforce, the "Lady." Watching her make her innocent way past the master criminals and through the proverbial Valley of the Shadow of Death (and in MacKendrick's hands it's really quite a dark shadow) becomes one of the pleasantest, funniest experiences I've ever had from a movie.This is dark comedy at its best; perfectly written, beautifully shot, and best of all performed with spirit.My favorite line (though there are many):One-Round: So all right! So I made a mistake!Doesn't sound funny? Watch it and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great to see such a positive response to one of Britain's finest movies, now sadly unknown to most of the younger generation.Some interesting points: The house used in the film never existed as a residence - it was constructed for the shoot. The front of the house was built in the middle of Argyle Street near St Pancras railway station, and the surrounding buildings still stand. The back of the house was built on open land at the end of Frederica Street off the Caledonian Road. This land is still accessible from Tileyard Road above the railway tunnels north of King's Cross station, and here you can relive the last movements of Professor Marcus and Louis (if you don't mind being pecked to death by geese). The hold-up itself was shot around Battle Bridge Road, and the famous phone box scene was filmed in Vernon Square.I still haven't tracked down the location of the street scenes around the police station, if indeed they are real streets.

		<shortDescription>Alec Guinness is terrific in this comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Ladykillers" a gang planning a robbery takes lodging in a little old lady's house. The little old lady thinks they are musicians. Mayhem ensues and eventually leads to the gang attempting to kill her, and further mayhem ensues. It's a simple plot, not hard to comprehend, fairly original, but nothing really special. What is special, however, is the execution. Good concepts are fairly common in movies, but the execution of those concepts, bringing them to life, so rarely happens this well. "The Ladykillers" is one of the wittiest and most refreshing comedies ever made."The Ladykillers", without a doubt, has one of the best screenplays written for any comedy in the history of film. There is not one second in the entire film which is boring, not one moment where the script falters, not even a small detail which could've been removed to improve the pacing. It is relentlessly funny. Still, I have seen films with screenplays as good which dramatically fall in quality due to bad delivery, bad editing, and most importantly static photography. The latter I'm willing to forgive for early films but in 1955 there is no longer an excuse for bad cinematography. This film is not only excellent in its dialogue and acting, but its photography and editing are also great. This film oozes style in nearly every shot.I would have never, upon first look at the cast prior to watching "The Ladykillers", thought that Alec Guinness would be the obvious standout, but he is. From the moment we meet his shadowy and creepy character we know we're in for a treat. That's not to discredit the remainder of the cast, all of whom are most certainly capable actors and who help keep this film entertaining at all times. The ensemble carries the film, and though the criminals are always fun to watch it is Katie Johnson who other than Guinness provides the film's most entertaining performance as the inadvertently annoying Mrs. Wilberforce.The film features several standout sequences, in one of them as the 'group of musicians' are about to leave Mrs. Wilberforce's house when a dozen or so very similarly annoying friends of Mrs. Wilberforce arrive for tea and urge the group to stay and play for them. In another, one of the few completely slapstick moments in the film, one of Mrs. Wilberforce's three parrots escape and the gang are forced to chase after it.The film, even in its most macabre moments is essentially cheerful. This is light entertainment of the highest order, written so well it should appeal to every sort of film viewer imaginable. Its short length and fast pace should keep anyone interested, while more discerning viewers can relish the endless wit the screenplay has to offer and the chemistry between the great actors on display. I can't see why anyone should dislike "The Ladykillers".9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very dark, disturbing and hilarious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. I particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from Hollywood.It's hard to say if this or The Man in the White Suit is my favorite Guinness film. However, it certainly is the most outwardly funny movie he did and I found myself laughing out loud throughout the film. It's a dark comedy about a gang who is planning a robbery. The ringleader, played by Guinness, lives in the upstairs flat belonging to a lovely old lady who the viewer can't help but like. He tells her he is a musician and that the gang members who come over from time to time are all musicians. To convince her, they each bring empty musical instrument cases when they arrive and play a record which she thinks is their little ensemble.Well, the robbery comes off without an apparent hitch. All is well. That is until the old woman accidentally stumbles on the loot and then the fun begins as they take turns trying to kill the lady. I know it doesn't sound funny, but it is--believe me! She is seemingly indestructible and the many ways they fail seem almost like something out of a Warner Brothers cartoon! Because of this and performances by the great cast, give it a try!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Entertaining Trifle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite an entertaining trifle, with a good cast, an amusing scenario, and a lot of little things done right. Its low-key approach makes an interesting contrast with the wacky story-line, and there's not a slack moment in the whole movie, from the opening setup to the climax.Almost anything with Alec Guinness is worth watching, and here he has plenty of help. Katie Johnson is very good as the innocent grandma-type whom "The Ladykillers" think they are going to exploit, and the rest of Guinness's gang also are all interesting characters. The crime caper story scores low on plausibility but high on entertainment value, with good helpings of humor and a little suspense along the way. The pacing is very good, and everything fits together quite well. There might be nothing weighty about it, but it's very enjoyable and nicely done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ladykillers", a delightful comedy of 1955, was one of the best films that came out of England in that period. Alexander Mackendrick, the director, had the fortune of working with the screen play by William Rose, making this a classic movie from the beloved Ealing Studios. The master plotter, Profesor Marcus, finds in Mrs. Wilberforce, the perfect landlady! Her small home is near King's Cross station in London, so convenient for the place in which to plot the perfect caper. By using the rooms being let by the old, unsuspecting, lady, Professor Marcus realizes he has stumbled on a good thing that seems the excellent setting for the right place to be. So, Marcus pretends to want to use the space for the string quintet he leads to rehearse. What Mrs. Wilberforce doesn't suspect is that her house is being used to plot a robbery from the station.Of course, there is no such thing as a perfect crime. There is always an innocent detail that gives the criminals away. In this caper it's in the cello case that gets stuck in the door of Mrs. Wilberforce's entrance door that is the beginning of the end for the criminal gang.Alec Guinnes as Profesor Marcus had one of the best opportunities of his career. Katie Johnson, is delicious as the landlady who has no inkling of what is going on under her roof, but who at the end, seems to have profit from the surprising twist. Peter Sellers, Herbert Lom, Danny Green, Cecil Parker, are the other members of the criminal quintet. Thanks to Mr. Macendrick's direction this timeless classic will always delight viewers forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pitch-black comedy from the Ealing team. To my shame, I'd never seen THE LADYKILLERS before now, but it's a story that has certainly stood the test of time and is much better than the maligned remake that came out a decade or so ago. The story, of five criminals who pull off a gold bullion robbery but who are then thwarted in their plans by the interventions of their well meaning elderly landlord, is perfectly written and memorable indeed.Much of the running time seems to consist of various famous actors playing the most sinister folk imaginable. Alec Guinness's creepy old fellow is the most sinister of the bunch, of course, but it's Herbert Lom who really shines as the incredibly dark and murderous Louis. Watch out for a youthful Peter Sellers and cameos from a couple of future comedy greats, Kenneth Connor and Frankie Howerd, playing a cab driver and barrow boy respectively.THE LADYKILLERS isn't really laugh out loud funny, but there are plenty of set-pieces guaranteed to raise a chuckle; the hunt for the escaping parrot is a personal favourite scene of mine, and of course the last half an hour marks the movie at its murderous best. The best thing about it? Katie Johnson's delightfully barmy old lady who acts as both lynchpin and catalyst of the whole thing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quiet riot, every morbid step of the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ladykillers (1955) is among the last of the Ealing comedies, but it sparkles with the same quality of writing and acting as the earlier ones. As for ingenuity of plot construction, it rivals The Lavender Hill Mob and runs well ahead of Kind Hearts and Coronets.A "professor" with an unctuously courtly manner and an insane gleam in his eyes (Alec Guinness) takes a room in the home of a thoroughly innocent little old lady (Katie Johnson). Soon, several other men arrive with musical instruments to join the professor in the cultivated pastime of playing classical music (the same Boccherini quintet, over and over) in his room. Unknown to the landlady, the soothing music that emanates from behind the door is coming from a record while the five men, an assortment of criminal types, lay plans for a heist. What becomes of the plans, the gang, the lady, and the money must be seen to be believed -- well, not believed, but gladly swallowed to the last drop.All departments are in good hands, but Herbert Lom very nearly steals the show as a self-consciously "professional" crook whose dread of being given away by amateurs clashes oddly with his own display of ultra-sinister mannerisms and his stunning Gangster Chic wardrobe.If you have an ear for dialogue and an eye for comic timing, those parts of your anatomy will not be wasted on The Ladykillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic to enjoy again - and again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back from a photo-trek cross freezing, muddy countryside and everything aches - a stack of world and art DVDs to watch, but what do I reach out for?Well, fairly obviously, this Ealing comedy, that has a take on American gangster flicks of the 40's - you can see, perhaps, shadows of Bogart and Edward G Robinson in there - but typically British, typically London and East End. Being a later Ealing, it's in Technicolor - the vast majority of Ealings from this classic period were in black &amp; white and this one has high production values, some of older, lesser known weren't so good and/or have poorer DVD transfers.The comedy is quite broad and obvious at times but which disguises a clever story but it is the characters and London scenes that steal it every time. The London before my time but must still be recognisable to many, all bustle and recovering from War.The casting is sublime, from the wonderfully twee but rather plucky 80 year old Katie Johnson as Mrs Wilberforce (just 'Old Lady' in some credits) but also with a list that includes Herbert Lom, Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, Danny Green and of course, the gang's smooth-talking leader, Alec Guinness, in a role I don't think he's ever played the like of which before, or since!Anyway, this mob (with names as Mr Robinson, Mr Harvey, Mr Robinson, reminds one of Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs) want an innocent and discrete little pad from which to execute a large bank robbery from and the dappy old dear seems a too perfect landlady to be true. As pretend- musicians she says she doesn't even mind if they practice their instruments!However, soon, as she innocently meddles in their affairs and we have lumbering crooks climbing out over the roof to try and catch her escaped parrot, they do not realise the trouble she will cause them. As you can imagine, there are lots of opportunities for both witty and visual humour. This is mixed with genuine 'Sweeney' style realism street scenes as the heist takes place. The final scenes include an atmospheric Hitchcockian style suspense scene, with the shunt and puff of steam trains below - and a really great twist...A young Frankie Howerd has a quick, but amusing run-in with Mrs Wilberforce as a rather old barrow boy but perhaps what made it special for many my father's age was to feature Jack Warner (the incredibly popular and fondly remembered Dixon of Dock Green star, who was pretty much the face of the British 'Bobby' at this time) as the superintendent-in-charge of the case.Really great films do get remade and Hollywood came knocking a whole half century later, with the Coen bros. casting Tom Hanks into the Alec Guinness role and a Deep South black woman as Mrs Wilberforce. In my opinion - and in my review of it - I feel that this is an adaptation by Americans and for them, not us and should be seen a different film - the humour does not translate, neither, I doubt did this original appeal wholly to the Americans, either.So, one of the top five Ealings and one of the best British films. I watched it as part of my 'Ealing Comedy DVD Collection', that also includes The Man in the White Suit, The Lavendar Hill Mob and Kind Hearts &amp; Coronets - an essential foursome if there ever was one and an excellent way of getting four of the best Brit flicks, ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five diverse oddball criminal types planning a bank robbery rent rooms on a cul-de-sac from an octogenarian widow (Katie Johnson) under the pretext that they are classical musicians.Ealing Studios has now fallen by the wayside, unfortunately, and is now known only by film critics and historians. But once upon a time, not so long ago, they were a great place making great films. This is one of them.How can you go wrong with Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness and other comic greats? Guinness does his best to play a shifty character, though he does not go nearly to the level he did in "Kind Hearts and Coronets" (a superior Ealing film). It is a shame that today he is probably best known as Obi-Wan Kenobi rather than a genius character actor.While I would not call this must-see, it is still a good film and worth a view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A British 1950s Early-Colour Mock-Gangster Flick Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are essentially two types of comedies: one where the characters behave realistically, but the action and events produce a comic effect, because the human life as such can be perceived as a comical affair; it's a matter of perspective on the part of the comedy's creator; a good example of this type of comedy could be the Russian duo of writers, Ilf &amp; Petrov. The other type of comedy is where the action is wholly unrealistic, and the behaviour of characters is clearly intended to produce laughs from the audience, so that realism cannot really be associated with this type of action and events. _The Ladykillers_ in its original 1955 version is the second type of comedy; but it gets away with it and still manages to be enjoyable, mainly thanks to the star power of the actors' ensemble. Funnily enough, the most realistic aspect of _The Ladykillers_ is the marvellous performance by Katie Johnson as Mrs. Wilberforce a.k.a. Mrs. Lopsided. You can see that this is a master actress at work; the emotions displayed in her eyes and face whenever she glances at the picture of her late husband, hanging askew on the wall -- you can see that those emotions and attachments are genuine; this is simply an upright, honest old lady. Now, the five gangsters are not believable in any way; but they are fun to watch, since they are portrayed by the likes of Alec Guiness, Herbert Lom and Peter Sellers. Sellers is so young in this film (30) he will be almost unrecognizable to those viewers who are only familiar with him from the Pink Panther series; Herbert Lom, though, looks very much like himself; it's a joy for any Pink Panther fan to observe the two actors square off in this early British comedy. The quality of picture and colour photography is lovely for such an old film; beautiful glimpses of mid-1950s London and its streets scenery. I'll be watching the Coen Brothers' version of _The Ladykillers_ next, curious to see if the two brothers, otherwise famous for their brutal realism, attempted to inject some realism in their own rendition of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic Ealing Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that was always on TV on a rainy Sunday afternoon when I was a kid. The trouble is, as a kid, I wasn't all that interested in Ealing Comedies. Boy was I wrong! This is the first time I can honestly say I sat down and watched this one from beginning to end and it's excellent! A very gentle comedy with a bit of a dark edge to it. Very much of its day, but still very watchable nonetheless. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary.Sweet little old lady, Mrs Wilberforce, has some rooms to let in her little house in London, near to King's Cross railway station. They are taken on by a gentleman known as Professor Marcus. He, and a group of friends, form an amateur string quintet and, with Mrs Wilberforce's permission, practice in his rooms. The members of this little gathering are; Claude (a.k.a. 'Major Courtney'), Louis (a.k.a. 'Mr. Harvey') , Harry (a.k.a. 'Mr. Robinson'), One-Round (a.k.a. 'Mr. Lawson') and of course the Professor himself. Little does Mrs Wilberforce know that it's a front for a gang of thieves who are planning a robbery. What she also doesn't know is that she is about to be, unwittingly, an accomplice to their dastardly plot. Furthermore, her life may be in danger! I could tell you more but the Spoiler Police are already after me for the 'X-Files' caper.I really enjoyed this film, as I've already said, a gentle comedy that gets a shade darker towards the end. I think I enjoyed the performances as much as anything else; all of the cast were excellent. Alec Guinness was almost unrecognisable, and also brilliant, as Professor Marcus. Cecil Parker was great as Claude, as was Herbert Lom as Louis. Peter Sellers didn't have an awful lot to do, but was very good as Harry and Danny Green did a decent job of playing One-Round. I must give the highest praise to Katie Johnson as Mrs Wilberforce, I thought she nearly stole the show! Honourable mentions also go to; Jack Warner as The Superintendent, Frankie Howerd as The Barrow Boy and Kenneth Connor as The Cab Driver (uncredited).I was pleasantly surprised to find the film was made in colour. Very few British made films were, at the time, and so it must have had some serious backing to warrant such treatment. All the characters appear to be larger than life, apart from the old lady and this, I think, is what makes it work so well. I have heard horror stories about the Coen Brothers' remake and I'm kind of loathed to see that version, but I know our paths will cross (eventually). But enough of that one, this was, for me, one of the very best of the Ealing Comedies and I deem it highly recommended.My Score: 8.1/10.IMDb Score: 7.9/10 (based on 12,185 votes at the time of going to press).</fullReview>

Mr. Guinness claims he'll use the place to practice orchestral string music with his combo - Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, Peter Sellers and Danny Green. However, the men put on a phonograph record, then plan a heist. Interrupting with offers of tea and sympathy, Ms. Johnson seems oblivious the quintet's sinister motives. After a mishap with an absent cello, the cash is out of the bag. Now, the lodgers must decide how to kill the sweet old landlady..."The Ladykillers" is a sharply written, witty and whimsical comedy. Award-winning writer William Rose and director Alexander Mackendrick play death as highly absurd, moderately grotesque, and not at all gruesome. It turns out, under these circumstances, to be an inspired combination. Apparently, from the evidence herein, Mr. Sellers may have learned more than a little about comedy from Guinness. They key to it all is Johnson's spot on classic old English lady performance.******** The Ladykillers (12/8/55) Alexander Mackendrick ~ Katie Johnson, Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Herbert Lom</fullReview>

He tells her he's a musician as are his pals (including Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom) and they need a quiet place to rehearse their classical music. They are, however, a gang of robbers planning their next heist and they intend to use the old lady to pull off the job.This drle 1955 black comedy is from the Ealing Studio. The heist is carried out despite the old lady's constant, well-intentioned, and funny interruptions, she gradually realizes her part in it, and justice prevails with lots of giggles. Guiness, sporting a large overbite and flyaway hair, is charmingly devious as the gang leader, but it is the inimitable Katie Johnson who steals the show. She's so likable and convincing, completely inhabiting the role of the befuddled, sweet landlady who is blithely unaware she is surrounded by criminals.Highly recommended for those who enjoy classic British comedy.</fullReview>

But when things start to go pear-shaped as the yanks say the cinematography really starts to kick in. The movie goes from camp little old ladies besieging the villains to a astounding and remarkably effective scene with the body in the wheelbarrow taken across the bridge with steam and smoke from the trains beneath shrouding it.And as each villain is cast into the inferno the tension builds and builds.

		<fullReview>The innocent little old lady ("I'm so sorry to be a bother, gentlemen") played by KATIE JOHNSON (who died after doing one more film), is the real factor that gives the story a heart. After all, it's the brisk tale of a gang of criminals with a clever heist plan that goes awry thanks to the meddling of Miss Johnson. Without her highly amusing central role as the woman who unwittingly gives the gang shelter, it would be no more than a broad comedy.That's not to say that ALEC GUINNESS, HERBERT LOM, PETER SELLERS and CECIL PARKER aren't superb as the gang members, but Johnson is the story's most necessary ingredient. Her dotty ways are endearing long before the plotters show up at her residence, pretending to be musicians.The misadventures that occur the moment they show up at her doorstep keep the story flowing along at a rapid pace--beginning with the escape of one of her parrots that leads to some inventive gags. But that's only the beginning. All the other mishaps lead to a rather surprising ending.Definitely a comedy to check out if you want a real good time! Expert script, costumes, performances and some catchy background music, all done with style and wit in the best British manner.</fullReview>

As a British heist caper from the 1950s, THE LADYKILLERS illustrates about the best this era had to offer from this genre. Though the doomed quintet equals only half the toll taken in Agatha Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, this project at least never was saddled with a really racist original title, as was the case with the Christie countdown (also known by the slightly less cringe-worthy title TEN LITTLE INDIANS).</fullReview>

Other IMDb comments say virtually everything I'd want to share about my impressions (except the negative ones...some viewers seem impossible to please!), so I'll just note that, when this was made and the use of color film stock wasn't de rigueur, as it almost inevitably is today, it seemed a revelation to see how creatively color was used. The accepted wisdom among cineastes back then and, perhaps, even now is that color cinematography "slows down" a comedy but I really don't think you can say that about this one. And compared to the often blandly overlit color films Hollywood was cranking out in that era, the British "Colour by Technicolor" was a rich and tasty treat! Katie Johnson was in her late seventies when this one was made, had started her career in the early Thirties, and appeared in only about two more roles.

After robbing a ?60,000 wage delivery they drop the case containing the money amongst the incoming parcels at King's Cross where Mrs Wilberforce picks it up believing it to be perfectly innocent luggage for the professor. Once they have the trunk they hide the money in their instrument cases and prepare to leave; unfortunately for them one of the cases falls open and Mrs Wilberforce sees their ill-gotten gains; it isn't long before she is threatening to go to the police; clearly she has to be killed but which of them should do it? This film is a classic for a reason; it manages to be both dark and gentle at the same time; it also has quite a few laugh out loud moments. Katie Johnson is brilliant as Mrs Wilberforce; a sweet innocent old lady who somehow wreaks havoc around her; the scene where she stops to remonstrate with Frankie Howard is hilarious; she is trying to do the right thing but manages to wreck the livelihoods of three men! The five criminals are great too; led by Alec Guinness, an actor who seems to become a different person in every part he played and also featuring Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom; two actors who are best known for appearing together in the 'Pink Panther' films. The scenes where they plot to kill Mrs Wilberforce but gradually end up killing each other are great in a slightly twisted way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Katie Johnson steals the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would think it almost impossible to steal a movie from Alec Guinness, but, as good as he is, Katie Johnson does steal this movie.One of the best comedies ever made by one of the best British studios, Ealing.The funniest part for me is watching Ms. Johnson wander quietly around amid the chaos (most of which she creates in her wake).Beautifully shot, great locations, great cast, great script...just great.The humor comes out subtly as the film is carefully constructed in the early goings, but, then watch the fun begin.A 10 out of 10 and a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor old Mrs Lopsided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flawless black comedy with a masterful cast of comic-book villains who descend upon the happy ignorance of a five-foot nothing elderly lady by the name of Mrs Wilburforce (Johnston). The scheming Professor Marcus (Guinness) rents a room in her quaint London house (on a distinct lean as a result of air raids), and under the pretense of band practice, invites his gang of violent thieves to plan and execute a daring armoured car robbery. Of course the extremely benevolent old widow (and talking parrot) is blissfully unaware of the ruse until they spill a cello-load of cash on her doorstep in the bungled getaway. It's then a case of drawing straws to determine who'll silence her before their crime is exposed to authorities. But who could really kill a sweet, old lady?Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, Danny Green and Peter Sellers are all brilliant as the rag-tag quartet, led by Guinness the slightly mad genius who architects an apparently perfect crime, except for, as he later laments "nothing could have planned for Mrs Wilburforce". Lom is especially good as the mysterious Mr Harvey, mostly reticent until it's time to do the deed (although this proves easier said than done). Jack Warner and Frankie Howerd also feature in incidental supporting roles. Kudos to Katie Johnston as the irritatingly benign spanner in the works, and on whom every subsequent dotty old duck could be modelled. A tremendous legacy for a long but obscure film career.Vibrant colour tones, commanding score and superb sets complement the colourful characters culminating in an unexpected climax and extremely satisfying conclusion; director Mackendrick has taken a modest concept and delivered a film of magnitude that no remake can ever do justice. An absolute delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Ealing Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Passport to Pimlico, The Ladykillers is the Ealing Studio's other undisputed jewel in it's already impressive crown, and this time the comedy cannot be more darker or blacker.Elderly widow and local busy-body Mrs Wilburforce rents rooms between of course, her frequent visits to the police station to report this and that and complain about that and the other.Her most recent tenant is mild-mannered Professor Marcus played by Alec Guinness practically unrecognisable behind a hideous set of teeth and an over long scarf that predated Tom Baker's Doctor Who by almost twenty years. Professor Marcus befriends Mrs Wilburforce and rents her room as he is looking for a quiet place to rehearse his up and coming string quintet.Other members of this seemingly harmless and cultured group include a handle-barred mustachioed Major played by Cecil Parker, A teddy-boy cockney played by the great Peter Sellers, a sinister looking trench coat played by Herbert Lom, and a mono-symbolic punch-drunk bruiser played by Danny Green.However despite the musical instruments they carry it soon becomes clear that they actually have their minds on an altogether different kind of 'fiddle' They are actually all seasoned criminals planning a major cash heist from the local railway station, using Mrs Wilburforce and her 'lobsided' house not only as a base of operations, but plan to involve her unknowingly in the transportation of the cash.All goes well, and the robbery goes ahead as planned, but when Mrs Wilburforce discovers their true identities, their sordid crime and the stolen money, it is clear to these desperate men, that she clearly knows too much, and will not have any second thoughts about sharing her information with the local Police inspector first thing in the morning.It is decided by the now obviously insane Professor Marcus that one of them must 'do the old woman in' but each of them are either too cowardly or too fond of her to do the dreadful deed. One by one they are chosen and one by one, they chicken out and try and double cross the others, which leads to a series of unfortunate accidents occurring throughout the night.Alec Gunniess, Peter Sellers, Herbert Lom, Cecil Parker and Danny Green are all perfectly cast and deliver spot on comedy performances but it is clear from the outset that the adorable Katie Johnson practically steals the film as Mrs Wilburforce making a stand against Guiness and his gang of thugs after being taken advantage of in the worst possible way.With delightful cameos from Carry-oners Kenneth Connor and Frankie Howerd plus Jack Warner and Philip Stainton in their requisite roles as the local police inspector and his portly Sergeant, this is a classic British film, which outstrips it's contemporaries (and remakes) by a country mile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ealing's Finest Hour (and a bit)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You really do begin to wonder how the British movie industry went down the plug-hole when it could produce such masterful work as this. I guess there just weren't enough of the rest to compare. There are some extremely well-observed opinions expressed on this site, detailing the wonderful intricacies of this movie. So I will only mention the following...The core cast were, of course, quite sublime. Once again we have an old woman playing a leading role, and demonstrating a scene-stealing skill and subtlety that most pretty young things of today couldn't begin to equal. Perhaps in 50 years, the likes of Sandra Bullock will be a real class act. Otherwise this obsession with youth has been a dog-day for women in cinema and viewers alike. But there was also plenty of other talent waiting in the wings, so to speak. We glimpse Arthur Mullard, Sam Kydd, Kenneth Connor, Jack Warner, and Frankie Howerd. Warner was cast - almost inevitably - as a copper, a role he was born to play. Frankie Howerd, the fruit-wagon boy who was brolly-beaten by Mrs Lopsided, went on to become one of British television's top comedians. For those with an interest in movie locations; the body-dumping spot is still there today, up in Camden Town, London. A few years ago I visited the site to take a snap and almost joined the gang over the parapet, being chased by a large pig - let loose, one suspects, for the express purpose of discouraging the likes of me. Visit it at your peril. Mrs Lopsided's quaint Victorian cottage was, of course, never there. That was just a bit of artful Ealing deception.With the extensive re-development taking place in this area, particularly&nbsp;in the context of high-speed 'Eurostar' rail-links, one suspects that yet another iconic movie location will be lost forever. See it while you can (but just watch yourselves). And watch the movie, too. This one really is as good as they say. &nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original and best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two films taking the same name spanning nearly five decades apart, this included the original version that remains the best while the remake from the other side of the Atlantic was really a failure and it is difficult to understand why the respectable Tom Hanks the Coen Bros should have made this. Alec Guinness does it perfect as Professor Marcus, the slimy leader of the gang of hapless crooks whom were planning a daring robbery from a "bank van" and the gang lodged in old Mrs Wilbourforce's rather tumbled down house near Kings Cross (London) pretending to be musicians and actually played behind closed doors from a record player while engaged with their raid plans. The marvellous Herbert Lom (whom in recent times criticised the remake) is excellent for a starring role as that somewhat slightly nervous shaved-haired gangster-like Mr Harvey while Danny Green did a rare leading big screen role as Mr "One-round" Lawson for he spent much of his time doing smaller cameo roles while Cecil Parker did the flustered major. In fact, the film also gave Peter Sellers his big break onto the silver screen. The length of the film is mildly funny and even so, the perfect robbery for 1955 started to go all wrong when they found out that old Mrs Wilbourforce wasn't as harmless as she seems to be and when she found out that her lodgers weren't musicians and had committed a robbery, they planned to kill her but nearly none proved capable in murder and the plan went through bumps and turns, with the last two meeting a somewhat unusual and hilarious end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Professor Marcus may style himself a criminal mastermind, but his plan to steal 60,000 British pounds comes a cropper when he decides to incorporate gentle, unassuming old Mrs. Wilberforce and her decrepit house into his plans."Such charming windows," Marcus purrs in a voice dimly recognizable as that of Alec Guinness. "I always think windows are the eyes of a house, and didn't someone say that the eyes are the windows of the soul?" Marcus's eyes, by the way, are dark-rimmed and piercing, not a good sign but an accurate one."I don't know," says the baffled, slightly softheaded old biddy, who has just been at the police station to discuss a friend's flying saucer report. "It's such a charming thought, I hope someone expressed it."He is so menacing, and she so gentle, it is hard not to watch them together and wince. Wince you should, too, but not for her as things go in one of the best caper flicks ever.The last of the classic Ealing comedies is not only perhaps the best but presents a darkly clever crossroads between British film humor future and past. Guinness's ghoulish turn as the criminal mastermind; the presence as members of his gang of two actors who would in the 1960s and 1970s clash so memorably in the anarchic Pink Panther movies; and the whole idea of murder as light comedy all point to a time well after the film's release in 1955. But then there's Katie Johnson as the aged widow who dates back to the Victorian age, whose tea cozies, parrots, and chintz wallpaper display a spirit a couple of World Wars past its prime yet unbowed in the face of her boarders' evil.Johnson's performance along with the script by William Rose are the movie's best elements, both balancing acts of measureless wit and nuance, and the direction by Alexander Mackendrick gets the most from a London still recovering from the Blitz and postwar privation. However bleak and gray the city looks, a humanity and color pokes through from the ad hoardings and the painting of Churchill a sidewalk vendor tries to sell. "The Ladykillers" would be a feel-good film if there wasn't a laugh in it.But there are laughs in it, big ones, most at the expense of Marcus and his dangerous but inept crew. It's an impressive display of Rose's skill how every character both serves the comedy and advances the plot, rather than just one or the other. Even Herbert Lom as the nasty Louis draws laughs, curling his lips in disgust while forced to hold a tea cup and crumpet to appease Mrs. Wilberforce.Soon the gang decides to kill her, selecting Major Courtney to do the deed. Then the film gets even funnier. "Not in front of the parrots," Courtney whines. A weaker film might flip the tables by making Mrs. Wilberforce sly and knowing, but this one keeps her completely in the dark yet as invulnerable as Jacques Clouseau would be in later decades.Speaking of Clouseau, Peter Sellers' performance as one of Marcus's gang was his first role in a major film. He's quite funny, yelling at a parrot who bites him or trying to steal all the "lolly" for himself, yet its not a career performance from him, just a good one in a great film that would work as well with almost any other actor.Well, not Frankie Howerd, who plays a barrow man here and whines a lot in the one sequence that feels padded and unnecessary. Why does Jack Warner, not the mogul but an actor who plays the superintendent and says maybe 15 lines in three scenes, have higher billing than Katie Johnson?But what an ending. And what a film! Johnson's eyes are the windows to a beautiful soul, and it makes one happy to think the sun will never set on it. And it won't, neither, not as long as people watch great comedies like "The Ladykillers."</fullReview>

Thinking her a harmless little old lady, they enlist her unknowing help in the crime, not realizing she's a total Jonas.A very clever script and a top-notch cast contribute to making this an excellent film. Alec Guiness, Katie Johnson, Peter Sellars, and Herbert Lom, Cecil Parker, and Danny Green are all excellent. There are some very funny slapstick scenes, including one in which the group attempts to rescue one of Mrs. Wilberforce's parrots from the outdoors ("Major Wilberforce went down with the ship...but he made sure these creatures were safe on the last boat.") The remake of this seems to have come and gone - I don't understand the reason for most remakes, and most especially not this one.</fullReview>

What is most striking is the utterly priceless performance of the 77-year-old Johnson who, in her own act of grand larceny, effortlessly steals the picture away from past masters Guinness and Sellers. After being plucked from obscurity by Mackendrick she was deservedly named Best Actress by the British Academy?but where had she been hiding? Her otherwise unremarkable career had been a hodge-podge of bits and pieces and uncredited parts. In The Rainbow Jacket, for example, an almost forgotten horse-racing picture filmed only the year before, she plays a nameless character and is billed 24th!</fullReview>

One marvellous scene early on in the film, is whenMrs Wilberforce asks for the gang's help, to give the parrot hismedicine. Even after seeing the film about 20 times I still find itdifficult to stop laughing during this passage. The rest of the cast,Peter Sellers,Danny Green, Jack Warner, and Herbert Lom arewonderful, but special praise must go to Katie Johnson, who runsAlec Guinness close as the star of the film. It is interesting to notethat after 45 years the film is still as good as ever. Also that there isno swear words, sex or violence in the film, perhaps modernfilmmakers should take note.</fullReview>

Her propriety and kindness complicate matters beyond the point of sanity. Some really wonderful photography and directing, particularly as the climax in the railyard nears. When I checked this out, it was on video, and I have not seen a DVD anywhere. Although the photography was very well done, the colors were spotty and it looked like it may have been made from an old print.

		<shortDescription>Audiences are forced to turn to classics like 'The Ladykillers' as contemporary comedy films are shockingly bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As contemporary comedy is becoming more and more extraneous, it is natural for fans to turn to classics of comedy. This is one plausible reason which can explain the growing interest for comedy classics and 'The LadyKillers' in general. Starring Sir Alec Guinness and directed by Alexander Mackendrick, 'The Lady killers can be easily classified more as a moral fable than as a black comedy. It is quick to establish the moral message that criminals do not achieve anything as they end up destroying each other. The pace of the film is slow at times but that doesn't reveal itself as a constraint as an old lady uses all her wit in order to outwit a gang of bumbling criminals. Katie Johnson is remarkable as Mrs. Wilberforce who doesn't cringe with fear upon discovering that a gang of criminals have fooled her in being accomplice in a robbery. She decides to remain exceedingly cool that the gang starts to fall apart. If wine lovers know that a good wine tastes better with the passage of time then all cinema audiences should also know that British comedy film 'The Ladykillers' is also becoming better year after year. This has a lot to do with the general decline viewers are witnessing in falling standards of comedy films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladykillers and old lace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My ability to appreciate the classic Ealing comedies has grown as I've gotten more literate in English culture and history. When I was a teenager I really found this film repulsive, particularly Marcus and his disgusting Conrad Veidt in "The Man Who Laughs" mouth. Now I can see that the overall concept of "The Ladykillers" is a riff on "Arsenic and Old Lace," with Marcus as the Boris Karloff character of the piece, and Herbert Lom as Peter Lorre (he's even got Peter's switchblade from "M.") Of course it doesn't have the slam-bang Big Band era boisterousness of "Arsenic," and why should it. It's not taking place in wartime Brooklyn but in a London that's still suffering the after effects of the Blitz and where postwar shortages mean that there are still horse-drawn carts in the streets and older ladies are forced to pull fifty year-old outfits out of their steamer trunks in order to stay dressed decently.I watched this again after reading Graham Linehan's excellent 2011 stage adaptation, which dials up the humor from Ealing postwar English folk humor to "Arsenic" level farce. I think it shows the sturdiness of "Ladykillers"' underlying structure that it can stand up to this kind of update. I think the fact that Linehan succeeded in his update where the Coen brothers failed in theirs proves two things: that this is a quintessentially English story that just doesn't transplant to a rougher climate, and that even artists who make classics can stumble when they try to remake a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"She'll always be with us, wherever we go.." There's not much more I can say about this deservedly acclaimed classic black comedy. I can't believe how well it holds up today, probably due it's style, wit and imagination. First and foremost the visual style is excellent, making London look warm and local, as if it's all Mrs. Wilberforce's back garden and the gang are just kids playing in it. Her house, standing out from all the rest at the end of a cul=de-sac, with it's crooked pictures on the wall (because of the bombing), it's pretty decor, antiques and creaky floorboards, is like a comfortable trap, and that's what it becomes. The men pull off the robbery with ease, tricking Mrs. Wilberforce into bringing the cash back to her house. The perfect crime, except for one blunder that reveals to Mrs. Wilberforce that they're not an amateur quintet. The rest of the film is one big argument over whether they should kill her or not and who should do it, and one- by-one they kill each other. A hilarious black comedy with excellent performances, particularly from Alec Guinness as the wonderfully charming and creepy Professor Marcus. Herbert Lom is good as the cold Louis, and Peter Sellers is funny as the nervous Harry. He also does the voice of General Gordon the parrot. Katie Johnson is excellent as the perfect-mannered, proper, sweet old lady. The various situations they find themselves in are hilarious, and the absurd finale is hilarious and surreal. The photography is excellent; Mrs. Wilberforce's house looks like something from a dream or fairytale, and London looks cold but colourful. This is an absolutely brilliant film, I'm glad I finally saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ladykillers" is great fun, a witty and clever black comedy, in which everything that can go wrong does go wrong for our main characters. They're brought together by criminal mastermind "Professor" Marcus (Alec Guinness), who's planned a heist. He rents some rooms from kindly, if slightly dotty, old Mrs. Wilburforce (Katie Johnson), making them the base of operations while he and his crew masquerade as classical musicians. She's onto the scheme sooner than you'd think, as their plan unravels, and they have to spend the rest of their time thinking their way out of their situation, while contemplating murder of the old lady, who can easily finger them. A top notch ensemble brings these entertaining characters to life, with Guinness scoring as the fairly creepy, persuasive, and slick Marcus. This is a guy who never loses his cool. The star's expressions and mannerisms are downright hilarious. Peter Sellers is the young punk of the group, Cecil Parker the dignified older gentleman, Herbert Lom the surly, dangerous one, and Danny Green the muscle of the group who's also got the biggest heart of any of them. As written by William Rose, and directed by Alexander Mackendrick, "The Ladykillers" does a fine job of staying on track and maintaining that darkly comic tone from start to finish. Johnson is delightful at providing a counterpoint to the personalities of her tenants, while excellent guest appearances are made by the likes of Frankie Howerd, Jack Warner, and Philip Stainton. There are some wonderful farcical moments to enjoy, such as the quintet of criminals having to go out of their way to rescue one of Mrs. Wilburforce's parrots, the little matter of what to do once the dead bodies start piling up, and our merry crew having to tolerate and even entertain a gathering of the old lady's friends. The music by Tristram Cary is excellent, and cinematographer Otto Heller gets some really great shots. Much of the dialogue and many of the situations are sure to put a smile on the faces of the viewers, who will enjoy this from the beginning to the resolution, which is just brilliant and, really, the perfect ending to the crazy goings-on. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Katie Johnson is both hilarious and lovely as an unsuspecting old lady caught in the path of crime. Nicely made, though a bit dry at times, but there is always one bit of humor waiting in the wings.

I pulled up IMDb, and was shocked to see so much vitriol, including Americans insulting the British and Brits insulting Yanks. Has the world truly gone mad? This is a movie, not a world war. I had a bad case of the flu when I watched this, and wanted to watch something that was not too loud and garish, but amusing. This fit the bill nicely. Not all humor has to be in your face or obnoxious. Are such crass movies warping people's tastes?I had seen this before, so I knew the basic plot, though did not remember all the details. It still amazed me how the story went from a highly improbably Point A to Point B to Point C (which I cannot describe more specifically without spoiling the movie).Some bemoan Alec Guinness in such an unseemly role. But that's the beauty of watching a great actor, and Sir Alec is truly among the greatest chameleons on film. You would never think this was the same person playing Smiley in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Of course, Guinness was doing a lot of off the wall comedy in the 1950s; try watching "The Horses Mouth."And then there's Peter Sellers, the other great chameleon whom most modern viewers would never recognize here. His transformation with Lolita and The Pink Panther was astonishing. Perhaps he was using the Alec Guinness Method Acting.Guinness may have picked up an acting tip or two from Katie Johnson. Her performance is a triumph of understatement. She says more without words or actions, just with a look. Guinness would later become a master of silence as acting, especially as Smiley.And as to Mr. John M. Upton's comments on the Coen brothers remake, I stopped watching their movies a long time ago because they have no respect for the intelligence of their audience. I certainly did not bother with the remake, which sounds awful.This does not mean Hollywood cannot make, or remake, pretty good facsimiles of British films. Some of the finest "British" films were made in Hollywood, including Rebecca, Mrs. Miniver, and Random Harvest, to name just a few. Why? Because Hollywood at the time had bigger budgets and higher production standards, not to mention lots of international talent.Look, if you don't like American films, don't watch them. Or at least don't watch the bad ones, and then make broad generalizations about America and American cinema. Promise yourself that from now on you will only watch classy films made in your own country. That will leave you plenty of time to read some good books. If you are interested in the history of cinema, you must see The Lady Killers for its pairing of Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers, and because it is a delightful, funny movie.If you don't see the humor in this movie, the problem is within you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Balances black comedy with crime and the threat of cold blooded murder near flawlessly, while substantial attention to the post War generation looms overhead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Britain's original The Ladykillers treads a really fine tightrope; a line so thin and so fine that a tilt either way might've turned it into quite the opposite of what it most certainly is. In an odd attempt to combine pulpy, gangster material which predominantly revolves around a heist and the resulting chaos because of that heist with a tone of light comedy at its heart, as told from a perspective of the brutally innocent; The Ladykillers walks that tough, stick thin tightrope with aplomb. Set in pretty immediate post rationing Britain, a period born out of The Second World War, the film is a tale of struggling that around half a dozen people go through; while the manner in which it touches on substance of a moral nature is quite extraordinary.The film revolves around five men whom take up a letting of a room at the small house owned by Mrs. Wilberforce (Johnson) in London. This is instigated by a certain Professor Marcus (Guinness), a character given a basic brooding build up born out of the use of expressionism. While posing as musicians of soft, classical music; their true intentions are far darker and use the rented room plus a smaller, adjoining room to plan a raid on an armoured van that makes its rounds to and from the local train station. The film explores the clashing between the young and the old, indeed all of the early exchanges go so far as to establish all we need to know about Mrs. Wilberforce, such as her tendency to visit the police station a little more than she might need to; but a thorough enough attitude to things when its revealed she takes the time to reveal false alarms to the officers in order to clear everything up. She talks of how things were when she was younger, in a tone that is nostalgic and designed to evoke a sort of saddened atmosphere implying things used to be better.This talking of days of old in itself causes the weather to cloud over and spawns rain outside in the street; introducing a somewhat ominous sense about the said subject matter and immediate proceedings. On her way home, it is only then that Marcus' presence makes itself known as, unbeknown to us at the time, he internally plots renting her room and the illegal proceedings; thus with his post-Second World War crew of mostly youngsters and spivs as charcoal drawings of Winston Churchill threaten to 'run' because of the falling shower. Prior to this and still at the police station, Mrs. Wilberforce goes over a story from a few days ago linked to a flying saucer sighting and possible interaction with extraterrestrials which she now states was a false alarm. This mentioning of material of a science-fictitious nature mixed with modernity spawns the aforementioned comment on the times of old and suggests a vulnerability to the 'new' world she and everyone else now inhabits; a more modern world which will only develop further now that The Second World War is over and modernity moves into a new era.Fitting then, that her struggles in the film and the majority of the threat posed towards her are from, predominantly, young individuals trying to make ends meet. This, in what is a life to this next generation moulded out of not having very much growing up due to rationing as well as seeing friends and family at a young age struggle through a World War, that they are entering their adult life with nothing born out of a national rationing situation and feel the need to turn to crime because of this. It is no coincidence that the eldest of the thieves, a certain Major Courtney (Parker), seems to be the most humble of the bunch and the more humane; whereas Marcus' role as the perpetrator and because of the horror-inspired introduction through music and shadow, renders him of an uncanny nature and therefore immune to the study of new generations doing what they do.In posing as elitists, specifically producers of classical music, the gang of thieves render their room that they've hired a den of crime and terror, as low lighting dominates the main room and a blood red tint encompasses the nature of the lighting in the other. Downstairs, Mrs. Wilberforce inhabits a relatively plush room; a space full of nice furniture and easy-on-the-eye mise-en-scene as her pet birds let off somewhat deafening squawks which disturb the peace at intermittent times, a sort of flash of noise and chaos amidst the calm which foretells what's to come when chaos will reign more predominantly than during the initial stages. A picture of her husband, a casualty of The War and therefore not granted entry into this post-war existence, is placed high on the wall and looms over everyone as a mark of what once was as opposed to what is now. If the film doesn't suffice for some as far as heist films go in terms of planning and execution of the event, then it's because it is more interested in the rough relations between young and old; just and unjust as well as prewar attitudes and postwar attitudes.According to reviews of recent Nimrd Antal film Armored, the crash-bash executing of the heist is all there and done accordingly, but post-heist the film hits a wall when they all arrive back at a designated area. Since 1955's The Ladykillers is actually about something more than just how you can shoot an armoured van heist with a bunch of characters, the real meat of the film kicks in when they arrive back at this cinematic space of Wilberforce's house and attitudes; observations and the designated substance plays out. Whilst I haven't seen Antal's latest, I'm tempted to say that if there was ever a reason to use the old clich "They don't make them like this anymore!", then it might very well be here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crooks under the guise of a classical string quintet rent a room in the home of a kindly old widow while plotting a bank robbery. Guinness, seemingly made up to look like fellow British actor Alistair Sim, is marvelously goofy as the leader of the gang. The other crooks are well played by Parker, Green, Sellers, and Lom. The last two would of course go on to co-star in the "Pink Panther" films years later. Johnson is delightful as the sweet old lady who is oblivious to everything. The comedy definitely turns dark as the gang's plan goes awry. However, the laughs don't stop. Mackendrick was credited with directing only nine films, but they were mostly of high quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was The Ladykillers killed with a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ladykillers. What can I say? It is a sparkling gem of a comedy, by none other than Ealing Studios.The original Ladykillers was a brilliant film. British humour, no unnecessary violence or slapstick, and contains killer lines; basically it is an all-round excellent film. And it contains the legendary actor, Alec Guinness!There are absolutely no flaws in The Ladykillers. It is hilarious, with the five villains and Mrs Wilberforce's innocent and sweet nature, which makes it such a wonderful film. It is a very British comedy!! Why The Ladykillers was ever remade, I'll never know. There was nothing they could improve upon, because it was perfect. I have seen the remake (pardon me for discussing another film), and I was disgusted at what I was seeing. Although, I must admit, I am English, and so my tastes may be different to others'. But speaking from an English girl's point of view, I absolutely love the original.The Ladykillers is a film everyone must see. If you have seen the remake, watch the original, as it far outshines the 2004 version. If you have seen neither, have I persuaded you as to which is more worthy of watching?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy noir would seem to be a contradiction in terms, but there are in fact movies in this vein that deserve serious attention, particularly The Ladykillers (1955). Produced for Michael Balcon by the multi-talented Seth Holt, and easily ranking as the most ingratiating LOL movie of all time, this wittily-plotted, thoroughly macabre comedy is propelled by a superb cast led by the redoubtable Katie Johnson in the best (and second last) role of her entire career. Her superlative performance (she won the British Academy Award for Best Actress) is aided by a stellar support cast in which Alec Guinness, Cecil Parker and especially Danny Green, shine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terraplane comments on American views of British comedy. This movie is priceless as nearly all of Alec Guinness's movies are. Referring to the golden age of British comedy, as an American now living in Canada, I tend find British comedy falls into two classes: very good or rather insipid. Obviously, this movie falls into the former. Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers became great stars. Alec could do drama as well as comedy while Peter was a master at satire in many of his films, though this one is not satirical. It is just great comedy. Another actor, Herbert Lom, went on to act in many of the Pink Panther films by which time he had developed his technique for comedy costarring with Peter Sellers. I don't think that the American remake of The Pink Panther deserves comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This original comedy is one of the early examples of dumb behaviour comedies, kind of like Airplane! It was also the first Ealing Studios film I ever saw, before the one I knew was one, Kind Hearts and Coronets. Basically, a normal old woman, Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson), lives in London, she is one day visited by a silly looking man called Professor Marcus (an excellent Sir Alec Guinness). He asks if he and his band can rent the vacant room, and they soon all arrive. The band includes Claude (Cecil Parker), Louis (Herbert Lom), Harry (young Peter Sellers) and One-Round (Danny Green). Mrs. Wilberforce doesn't know it, but they are not a band, and they are planning to rob a bank. When she finds out that they have stolen a lot of money, she intends to tell the police. The gang now have to decide who is going to kill her so she doesn't blab. They all die one by one in the process of attempting to kill her, or getaway with the money. Peter Sellers was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 22, and Sir Alec Guinness number 12 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Sellers was number 7, and Guinness number 2 on Britain's Finest Actors, and Sellers was number 24, and Guinness number 11 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 43 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, it was number 35 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 23 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as hilarious as the cast or its reputation would make you think, but still a darkly enjoyable comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When she takes in a new lodger, Mrs Wilberforce is overjoyed to learn that Professor Marcus is a musician and that he intends to use his room to practice with his friends in an amateur musical troupe. However, unbeknownst to her, the group are in fact a criminal gang planning a raid on an armoured car loaded with cash. While his colleagues think he is taking a great risk, Professor Marcus plans to use Mrs Wilberforce to unwittingly transport the money to safety right under the noses of the police! With the job done the gang think they are home free until Mrs Wilberforce learns what they have done and threatens to turn them all in.With the remake currently taking a kicking in the popular press (I've yet to see it so I can't comment) I thought that I would spend a rather miserable Saturday afternoon in front of a nice gas fire watching the original. The plot is pretty well known but doesn't always totally engage because it relies on us accepting that these criminals have sufficient morals to not wish to kill the old lady ? maybe at the time that was accepted but it doesn't wash so easily nowadays. That said, this aspect of the plot only covers the second half of the film and there is enough else to make up for this minor weak spot. The film is never laugh out loud funny but more of a sort of whimsical caper ? consistently amusing but nobody will be rolling in the aisles. The characters make for a good film though and really it is they that ruin their job, not Mrs Wilberforce!The cast made me assume that this would be funnier than it was but they are also a big part of the film being as enjoyable and memorable as it was. Guinness is great value and a very enjoyable character, not letting the teeth gimmick trick him into a lazy performance. Of the rest of the cast, few really deliver the sort of performances that their names suggest but they do well as an ensemble. Sellers plays a fairly normal character, Lom enjoys himself in a dark role, Parker plays to form as a military type while Danny Green is a big presence on screen! Katie Johnson gives a perfect performance as Mrs Wilberforce, she is the central joke of the film in that she couldn't hurt a fly ? Johnson pitches this spot on playing her as the archetypal old English rose! Smaller roles for Kenneth Connor and Frankie Howerd help the film as well.Overall this is an enjoyable film very much in the Ealing mould by being amusing and witty without actually having many belly laughs in there. The darkly comic tale is worth seeing and the cast has a strong ensemble feel to it with none of the many comedy stars really stepping up to claim the film as their own. Worth seeing and pretty darn enjoyable but I don't totally think it deserves the reputation as a classic comedy that it has garnered over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever a film were to be perfect then The Ladykillers is it. Fantastic casting and so well written. perfect for the time it was released and a complete joy to watch. I have seen it loads of times and loved it from the start. I first saw it screened in the assembly hall of my Grammar school in my home town. Not the ideal way to see such a great movie but the quality of the film overcame the less than perfect method of delivery. I do remember that I found it a little scary the first time I saw it, but I was very young maybe 12 or thirteen. It impressed me so much that I made a point of seeing it again when it appeared at the local fleapit. it never let me down and impressed me just as much - the next time I saw it must have been on TV and once again I was not disappointed. The idea of a US remake was an horrendous idea to me and when I saw it , so it proved to be. You just cannot remake perfection and anyone who loves movies would surely know that.

		<fullReview>This wonderful comedy is one that is truly remarkable, and perhaps worthy of more praise. Its main merit is the superb Oscar-nominated screenplay, that was full of black humour and wit. I particularly loved it when Mrs Wilberforce tells the police constable to "buzz off", something you don't expect her character to say. The cinematography is also excellent, with lovely sets, and doesn't look like it was filmed at a studio. The film is also helped by a brilliant music score, that is not only atmospheric but quite haunting as well. There is clear evidence of detailed direction, and the fast pace of the film ensures that the film rarely slips from its focus. My favourite scene has to be when Danny Green's character is standing on a chair, and he falls through the seat, and can't get his legs out. What made this movie though was the acting. Alec Guiness is deliciously seedy as the professor, and while Herbert Lom, Cecil Parker and Peter Sellers have a little less to do, they are all excellent as the men who plan a robbery. However, the film belongs to the marvellous Katie Johnson, in a wonderfully dotty performance as the elderly spinster who proves to be more of a match for them. Overall, a wonderful film, that is thoroughly entertaining. 10/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Tom Hanks was Prof. Dorr, Sir Alec Guinness was Prof. Marcus. In the original "The Ladykillers," the Professor leads his gang in engineering a bank heist. Their headquarters is the boarding house of Mrs. Wilberforce, a dear old lady played by Judith Lively. Other members of the gang are Peter Sellers as Harry, a fast-talking Cockney, and Dave Green as One Round, a slow-witted but sentimental thug. The story follows the gang through their bank heist, and how they almost blow it, to what happens when Mrs. Wilberforce gets wise to them. What happens next is British madness. "The Ladykillers" is a lot tamer than movies like "Snatch," but is just as entertaining.

		<fullReview>A highlight of Ealing Studios' output features Alec Guinness in creepy-funny false teeth as a devious 'professor' who rents a room from an elderly widow in old London, pretending to be part of a classical music quintet; he and his cohorts are actually plotting a daring daylight heist in the center of town, with the dotty old lady their unsuspecting carrier pigeon. William Rose's (not-surprisingly) mild screenplay does include flavorful roles for each of the five crooks, yet it doesn't go the distance, ending with a series of comically-presented mishaps (albeit discreetly presented) which leave a sour aftertaste. The picture isn't particularly well made--and there are some silly asides to pad the running time--but with such a talented, ticklish cast of players, it can't help but be highly amusing on occasion.

Today, you would have to have a man in a white coat come around to the house asking about an escaped patient and bearing a full-color front-and-side-view photo before they got it. Audiences of the day probably understood the minute Alec popped his head through the door with that Uncle Fester make-up on that he wasn't "right in the head," and never needed more than a couple of hints to confirm what they already suspected.Anyway, I found subtlety like that an odd juxtaposition with such slapstick elements as the kettle-drum sound used repeatedly toward the end of the film (a very odd choice indeed, frankly) and the outta-my-way-knucklehead way these professional criminals tend to trip all over each other whenever they need to get something done.Still, I thought it was a fun movie.Original grade: 7 out of 10 - worth seeing, but once will probably do.Revised grade: 6 out of 10. Not bad. Worth seeing, not worth recommending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By pure coincidence I saw this within hours of Le Corniaud which was made about ten years later (1965) and shares the theme of the innocent dupe finally having the last laugh. This is certainly a respectable effort though if this really IS, as has often been claimed, the Best of the Ealing comedies, I wouldn't be standing in line to see the worst. Again it's a time thing by which I mean that I'm prepared to concede that back in 1955 this may have been a laff riot which had them rolling in the aisles but half a century has taken its toll and it's difficult for example to understand how Peter Sellars built an international career on what is at best a heavily mannered performance which is about as funny as Frank Randle on a bad night. This seems to be one of the last times Alec Guiness resorted to grotesque make up to build a character, something that has always bemused me conversant as I am with his many fine stage and film performances in which he allows his exceptional talent rather than prosthetics to speak for him. As comic 'caper' movies go it's about par for the course but whoever had the bright idea of letting Frankie Howerd do a 'cameo' should be forced to turn in his Producer's ticket. If gentle, well-intentioned whimsy is your speed then have this one on me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guinness and those teeth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady Killers (1955) Directed by Alexander Mackendrick - Starring Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Katie Johnson, and Cecil Parker - 6/10Alec Guinness has a field day in this comedy about a band of crooks who pretend to be a band of musicians. Guinness plays Professor Marcus, a polite but diabolical man with very large teeth. He has devised a plan for a heist that will not only make him rich, but allow him to get away free without the authorities ever having known he was involved. The plan has only flaw ? Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson). The Professor's plan involves an old lady participating in his robbery without any knowledge of it. To accomplish this, he takes up residence as a border in the home of the kindly and frail widow Mrs. Wilberforce. Here, he assembles his team. First to arrive is Major Courtney (Parker), a very nervous man. He is followed by Mr. Robinson (Sellers), Mr. Lawson, and Mr. Harvey. Each man brings his own traits to the crime. In order to plan the crime in the home of Mrs. Wilberforce, they pretend to be musicians and discuss their plot while playing records so that she is none the wiser.Professor Marcus has also schemed a way for Mrs. Wilberforce to help them move their loot to avoid police detection. But when the plan goes awry, and Mrs. Wilberforce ends up in the middle of it, Marcus and his cronies realize the police are the least of their worries.The strength of this film is in its characters. The henchmen are rather two-dimensional (even Sellers) and add little, but they aren't supposed to. The focus of the story is on Guinness and the old lady. More known for his dramatic performances, Guinness again shows his range for comedy (maybe best displayed in 1951's The Lavendar Hill Mob). Marcus is a completely over-the-top character that could have become a cartoon in the hands of a lesser actor. Meanwhile, it is Mrs. Wilberforce who is driving the plot. The robbery occurs fairly early in the film, it is her relationship with the criminals that drives the remainder of it. She is kind, honest, and very na?ve. These traits have a different effect on each of the men and their ability to operate as a single gang.The plot itself is mildly funny, but the film is worth watching just for Guinness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny idea which becomes no laughing matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize that some people swear by THE LADYKILLERS, and this is nothing against their opinion. This just happens to be my own personal opinion. The film starts out with great possibilities, but is ultimately disappointing. Elderly Mrs. Wilburforce (Katie Johnson) rents out one of her rooms to an "eccentric musician", but he and his group are actually a gang of crooks, using her place to plan and carry out a robbery. The gang includes: Professor Marcus (Alec Guinness), the strange criminal mastermind; Major Courtney (Cecil Parker), more of a confidence man than a robber; Louie Harvey (Herbert Lom), a somewhat menacing hoodlum; One-Round Lawson (Danny Green), a punchy ex-prizefighter; and Harry Robinson (Peter Sellers), a cocky young punk. Suffice it to say, the crooks are ultimately thwarted by the little old lady, and it would be a better film if that were the extent of it. However, the dark turn which takes place in the final third wrings all of the comedy out of it as far as I'm concerned, and vitiates all that had come before. There are some good performances, and Sellers' performance might have some interest, this being one of his earliest films. While he fulfills the limited requirements of his role as the youngest member of the gang, and proved that he was more than just the guy with the funny voices from radio, he really doesn't have that much to do here. The overall effect of LADYKILLERS leaves me cold, and would have been better had it not made that afore-mentioned dark turn. As it is, it's only fair. As for its place on my ratings scale, this ranks two stars out of a possible five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been even better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent as The Ladykillers is, it is spoiled by an anti-climax in the middle: after the heist has gone wrong and before the Professor decides they must kill Mrs Wilberforce. He should not have been there when the money escapes. Instead he should have been away, tying up various loose ends. The blunder would have been another sign of things going wrong in his absence, like the parrot's escape. Once again he could have been seen calmly walking back, only to stop short as he spots the disaster.Once again his terrible shadow could have been seen outside Mrs Wilberforce's windows as the gang sing those terrible old songs. The dramatic suspense would have been maintained much better. She would then have locked them up, only for the Professor to climb through the window with his fresh solution??.And, as a matter of fact, the production values aren't too hot generally. The thug (Danny Green) puts his fist through that door panel, only for it to miraculously re-assemble 10 minutes later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, but a Comedy? No</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ladykillers is a film with a lot to work with in terms of its cast, yet has little to provide in terms of comedy or suspense, as no characters are endearing enough to even care about. For what this comedy lacks in witty dialogue it does not make up for with slapstick, or at least enough to make this humorous enough to be worth watching. The amount of enjoyment it provides is dependent on how you perceive the main character, a little old lady that appears to be a senile version of the boy who cried wolf. She is intended to be weak yet the story contradicts this at times. She lost any charm she had in very little time and was as much an annoyance to the viewer as to the characters in the story. The only reason I can imagine this being worthwhile for someone is if they are a fan of one of the actors in it and even then no performance is spectacular. The most interesting part of the movie is likely the absurd fake teeth that Alec Guinness wears and the intrigue revolving around their authenticity, as he is of course a British actor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comedy is so laid back it's practically in a persistent vegetative state. There's nothing really wrong with it, except that it was clearly aimed at an audience whose expectations were so mundane and sedate they could have been equally entertained by a marathon game of "Got yer nose!" Watching this film reminded me of the Thundercats cartoon I enjoyed as a kid. When I saw an episode as an adult, I was astonished at how slow and simple and benign the show was. That's the same feeling I got from The Ladykillers. It's so subdued and placid that the few times the movie gets slightly energetic are more off putting than amusing.Professor Marcus (Alec Guiness) is a criminal mastermind who's hatched a scheme to rob an armored car with a quartet of fellow villains (Herbert Lom, Peter Sellers, Danny Green and Cecil Parker). The plan revolves around Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson), a frail, old busybody with a house that's went lopsided from the bombings during WWII. Marcus and company manage to pull off the robbery. Mrs. Wilberforce plays her unwitting part in helping them get away with the money. Getting away from Mrs. Wilberforce, however, turns out to be the most difficult thing of all.Alec Guiness gives a nice performance that starts with a prosthetic overbite and unfolds into an unceasing parade of mannerisms. On the stage and with some punchier material to work with, his Professor Marcus would have been a wonderful creation. Here, though, it's like a trickle of water in the desert; barely enough to keep your interest alive.Guiness and Peter Sellers are also the only actors giving recognizably comedic performances. The rest of the cast and, for that matter, 90% of the film could be transposed into a drama with only the most superficial of alterations. The overwrought soundtrack sounds like it came from a much more dramatic motion picture, which may be an intentional joke but is undone by how thunderously it echoes through this cinematic lull. The intent may have been humorous but it makes equally as much sense to take as a mistake.You could show extended excerpts from The Ladykillers to ignorant audiences and they would not be able to tell if it was a comedy or not. I hate to put the blame on her, but I think it's largely because of Katie Johnson. She has so little energy on screen and any humor in her role is so obtuse that Mrs. Wilberforce becomes an anchor that drags down everything else in the movie.If you've taken a lot of cold medicine or have popped out of the TARDIS from 1950s Britain, you might be able to enjoy this film. The rest of you would probably get as many laughs from watching Alec Guiness in The Bridge On The River Kwai as you would from The Ladykillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ladykillers; or how to waste an actor's talent...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sir Alec Guinness. Young Peter Sellers. An Oscar-nominated screenplay by William Rose. An old British woman who foils them all. With all of these factors racing towards the finish line, one could imagine the hilarity that was to follow. Alas, after the first twenty minutes, it seemed to all come to a screeching halt. Yes, there were comic moments, genius creativity, and excitement in the air, but as a whole, "The Ladykillers" was more a hodgepodge of could-be-great ideas mixed together with poor execution and a misuse of the actors' ability on-screen than a laugh-out-loud comedy. Yes, this was a "dark" comedy, and the ending solidifies that idea, but what was lacking within the story was the actual comedy itself. With such actors like Guinness, or Peter Sellers, or Danny Green; director Alexander MacKendrick had loads of opportunity to transform this film into a cult classic, to unleash the potential hidden within his players. Too bad he missed the opportunity. With a intriguing story, a fun old lady, and a misused cast, "The Ladykillers" may have been bold for the time, but today it just felt stale, slow, and misplaced. How could a film with so much potential fall so flat? Our story begins promising; with a little old lady (Ms. Lopsided) talking to the police about how there weren't aliens in her friend's garden. As she travels home a looming figure follows her. MacKendrick does a great job of creating early tension, this unknown of who is going to arrive at the door or what the motives may be. As Guinness rings the bell, the shadow is revealed to have large fake teeth and a comb-over. This random act of costume design demonstrates the ability of comedy on both the part of the actor and the director. As Guinness swoops into his charming devilish self, the dynamic between him and the old lady becomes the crux of this film. MacKendrick must realize that the two have chemistry (or that the two were the obvious focus of the film) because he focuses his entire remainder of the film on these two alone, oddly leaving everyone else in the wake of unknown. As we are introduced to the rest of the string quartet, as audience members, we have hope that these actors will provide us with genuine laughs. Perhaps some comedic parody or defined character humor, but there is none. Sellers is left with a cardboard character worthy of mere facial expressions and overblown acting. He is wasted because MacKendrick is too focused on Guinness. The same can be said for everyone else in the background the focuses more on clich than on actual substantial characters. Major Courtney, One Round, Harry, and Louis are lost within the scene, leaving the audience to care nothing for them, giving us a less-involved ending.With our major actors in no position to lead, we are left with a story that remains the excitement of this film. The heist scene alone is worth watching this movie for 90ish minutes. To have early scenes (and scenes after) carry the same theme song throughout, but then have no music at all during the heist ? only enhanced the experience. Again, MacKendrick had to have known that he had a great script, I just wish he could have managed his actors a bit more. The choreography for the heist, as well as the cinematography, was pure caper. It was executed as well as any Michael Mann film could have dreamed. Everything from the actual robbery all the way until Mrs. Lopsided's role in the scheme was introduced was finely tuned. Even the escape, which kept me on my toes, seemed well developed and enjoyable ? but then again, we seemed to come to another hodgepodge thematic and tone downfall. The introduction of the other old ladies was fun, but after that ? when the group begins to implode, it just doesn't feel right. I was ready for the dark comedy, but there are always two parts to this ? both the darkness and the comedy ? and "The Ladykillers" was lacking in the latter.So, the mix of bad characters with substantial plot really made this should-have-been great film into just another decent 50s British film. If MacKendrick would have focused a bit more on the actors' abilities than I think he would have had a solid film, but without it ? it just felt disjoined, poorly edited, and a splattering of good points with bad. Overall, just a mediocre film.Overall, I just wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be. It began with quite a bit of excitement and creativity, but by the end I just wanted it to be over. I wanted to get to know the other characters more; I wanted to see them evolve like I did the story. I had high hopes for Sellers, whom is merely a background character ? demonstrating none of his ability. Guinness does shine, but he cannot carry this entire film. The old lady made me laugh, and while the reimagine is no better, I can see why the Cohen's wanted to remake their version. That final scene with the old lady was phenomenal, but why couldn't the rest of the film follow suit. Decent ? but nothing worth keeping or watching again or again.Grade: *** out of *****</fullReview>

The demented-looking Professor claims to be a musician and uses his room to gather his bumbling friends that pass for a musical troupe with intentions of planning and carrying out the robbery of a London armored car. The addled brain robbers think they are in the clear until Mrs. Wilberforce discovers the stolen money that has fallen from a cello case. She is led to feel the guilt from her unintentional small part in the robbery. This motley crew now are convinced it is safer to draw lots to see who will "do away" with the little old landlady. Easier said than done...each man in turn will fail in their dastardly attempts of homicide. The gang of crooks feature: Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom and Danny Green. My favorite scene is when Harry(Sellers)tries to capture Mrs. Wilberforce's bird that has flown the coop. Beware: spurts of bumbling action soon becomes short of irritating.</fullReview>

No matter how many times I watch this, I never cease to want someone...ANYONE...to slit her throat or blow her brains out.

		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Sir Alec, and the work he did for Ealing Studios. _Kind Hearts and Coronets_ is a classic, and _The Man in the White Suit_ is biting satire at its best (although I have a soft spot in my heart for _A Run for Your Money_). So when I saw that _The Ladykillers_ was going to be on, I set up the timer for my DVR, since that's also considered a classic.It was...excruciating. From the opening credits, and that sort of creepy dark music (not to mention the weirdly saturated color that made me think of _The Red Shoes_ -- another so-called classic -- and also made me wonder if Ted Turner had been mucking around with colorization again) I wondered what the fuss was all about. I'm still wondering. It was clear that the cops thought Mrs. W. was a complete nut job, to be humored and gently led back home. I guess that's supposed to be funny, but my dad had Alzheimer's, and so did my maternal grandmother, so it really isn't. I guess it was supposed to set up something like "my tenant is a notorious bank robber" "yes, yes, let us take you home now and don't forget your umbrella this time..." But I didn't wait around to find out. And those teeth! I know that Guiness specialized in makeup stuff (see the aforementioned KH&amp;C and his multiple roles). He was just creepy, and not in a funny way. Made it through about 20 minutes (where everyone is chasing the parrot across the roof) and gave up up in disgust, because that's 20 minutes of my life I will *never* get back..... Avoid this stinker like the plague, and ignore most of the past 90+ reviews on here (they apparently saw a completely different film). Go watch _A Run for Your Money_ instead, because it's actually funny. Or _Kind Hearts and Coronets_ which is a delicious send-up of Oscar Wilde (and would make a great double-feature with the Michael Redgrave version of _The Importance of Being Earnest_), because it's Sir Alec at his very best....</fullReview>

The scene where the entire gang pile into the phone booth was just-plain dumb. What made this movie even worse is that I was expecting something far better, especially since it starred Alec Guinness. And regarding Alec Guinness's character, Prof. Marcus, the Marcus character would have fit in quite well as one of the aliens in "Star Wars" or some other science fiction movie. A lot of people ragged "The Dukes of Hazzard" but that film was unpretentious and the Duke boys were FUNNY; these British thieves were not good natured buffoons; they were nasty and grotesque.
