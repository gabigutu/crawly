		<shortDescription>Not an adequate remake, but rather a reinterpretation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly, the Cohens have enough decency to know when a task should be left undone, and when that task is the re-creation and improvement of a comedy classic,they know better than to regurgitate old gags infused with modern flair, or do they? I will admit that I did enjoy this novel retelling of the Mackendrick classic. I enjoyed Hank's brilliant, earnest, and flawless delivery. I also enjoyed Irma P. Hall's sincerity. I enjoyed the score, the locale, the warm-lazy essence of Mississippi, and the mythological progression of events that is so common in the Cohens' films. Most of all, I enjoyed the charm of this film more-so than its predecessor.Of course, in deference, the originators deserve their due praise, but this is certainly no simple remake--it's a retelling. Retellings don't need to improve, dazzle, or impress by comparison--they simply are what they are, and this was enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake? Mainstream? So what - it is a great fun:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not stop laughing and enjoyed it tremendously. Tom Hanks was simply delightful pretending to be refined, highly educated, charmingly polite and smooth talking Rococo music lover Professor G.H.Darr who in reality was a very dangerous, ruthless and devious criminal that assembled the most hilarious gang of thieves (each has his special talent) to dig the tunnel through his landlady's root cellar to a casino vault and to steal 1.6 million dollars. As good as Hanks was, he was completely upstaged by Irma Hall who steals the movie as Marva. She received many awards for her acting and very deservingly. I know that many Coens' fans don't like The Ladykillers because 1. it is a remake of the 1955 movie with the same title and 2. because it is one of their most mainstream films. I don't care - "The Ladykillers" has Coens' signatures all over - it is very funny, very dark, and uniquely beautiful visually - just remember the opening scene with two scary gargoyles and the garbage barge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Coen gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersFalling short of a Coen masterpiece (such a Fargo), The Ladykillers can be described as a Coen gem. The style is evident right from the opening shot. Where else can you find a garbage barge and a garbage dump transformed so magically by the movie camera into what looks like an idyllic paradise. Equally sparkling is the audio pleasure proffered, with the beautiful background of barber-shop like chorus leading into an on screen duet of snores of the sheriff and his deputy. While on that score (no pun intended), lively, exciting swinging gospel music provides excellent interludes as well as background throughout. Knowing that this is a remake of a 1955 version lead by Alec Gunnies, I'll make no further reference to something that I have not had the pleasure of watching. Instead, I would make reference to the assembling of the team for the caper, an enjoyable prologue as found in many similar films, from the good old classic The League of Gentlemen to the more recent Italian Job (also a remake). The slight difference here is that instead of seeing the mastermind (Tom Hanks) actually recruiting each one of them, we are shown what looks like a cartoon quip of each, with some good laughs but at the same time highlighting their individual characteristics.Tunnelling for a robbery is not new, and the classical one has to be The Red Headed League in the Sherlock Holmes short stores. Here, under the pretext of researching Renaissance music, Hanks and company rent the basement of a widow, played by Irma P. Hall. One source of amusement to the audience comes from the scenes between these two, the church-going Southern black woman whose every nuance overflows with simple, principled honesty (but earthly smartness) and the completely cunning crook who tries to wriggle out of her recognition at every twist and turn. Another contrast played upon a lot by the Coen Brothers is the Hanks' talking 'genteel' (as Eliza Doolittle would have said) and the proliferation of obscenity from the 'punk', the insider member of the gang.Funny right from the start, this movie gradually reveals more and more of the Coens' brand of dark humour when eventually the title 'ladykillers' take on a literal meaning. An 'In competition' film at Cannes this year, this Coen gem is well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some say....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not as bad a bad movie as many other would seem to want you to believe. It does not really bear comparison to the original because it has been made differently and updated for a modern audience. Tom Hanks, contrary to other comments I have seen here, is quite excellent in the lead role. His hammy, Poe-esquire disguise, is clearly compensating for the lack of intellectual gravity to which he so anxiously aspires. And, although I understand that Hanks did not watch the original prior to filming, it is a neat coincidence then that he chose to insert false teeth (see Alistair Simm in the original). The supporting characters are nicely fleshed out with some helpful introductory vignettes and although some of the film comes across as a little too "Uncle Tom's Cabin" at times; I think we can forgive the Cohens. There are some great laugh out loud moments of pure slapstick and some nice subtle touches of more gentle humour. This does not stack up against some of the more lauded of the Cohen's work - Fargo - Barton Fink - but it is an enjoyable and worthwhile slice of cinematic time. Beware of plenty of (uneccesary) bad language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CRITIQUE CONTAINS SPOILERS The original 1952 film was about a group of crooks, posing as musicians, who rented a room and an old lady's house in London. She was unwittingly drawn into their plans to steal a large sum of money. The old lady was portrayed by Katie Johnson as a vulnerable woman who, nonetheless, was saved from being implicated in the plot and rose above it.The remake takes the central story, transfers it to the United States, and makes the old lady anything other than vulnerable. That being the case, the outcome of this film is always clear. She is not and never will get drawn into the plot of the gangsters living in her midst, unwittingly or otherwise. Also seen in the remake is the old lady routinely attacking her lodgers, something only fleetingly glanced at in the original.When old, classic films are remade the authors should bear in mind what makes them special and try to keep it. In The Ladykillers (2004) this was lost. The studio thus served up another film which didn't benefit the world of cinema one iota.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Coenesque for this caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ladykillers (1955) is an enduring classic of British cinema. It was far and away Ealing's finest hour as a studio. Smooth, polished and blackly funny, its one of the best British comedies ever made. Now the classic tale gets the 21st Century makeover from Ethan and Joel Coen.The basic story is just as Ealing left it. Five men plan a robbery while posing as musicians for the little old lady putting them up. She eventually finds the money, and the gang have no choice but to bump her off. But everything that can and will go wrong does. Ealing comedies have always been a big influence on the Coen Brothers. Especially The Ladykillers. They love to make films where hapless folk fall victim to cruel and unusual circumstances. The Ladykillers should have worked really well in their hands. What a crushing disappointment that it doesn't. The Coens have made many marvellous films over the years. But this is one film on they're resume that misfires.The Coens' have radically reworked the story to suit themselves. E.g. A pet cat instead of pet parrots, bodies dumped into garbage barges and not train carriages. And the Deep South as a setting. I have nothing against changes. The mark of a good remake is to take the original story and find some new novelty on it. But its the approach the Coens' take that kills the story.Much of the appeal of the original film was the way it took place in a cosy, English domestic setting. Beneath a placid demeanour was a very sinister crime story. As violence and murder began to spiral, it pushed the film from the blackly comical into the truly hysterical.The anonymity of the original made the violence in it that much more disturbing. And that all the more funny. But the mistake of the Coens' is to make it disturbing, but not to rein any of it in.Coen films are frequently bizarre. But its an approach that doesn't sit very well with the story. Alec Guinness' Professor Marcus was hardly normal. You could tell that just by looking at him. But he didn't have to do much to convince you of that. One of the major problems with the remake is the way the Coens' have rewritten his character. Professor Marcus has now become Professor G.H. Dorr, Ph.d. This was Tom Hanks' first time out with the Coen Brothers, and in interviews, he said he'd never seen the original film. If he had, I can guarantee he wouldn't have wanted to do a remake. Because the original film was perfect. The remake only reminds you of how well written and well acted the original was.Tom Hanks' performance is more distracting than it is engaging. He plays the role with a series of peculiar squeaks, grunts and double-takes. Its impossible to form a connection with such an unusual character. Hanks draws too much attention to himself. Where Alec Guinness was more subtle. He could communicate volumes with a simple look.The other members of the gang are not much better either. We care little for these people. And like Hanks, they're much too bizarre to identify with. Considering they're supposed to be criminals trying to keep a low profile, it just doesn't make any sense that the Coens' play up their quirks to shrieking, absurd levels.One thing that seriously works against the film is Marlon Wayans. I must admit to an intense dislike of him as an actor. His performances are annoyingly over the top. And The Ladykillers is no exception. He spends half the time swearing his way through the film. He does more swearing than he does talking. Which feels out of step with the rest of the film. Every time he's on the scene, I wanted to leave the room. I was relieved when he was killed off. The film is all the better for it.An otherwise fine actor like JK Simmons is wasted. He doesn't get much to do, and his irritable bowel syndrome isn't nearly as funny as the Coens' think it is. Tzi Ma and Ryan Hurst make no distinction on the story at all. They're not the smooth, attuned ensemble Guinness' gang were.In the role of the little old lady, instead of Mrs Wilberforce, we have Mrs Munson, played by Irma P. Hall. Her sassy, energetic presence is the one ray of sunshine to the film. She's the one thing about the remake the Coens' get right. She's an amusing reversal of what we were expecting. Not too knowing. But not too naive either.The film is slightly more successful in its second half. As soon as it gets to the point where they have to kill Mrs Munson off, it forces the Coens' to stop springing oddball quirks on us and get on with telling the story. A point where the Coens' trademark black humour finally starts paying off. They die just like the last time, with Mrs Munson completely none the wiser. But the Coens' put they're own sadistic spin on them. Tzi Ma's death is particularly hilarious.But that's all of 30 minutes before the credits roll. And that's too late in the film to save it. And even then, we never get the feeling that things are getting worse by the second the way we did with the Ealing version. Or the way the Coens' did with Fargo. They fortunately recovered with their next film, the superb No Country For Old Men. But if that film showed the Coens' at their best, The Ladykillers is them at their worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely unnecessary remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've admired some of the Coen's other movies, and Tom Hanks gives a smooth comic performance here.That's about it.It's not a very funny movie. It's not entirely lacking in the Coen's sort of irony and wit -- two of the gangsters constantly at each others' throats are a jive-talking rastafarian-looking black kid and an older white guy who was a freedom rider. But the humor is driven in with a sledgehammer, what there is of it. While demonstrating how safe it is to handle a kind of explosive, the expert hits it with a hammer and blows his finger off. There follows an argument about whether or not it can be sewn back on like Bobbitt's penis. The black kid claims it can be although it might "maybe look like a chewed up frankfurter." In the original the crooks execute a simple but nicely choreographed heist on a city street and involve their old landlady in the retrieval of the money. Here, the crooks tunnel into the vault. Why? Digging tunnels and having accidents (the fuse that stops, then restarts at the wrong moment) are easier to do than figuring out jokes that might take place during a street robbery. And the old landlady is in no way involved in the plan. She stumbles on the gang by accident while the air is filled with fluttering bills. She's also not old and delicate. She's in late middle age, energetic, and robust.Well. Others might enjoy it more than I did, especially if they're not familiar with the unsurpassable original. I personally am getting awfully tired of remakes. What a dearth of creativity they portend. They are beginning to make parodies of parodies. Shot-for-shot remakes of classics that were in no need of remaking. What next? "Citizen Kane" starring Keanu Reeves in Splendocolor? "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Part Two: The Return of Gold Hat"? "Viagra Comes to Golden Pond"? Another remake of "Reefer Madness"? You see where I'm going with this. The MBAs have taken over the asylum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the annuls of cinema, Character is king. Many can come up with a winning high concept idea but unless you fill it with a rich tapestry of Characters you've wasted time. For the greatest plot idea can become mundane if you've put the wrong character in the wrong place. Joel and Ethan Coen's THE LADYKILLERS is a mundane story that is saved by top notch and very rich performances. Mrs. Munson (Irma P. Hall, Soul Food) is a simple woman. She lives at home alone, she goes to church every Sunday, and she prays for the souls of those young kids listening to that "Hippity Hoppity" music. So when she rents a room to Professor Dorr P.H.D (Tom Hanks, Philadelphia) little does she know that her annual contribution to Bob Jones University will never be the same.Dorr turns out to be a criminal mastermind, trying to pull off a simple casino robbery. He's acquired a crack team of losers and creeps to pull it off: Gaiwan (Marlon Wayans, Dungeons and Dragons) The Inside Man, Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons, The First Wives Club) The Munitions Expert, The General (Tzi Ma, The Quiet American) the tactical man, and Lump (Ryan Hurst, Patch Adams) is the muscle. Will they pull off their brilliant plan? Only time and the two-hour running time will tell.What the Coen's have crafted here is an acquired taste. The comedy is a little bit esoteric. The story plods along with almost reckless abandon, and they use swear words like their trying to buy a Ferrari with their swear jar. But something else is going on under the surface, a great character drama is unfolding.Hank's overplays Dorr, but only to hide the fact that he might not be nearly as smart as he might claims. It's so subtle, and yet so garish I could see many thinking the performance is too over the top. But Hanks plays it so smartly and charming, you can't help but be enveloped into its complex layers. I also liked how the Coen's screenplay polarizes it characters by playing the actors against each other. Dorr and Munson relationship works because it's the classic battle between brains and innocence. You may be able to quote Edgar Allen Poe, but if you can't do the right thing maybe you should get a real job. The other great struggle is between Gaiwan and Garth. Gaiwan is a young black male with no conscience. Garth is a liberal white guy trying to knock sense into this stupid kid. Their escalating story builds from an almost a playful game of Older Vs Younger, but then raises the bar as it escalates into violence. The Coen's have always had limited appeal because their films are dependent on audience involvement. You have to care for the characters; you have to put yourself in the characters place. Those who don't will leave the theater going that was weird, that was stupid, and that didn't make any sense. But that's why I like their films so much.THE LADYKILLERS is worth the price of admission if you're interested in a silly and subtle characterdrama but fails in plot. But boy it's a lot of fun, and if you give it a chance you might just walk away without that look of confusion you had on your face after THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.**** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun variation on a comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "The Ladykillers" is one of my favorite comedies, a gleefully macabre and witty classic with some outstanding performances, especially Alec Guinness' hysterical performance. It was also distinctively British. Now, I am not nearly as annoyed by remakes as many other filmgoers are- I merely find most of them unnecessary and hence avoid most of them. The only ones I respect are those that attempt to do something different. The Coens are probably my favorite living directors and among the more distinctive currently working, and they certainly put their own spin on an established comedy classic with this film.I think that the poor reception this film got is largely due to its sense of humor. The Coens' dry wit present in several of their films is present here, mostly through the main character Professor Dorr, portrayed excellently by Tom Hanks in one of his better performances, but there's also a lot of low-brow humor, and not even distinctive or interesting low-brow humor, just 'haha he dropped an f-bomb' sort, which is really at odds with the rest of this film. Really, take out Marlon Wayans and his annoying character and you would have one of the best remakes ever made. Instead you've got this film."The Ladykillers", in spite of its awful reputation, is really not a bad film at all. It's got atmosphere, it's beautifully photographed, it's fairly amusing, and the majority of the performances are very good. It's inferior by the Coens' standards but still better than most comedies released in 2004. In addition, although it takes a lot of liberties with the original story, it recreates the most memorable sequences from the original with care and obvious affection, resulting in a hugely entertaining last twenty minutes in which so many memorable images from Mackendrick's classic Ealing comedy are translated to the American south. This is a minor film for the Coens, but obviously one made with love and affection. It's fairly flawed, but it's also quite amusing and features and outstanding performance from Tom Hanks, an actor I don't normally think is particularly great. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and Bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a remake this movie falls flat, as a stand alone movie its not too bad and will appeal more to a younger audience and probably mostly American one at that.Here is the problem with remakes - If you make it exactly like the original then there is little point in remaking it, if you just change the country what is the point when the dialogue and the setting is the exact same almost, with a few words changed here and there... Coupling UK and Coupling USA is a good example... and also maybe Life on Mars. Of course these are TV shows but the comparison stands.They made this movie very different to the original and shouldn't have called it a remake, or even The Ladykillers. In no way does this resemble the original, which is a classic and is still watchable today but set far in the past when TVs were black and white... is it better than this movie if you are comparing them as the same movie... the original blows this away without a doubt.So bare that in mind when watching this movie. I wouldn't compare these movies at all, to be honest they are far too different to compare, the only comparison i can come up with is that they have the same name and some of the characters are similar... the scenario is quite different except that they are both about stealing money.Not a bad or great movie by any means, and i think Hanks character tried to be like the Alec Guinness one, a little strange, and it didn't quite work, for me anyway...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sacred and the very profane ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My recollection of the original THE LADYKILLERS is somewhat shaky, but I remember it to be a whimsical little comedy, one of those delightfully British films that celebrate English eccentricity, even in its dark and slightly murderous extremes. Made in 1955 and featuring such wonderful talents as Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom, it has earned a reputation as a minor classic.One can only assume that the Coen Brothers never saw the original, or if they did they decided that to Americanize the tale they had to strip it of anything that might even vaguely seem whimsical -- or funny. As if to reinforce the continental notion that Americans are vulgar, their woefully inept remake wallows in tastelessness. The film does display the Coens' penchant for striking visuals and offers up moments here and there of genteel ghoulishness, but it's all superficial style. Beneath that facade the film is cruel and ugly and hateful and really quite racist. For no particular reason, this tired tale about thieves tunneling into a vault has been transported to the Mississippi Delta and populated with a cast of characters trapped in racial stereotyping of every sort.Doing a crude parody of a southern gentleman, Tom Hanks plays unpleasantly against type as Prof. Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph.D., a con man who finagles his way into a boarding house ran by Irma P. Hall as Mrs. Marva Munson. He hopes to commandeer her basement as the starting point for a tunnel into the counting house of a nearby casino. (Never mind that his "inside man" already has inexplicably easy access to the poorly guarded vault making the need for the tunnel questionable.) Anyway, the plot is tired and predictable, but workable if approached with a sense of clever good cheer (as proved by Woody Allen's SMALL TIME CROOKS). But that is not to be in this case: the Coens -- Ethan and Joel co-directing and co-writing -- try ham-handedly to blend macabre wit with the obscenity-laden ethnic humor of black exploitation films. As such, the film is constantly shifting back and forth in tone.The stereotyping of Mrs. Munson as a no-nonsense Bible-thumping dowager is broad, and, at times, rather than being naive and slightly dotty, she seems just plain stupid. (She thinks Ph.D. is the spelling of Elmer Fudd's last name; that's how desperate the humor gets.) But Mrs. Munson is relatively inoffensive compared to the grotesque caricatures the film makes of the other characters. Especially offensive is Marlon Wayons' foul-mouthed Gawain, an utterly moronic homeboy, who seems to have drunkenly stumbled in from the set of SCARY MOVIE; his only function in the film is to insert multiple, achingly unfunny obscenities into every single sentence he utters. I suppose he is also meant to represent a contrast to the church-going, gospel-singing members of Mrs. Munson's congregation, but the juxtaposition of gospel and hip-hop, the sacred and the profane, serves no purpose other than to present two equally clichéd vision of African Americans. The Coens patronizes southern blacks, while also pandering to the lowest level rap music mentality.What should have been a family friendly comedy develops into an R-rated insult. Wayons' unrelentingly filthy language is matched with jokes about bowel movements and a painfully unfunny gag about a dog suffocating. The only character worthy of sympathy is Ryan Hurst as the hatefully named Lump Hudson, a brain-damaged football players who is utterly irrelevant to the story except to be condescendingly laughed at for being dumb. And doesn't it say something that the Coens, once celebrated for their adult wit and sophisticated approach, have fallen to the pathetic level of naming a character Lump, just to get an easy laugh? By the time the film takes a murderous twist, it is difficult to care about anyone. I assume that Hanks' Prof. Dorr is supposed to be a lovable scalawag, but his posturing demeanor is as annoying as his compulsive snickering laughter; none of Hanks' natural charm seeps through. His band of cohorts are callous and one-dimensional. Even Mrs. Munson begins to grate on one's nerves, as she proves to be a dull-witted bully.What is missing from the film is a sense of innocence. The Coens have proved they know how to embrace malevolence, but not since BLOOD SIMPLE have they shown the devilish wit of Alfred Hitchcock or Tim Burton or Charles Addams or Edward Gory or even Edgar Allen Poe. In their inexplicable attempt to mix modern film sadism with quaint British irony, they let the former suffocate the latter; and like the poor dog in the film, THE LADYKILLERS dies a slow and painfully unpleasant death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chez Coen serves a stale ham sandwich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has it's moments, and I didn't consider it a complete waste of time, but it is not nearly up to the standard of any other film by the Coens.Everybody tanks now and then, but it is hard to believe the same guys who made ANY of those other movies made this.The odd thing is, it's hard to put your finger on exactly what went wrong. The story and the script are fine, although the irony is somewhat overdone by the time the last body drops off the bridge, and that detracts from the more subtle irony in the final disposition of the cash. There is a lot of talent on screen, all people who have done much better work, but only one Coen regular that I recall(Stephen Root).After watching the movie a second time, just to see if I 'missed it' somehow, I decided that it was over the top and out of control performances (Wayans, Hanks and Simmons being the worst offenders) that brought it down.It's odd, because but the Coen's have handled exuberant and highly creative actors playing outrageous characters in their previous films and managed to make them hilarious yet believable (ie almost every character in 'The Big Lebowski' or 'O Brother'), but this time I guess the monkeys got control of the zoo.Anyway, for whatever reasons, it just doesn't feel like a Coen film to me, and certainly doesn't have the 're-watch' appeal of ANY of their others, many of which I have watched and enjoyed a dozen times or more.</fullReview>

This wasn't even close to what they did before. Sure, it's a different movie, but they could've at least tried to make it funny. This had no humor and no story to it at all. Even Tom Hanks couldn't save it. It was basically a bunch of ne'er do wells trying to do away with an old lady, but they kill themselves instead. Exciting? Funny? I think not!

		<fullReview>While usually a fan of the Coen Brothers and certainly of Tom Hanks, I sit stunned after viewing this poor, ill-conceived remake of the original 1955 classic. I had to practically bribe my wife to finish it with me after the first half hour; my personal threshold for inept film-making is much higher than is hers. The original film from 50 years ago brims with a highly intelligent, wonderfully imaginative screenplay which is structured brilliantly; the 1955 film shines with wit and HEART throughout -- despite the thoroughly dark humor, and boasts wonderfully fine-tuned performances from Alec Guiness through Peter Sellers and the absolutely amazing Katie Johnson as the intended victim; her work in this film is hilarious in its subtlety and it's conceivable she truly might be a vulnerable victim of this gang, which is completely the opposite of the impression one gets of the Coen Brothers' Marva Munson. The original holds up as well as if it were made today. The remake? Wretched. Why bother remaking something so blithely perfect to begin with? There's not a single character to root for - and that includes the central character of Marva Munson played very well but to no avail by Irma P. Hall - she's no victim; there's absolutely no fear she might be done in - instead, I'd run FROM her rather than accidentally irritate her. The only question I have is this: WHY? Why did anyone feel they had something new to say with this remake? It's an exercise in bad decisions and choices from beginning to end; it's not often I feel filmmakers have blown it on so massive a scale that I feel compelled to vent my irritation at having had my time wasted, but everyone involved in this terrible production certainly know better than to foist this dreadful trash on anyone who enjoys and salutes film entertainment. If you somehow enjoyed this wreck of a movie, please do yourself the privilege of seeing the original Ealing Studios production to see it done well. And then try sitting through the Coens' version again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Glorious Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I really appreciate artists willing to push the envelope. They're not pushing if they don't fail at least a third of the time. This is a failure, but an interesting, glorious one and in its way is more interesting to watch than, say, `O Brother.' You know something worth knowing is up when the most nuanced actor in a high level project like this is a painting.These guys are cinefiles, enthusiasts who examine what they and others do with meticulous detail and grand vision. They reach for a specific tone, different for each project, and then engineer the pieces to support. What do you think? Was the original vision too ambitious: a takeoff from theShakespearean actor from Huck Finn? In this case, it is a Coen-like folding: an actor playing an actor playing Twain who writes the riverboat plot using a previously written skeleton (something recently done by PS Hoffman in `Cold Mountain').Or is it that the vision was as apt an reachable as any they have had, but they erred in the engineering? I think it is this latter. Some of the blame is theirs: they have come to be hypnotized by the power of themed music in their films. Here it is a distraction, saps resources and fails to support the quirky vision. Tbone failed them.But they were stuck with some bad casting. Once that happens, you're lost. Hanks is such a heaviweight that he forces the vision to bend to what he wants to do as an actor. Big mistake.The old lady Marva Munson is capable of playing only one sort of character. We've seen her do it in several dreary projects. She just couldn't ever get the joke and really believes she is in an Eddie Murphy movie.And third, and almost incidentally, we have Wayans. He also knows only one way of swinging. None of these three was capable of getting on board the twisted vision the brothers had. Dozens of real actors have. But these three are, alas, characters now, not actors.Still, you can see what they had in mind, and still be amused by it even though it never appears on the screenTed's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New version of the classic movie as entertaining and amusing as the British film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A band of botcher thieves (Marlon Wayans , Tzi Ma , Ryan Hurst) led by a cunning man (Tom Hanks) attempt a great robbing , but their scheme is foiled by an allegedly innocent old lady (Irma P. Hall) . They devise a perfect plan which is continuously spoiled by the inopportune intervention of the sweet little landlady .The picture is a bemusing and droll comedy especially in the parts happen the antics and flops of the heist . The laughters and chuckles are varied and giggles are based on diverse personalities and differences among protagonists . It's an agreeable movie for the youth who will enjoy enormously and with lots of fun . Tom Hanks (in similar role to Alec Guinnes) is terrific as the leader , if you like Hanks manic performance , you'll enjoy this one . However , the profanities and bad taste language are in charge of Marlon Wayans (Scary movie) and other secondaries such as J.K.Simmons (Spiderman) , the Oriental Tzi Ma and the hunk Ryan Hurst are pretty well . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Roger Deakins and enjoyable music by Carter Burwell (usual musician of Cohen brothers) . The picture is a good adaptation of the classic British film of the golden decade of Ealing studio , a droll black comedy with the same title and featured by Alec Guinnes , Herbert Lom and Peter Sellers and written by Willian Rose . The motion picture was rightly directed by Joel and Ethan Cohen . The flick will appeal to Tom Hanks fans and black comedy buffs . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad day in the film career of Tom Hanks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so disappointed in Tom Hanks for appearing in this TERRIBLE remake of a really good movie. The use of filthy language was awful, and added absolutely nothing to the storyline. It is a crying shame that such a great classic movie can be remade into such a piece of crap. The original was British made, and done with class. It's this kind of "entertainment" that makes America look bad in my opinion. The Coen brothers, who I think made "O' Brother Where art thou?" have really sunk to a new low with this movie. I hate that I wasted money to see this and I warn you to not waste yours. Go rent the original and enjoy a good movie, but stay away from this version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary filthy language, ridiculous sterotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ladykillers appeared in our newspaper with a 4 star review. Staring Tom Hanks and featuring a number of other well known actors, it was billed as an interesting story of several men in modern day Mississippi robbing a casino, along the lines of "Ocean's Eleven". Instead of an interesting story with a nice twist, we got Tom Hanks with a ridiculous accent using vocabulary, that though difficult to understand, was also difficult to comprehend. His absurd dialog was coupled with more useless, vulgar profanity, racial and ethnic sterotyping, and portrayal of southern black religion in the worst possible light, than I have seen in any other movie - EVER! The plot, such as there was, never really developed, and devolved into a torpid, time-wasting, unenjoyable, stupid (but not stupid enough to be entertaining), annoying, unbelievable waste of talent and celluloid. This movie was so bad, it is only the second time, in 35 years of movie viewing, that I wish I had just walked out. I can't believe Tom Hanks was associated with this film, and any talk of an Oscar for him is so contrived, it makes me question the entire Academy Awards process. If the new trend is to give 4 stars to only those movies that are so "different" as to be totally unwatchable, then it's time to stop paying $40 to take my family to the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ladykillers of 1955 is one of my all time favourite films. The 2004 version is a typical Hollywood failed remake. Why do they always ruin films from elsewhere in the world like they did with La Cage aux Folles when The Bidcage came out.This remake is undoubtedly the worst of a very bad lot. Tom Hanks was appalling in the Alec Guinness role, the 'lady' in question though well acted missed the whole point of the plot, and the black character with verbal diarrhoea and a foul mouth was a disgrace to the memory of the Ealing Comedy of old.If you have a modicum of good taste, do not go to see this execrable nonsense.</fullReview>

What does the scene in church where the choir is singing, for what seems an eternity, have to do with anything.?? Then the the preacher get up and babbles for another eternity .. about nothing. This movie was only slightly better than Lost In Translation .. but not much. I gave "The Ladykillers" a 1 ... and that was being very kind. Tom Hanks did give a mediocre performance considering the difficult character he was forced to play. Take my advice and don't waste your money .. burn it instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite enjoyable but lacking few really good touches and it is certainly far from being a match for the Coen's best work or the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marva Munson is a religious woman in the Deep South who has a room to rent and a large character. She takes in the rather eccentric and rather charming gentleman Professor G.H. Dorr, who asks if he may use her basement for his musical ensemble to practice. However Dorr's real plan is to tunnel out of the basement and into the underground money store of a nearby casino.However, the plan doesn't go exactly to plan and the one thing Dorr hasn't accounted for is a little old lady discovering what's really going on.Having spent last Saturday afternoon in the company of the original (very good if not a classic) I decided to spend part of this Saturday in a cinema with the remake. The plot is pretty much the same as the original, with only the characters and the specifics of the job changing; in terms of concept, some plot details and even some scene set ups it hasn't changed that much and I quite enjoyed seeing elements I recognised. The film is quite fun on its own terms but it is not great and it becomes rather frustrating to not only compare it to the original but to also have in mind that this is a film from the Coen brothers. I say this because, aside from Dorr himself, the film lacked their usual assured wit and eye for character.Dorr is a fine character in the mould of the original but the rest of the characters are really lacking. How many Coen films have the characters been more important than anything else? Here we have characters with the usual 'things' about them, but here these 'things' are really lazy and obvious ? like someone was trying to ape the Coens. So MacSam becomes a lazy 'mo-fo' talking black character, The General is a quiet, calm Oriental and Pancake's twist is that he has IBS ? practically giving us fart jokes, in a Coen brothers movie!These secondary characters deliver very little whereas usually the Coens provide much to love in their support. The change to the character of the little old lady is a big mistake too ? the whole idea is that the lady is not a match for the crooks but overcomes them by accident, here it is apparent from the start that Munson is more than a match for any of them! The cast are pretty mixed and pretty much do what they can with what they are given. For that reason Hanks is great and adds cream to the top of Guinness' performance in the original ? he is funny and well worth watching but the film dips when he is offscreen. Hall is very good and it is not her fault that her character is misjudged; she works her facial expressions very well and I enjoyed her even if I longed for a role like the original had. Simmons tries hard but the IBS thing spoils what little he had, Hurst is just a lump (literally) and is annoying rather than funny, Ma is pretty funny because of how he acts but even the whole flip-cigarette-inside-mouth thing is an old joke. And then we come to Wayans. Wayans is not the sort of person I ever thought I'd see in a Coen brothers movie and he just does his usual 'mo-fo' ethnic stereotype thing here, he is annoying and his character just smacks of a complete lack of imagination.The soundtrack is full of good gospel stuff and it makes it feel a lot more lively than the original and this energy does help cover some of its failings ? but not that well. Overall it is fun and it is worth a look, but if you have seen the original or like the Coens then you will struggle to see past its failings at times. The characters are not as well written as they could have been and it is not as funny as it needed to be (the original wasn't laugh out loud either, but then it had other strengths that this doesn't). It has just about enough going for it to be worth watching once but it is both a sub-par Coen brother's film and a sub-par version of a better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the worst disappointment I've had in a long time. I love the original Ealing comedy this is based on &amp; was so excited when I heard the Coen brothers were remaking it, with Tom Hanks to boot. What happened???Several others have commented on the jarring changes in tone &amp; this is a major problem. The scenes with the old lady evoke a 50's feeling, then suddenly you're in a casino with the F-word spouting every 5 seconds. What the heck is that?? What's the need for all the cursing at all? It's just not funny.Tom Hanks is a mess. I think it's the script mainly, the majority of his lines are confusing mush. I read somewhere that he didn't view the original before making this, but his sniveling laugh sure looks like a poor imitation of Alec Guinness's monstrously funny snickers. You even get a little of the teeth movement, but again, nothing to compare with Guinness. The other characters are uninspired &amp; not as well drawn as the originals, with the exception perhaps of "The General" who came off pretty well. It's hard to compete with Herbert Lom &amp; Peter Sellars, of course, but couldn't they come up with anything better than this? The munitions guy was the worst (yes, more than Marlon Wayons' stereotyped role) and his irritable bowel syndrome....gee, nothing like toilet humor to bring on the laughs!! You just don't care about these guys!Lastly, the old lady character was okay, but no match for Katie Johnson in the original. She was too sharp, too strong. Most of the humor in the original came from the old lady being so dottily sweet, mild and (seemingly) frail. You could see why the police thought she was a little daft. Not so with the new character, I didn't buy it at all.Don't waste your money on this one. Go for the original and, while you're at it, try some of the other Ealing comedies, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly funny but disappointing coming from the Coens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ladykillers" is the Coen brothers' re-interpretation of the British classic of the same name. In it, Tom Hanks plays a charming Southern professor who assembles a varied group of individuals in order to pull off an ingenious heist. However, his landlord, a lively old widow played by Irma P. Hall, soon threatens to expose the entire venture.I originally saw this film during its theatrical run and found it funny enough to warrant a DVD purchase later on. I watched it yesterday for the first time in a few years and I was left disappointed. I seemed to recall the film having a number of absolutely hilarious scenes. This time, though, the film wasn't nearly as engaging.The cast isn't too bad. Tom Hanks delivers his best comedic performance in years and Irma P. Hall was an excellent choice for her role. I am certain that I enjoyed the interplay between J.K. Simmons &amp; Marlon Wayans moreso in the past but they're still not bad. The rest of the cast includes a few interesting performances but nothing especially noteworthy.The story is a fairly entertaining black comedy that mixes humour of the crude and more sophisticated varieties. The Coens do a pretty good job of bringing the story to life and, as usual, the direction is top notch. The gospel-infused soundtrack is rousing but I got the feeling that the Coens were just trying to recreate the musical success that they enjoyed with "O Brother, Where Art Thou?".When you get down to it, I think that this is a worthwhile comedy but when you compare it to the likes of "The Big Lebowski" it's really no comparison at all. That being said, the current IMDb rating of only 6.2 seems a tad harsh.</fullReview>

From Hanks accent, that strangely kept me awaiting his next dialogue sequence, to Wayan's over the top perpetuation of racial stereotypes, I found The Ladykillers to be worth the watch. If you're into spoofs of movies like "Mission Impossible" and those "Oceans" films you should find this at least a nice addition to your mental movie repertoire. Also, if you're a fan of Tom Hanks you should find this, though not the best of his movies, a real breach of character as he delves into murderous plots and dastardly schemes.

		<fullReview>Aside from there being an unidentified akilteredness to the film that kept it shy of a top rating, fans of the Coen brothers (eg Fargo and O Brother, Where Art Thou?) will love The Ladykillers, as will anyone who likes cutthroat highbrow humor.Character development of the assembled band of thieves is impressive. Usually there's a few standouts in the crew that get most of the attention. Not in The Ladykillers. You'll feel familiar with every one -- you may even care about a few by the end.Tom Hanks' dialog is Shakespearian--or should I say Poeesque--and impressive in its scope. The Wayans brother is comical and entertaining as the angry young black man. The Lady of the House could have stolen the show if the Coens would have allowed it.There are no-holds-barred racial slams; but are they really slams--or something more? This is the kind of movie you'll have to allow to marinate for awhile. At my first viewing about a year ago, it planted the seeds. Watching it again last night, the ideas blossomed. This is no insignificant piece of work. Look for the subtleties. Think Poe.You'll get down home small southern town charm aplenty. Much excellent gospel music from top notch church gospel singers. With the Coen edge pushing it beyond artistry and to a place where you don't know whether to laugh or feel uncomfortable, you may be surprised at who laughs last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Bros. Make This Ealing Classic Their Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Tom Hanks became our generation's James Stewart, it seems people have all but forgotten how good he can be at playing jerks and bounders. (For that matter, Stewart had a dark side he showed off well in the films of Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Mann...but I digress...) Bless Joel and Ethan Coen for giving Hanks an opportunity to unleash his inner scoundrel as they take the characters and ideas behind Ealing's classic 1955 Alec Guinness/Peter Sellers black comedy and make it completely, quirkily, and uproariously their own! Set in New Orleans this time, the Southern setting provides a wonderful opportunity for the Coens and scorer Carter Burwell to use gospel music and provide a delightful co-starring role for Irma P. Hall in the Katie Johnson role as the religious landlady who is as sharp and no-nonsense as she is innocent of the riverboat casino robbery that Hanks and his crew of larcenous loons are planning right there in her basement. Hall and Hanks play off each other sparklingly, and Marlon Wayans has some hilarious screen time with her as well, especially in a scene when Hall smacks Wayans every time he curses (and of course, with each slap he curses in pain, which begets more slaps. Then he chickens out when called upon to kill her, because she reminds him of his mother!). It's great fun to hear Tom Hanks essentially doing a better-dressed Foghorn Leghorn, and his able cast of scalawags is filled out nicely by Tzi Ma (THE QUIET American co-star shows his funny side here as a donut shop owner with a violent streak and a Hitler mustache), the hilarious J.K. Simmons (one of those actors who rarely looks the same from film to film -- as the demolition man whose Irritable Bowel Syndrome is his undoing, Simmons resembles nobody so much as Frank Cady of TV's GREEN ACRES, PETTICOAT JUNCTION, and Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW! :-), and Ryan Hurst (the big lug from REMEMBER THE TITANS, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and others doesn't get much to do besides look bewildered and musclebound, but he does it amusingly).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yahoo college comedy level of superior original - hopefully the Coen's lowest career point!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to be blunt (like the film itself): Let's hope this is the Coen Brother's lowest career point. A remake of the suave comedy thriller original from 1955 moves from England to Coen backyard territory: southern Mississippi. Hanks plays an odd, voluble leader of a motley criminal crew that schemes to rob a casino, using an old lady's house as a hideout and posing as classical musicians. When Hanks early on pratfalls out of a tree trying to bring down the old lady's cat, the level of the bar is set at slack-jawed... and sadly doesn't go up from there.This feels both rushed and surprisingly devoid of any ironic refinement that marked the original - which also ironically IS a Coen trademark! Instead it's packed with blunt stereotypes (just count them, one by one!), cheap slapstick and toilet jokes that could be lifted from any random yahoo college comedy. Another crucial element of the original - which has never felt better, by comparison - was making the old lady sweet and likable. Here, she's obnoxious, loud and bigoted to the point where I almost wanted to see her ditched!And if the moral of the story is: 16 million $ going to a bible school being a good thing... well, you won't see me going: "Amen" to that statement! Hanks gives a memorable performance, but that's about all that this tiresome misfire can put in its church collection booth.3 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake of the classic Ealing comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first, I have to admit, I was always going to be prejudiced against this film from the start as I am such a huge fan of the Alec Guinness original, but decided to give it a try as I am also a big fan of Tom Hanks.So, how can I put this politely...This is poor, a bad film and a cheap remake that is not up to the usual Coen Brothers standard. And that's me being nice. While the plot is based on the original and the characters have been lifted to a new setting and updated, as you would expect from a remake, they just don't work. The supporting players have none of the charm or menace of the originals, played by the likes of Herbert Lom or Peter Sellars, and are cheap fits to the remake mould. The roles have been rehashed into stereotypes that are played out for cheap laughs, such as the character "Pancake", as played by the hugely talented JK Simmons, having an irritable bowel so they squeeze in some cheap fart jokes. The whole thing just didn't seem to fit with any class and the characters didn't go together, which was a fundamental behind the idea of the gang being a musical group as a cover for their criminal activity.But the recasting of the sweet and innocent "Old Lady" as played by Katie Johnston in the 1955 version is a disaster. The whole premise of the original film is that the criminal gang are incapable of "bumping off" the lovable old dear, who defeats them by accident and charms everyone along the way. In contrast, I sympathised with the gang and wanted to kill Ms Munson, who you got the impression was the sharpest character in the film and one step ahead all the time. This is such a shame, as Irma Hall is not to blame and has some fine acting credentials, but the writers who shaped her character have given her nothing redeemable to work with and the film collapses around this central character.The acting of Hanks, who does well as southern gentleman-come-criminal Professor Dorr, was the only real highlight in a film that fell very short of my admittedly limited expectations. But then, as stated before, I was going to be biased from the start...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Loved Coen Brothers' Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best-loved films from the idiosyncratic British film studio Ealing Pictures gets an update from the equally idiosyncratic film making team of Joel and Ethan Coen in this offbeat comedy entitled,The Ladykillers. This black comedy film directed, written and produced by the Coen brothers and starring Tom Hanks, with a supporting cast that includes J. K. Simmons, Marlon Wayans, Tzi Ma, Ryan Hurst and Irma P. Hall. It is based on the 1955 British Ealing comedy film of the same title.If you've never enjoyed Alec Guinness in the classic 1955 British comedy that inspired it, the Coen brothers' remake of The Ladykillers may well prove hilarious. For starters, it's got Tom Hanks in a variation of the Guinness role, eccentrically channeling Colonel Sanders, Tennessee Williams, and Edgar Allan Poe in his southern-fried performance as Prof. Goldthwait Higgins Dorr, Ph.D., a deliciously verbose con man who needs a secret headquarters for his five-man plot to rob a riverboat casino moored on the Mississippi. In the film's funniest and least-caricatured role, Irma P. Hall plays the churchgoing widow who rents a room to Dorr, whose crew of "musicians" use the lady's root cellar to tunnel to the casino's cash-rich counting room. Rampant mishaps ensue, the body count rises among Dorr's band of idiots, and the Coens put their uniquely stylish stamp on everything. It's a funny movie, allowing for some nagging flatness to the material, but if you've seen the original, you'll eventually wonder what were they thinking? The Ladykillers is small and compact and it doesn't kill, it's just a doodle but it's a very pleasant cartoon for grown-ups. It's some sweet fodder.Also,despite cartoon characters, over-the-top hijinks, and occasional lapses of bad taste, any movie that leaves you laughing up the aisle, has to remain well-recommended.Hanks' performance in the lead role is inspired, but this is a relatively minor offering from the Coen brothers.While being far from the Coens' finest hour, it remains more intelligent and ambitious than most of what currently passes for Hollywood mainstream comedy.Finally,this film is good but not great and it is simple and somewhat funny plus 'nothing more.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst I can see why and that it's automatic for originals to be compared with remakes, it's probably only us not so old/oldies that would even have heard of, let alone seen the 1955 original. A half- century gap and it's not as if one can nip into Blockbuster and get an old black &amp; white Ealing comedy out.No, it's not as good as the Alexander Mackendrick directed movie but that's partly because Joel &amp; Ethan Coen haven't copied it, or even re- made it. On many fronts, it's a different film entirely. They obviously loved the original premise and have indelibly stamped their own black comedy and directorial flourishes onto it, plus some great twists at the end.Because, unlike the Ealing, it's set for comedy, it can only be so good, given the limitations. Comments about the robust, Southern black woman that the gang infiltrate, who is far too much of a tour de force for the film to work, are missing the point. SHE is the comedy, whilst the supporting cast add - or possibly detract from - the whole set-up. Moving it all from the East End to (I guess) the Mississippi makes it as American as it can be - can you envisage a timid, naive black woman playing that role? Similarly, our very English stereotype is that quaint old dear, who inadvertently becomes a hero.Anyways, the comedy for us Brits is hit and miss and too broad for many, which when mixed with the perceived messing with our National Treasure, make it sit even more awkwardly. I'm certainly not pro American but the Coen bros have made some very fine films - and while this certainly isn't one of those, it does deserve more credit than is often given.</fullReview>

Few artists dare to try to talk about ways of working toward redeeming what's wrong, because they'll look sentimental and naive to all the weary ironists. Irony's gone from liberating to enslaving." ? David Foster Wallace "The very concept of meaning is now outdated, nerdy, pre-ironic.

The plot: a band of thieves, led by arch villain Professor G. Dorr, worm their way into the home of an elderly woman, whose basement they intend to use as the staging ground for a daring robbery. Despite the elderly woman being oblivious to Dorr's sinister intentions, a series of freak, chance events foil the robbers, protecting the old woman from murder and leading to the deaths of the entire criminal gang. Through sheer luck, the old woman then inherits millions of dollars.Most of the remake's best visuals are derived from the 1955 film (the sight of men falling off bridges and into garbage trains becomes men falling off bridges into garbage boats), and the Coen's scripts sticks religiously close to the original. But the brothers do add several of their own personal touches. For example, Tom Hanks' super-villain becomes a cross between Colonel Sanders, Mark Twain and devilish Souther Gothic preacher men (see Robert Mitchum in "Cape Fear" and "Night of the Hunter"), whilst one character recalls Alec Guinness' Japanese foe in "The Bridge On The River Kwai" (Guinness starred in the original "Ladykillers"). The rest of the cast are likewise more collectibles than characters, including one woman who looks like a cross between Pippi Longstockings and Shirley Stoler.The Coens also swap London for the American South, and make an effort to capture the tone of Ray Bradbury ("Something Wicked This Way Comes"), Edgar Allen Poe ("The Raven"), Oscar Wilde ("The Picture of Dorian Gray") and various Southern Gothic horrors. It's a strange cocktail ? the classic tale of a slippery tongued devil infiltrating a Christian town...humorously gene-spliced with a KFC bucket - but they mostly pull it off.Thematically the film is typical of the Coens. All their films crash screwball with noir (noir being screwball without the comedy) and are exclusively about the world being "about" nothing other than random, cosmic causality. In this regard they consistently serve up a kind of chic nihilism, where audiences are invited to laugh as silly humans fall prey to the chaos of a wholly indeterministic universe. For the Coens, murder, pain, suffering, death, accidents, stress, crime and all manners of bad vice are deserved, the natural order which anyone stupid enough to tempt the dice must ultimately submit to. It's a kind of smart-alecky existentialism, where chance is the ultimate arbiter in life, fools, disengagement and inaction are rewarded over planners, action and schemers, and nothing makes any sense, is worth doing or looking at. Early Coen films, like "Where art Thou?" and "Barton Fink", even went so far as to deride socially conscious artists altogether. "Fck it, dude," is the Coen motto. Or as a title card in the Coens' "A Serious Man" reads, "receive with simplicity everything that happens". More than most directors, the Coens are resolutely postmodern. Their films are homages, copies of copies, comic book games of pastiche and robot replication. They tend to reject sincerity and their moral position is oft one of total absurdism; as everything is uncertain and ultimately hopeless, stop thinking, stop looking, stop being serious.Of course postmodernism's basic stance of hopelessness and apathy was born out of a sense that the project of human emancipation had failed. Rather than impose Rationality in a (futile) attempt to emancipate the whole of mankind, postmodern artists take a converse view where it is both meaningless and immoral to look larger than the immediate, local, personal, and typically selfish. When they do so, it is often with a sense of despair and hopelessness that manifests itself in cynicism, irony and contempt. Postmodernism is fundamentally a movement borne on anger, loathing, cynicism, hopelessness, resentment, and neurosis. Feelings that only come when you are at the bottom end of a power dynamic you have no chance in changing. And of course such a stance only reinforces the cause of the pain, rather than moving on towards any kind of reconciliation or reparation.But artists like the Coens don't only revoke sincerity, but completely redefine irony, or rather, focus only on one aspect of irony. Irony has been manipulated to echo postmodernism (isn't it ironic that a clever villain is foiled by a silly, religious black lady? Isn't it ironic that a serious man's seriousness can't save him?). Its entirely self-conscious stance precludes sincerity, sentiment, emoting of any kind, and thus has to rule out the existence of ultimate truth or moral certainty. Irony, in this context, is not there to lance a boil of duplicity, but rather to undermine sincerity altogether, to beggar the mere possibility of a meaningful moral position. In this sense it is indeed indivisible from cynicism. This isn't to say that "truth-seeking" irony has evaporated, it is just increasingly abandoned.7.9/10 ? Funny but too verbose.

		<shortDescription>not that magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not positively great, but not the worst either. I rented it a year or so ago, when I had my teeth pulled and was basically bed-ridden and sedated. Anyways, in that state, I couldn't have actually seen much of it, so I'll be a bit nicer. I was looking forward to something funny and light-hearted, as Tom Hanks is notorious for, but this was not what I was expecting. I'm not a prude when it comes to bad language, but it was a bit much. The point of a curse word is for it to have some effect on the person who hears it. There was so much bad language in this film, that it didn't even grab my attention anymore. It became monotonous.It looked promising, but after the first few minutes that the woman started talking and the professor was trying to trick her, i kind of fell asleep. When Marlon Wayans wasn't intensifying my toothache, the plot fell apart and everyone eventually died and fell in the garbage barge. Not that smooth a cover-up. It seemed a bit far-fetched to me. But then again, I never saw the original, so I can't compare the two. Irma. P. Hall dished out a few giggles, and Tom Hanks did a nice job , but most of the other players did not compare. All in all, go watch it if you want, but a bit overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven, mean-spirited mess slopped over great Hanks performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cohen brothers' remake of "The Ladykillers" has its good points, but they are overrun by by its bad ones. Tom Hanks gives a great performance as an over-loquacious southern flimflam man right out of an episode of "The Andy Griffith Show." It is his first flat out comic turn in many, many years, and it is wonderful to see that he is willing to still be funny after playing such a long line of painfully "good," and pretty damn bland, characters. But his well turned part is offset by an unnecessarily broad, crude, and manic performance by Marlon Wayans, who seems to think he's in another of his brother Keenan's "Scary Movie" slapstick parodies. A very tiny bit of his aggressive, bug-eyed, "nigga this, nigga that" routine goes a very long way.And the film-making is as uneven as the performances. For instance, the opening sequences which introduce the individual characters are off-putting, both in their crude content and in their scattershot execution. In other words the first fifteen minutes or so will leave you asking yourself "who are these people, what do they have to do with anything, and why is everyone yelling and swearing so much?" The opening is offset, however, by a typically lyrical, and funny, Cohen ending that I found very satisfying (in fact, I suspect they came up with the ending first and worked backwards).All in all this is one of those movies that has enough good points that its glaring and all-too-avoidable missteps really kind of p*ss you off.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks isn't acting, he's showing off,and completely overshoots what he probably had in mind. the old lady ... well, how can you develop sympathy for a character that is quite simply the perfect example of why euthanasia should be legalized? The rest of the cast : same problem. we all see what kind of performance they want to achieve, but somehow all of it is overdone, thus setting the wrong tone for the entire movie. a word to the coen brothers : take a break. no more remakes, no more "project" movies, try to recapture whatever it was that made you guys make "The Big Lebowski" "Fargo" "Barton Fink" (and yes, even) "The Hudsucker Proxy" because all of those are waaaaaay better than the infantile sludge of a movie i just watched on DVD. 3.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought a Tom Hanks film would be good. This one wasn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three generations attended a showing of this movie, thinking that with a movie starring Tom Hanks and a possibly funny plot as shown on TV trailers, we would be well entertained. ALL three generations were totally disappointed, with the two persons from the oldest generation walking out of the showing when the R-rated language of Marlon Wayans' character seemed to go on and on. Don't go to this movie if you don't like gutter language. Even if you can put up with that (I suffered through it just to see if the movie would get any better and learn how it would turn out), there was little to redeem the movie besides the characters played by Hanks and Irma P. Hall, and the interesting ending. But I can't say it was worth sitting through all the rest to see the ending. My daughter, from the youngest generation comments, as follow:As a 22-year-old college senior, I've seen a lot of good movies in my day, but "Ladykillers" certainly isn't one of them. Tom Hanks does a phenomenal job in the role of the educated PhD professor, with the convincing accent and exquisite demeanor. The movie's "plot," however, did not truly get started until well after I was praying that sleep would overcome me. I must also mention the unnecessary profanity, which possibly stole about 40% of the entire dialogue. So, in conclusion, other than the last 15 or 20 minutes (which did bring a quite clever ending to this film) and the mere fact that Tom Hanks was the star (who is, in my opinion, quite an exceptional actor) nothing much more can be said in this movie's defense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY Underrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised by the low scores for this movie. I passed on it in the theaters but decided to give it a go on DVD rental and was pleasantly taken into this plot line and all its characters. It's one of "those" movies that has the right level of comedy in the right places. I could do with a little less vulgar language (it seemed excessive at times) but overall, the movie is a great clash of different character types thrown together in a comedy stew. The Mississippi location and soundtrack really work in bringing this title to life. Hanks does a good job of playing that southern gentleman bent on thievery. His motley crew really drives this movie and how incompatible they all really are. The dumbest criminal (the musclehead) is - in some ways - the smartest, the toughest (Wayans) ends up being the weakest and the smartest (Hanks) is ultimately done in. Great movie and worth a second watching. My wife pointed out that the demolitions guy was really the only weak link in the group/plan. His constant mistakes are what caused the operation to go south (and not just talking about his IBS :) Overall, great little gem of a movie that deserves better mention on here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and fun, but that's not really enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similarly to the uneven Intolerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers, a remake of an Ealing classic starring Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers, started as a simple writing gig for the Coen brothers (their former cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld was going to direct), before becoming a lot more. Once again, it's not an entirely successful affair, but it does have its moments - not least the joy of seeing Joel and Ethan share their directing and producing credits for the first time.In their attempt to re-imagine the 1955 Brit comedy, the brothers have relocated the action from England to Mississippi. Unusually, coming from them, this means the picture is replete with black stereotypes, all of which are strongly frowned upon by the good-hearted, "hippity-hop"-hating Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall), a widow who earns her living by renting a room in her house. One day, that room is taken by Professor G.H. Dorr (Tom Hanks), a verbally gifted, Poe-obsessed lecturer-cum-musician who requests to use the basement for band practice. In reality, his four "co-players" (J.K. Simmons, Marlon Wayans, Tzi Ma and Ryan Hurst) are crooks assigned to help him with an ingenious heist: the old lady's basement is the starting point of the tunnel they will use to access the vault of a casino. A perfect con, assuming Mrs. Munson doesn't find out...The film's title is a pretty clear indication of what will occur in the third act, and such a premise means a welcome return to the Coen brothers' darker roots after the considerably lightweight Intolerable Cruelty. The creepy atmosphere contrasts nicely with the Gospel music that permeates the soundtrack, and Roger Deakins' cinematography gives us a very charming portrait of a slightly retro Mississippi. And then there's Hanks, who obviously enjoyed working with the Coens and does one of his best comedic jobs as the eloquent but ultimately hollow Dorr. If only the supporting cast were as good: Hurst and Ma are practically useless, standing in the background as the action unfolds; Wayans tries to do a better version of his dope-head from Scary Movie and, not surprisingly, fails; Hall, who mysteriously won a Jury Award in Cannes for her performance, is pretty imposing but too earthy to really fit in (so maybe there's a point in dismissing the Coens' work as cold). Thankfully, Simmons, a veteran of the brothers' pal Sam Raimi, plays his demented part to his strengths, even managing to make an otherwise cheap IBS joke funny.Final verdict: Never exactly a pure Coen triumph, but worth catching for the fun premise, quirky mood and fresh double act between Hanks and Simmons. If that 's not enough, there's always that other Mississippi yarn, O Brother, Where Art Thou?.7,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was could be called a barely adequate movie, but Wayans' screeching profanity simply made this a joke. Possibly the Coens' including Wayans in the cast paid off a bet, or fulfilled a deathbed promise to a dying relative, but for whatever reason, Marlon Wayans brought ab-so-lute-ly nothing to the table.The original "Ladykillers" was something I was lucky enough to have seen when I was just a pup, and I own the Alec Guinness DVD collection. "Ladykillers", "Lavender Hill Mob", and other classic Ealing comedies did much to shape(or warp) my sense of humour. I love "Something About Mary", and "Fargo", and until "Jersey Girl", the View Askew movies, so I'm not real conservative, but for my money, Donald Rumsfeld is funnier than Marlon Wayans....and way scarier</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen some awful turkeys in my time, but this little epic was quite possibly the worst movie it has ever been my misfortune to watch. When I saw the coming attractions last year in the movie theater, I was intrigued. Not enough maybe to see it at the movies, but enough to rent the video. Well! I have always loved Tom Hanks, but this - this verbiose, nasty, psychopathic creature that he played - it was wayyyyyy over the line. I could not understand half the things he said. Unfortunately I could understand almost every word that Wayans said...and with my 7 year old grandson in the room! Look, I use "language" along with the rest of the world...in its place - but what Marlon Wayans did was unnecessary and overkill. The other characters were for the most part fair...but Wayans and Hanks portrayals just destroyed what could have been a great movie. I have never seen the original, I really don't care that the Coens changed the setting from England to the deep South...they could have set it in Timbuktu for all I care!! I wasn't expecting Hanks to become Obi-Wan either...but I was expecting to be entertained...and I can tell you I was NOT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And a Wayans brother has blown yet another movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Ladykillers is one of those rare comedy classics that's not really funny anymore, like The Odd Couple. But it is smartly made and it respects itself and its audience. It's a dark comedy but it's a smart one, it has colorful characters who move through the movie in pursuit of questionable goals and suffer through lots of hilarious mishaps along the way. Sure, they're not funny, but you have to appreciate the situational humor involved. Like the original film, the 2004 remake focuses on a strange ensemble of characters each in it for the money, no one knows anyone else outside the group, and the leader thinks he has everything planned out to the most minute detail until everything that can possibly go wrong goes wrong at every turn.I remember when The Ladykillers came out in theaters, where I never had the chance to see it, and I remember being genuinely surprised to see that the Dawn of the Dead remake was getting better reviews than this, the latest Tom Hanks movie. I just don't associate Tom Hanks with movies that get lesser acclaim than remakes of 80s horror films. Then I saw the Dawn of the Dead remake and I understood why it was getting better reviews. Now I've seen The Ladykillers and I understand even more. Tom Hanks, as is to be expected, delivers a spot-on performance as an intellectual from the deep south, brilliantly pulling off not only the accent but the demeanor and earthily classy mannerisms as well. Not that I'm some expert on the deep south, but consider his introduction into the film, when he knocks on Mrs. Munson's door and reluctantly pursues her escaped cat ('Won't the cat eventually pine for its masters affections and return of its own initiative?'). I love stuff like that. You don't just come up with dialogue like that, it takes a lot of talent to enhance the complexity of a simple sentence like that. The film has started off on the right foot.And then, of course, you have Marlon Wayans, the most catastrophic casting decision in the entire film by far. I'm confused by his impressive performance in Requiem For A Dream, because in every other movie I've ever seen him involved with he has been an absolute disaster. His ridiculous character screaming mind-numbing streams of profanity single handedly ruined this movie, the Scary Movies, which he wrote, are some of the worst, most sickening slop I've ever seen recorded on film, and Senseless and White Chicks are two movies that I am determined never to see. I'll watch a movie even if I know it's going to be a disaster (I've seen all three Scary Movies, for example), but this time I'm putting my foot down. I can't even IMAGINE sitting through White Chicks, and no amount of curiosity about the formation of Marlon Wayans' idiot iconography will persuade me to watch Senseless. I'm struggling not to swear off on sight anything that he is ever involved with again.Look at Jamie Foxx, for example, another actor whose career sprung from the dregs of television, In Loving Color. He's certainly been in his share of tasteless roles, but has built up his career to the point where he is generating Oscar buzz for his massive performance in the upcoming Ray, not to mention other great films like Ali, Collateral and, to a slightly lesser extent, Redemption. Wayans is still running around acting like a complete moron in ridiculous roles like this one, single-handedly destroying what should have been a classy and clever remake of a classic. Then again, maybe it's unfair to compare Jamie Foxx and Marlon Wayans, since Wayans could never hope to possess the tiniest fraction of the talent that Foxx has, but you have to have your limits. Never in my life have I seen a Tom Hanks movie that made it so easy to picture him trying to hide his face at the premiere.What kind of a turn is this for the Coen brothers, who generally have characters so rich and interesting that they overshadow most of the rest of the film? Their movies are not about their stories, they're about the characters. In this film, every single character is a cliché. The stolid general, the idiot jock literally without a thought in his head, the ludicrous MacSam (Wayans) who is nothing but a spewing fountain of profanity and a direct insult to the African American audience, one character is even defined by his having irritable bowel syndrome. I really expect more from the Coens, who we have to thank for such masterpieces as Raising Arizona, Fargo, The Big Lebowski and O, Brother, Where Art Thou?(spoilers) Wayans' brain-dead performance is thankfully outweighed slightly by the strength of Mrs. Munson's character, but unfortunately her character is also a turn from the point of the original film, from which most of the humor was derived. That movie wasn't even very funny, so I would think that every effort possible would be made to maintain the comedy, much of which came from the situation of a lot of men trying to pull a fast one on a sweet little old lady, but who catches on to their game and ends up in control of everything. In this version, you have a lot of men trying to sneak around Mrs. Munson as though she were their mother. She is smarter and stronger than all of them, which removes the irony of their defeat and a large foundation of the comedy in the story. Then the Coens tried to make up for that loss by writing a character like MacSam and succeed only in digging the hole deeper.The Coen brothers have teamed their powerful directing and writing skills with the astronomical talents of Tom Hanks, and thanks in large part to a typical Wayans performance, they have indeed laid a multi-million dollar egg. Miss it.</fullReview>

Well that's how I felt after watching this trash. I reluctantly went to see this with some mates thinking it wouldn't be all that bad seeing as it had Tom Hanks in it being a funny-man for once. But after seeing this I couldn't believe I'd even paid to see it. I didn't laugh at one thing in it (and I always have something to laugh at during a comedy even if it's a really bad one). It featured the most annoying performance by Tom Hanks and an even worse film by Marlon Wayans. Now unusually I'm not at all bothered at language in a film but the amount of F***'s by Wayans was just plain stupid. Terrible script. The only really funny thing about this movie was the fact that I paid ?3.95 to see it. That and how unfunny it was.

		<shortDescription>Not so successful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the classical movie (1955) by Alexander Mackendrick of the same title. There it was a bank robbery which is planned and executed while here it's the planning an execution of a floating casino one. The British atmosphere is here replaced (let's say in passing with some success) by the Mississippi southern one with its typical people and the old Victorian landlady by an old typical black lady. This is not the weakest part of the movie and we must also stress the excellent performances of Tom Hanks and Irma P. Hall as the "professor" who leads the gang of robbers and the landlady who lodges him and his disguised "quintet" of musicians who are "rehearsing" Renaissance compositions. Nevertheless the succession of less convincing and somewhat artificial scenes withdraws most of the movie's possible funny side mainly if we compare it with the corresponding scenes of the classical movie of which this one is a remake. The final succession of gags by which the problem of the robbed money is solved is too hasty and a bit forced even if we must take for granted that a comedy is not to respect fully the logics of reality. Summing it up, it's a movie that amuses you a bit but has some flaws in its "mise en sc?ne" that compromise its possible success and its classification as a good movie.</fullReview>

The setting, characters, and plot details have been changed enough that it feels like more than a remake. The expository scenes are not funny, but there are plenty of chuckles later, particularly the exchanges between old white liberal Simmons and black punk Wayans. Hanks plays the leader of the gang in the same vein as Alec Guinness in the original. However, the character of the widow is changed considerably, not necessarily for the better. Ultimately, it's not as good as the original but a worthwhile diversion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a time in my film watching life when I would have said that there's no such thing as a bad Coen brothers movie. Five years ago I may have debated the subject. After seeing The Lady Killers I have retracted that earlier statement completely. I'll list a few basic issues:1.The film has no idea what year it's in. I'm fine with a film like Huddsucker Proxy where the language and hammy acting is circa 1940's and the art design and subject is a little more 1950's, but the Coen's have the creative license and use it well. This film's timeframe seems to haphazardly jump around the last 5 decades.2.The Coen brothers usually have awide array of clever, unique characters shaped from the rich material of the culture Americana. Here we get paper thin stereotypes who's shallowness impells the cast to overact in order to compensate. Everyone looks so psyched to be in a Coen brothers film since they've seen what it's done for their peers in the past yet they're desperate with little to work with.3.This film is not only bad, it's a bit offensive with it's cheap racial humor and vulgar jokes about flatulence and bowels. Now I can appreciate a good fart joke or Mel Brooks or Richard Pryor movie, but this stuff was below bad TV sketch comedy. It's as if the Coen brothers are trying to make themselves accessible to the audience that likes 'Friday' and 'Harold &amp; Kumar Go To WhiteCastle' I enjoy those movies, but the Coen Brothers have usually been in a class by themselves. If this is your first Coen brothers film, forget you saw it and start from their beginning and stop after their first couple of Academy Awards. That's when they started getting soft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It tried to be serious at times but ended up too funny to be serious. The quirky character by Tom Hanks is probably one of the Coens' best ones, he is well-developed, humorous, and weird-looking. The rest of the cast is also one of the best ensemble of the Coens' career: stupid, Chinese, bowel issues, and black. Now the story may be used many times before but the writers obviously did some tweaks to it that made it so original. The script isn't perfect, in fact, it is probably a lower level script of the Coens' career. But I think that the film showed more of the directing side of the brothers than the writing side. The imaginative scenes, the cat, and the teeth all demonstrate how well they can transform simple things into beauty. The Ladykillers isn't better than the original and it is definitely flawed, but Tom Hanks' likable character and the bold directing made the film worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Coen Bros. Film I'll Pay Money to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie that tries to be cool, from cool, "with it" filmmakers. It's just adolescent trash. I could get more reading the toilet walls at the downtown bus station. The took a good story (original) and trashed it with their "creative" skills. It writtenby unknown filmmakers it never would have beeen produced, as anyone reasing the script would realize how bad it is. I'm especially disappointed with Tom Hanks, taking on such an unrealistic, cartoonish character. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this, so far for me the Coen Brothers have never put a foot wrong, I admire Tom Hanks' work and have no problems with updating what is a classic of the British cinema. Woe is me, was better that they should have left it alone. Where the original has charm and gentle humour, this is utterly charmless, overacted, and with far too much gratuitous use of foul language. Where there should be an edge of tension, a sense of foreboding, we have hammy Mr Hanks, who, knowing he is following the immortal Alec Guiness, should have tried harder. He twitches, pulls faces, sucks on his false teeth and completely fails to denote any sinister air whatsoever. One isn't exactly sure if he really knows what the part is about. As for his "crew", to be perfectly honest, the least said the better, I did find the bad language hard to take though. The sweet little old lady isn't. One really wonders what on earth they were thinking of - do yourself a favour and give this the old body swerve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a Coen Brothers film, his ranks as a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there a Hollywood tandem that is more misinterpreted or under appreciated than the director brother team of Ethan and Joel Coen? Over the years, their filmography has included an eclectic group of entries that have introduced us to some of the strangest characters this side of a David Lynch television special. Remember how weird Barton Fink was when we first me him? How strange was the musical number featuring the Dude in The Big Lebowski? And was there any better way of watching Raising Arizona than alone and under an influence? Add to the mix their more popular entries like O Brother Where Art Thou, Fargo and Blood Simple, and you have a brother team that has given us one unique vision after another for the past 20 years. In fact, their style has attracted some of Hollywood's A-list talent including Jeff Bridges, George Clooney and Nicholas Cage. So when their 2004 film remake of The Ladykillers was announced, it was not much of a surprise that none other than Mr. Revered Tom Hanks attached himself to the project in the starring role. I will admit to not having seen the original Ladykillers starring Alec Guinness, but I don't think I am at a loss due to this oversight. The 2004 edition stars Hanks as Professor G.H Dorr, a refined gentleman with a southern droll that enlists the aide of four other misfits in effort to steal money from the Riverside casino vault. Their plan is simple. First, Dorr rents a room from an elderly black woman (Irma P. Hall), and then under the guise of a band practice, the group beings to tunnel from the basement of the house to the casino's counting room. Simple right? Not with this cast of morons, and never ever ever in a Coen film. To understand the obstacles, we must first understand the dynamics of the group. There is the explosives expert, Garth (J.K. Simmons) who seems both confident and careless at the same time. There is The General (Tzi Ma), a chain-smoking Asian responsible for tunneling to the riverside. We have the token black guy in Gawain (Marlon Wayans) and finally, the dunce Lump (Ryan Hurst) who is hired more for his brawn than his brain. Together, they complete a team of would-be criminals that couldn't be more different in their personalities or character traits than the cast of Survivor All-Stars.The heist in itself is ingenious, but before long, the intangible comes into play in the character of Irma P. Halls' Marva Munson. Marva is a church going individual who doesn't stand for foul language, violence or even smoking. The thought of a group of men hiding out in her basement seems to intrigue her, and her interest in their matters will soon lead to a discussion within the group on how best to deal with Ms. Munson. The rest of the movie, without spoiling it for you wanna-seers, surrounds the groups efforts to dig the tunnel and steal the money all the while trying to hide their intended scheme from the curious old lady up the stairs.In the hands of the Coen's, The Ladykillers shaped up to be one of this years must sees. Unfortunately, the end result left much of the audience trying to gauge their eyes out or at the very least, scratching their heads wondering where it all went wrong. But it's not for lack of trying. Neither is it one specific thing that brought the movie down to a two star rating. The story was interesting if not original, and the black humor of the Coen's was present in every other scene. Garth's problem with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) was a bit too hokey for my tastes, but generally, it does look like everyone was having fun. The issue might be in the director's indecision as to the type of movie he was trying to make. Was it a heist film? A comedy? It would almost have worked as a good family type caper had it not been for the Gawain character that spews off mother f****ers often enough to issue the film a Restricted rating. This lack of a truly defined direction left me with a feeling that all the ideas were just thrown into a melting pot and this was the result. There are good scenes and bad, but the end result leaves a stale taste in your mouth (which could have been the popcorn, I must concede).One thing that did take my notice is the films' deaths. And there are a handful. The Coen's have always brought us memorable demises (remember the Wood Chipper in Fargo?), and in Ladykillers, as the members fall to the hands of their own greed one by one, they are offed in a way that made me laugh and was unique enough to go on their wall of accomplishments alongside the flood in O Brother Where Art Thou or Dan Hedaya in Blood Simple.So if I was forced to watch the film history of the Coen's, I would have to put this film towards the bottom just above Intolerable Cruelty. Tom Hanks may have tried to stretch our his dynamically changing characters film-to-film just one step too far. His southern drawl and eccentric Professor G.H Dorr may not be one of the characters that he looks fondly upon when we are doing Hank's retrospectives 25 years from now. And if he doesn't?why should we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but not the Coen's best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers are undoubtedly the best film makers of all time. Making classics such as Millers Crossing, Fargo, The Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona, here comes their newest work. Bearing a great cast (Irma P. Hall, Marlon Wayans and the magnificent Tom Hanks) this was bound to be a box office success. I'd be surprised if it wasn't (I can't remember!) Because this is just so funny.Tom Hanks plays the lead role as a con man who gathers together a dunderheaded group of misfits to rob a bank. Choosing a harmless old lady's basement as the escape and entrance route may be a little sour, but this film is definitely for the light hearted. It's not particularly politically incorrect (well, except for the swearing) this film may not be everybody's cup of tea, but it was mine. Not great, and not up to scratch with the 1955 classic, this is probably worth a rental, but I wouldn't impulsively buy it straightaway-I'd view it first. It may be the Coens Brothers, but compared to efforts such as The Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona, this falls short. Still good fun, however.Overall: ***/ out of ***** (3 and a half out of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of thieves disguised as musicians hiding out in a sweet old lady's house sounds like a pretty hysterical premise for a movie, and Alec Guiness proved it was in the original film.The new version, however, only demonstrates how you can start out with a great premise and completely destroy it.While Hank's performance was funny, it certainly didn't out way all the foul language and meaningless interludes that were supposed to "modernize" the movie. The director and/or writers obviously missed the point and charm of the other movie.If you like the sound of the plot, don't see this movie, stick with the classic.

		<shortDescription>An awful, dreadful, unfunny mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose it's a sign of how low Hollywood has sunk when the usually wonderful Coen Brothers resort to remakes. Actually, calling the Coens' "The Ladykillers" an awful, dreadful, unfunny mess is being unkind to films that are really awful, dreadful and unfunny.This remake ranks right alongside Gus Van Sant's "Psycho" as the worst remake of a classic. The Coens have taken a marvelously droll and brilliantly understated and charming black comedy and turned it into a broad, charmless and crude excuse for a comedy.Tom Hanks hams it the whole way. There's not a single funny moment in his entire performance. He could win the Best Actor Oscar every year for the next 25 years and wouldn't amount to half the superb actor Sir Alec Guinness was. And as much as I like Irma P. Hall, the Coens got her character completely wrong.What made the original so good was sweet Mrs. Wilberforce's (played by the incomparable Katie Johnson) naivete and vulnerability. The Coens have transformed her into a tough-talking woman without an ounce of vulnerability, and the story loses all its charm and humor. Hall's character just doesn't work in this story.Marlon Wayans grates as the foul-mouthed "inside man" - unable to extract any humor from their remake, the Coens resort to Wayans spewing profanity pretty much in every line of dialogue. I have no problem with profanity, but here it's just not funny. And where the profanity doesn't work, the Coens believe bathroom humor will, by giving a character Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This is what Ethan and Joel have been reduced to. The guys who've given us some of the best films in the last 20 years have sunk to this level?The Coens' film has only two minor things going for it: a) a lovely cat named Pickles and b) a terrific gospel soundtrack. Save yourself the trouble - buy the soundtrack CD and rent Alexander Mackendrick's original on DVD. It's only March and the Coens have already given us one of the worst films of the year. We can only hope they got the remake bug out of their system. Unless, of course, since they are, after all, the Coens, they're planning on remaking "The Bicycle Thief" - in color, because De Sica didn't get it quite right the first time.</fullReview>

And I cherish Coen period pieces.Hank's work is great here, great, as is Wayan's, but something is just off.. I really don't see Tom Hanks as a good fit to the Coen bullpen, nor Simmons really.Look, even a weaker Coen Bros. film is better than most other's strongest efforts.

		<shortDescription>Kills more than just ladies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen's attempt to recover from the disaster that was Intolerable Cruelty by jabbing at the 1955 black comedy by Alexander Mackendrick resulted in what I believe to be their worst movie.Tom Hanks plays a charming Southern professor who rents a room from landlady Marva Munson, (Irma P. Hall) who isn't aware of him and his crew's plan to rob a casino underground right under her nose. But they aren't quite aware of just how observant she is.This film is so awkward, which I understand was a main intention, but awkward in an annoying way. Casting Tom Hanks, Tzi Ma, and JK Simmons is one thing, but casting Marlon Wayans in an adaptation of this classic? Cmon! Not even the good actors can save it. J.K. Simmons is completely suppressed and annoying, Tzi Ma just says nothing and eats cigarettes all day, and Tom Hanks in his possible worst performance ever snickers and snorts like a pig five different times, as if it's supposed to be an interesting trait of his.The tone is very off putting. It's a goofy light comedy with cheesy, fake characters, while at the same time having people getting blown up and hung. It's all over the place. Erma Hall as the landlady is very entertaining in her scenes and very commanding in her role, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Unfortunately, we don't get much of her. Instead we get forced humor with repetitive gags. To be fair, I wasn't expecting this to be good, but I wasn't expecting to hate it this much. The moment Marlon Wayans robs a store and gets lifted up by his nostrils, I just wanted to cry. The scene where J.K. Simmons blows himself up while testing an explosive on the wall was actually a pretty fun scene to see the house shake from the outside, until we see he loses nothing but a finger in that huge explosion. I know it's a comedy, but in a film like this, suspension of disbelief doesn't apply.Overall, this film is atrocious, not just for a Coen's film, just in general. I'm glad this is as bad as it gets for them because if it got worse, then I'd question their motives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ladykillers (2004): An Incredible Must-See Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2004 remake of The Ladykillers deserves far more attention than it received from some mainstream media critics. This charming film benefits from excellent writing, beautiful cinematography and first rate acting and directing. The use of themes in the film to contrast good and evil makes this remake worthy fare for church groups, community groups and family viewing (although some characters use coarse language that might offend some viewers, the use of the expletives fits the plot and furthers one of the themes of the film).One of this re-make movie's virtues, absent in the original, revolves around the character of the kind hearted Marva Munson, a devout elderly lady with a will of iron, a hot temper and a heart of gold. She epitomizes the strength that surrounds innocence and purity of spirit. The talented Irma P. Hall portrays this character vibrantly. She deserves acclaim for her memorable performance in the film. Tom Hanks as the conniving, pedantic scholar Professor G. H. Dorr also deserves acclaim for his work in this re-make. Unbelievable circumstances in the plot gain credibility through his impressive characterization of a talented man overpowered by the forces of greed.Marlon Wayans as Gawain MacSam also delivers a stunning, sensitive performance. His talent emerges as the events of the film unfold. Although his character displays some negative qualities, the audience develops affection for him. Portraying a complex character so effectively demonstrates great talent. Performances by others, including J.K. Simmons as Garth Pancake, Tzi Ma as The General and Ryan Hurst as Lump Hudson all deserve very high praise.The film makes excellent use of its locale, with captivating imagery that furthers the symbolism in the script. If this film did not garner Oscar nominations, it really deserved that credit. Watch this gem of a movie if you want to see an entertaining, humorous adventure with substance.</fullReview>

However my favorite character in the film was Garth Pancake, that part was cast perfectly and that character was hysterical. Everything he said that was the "easiest thing in the world" was actually really hard and ended up crashing down and blowing up in there face and it was a laugh riot. It's been a while since I had a good laugh and this film gave me a couple good laughs and I'm glad to have gotten them. The only character I did not like was the Wayne's brother he wasn't needed he added nothing and did nothing, but cuss and act out.

		<fullReview>A wonderful remake of the original from 1955 by Alexander Mackendrick. The story is now placed in a more recent era, in the American south, with a pretty different set of characters. Even though I prefer the original, this one is still one of the best comedies by the Coens.A lot comes down to whether or not one likes the characters and I, well, I just love love love them. Tom Hanks plays Goldthwait Higginson Dorr perfectly and of course Irma P. Hall does a cracking job of portraying Marva Munson. But there is not one other character that is out of place here; The General, Pancake and his Mountain Girl, Lump, Gawain, you name 'em, they're being portrayed with a perfect sense of (black / slapstick / over the top) comedy.The unfolding of the story follows that of the original closely, but the Coens still manage to put in their own original ideas and twists, again, with a perfect sense of (black / slapstick / over the top) comedy.A big 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of films in terms of structure or pace, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Professor G.H Dorr (Tom Hanks) responds to an advert where an old lady Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall) is advertising for a room to let at her home. However, he has an ulterior motive and intends to rob a casino located close to Marva's house. Dorr recruits a ensemble team to assist in the heist which will start in Marva's cellar. They use the pretence that they are a group of musicians and make Marva believe that they are practicing in her cellar. Although Marva is unsuspecting at first a serious of mishaps cause her to become more and more suspicious of this bunch of 'musicians'.Having not seen the original film, I'm going to have to just stick to reviewing this film and I must admit that I did find it very enjoyable on the whole. There were some minor issues I did have with this film; I didn't think it was particularly well paced; I felt the set-up was perhaps a little long given the fact that it has a relatively straight-forward plot, there were also odd occasions when the film seemed to have unnecessary deviations away from the main plot. The introduction of Mountain Girl also seemed rather pointless to me as her character added very little to the film. However, these were very minor problems and didn't cause too many problems whilst I was watching the film.The cast were all good here, but particular praise should go to Hanks &amp; Hall; I've no idea what the original film was like, but the Coen's have given this a 'black comedy' feel to it and it works really well. Hanks enhances this effect by giving Dorr a creepy and weird feel to his character and at times he does give you that 'cringe' feel when watching him on screen - this is meant as a compliment and is a testament to both Hanks as an actor and the Coen's as writers. Hall is also very good here and manages to give her character a sort of na?ve charm, but she's also quite ballsy and has no problem in keeping the men in line. Her comic timing &amp; delivery was also fantastic. Tzi Ma doesn't speak much here, but he actually manages to be funny more for what he does than what he says but he does get some funny lines as well. Simmons &amp; Wayans are both good for the most part and their constant squabbling and one upmanship was pretty funny to watch. On occasions, Wayans was close to crossing the line between being funny and being annoying, but I think he just about gets away with it here. Hurst for the most part is just the clichéd lumbersome jock although like Ma, the Coens do treat him to some good one liners.Like many Coen brothers film, the film is also excellent from a technical basis with editing, direction, score and cinematography all being superb.As mentioned, I haven't seen the original version of The Ladykillers, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed this Coen brothers remake. The characters are inherently quirky (as they are in most Coen brothers films). When it hits it is incredibly funny - it's very rare that I laugh out loud when watching any comedy, but this film achieved that result on a few occasions. The cast were all terrific with Hall &amp; Hanks being notable standouts. Simply put this is a wonderful black comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment from talented people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ladykillers" is a black comedy directed by the Cohen Brothers and featuring a terrific cast so it should have been money in the bank, but something must have gone wrong along the way because it's not particularly funny. The film is about a group of criminals who want to rob a casino by tunneling into the building's vault. To do this, their leader "Professor" Goldwaite Higgins Dorr (Tom Hanks) rents a room from an elderly widow named Mrs. Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall). Under the pretense of band practices several days a week, Dorr invites over his "friends" Lump (the muscle, played by Ryan Hurst), "The General" (a tunneling expert, play by Tzi Ma), Garth Pancake (J. K. Simmons as the demolitions expert) and Gawain (Marlon Wayans as the inside man) they spend the evening digging towards the tunnel. As the criminals get closer to their ill-earned goods, trouble arises not only because the widow grows suspicious, but from the group itself. In this case, there's little honor among thieves.It's difficult to pin-point why the film overall doesn't work, but a big part of it are the characters. Most, like "The General" and Lump are basically one-joke characters that get very little dialog. Even the others who get more scenes to clearly define their personality are mostly identifiable by their single joke. About halfway into the film we learn that Pancake has irritable bowel syndrome, so in pretty much every single scene we see him in from then on, he has to go to the bathroom. Even the mastermind Dorr feels more like long strings of articulate, elaborately-woven Southern Dandy-speak than an anti-hero you can follow with glee. None of these would be a problem if the movie was genuinely funny but isn't. I actually found it to be quite annoying. Most of the characters are so bumbling that I knew there was going to be one thing that would go catastrophically bad after another so I found it predictable in that way. I did find some genuine laughs here and there (like when Pancake makes an argument for worker's compensation) but that never counterbalanced the endless, irritating scenes where I had to listen to Tom Hanks and Marlon Wayans talking constantly. I had some real problems with the ending as well, which comes in so quickly it feels like an afterthought. The film doesn't feature any particularly inspired cinematography and the story is just OK. I wish there was more to say, but it's a comedy that's competently made, except for the fact that there's nothing about it that stands out and there aren't enough laughs to keep the film afloat.The most frustrating thing about "The Ladykillers" is that everything about it should have worked. We have a great cast, talented directors and a good premise, but it's probably the worst of the Coen Brother's films. It's not unwatchable and I can see some people actually liking it quite a bit but I can't really recommend it. (Full screen version DVD, January 26, 2014)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A largely-overlooked, forgotten later entry in the Coen brothers' catalog, though that might just be for a reason. At a glance, it's got all the hallmarks; a strong, curiously mixed cast; one wacky, dark-hinged plot; heaping portions of personality and charisma; tons of ambling, how-did-that-work dialog. But despite the familiar recipe, it never really comes together. There's a decided lack of magnitude to things, as if we've spent the entire running time waiting for some sort of revelation - an air of quiet respite that never departs. It's at once wicked and silly, both Coen staples, but superficially so. I don't think I'd snicker nearly as often on a second viewing. In some ways, it feels like an especially long SNL sendup of the auteurs' well-known idiosyncrasies. Tom Hanks certainly feels like he's playing a glaringly colorful caricature in the lead role, tackling an out-of-time southern gentleman as if he were Colonel Sanders. Supporting efforts from JK Simmons, Marlon Wayans and Tzi Ma are no less flamboyant, nor less frivolous. At worst I'd call it gaudy, shallow and watery, though not irredeemably so. At best? A spicy little caper picture, speckled with immeasurable quirks, that's light and swift at heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ladykillers is an eccentric film but very heavy on humor and witty dialogue. It's a shame people didn't like this as much as I did, because I was just howling in laughter throughout the entire film especially at the slapstick and extremely sharp dialogue. This is certainly a Coen Brothers film, perhaps not their greatest, but still a wonderful addition to their filmography.The Coen Brothers directed a film about how a man named Professor Dorr assembles a team of criminals to rob a casino by creating a tunnel in the basement of an old lady. But when she suspects something, they all agree she must be terminated.I never thought I would like a film that would pair up Tom Hanks and Marlon Wayans. But there have been weirder things in life and they ended doing well together. Hanks, of course is a genius actor and was really funny. Wayans was a little annoying, but was funny for the most part. J.K Simmons was easily the best of Tom's criminal gang and his one-liners are hilarious. Finally, Irma Hall was excellent with a fluid comedic performance. Hippity-Hop music, anyone? Overall, The Ladykillers is a genius film directed by a talented pair of brothers. This is not their best, but this is prime entertainment and I was very amused throughout the film. Lots of witty one-liners is what makes this film so funny. I also must mention Roger Deakin's cinematography skills. The movie was shot very well, especially for a comedy. It sounds like people were expecting perfection, but while not perfect, it's still comedy gold. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers have had an extraordinary career carving out their own niche beyond Hollywood's borders in Indieville. Gems like "Fargo" and "The Big Lebowski" remain eminently watchable but not what you'd call mainstream. So a remake of a much-loved Ealing comedy might have seemed like a safe bet to the brothers but alas, the gentle charm and innocence of the original has been lost in a whirlwind of cartoony performances and a barrage of four-letter words.Sleazy oddball charmer G.H. Dorr (Tom Hanks) answers the advertisement for a room to let at the home of Southern widower Marva Munson (Irma P Hall). He explains that he and his fellow musicians need somewhere quiet to practise and Marva's basement provides him with the ideal location. But Dorr's interests lie not with the arts but with the cash deposits stored in a nearby underground vault by a floating casino. Dorr and his various accomplices (Marlon Wayans, J K Simmons, Tzi Ma and Ryan Hurst) begin tunnelling their way to ill-gotten wealth but when their scheme is discovered by Marva, they soon decide that one of them has to silence the old lady for good...Despite the wave of criticism, there is much to like about "The Ladykillers". The gospel music provides a real boost, infusing the picture with an energy that the plot itself lacks. Performances are also top-draw - Hanks is certainly memorable as Dorr but he is upstaged by genuinely funny turns by Simmons and Wayans, who I normally can't stand. Hall, for my money, is the film's MVP as she provides a warm, homely centre for the movie but one with a steely exterior when the situation demands it - much like Katie Johnson did in the original. There are also several laugh-out-loud moments of subtle comedy that work, rather than the usual attempts of going overboard by Hollywood films. However, there are problems - pacing is dreadfully slow and the film's reluctance to differ too much from the original merely highlights a lack of imagination from the Coens. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but what benefit is there in remaking a perfectly good film for modern movie-goers? Did it do Gus Van Sant any good remaking "Psycho"? There are other flaws as well. While Wayans is much funnier than normal, his constant swearing jars wildly with the old-world charm of the film in general and he simply doesn't fit in. There is also a sense that the film thinks its funnier than it actually is - Hanks' performance is good but too much for the role, the opposite of Alec Guinness' performance which was understated and much funnier. The whole film is filled with clichéd characters like the choir master who looks like a young Little Richard and farcical scenarios that simply wouldn't happen. In short, none of it feels real which was what made "Fargo" so good in the first place. However, I'm not going to mark a film down just because it is a remake. There are laughs to be had here, although fans of the Coens will be disappointed with "The Ladykillers". But would I watch it again or hunt down the DVD like I did with the 1955 version? Nope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the Coen brothers had, as I seem to recall they claimed, wanted to take the original set up for the 5 star classic original Ladykillers and devise their own spin on it, then they should have removed the iconic imagery and devised a new delightful heist scenario. Sadly what they've done here is include all the iconic imagery and diminish the heist to a few scant moments of tunnel digging. The things they've changed have changed in a way that makes them nonsense (the old lady is now streetwise, the body drop off point is a car drive away...). As a result the things that remain unchanged (the Professor's arrival, the body disposals) are constant reminders of precisely what the Coen's have failed to re-achieve. Above all, the Coen's display a surprising lack of comedy acumen in the writing and direction of this hopefully forgettable remake, which no amount of Coen visual flare can make amends for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eh... is such a good reaction to this movie. It's got some solid, funny parts, and I did at points laugh out loud. On the other hand, certain other parts were unquestionably drawn out and predictable. Marlon Wayans is good, Tom Hanks get annoying with his weird laugh and whatnot. I mostly went because a family member invited me. Not quite sure if this movie is worth the local ticket price of 10 dollars... If you get discounts or get invited or have money to throw around, just go I guess... But the movie is deffinately not worth being the center of your Saturday night plans. I walked out with a half smile: I did laugh a few times, but was I sitting there wasting my time for the other 75% of the movie? That I cannot decide for you, go see it and find out for yourselves.Cheerio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat Comedy, but still missing something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie started off and ended to bring the movie full circle, but the entire body of the movie was lacking. Characters were not developed well enough, some parts of the story just seem unbelievable or otherwise thrown together. As for the comedy, there were definately a bunch of laughs, but at the end it feels like a bunch of randomly put together scenes, none of which are needed in conjunction with any other to create the humor of the moment. The whole plot unfolds to quickly and without any suspense or mystery. The only interesting part of the plot doesn't unfold until the few scenes before the ending. The movie was offbeat, fun to watch at times, but all in all I walked out somewhat entertained, but quickly forgot about the experience. This movie would be perfect for today's teenie-bopper pop culture, but it's humor would be difficult to understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ladykillers (2004): Dir: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen / Cast: Tom Hanks, Irma P. Hall, Marlon Wayans, J.K. Simmons, Tzi Ma: One of the best of the Coen Brothers, which proves that even they can create a masterful remake. It is a hilarious caper about a group of thieves who charm an elderly woman as gospel musicians while using her cellar as a base for their operation to tunnel to a casino. It contains the skill of Joel and Ethan Coen whose credits include such impressive films as Blood Simple and The Big Lebowski. Their film is a remake of the 1955 classic starring Alec Guinness but thankfully the Coens use style and witty writing to pull off one of the best remakes to come. Tom Hanks leads the heist sporting a funny accent and a charm that delights Irma P. Hall who allows them to shelter there. Marlon Wayans works as a janitor inside the casino and is the inside guy. J.K. Simmons plays an explosive expert who has a medical bowel condition. Tzi Ma plays a character called the General, and Ryan Hurst plays an unintelligent football player of few words. This is a great collaboration of actors playing thieves hindered by their victim's unconditional devotion to God. It shows the consequences of crime with a peculiar reference to God in that Hall is a Christian woman who believes that the wayward direction is headed right where the thieves dump the body bags. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the deep south. Eccentric professor G.H. Dorr (Tom Hanks) leads a wacky group of thieves to rob a riverboat casino. He rents a room from old lady Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall). The gang pretends to be church musicians and starts digging a tunnel from her root cellar. The group includes casino cleaning crew Gawain MacSam (Marlon Wayans), movie prop guy Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons), donut shop owner The General (Tzi Ma) who dug tunnels in Vietnam, and bad football player Lump Hudson (Ryan Hurst). Pancake brings in his girlfriend Mountain Girl (Diane Delano). George Wallace plays Sheriff Wyner.I found the weird characters more distracting than funny. There is some slapstick comedy. It tries to be a black comedy but it stumbles into wacky territories. The story is slow like molasses and the drama has no tension. It's a lot of Coen style and mannerisms. I feel it's overwhelmed by it. There is a lot of wide ranging music and again I feel overwhelmed by it. The group is so random that they don't start off with any chemistry at all. That's what I miss the most about this movie. I get no sense of their relationship because the characters don't really have any. Also Tom Hank's southern accent doesn't appeal to me. The old black lady put me off. I couldn't find anybody to root for. The whole movie feels stuck in deliberate whimsy mode without the humanity. A lot of this just drove me nuts although I appreciate the Coen brothers are always trying to do their own thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the Coen Bros movies that always gets passed by or put down though honestly I don't know why. The characters are sharply drawn and while at times nearly slap-stick-like, they are still hilarious. Irma Hall as Marva Munson is just priceless ... having done yard work for many older widows when I was young, she is not too far from many of the ladies I worked for ("You don't want to be tested and found wanting" just cracked me up as I had heard it and many other Biblical quips from these women - some that I probably should have heeded far more often) ... they were dear sweet ladies but they were not to be trifled with on any level. Gives me a smile to think of them still, however, as they were so devoted to their god. Her "bitch slapping" of Marlon Wayons character for using "hippity-hoppity" language in her "Christian home" is an accurate portrayal of the ladies I knew when you took the Lord's name in vain.The other characters are just as funny. Tom Hanks' portrayal of the Southern professor gives the academic man a very nice old-time feeling and his continual, literary line of b.s. won't fail to bring a smile to your face while Tzi Ma's character, "The General", handles a couple of would-be robbers in a way we would all hope to and one that leaves the criminals wanting to be sure. J.K. Simmons (best known for his recent role in TV's "The Closer") character's ("Garth Pancake") sincere and continuous explanations of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS, or as Marlon Wayons asks, "You be what?") and his devotion to Mountain Girl are quite funny and sweet in a very odd way.But oddity is the watchword of these characters. They are all misfits yet all fit as a unit, give or take for a time or two. Of course, as you watch the film you'll start to notice that their numbers dwindle slow and sure as greed and opportunity allow one after the other to be eliminated.Wayons, as some have mentioned, probably is the weak link in this thespian ensemble. He simply doesn't have the skill set the other more experienced actors have but he does what he does to the best of his ability (having seen him in other movies this is his best by far -- Damon is the most talented of the brothers no doubt about it). Ryan Hurst is s surprise as the nearly-mentally numb Lump ... look back at his list of roles and you'll see he really can do much more than stand with his eyes vacuous while all air intake is done so through his gaped maw. As the old saying goes in acting circles, "You have to be smart to play dumb" and I'll say it applies to his performance.The Coen Bros also capture the Baptist (or perhaps the generic "black") church service perfectly. Having been a fan of the black gospel experience (the service, the sermonical delivery, and especially the music), it is a faithful and sweet portrayal of the small church experience and brings back many good memories. Indeed, the music of the movie is one of the best aspects of the movie. From the "Ink Spots"-sound of the song played over the opening credits and Mrs. Munson's original complaint to delightfully-lazy Sheriff Wyner (played deftly by George Wallace who accomplishes the perfect pitch of his character by very nearly using only his eyes) to the church service to even the rap "music" played blends perfectly with each scene it is chosen to accompany.This is one of the forgotten Ceon Bros efforts but take the time and you'll be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who killed the ladykillers? "We" said the Coens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an admirer of both the Coen brothers and the original of this film, I had high hopes despite the critical panning. It does start very promisingly. Irma Hall is fairly good, although more cantankerous and sassy than Katie Johnson is the earlier. The appearance of Tom Hanks as the professor is a delight and his performance as the verbose mastermind is superb throughout. And his verbal flourishes are among the few amusing moments in the film.Alas the film soon coarsens. In particular, Gawain, an obnoxious and foul-mouthed youth, whose "comedy" is the constant use of the f-word, is misplaced. One has the greatest respect for Irma Hall when she slaps him round the mouth for his slack language. Nor are the other members of the gang much better (and when one considers the gang in the original were Alex Guinness, Herbert Lom, Peter Sellars, Cecil Parker and Danny Green, a major disappointment). It says much that the mono-syllabic Japanese "general" is the most interesting. Another lame character is Garth, whose comedic routine is an affliction of IBS. He also has a girlfriend who is pointlessly introduced only to be pointlessly killed off (and incidentally, thus rather negating the scruples about killing a lady which was much of the point of the original). The muscle-bound "Lump" is a feeble version of the "One Round" character so memorably played by Danny Green is the 1955 film. A truly dreadful performance of someone trying, badly, to act stupid is frankly embarrassing to watch. I wonder if Lump's performance was so bad, that the Coens felt the necessity to cut down the amount of involvement he had? Certainly Danny Green had a much larger role and formed a bond with the old lady early on. This had important consequences in the 1955 film, with "One Round" protecting the old lady and forcing the gang to kill him. Here Lump manages to shoot himself after uttering perhaps 4 lines in the entire film. But it is Gawain's moronic character that truly grates and seriously unbalances the film. Since the general and lump are largely silent throughout and the professor's vast vocabulary would be lost on such a vulgarian, most of Gawain's interactions (which constitute almost the entirety of the gang's interactions) are with Garth, who is dragged into Gawain's f-laden world. All this is a pity since Hanks' performance, and the character he plays, are worthy of Alex Guinness in the first film.</fullReview>

One aspect where the remake clearly falls short, however, is the plausibility of the plot. So the ladykillers blast into this high security vault, which lacks all security gadgets we are used to from other movies (except for a retarded, obese security guard which personally I wouldn't trust a Mars bar to), and then they clean it all up and nincompoop Gawain perfectly rebuilds the wall thus rendering the hole invisible? Okayyyeee ... Watch it for the great performances instead, and for a Tom Hanks who really puts out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who has enjoyed the original British Ealing comedy, this American remake of the great 1950's classic comes as a bitter though inevitable disappointment. After all; how can you improve on perfection? British and American cultures have significant differences, and the comedy styles and subtleties of each nation do not necessarily transpose.Here, no less than the highly-regarded Coen brothers recruit perennial Hollywood favourite Tom Hanks to play the academic lead in this robbery-gone-haywire plot. As before, the gang are using the home of some kindly old women as a launching pad for their heist. This time, they're tunnelling.The movie borrows so heavily from the original as to create a de-ja-vu sensation. Unfortunately, fans - like myself - of the British classic are confronted by scenes that lack originality and freshness, the comedic elements of which are not only second-hand, but inferior.The script offers Mr Hanks an extremely verbose presence. He does his best turn at being the educated wolf-in-sheep's-clothing, but frankly - despite hamming it up like Jim Carrey at times - he just isn't believable or particularly entertaining. In fact, his endless outpourings become rather tiresome. And he gets the funniest lines. The rest of the gang just do their stuff with inadequate variations on originally hilarious ideas and turn in no more than adequate American slapstick.Of course, it's modernised a little. The kindly old lady is Negro now, not Caucasian. And the bodies are dumped onto a passing river ore-carrier or some such vessel. But otherwise you know how it goes. All the sly little turns of 1950's British humour are lost.If you cherish the original, don't waste your time or sully you memories with this one. Like 'Get Carter' and 'The Italian Job'; this is another British classic that the Yanks should have left alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not interesting and not smart; The Coen's go for heist genre frills before cheaply rounding off the character clash of classical vs. contemporary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Ladykillers, a black as you like British comedy from the 1950s, was a smart; often funny and interesting film detailing a perilous situation a handful of thieves wedge their way into following a successful cash heist. It looked at generations, both past and present, and at a Post-war; post-rationing Britain as classical codes and morals of old clashed with a youth-driven Post-war 'panic' as a nation attempted to pick itself back up again following World War Two. This was epitomised by a shadowy figure stalking an elderly lady on her daily rounds, a heist mastermind, thus forcing the sky to cloud over; rain to fall and pastel drawings of Sir Winston Churchill that a busker had drawn to run as the figure of whom represents desperate, mostly young males as a collective criminal whole loomed.It isn't much surprise then, that in updating the tale from 1950s London to 2004-circa Mississippi, plus providing a range of wacky; interracial men as the thieves, that you're going to loose a lot of that substance the British original ran on. I can remember watching the original quite recently, and in knowing the Coen Brothers had remade it several years ago, it dawned on me what it was that attracted them to this sort of material: a film whose premise revolves around an immoral swiping of some money; deathly black comedic overtones; an array of oddball characters and that sense of both asking and exploring where one's morals truly lie. It's unfortunate that the 2004 remake comes off as the dud that it does, with the above characteristics resembling their subsequent film in 2008's No Country for Old Men.The set up is the same: a shifty, talkative man comes into contact with an elderly woman living a relatively lonely life in a house with which the man will covertly use as his base of operations. The gentleman on this occasion is a certain Goldthwaite Higginson Dorr (Hanks), a professor and someone we must believe has decided to attune his rather in-depth knowledge to a life of crime, although credit to The Coens for not casting a British actor in the role as the intellect-come-villain. The elderly woman, a widower and home owner is a certain Marva Munson (Hall); the film opening on her in a police station, channelling the first, in her furious telling of the police officers about how much she dislikes a lot of the contemporary music (labelling it 'Hippity-Hop'). This lack of being able to identify with what's considered modern by the current crop of youngsters in this contemporary generation sees her cite the trivialisation of racial terms acting as song lyrics.Due to the film's updating and moving away from the source text's location and era, The Ladykillers is essentially rendered a by-the-numbers heist film complete with a patched on finale that ought to be about some pretty disturbing material, and whether these characters we've just spent the majority of the film with are able to carry out such an act, but just ends up playing out in third rate slapstick fashion. It begs the question: Why bother? Why bother remaking and updating something if you're going to sap out all of what made the source text interesting and substantial? The ragtag bunch of crooks that all gather at Munson's house with Dorr arrive in an extremely eclectic nature, with one being a silent, chain smoking man from East Asia named The General (Ma); one's an African-American cleaner at the casino they're going to rob; one's an American Football player with a low IQ and one comes across as quite an upstanding, middle aged man who's an expert in demolitions. The sheer diversity of the characters, and the fact you don't buy into the fact most of them have turned to a life of crime, render most of their reason for existing in the film to act as mere sight gags: "Look, he's a simpleton" in reference to Football player Lump Hudson (Hurst); "Look, she's central European" in reference to Mountain Girl (Delano), the demolition expert's girlfriend as well as The General's constant flicking of his cigarette into his mouth.These people have nothing in common, Lump of whom need not even be there. The setting and place have been extracted, leaving anyone to fill the void and for the film to run purely on the eerie premise of whether one could kill an elderly woman and live with it if it meant inheriting a large amount of money. There's a point when the Coen's realise they've hit a dead end; when they realise sucking out everything that made the original what it is was a bad idea, and that's in the laborious nature of their playing out of everything revolving around the planning and executing of the heist, in doing so bulking up the run time and consequently excusing them from staying too long with the latter part of the film. The true crux of the original was born out of when the thieves clashed with the landlady, their reactions and behaviour to one another and the predicament when it becomes obvious the landlady knows who the gentlemen are and that they must rid the world of her due to this knowledge was the true test. Observing some of them attempt to flee, others' reactions to the finding out of this and the expressions on their faces when they realise where their choice to enter a life of crime has got them was slick and blackly funny. Here, everything is sidetracked with the only example of youth coming up against classical traditions a moment when Munson slaps Wayans' 'inside man' for coming across as the kind into 'Hippity-Hop'. Rather ironically, The Ladykillers remake itself comes across as a slap in the face for those expecting something a little smarter and a little better then what we're given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the Wrong Stuff to Kill a Lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go for bottle rockets and fire crackers, but come back with sparklers and pop-rocks, you would still enjoy them like you would Lady Killers, a remake of an Alec Guinness comedy from the 1950s by Joel and Ethan Coen. The character's seemingly Looney Tune demise make them unbelievable at best, but as they are, quite hilarious. The Silver-tonged, bogus Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr (Tom Hanks) is the leader of the crooked operations to rob a cassino accompanied by Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons) who is the explosives expert with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Gawain MacSam (Marlon Wayans) who is the extremely fowl mouthed "inside man" always playing hiphop, The General (Tzi Ma) who says little and is the tunneling expert, and Lump Hudson (Ryan Hurst) as the muscle. They rent a room from widow Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall), who discovers them to be thieves and uncovers their operations making her the only obstacle standing in their way. Inevitably they need to rid themselves of this nosy, do the right thing, stubborn old lady to accomplish their plan. The incompetence of the thieves plays a large comedic role in the movie and they seem more adept to knocking off each other than an old lady.The Coen brother's quirky nature is relentless and the Lady Killers has not been spared. There is no real climax, nor is there an extreme low. It is just steady laughs and giggles. Taking the setting from urban Britain to the Deep South and focusing on the comedy more than the plot makes this laughable and forgettable film seemingly a flop if it was expected to be a good as the original. All aspects considered, the film does make a solid laugh throughout and is very enjoyable, just not an epic to quote drop from or change your life. Lady Killers gets one thumb up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bungled Casino Heist Comedy Is Uncharacteristic Coen Brothers Dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marva Mudson is a god-fearing elderly widow in small-town Mississippi who rents a room to the decidedly odd Professor Dorr and his motley collection of music historians. Little does she know that these are desperate men planning a sensational crime, and are using her house as a base of operations ...There's a clichéd perspective that European comedies are subtle and mannered yet biting and satirical, whilst American comedies are brash, tasteless and moronic. If anyone could change this view it would be the ultra-talented Coen Brothers remaking a classic Ealing Studios film, but sadly they fully live up to Hollywood expectations. Where Alexander Mackendrick's 1955 original is a bright, witty, tightly-scripted and gleefully funny black comedy, this is a weak, all-over-the-place, foul-mouthed, blunderingly obvious movie. The story and character-types are pretty faithful; the mail-train robbery is now a floating casino robbery, the old lady's parrot becomes a cat and there's an unnecessarily lengthy exposition of the gang tunnelling their way to the vault, but the basic plot is sound, right down to Tom Hanks' variation on Alec Guinness' teeth. So why do I find it so poor - it's the writing I'm afraid. The Coens can write fantastic dialogue (see any scene in Miller's Crossing) and indeed some of The Professor's verbal badinage here is very amusing, but they have a weakness for making all their characters too extreme, at the expense of the inter-relationships between them and the overall tone of the film. The funniest thing in the original film is the contrast between the gang and the old dame; here all the characters are in a world of their own and they just make little speeches, alternated with pointless arguing. Each one is interesting in his or her own right but they don't gel together. The old lady seems formidable right from the start (as opposed to a helpless little caged bird) and we are never really fearful for her, so the bite of the comedy is gone. The Coens are in love with the quirkiness of their performers - Hanks' nasal snorting, Hall's bow-legged walk, Simmons' bowel problems - all of which is screwy but doesn't amount to much. They put in five minutes of gospel choir footage for no reason other than they like it - it's not got much relevance to the plot. The cast all try hard, and are fine, especially Hall in a great star turn, although the actors who come off best for me are curiously Ma and Hurst, purely because their performances consist almost entirely of blank-faced stares with hardly any dialogue. This is a lazy movie by filmmakers who could do much better - it's goofy fun, and I'd give it more points if it were by someone else, or not a remake of a vastly superior film, but the Coens' real talents are in clever, deft writing and startling yet classical visuals, and neither are on show here. Trivia - this is the Coens' eleventh movie and the first where they give themselves co-director credit (previously Joel has been listed as director and Ethan as producer). A big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not so much a remake as a radical reinterpretation of Alexander MacKendrick's original. Indeed, this displays all of the strengths and few of the weaknesses of the Coen Brothers and while not quite in the same class as "O Brother, Where Art Thou" it still stands as a fairly worthy companion piece with its Deep South setting, (as Gothic and mythical as ever), its bunch of incompetent crooks and its marvellous score.The Alec Guinness role is now in the extremely competent hands of Tom Hanks, relishing the opportunity to put on false whiskers and dentures and play as broadly as all-get-out, while the Katie Johnson character is now a Black Mama who would strike the fear of God into any self-respecting criminal and is played to the hilt by the marvellous Irma P Hall.The jokes this time round tend towards the lavatorial and the expletives are certainly not deleted but its a delectable broad farce, gorgeously photographed as ever by Roger Deakins. The difference in approach makes comparing it to the original somewhat odious; best just to savor it for what it is.</fullReview>

How wrong I was... Thank goodness for subtitles.!!! What with his very strong southern accent mixed with the rest of the put on over the top, praise the lord, cotton eye joe, accents, (So strong in places you could hardly understand what they were saying) added to the more than liberal helping of obscenities and if you closed your eyes you would think you where listening to an Eddie Murphy movie instead of a Tom Hanks movie. Toms acting was only "good" in this remake of a classic comedy. I know it had a lot to live up to when comparing it to the original Ealing comedy. But even if you try to think of it as a movie with the same name as the classic, it was still a duff. Why do directors think that by adding more swearing they are going to make a better film. Or is it that the scriptwriters run out of words and need to fill in the dialogue with this rubbish. I might give it a second attempt and maybe watch the whole movie when it is shown on TV, (not long to wait I think) as I hope they will dub over the bad words and hopefully the bad accents as well. So don't watch it with your Gran on a Sunday afternoon. Only watch it at 3am if you can't sleep...... As it will help you.!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The undoing of a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of the American 'Coen Brothers' work previously, and I only chose to view this movie because of the original 'Ealing Studio's' classic masterpiece. So, I was looking forward to seeing this American version, and also how Tom Hanks would play the Alec Guiness role of the 'Professor'.But this remake was such a letdown, and a shadow of the work done by 'Ealing', why on earth did they choose to use of the 'F word' in the script I can not imagine, that was a turn off in itself, and which I would of done long before the end of the film, but for the fact that I had just paid ?4.00 for it on ebay.I was however, pleasantly surprised with 'Hanks' performance, and his interpretation, the only criticism I have is that he did try a bit to hard to copy Alec Guiness, who 'Hanks' must have viewed the original '1955 Ealing comedy' countless times before deciding on his approach.'Hanks' was also let down by a very weak group of fellow actors, who had no idea on how to portray character acting roles. He must have known it was going to be a disaster, but the huge amounts of money soon change one's thinking! There are some films as in this case, that maybe should not be attempted at remake because of the embarrassment in the failure of trying to recapture something that is not possible.Yes!, this remake could have been better, but it would have taken more than just 'Tom Hanks' it also would have required high calibre production, direction, and all, which sadly this remake does not have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some humor, but misses its mark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylistically convincing in the same vein as the Coens' "O Brother, Where Art Thou," and another seeming paean to the South, "The Ladykillers" has its moments, but it has little comic heat for such a variety of comic potential.I didn't find myself laughing much for the first two-thirds of the movie then basically found the last 20 minutes more or less (almost) worth the wait.The reason--it just lacked a consistent comic punch, even in the quirky way the Coens tend to write comedy. Yes, Tom Hanks is excellent as the loquacious and encyclopedically brilliant Professor G.H. Dorr, yet even he I did not find particularly funny. He doesn't play the Professor over-the-top exactly, but doesn't pull you in all the way either. Half the time he seemed to be mumbling his lines, if only because there were so many of them of such wild verbal density.The septet of criminal morons could have been a formula for great hilarity and I'll accept that the Coens are not the types to go for an easy laugh, but the style and tone of the movie rarely hints at humor, unlike "Raising Arizona" or the macabre humor of "Fargo." I'd forward my complaints about the movie's swearing, though surely they'd fall on deaf ears (so to speak). Some people simply are not concerned about such things, but I think it just distracts and detracts from the enjoyment of the movie. 99% of the swearing comes from Wayans and his black counterpart early in the movie. This is vaguely, if not intentionally, stereotypical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Immediately, I should say I have never watched the original film: I am not comparing this effort to the original. That said, I was not satisfied after watching. The simple plot burbles along and peters out, leaving only a weak Deus Ex Machina to end the film properly. That said, the characters in this film are interesting and fairly enjoyable, if clichéd, and no tension, however slight, is allowed to build for longer than 30 seconds before simply being resolved. This film is essentially an exercise in luck, with random chance affecting what will happen at each juncture, with no feeling of any eventual aim in mind. I suggest that this film be renamed 'The Killjoys'. (with an appropriate renaming of the main character, of course)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the trailers for this movie, I wondered, "Why would Tom Hanks have done this movie??", and after watching it... I'm left with the same question. Tom Hanks twenty years ago, during his "The Burbs" days, sure. An actor's gotta eat and pay rent, after all, but Tom Hanks post "Forrest Gump" and "Philadelphia"? It isn't as if the man can't pick and choose his parts! He did a fine job in the role, as did everyone, but the script was so lacking that I was incredulous. I watched the entirety of the movie, just waiting for it to get better, which, suffice to say, did not happen. I found this movie to be dull and moronic, and an absolute waste of time, though, I'll admit, it's slapstick humour might appeal to some, though, even in that case, it wasn't an excellent piece of brainless eye-candy. Just... blech...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply an awful film. It is one-dimensional and relies on swearing and scatological humour to drag it through its hammy screenplay. Whereas the original film had several dimensions to it - the quaint English humour, the sinister finale, and the lauding of decency over cunning, this film offers little more than some tired visual jokes and numerous crude references.Although I appreciate that a remake need not stick too closely to its forerunner, surely it must offer something new? This film, despite the presence of some excellent actors and the hand of the Coen brothers upon it, would surely only appeal to someone who has never seen a film before.It has no redeeming qualities and I found it a tiresome struggle to get through to the end of it. I have always maintained that there will be some aspect of a film that will be of interest - I haven't figured out what this film gives. I suggest that you watch the original film if you enjoy quaint humour. I cannot believe the Coen brothers are not embarrassed to be associated with this tripe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to the Coens?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with a lot of the comments posted on this film, it is by far, the worst film the Coen's have produced to date. I have long been a big fan of their films, but something just seems to be missing from their last two. Visually, this film is well made, and some of the acting performances are good, but as a whole, it is an unenjoyable film. Hanks' character, while well played, is boring and not funny. Wayans is obnoxious and insulting. I literally laughed one time in the entire move, a statement that very few people could make about other Coen brother classics like Lebowski, Hudsucker, or Fargo.I can't completely put my finger on what is so wrong with this film. I guess perhaps this film is put together like a Lego castle, after you've lost the directions. In other words, all of the key pieces of a Coen brother's film are there, (plot twists, interesting characters, decent actors, and a quality film crew) but the end product is completely sub-par.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen Brothers No More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understood the dangers in watching this film after I had seen "Fargo". I knew that awards and all sorts of acclaim didn't have to make sense and that a movie with such could actually be a big fat rotten egg. But I decided to walk on troubled waters once more and give the Coen Brothers a second chance. After watching "The Ladykillers", I can tell you that it will be the last Coen Brothers film I will bother with.For those of you who remember "Fargo", you don't have to worry so much about hidden "humor" with this film. Maybe in wising up a bit (although I doubt it), the Coen Brothers instantly portray "The Ladykillers" as more of a comedy through its uncommon setting and characters. But where their signature style comes out is in the introduction, where the audience is shifted all over the film without any warning telling them to hold on. The pieces do eventually fall together, but at what feels like a lethargic rate. Then, in an attempt to add their own poetry, we are given a slowly-deflated ending that takes the form of a succession of deaths. The ultimate sensationalism and ridiculousness comes in the form of one last deposit into passing garbage. Ironically, this isn't much different from what I thought of doing with this film. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>foul and unnecessary language did this film in for full family viewing. I wonder why such a wonderful and entertaining film featuring Tom Hanks felt it had to scoop so low with the typical 4 letters words which did not add anything (as if these words ever do)for a pretty good film. The story itself is very consistent with the characters sleepy little town on the mississippi river who have a very clever scheme of robbing the local gambling boat of at least 1.6 million dollars ... George Wallace (black comic not the ex governor of Alabama) did a real good job as the county sheriff as well as I have ever seen him before. See this film and judge for yourself whether having less foul language would had made any impact on the effectiveness of this movie or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not care for this film. I really liked "Oh Brother", but this one was a turkey. The funniest thing on the DVD was the "Slap Reel". Now that, I laughed at.Tom Hanks did his best to help this movie and Marlon Wayans was wonderful. However the efforts of these actors was not enough to save this Coen film. The Coen brothers are known for their quirky movies but this one was just not up to par. I am disappointed as I always look forward to seeing the Coen brother's work.The one person who I felt truly shined in this film was Irma P. Hall. Her portrayal of Marva Munson was absolutely fantastic. The Coen's should use her in other ventures. But aside from that I can not imagine what either Coen was thinking when making this film.</fullReview>

Ummm I said, "LET'S LAUGH!" BZZZZZZZZZ...even bigger disappointment....I managed to watch the first 30 mins of this movie and I'm proud to say I was even able (barely) to stay awake. In that 30 mins I couldn't find anything to laugh about except perhaps Tom Hank's terrible accent. The acting was substandard, the storyline was confusing at best and the characters were incredibly bland - perhaps some salt and pepper may have helped. If anyone is planning on watching this movie, I suggest you do yourself a favour and go bang your thumb with a hammer instead - I'm sure it will be far less painful.

		<fullReview>I'm not actually a huge Coen brothers fan-I think a lot of their humor is just too cruel to be funny, and some of their situations are very contrived. However, they usually can be counted on to be original, and are often very entertaining. This film showcased all the things that are wrong with most Coen brothers movies, and here it's not balanced by anything funny or clever. The characters are not believable in the slightest, nor is the situation they find themselves in, and the ending is completely, utterly without merit. I'm sure Tom Hanks didn't get his usual $20 million, but thought a Coen brothers pic would be something very "artsy" and the chance to star in it worth the cut in pay. Well, he was wrong. The only good part in the film was the preacher scene in the Sunday service ("we done smote!") but the rest is banal and just not funny. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks always does a good job, but this film is with out a doubt his worst to date. Even the cursing seemed out of place. There was only two scenes that were funny. The plot was o.k., but the acting leaves a lot to be desired, it did not seem to flow naturally, everything seemed to be forced. We have purchased all of Tom Hanks films, but this one was a waste of money. All of the previous Hanks films kept us engrossed, this one, we shut off even before it was finished, because we could not get into it or enjoy it. We also think it was poorly edited. We would not recommend this film to the buying public. I wished we would have reviewed the film before we purchased it. Warren A. McCarns Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just okay, not a repeat for me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a feeling this wouldn't be my type of movie, but with over a 6/10 rating from IMDb and Tom hanks in the Movie; I figured I'd give it a try. Overall I wasn't impressed, though I like to write reviews for just about anything I see so that maybe others could benefit from it one way or another. I loved O brother where art thou, and though this movie had a somewhat similar feel, there simply just wasn't enough substance in this movie to get my thumbs up (funny looking back O brother where art thou didn't have a lot of substance either but I liked it a lot for some reason).All that being said it certainly had some funny moments.Tom hanks did okay at his role and all but I just wasn't wowed at all by his intellectual babble throughout the movie and after a while was just waiting for one of the other actors to say, "Just shut up!" People who can't get to the point with out telling you their life story just but the crap out of me.Probably why I hated Big Fish so much. I guess the other thing that bothered me about his character was if you're going to have a guy with that much education and culture, then why on earth would he be a thief? Certainly he could have found other profitable legitimate work, so for me his character was too unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, you always have to have the 'Brains' of the outfit, I just don't think his character fit. And that weird goofy / psychotic laugh of his was just stupid. So certainly not one of hanks better roles, though it may have been more fault to the character rather than him. The other characters I thought were good. The gang banger and the guy with IBS certainly had me laughing at times, especially when they would go at it. So there was some good points to it, just not quite enough? The garbage boat scenes were funny at first, but then after a while became repetitive, like telling the same joke over and over.I don't really know who to recommend this movie to. It's a caper movie, but not serious one, however it's not really a spoof either, so it's kind of hard to classify. I didn't like it overall because it emphasized too much of what I didn't like. The ongoing intellectual garble from Hanks, the overused southern gospel music, plus I didn't like the mean old lady much at all, just too much crap that I couldn't digest well. While on the other hand it certainly had it's moments of shining as well, but they were far to few, so if they would have went more serious or more comical I might have liked it more, but the mix didn't work to well for me. I say 4 / 10 and that's not because of Hanks as I thought he added very little to the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, it's hard to understand the appeal of the Coen brothers. I'm not sure where to begin. One overriding criticism is that it's apparent from the very beginning that the movie is written by nerdy (white) men with no sense of the pace, music and dialect in the South...Anyone who has ever been to a black church in the South would find the depictions of the church in the movie puzzling...I can only imagine that the depictions of the church, and many other odd moments (not to ruin the movie for anyone, but the end is replete with odd moments) throughout the movie were meant to be seen as slapstick humor... I honestly don't even want to take the time to deconstruct this piece of crap movie, so I will conclude my rant now. The only reason I didn't stop the DVD at the fifteen minute mark was because Tom Hanks appeared and provided a bit of a hook to keep me watching.</fullReview>

Some of the cinematography on the bridge with the gargoyles was picturesque. The only lively character was the old lady. Even the cat had more charisma than Hanks. Aside from Hank's terrible acting, the story itself was not bad; it was a moral, religious one meshed with Edgar Allan Poe-style Gothic fall of the bad protagonists.

		<fullReview>I do not usually go to the movies due to the fact that there are so many films that are genuinely worth the cost and I am not a teenager/twenty something. I almost always rent and I usually choose those films that seem to have depth, belong to my favorite genre, or have a tried and true actor. In this case I rented Ladykillers because it starred Tom Hanks and the previews seemed amusing. I was stunned by the inappropriate obscene, vulgar language that was used in the first 30 minutes of the film. I expect some vulgarity in an R rated film, but this WAS extreme. Needless to say I did not watch the remainder of the movie and I do not recommend it to anyone. I really do not understand the use of such obscenity, I am a high school teacher and I do not even hear this much of such obscene vulgarities from the students. Those I do hear are not tolerated.

		<fullReview>(Spoilers) The Ladykillers is a movie with a swiss cheese number of plot holes, so the performances better take over and make you forget them, but they don't. Tom Hanks hams it up as Professor G.H. Dorr, a Mark Twain-like character who appears to have been transplanted into the present from the 1890's. There is no attempt to explain how or why Dorr acts in this manner, or how he recruits 4 caricatures of various types to join in on a casino robbery. We just buy it as is. There are a few chuckles along the way, and then the movie takes a nasty turn at the end, I guess so the Coens can keep their "kings of black comedy" reign intact. Out of all the Coen brothers movies I've seen, this one goes to the bottom.</fullReview>

This film had great potential but failed to deliver in every aspect. Hank's character was the only one in the film that was somewhat entertaining. His accent and southern gentleman ways made for a few chuckles. Marlan Wayans plays a foul mouthed casino worker and adds nothing to the film. Ryan Hurst plays the idiot role but fails to add any comic element to the film. The jokes are predictable, weak and vulgar at the same time. The comedy written around one character's irritable bowel syndrome jokes is very juvenile. Overall, there were very few laugh-out-loud moments.

I will continue to tell anyone considering this movie that the language is not just a "sometmes" occurrence but will probably be the most frequent use of the "f-bomb" and "mf-bomb" they'll ever witness!

So the movie which starts out on a weak premise now continues to annoy with characters, be detatched from some and still be forced to watch the long draw of much too slowly paced scenes slug along the big-screen.

		<fullReview>Nothing about this movie is very good. Except perhaps the gut that it must have taken to remake a classic like this. The Cohen brothers provide a weak script that even the great Tom Hanks can't make funny. As keeping with early critical opinion of the movie, it tries to hard to be funny. It brings out all those classic elements such as the exaggerate southern church scenes (more than one!) and actually, the entire southern stereotype. This coming from me has got to mean that they over did it because this is just my type of thing.Hanks, albeit the best part of this movie, delivers a poor, forced character that causes you to groan when you see that he is opening his mouth again. You wounder how much more are we going to have to endure such a wonderful actor embarrassing himself like this. At least he looks like he is enjoying the horrible accent and unrealistic dialogue.Many movies make the mistake of going on for too long and this is no exception. The caper is completed but you still don't understand the title so you know that there has got to be more. And there is. It drags on and even when I walked out of the theater I was still thinking they got the title wrong. **/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning had great potential for comedy and a variety of paths to conclude with.The characters, overall, had a good grounding, but weren't fully polished. Tom Hanks' character seemed to impress a British accent that failed to be legit or real. Garth's IBS [irritable bowel syndrome] wasn't the best way to use a medical condition for mishap, unoriginal to use that appendenge. Gawain was too obsessed with using the f- word in his diction, warranting an unnecessary R rating. The best character, was the General. He was enigmatic and displayed some wit with his cigarette; all this; while speaking in a limited manner.The ending, unfortunately, made me feel crestfallen. While I won't 'spoil' anything; the emotions and actions displayed by the men towards Ms. Munson were trite; I knew where the characters were headed [without seeing the original movie].Overall, the movie had the opportunity to be as good as its precursor has been criticized for being; but the stale ending and sophomoric humor couldn't help the movie, as a whole.

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks is one of greatest actors but this movie was very disappointing. Language ruined it - not funny - profanity / obscenities much overdone.BTW Saucier MS is a real community - it is close to Pascagoula no where near Memphis and no where near MS River. It is close to MS Gulf Coast. Casinos in MS are much larger and fancier than the one in the movie and never empty (especially those on MS Gulf Coast. All have hotels such as Beau Rivage with 1800 rooms, Imperial, Grand with 1000 rooms, et. al. Come see the real thing.I was looking forward to this movie but disappointed with crude attempt at humor with way too much bad language - a couple of mildly funny scenes kept rating off very bottom. Hanks was great in a terrible role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept falling asleep &amp; finally had enough and walked out. Don't waste your time with this one. It's hard to get past Tom Hanks' weird voice and mannerisms. It is also weird to see him looking like Col. Sanders. I really should have went and seen Home on the Range instead of this one. The entire time I watched this movie, I kept waiting for it to get better, and it didn't. The only good thing that I can say about it is Irma P. Hall did an excellent job in it. The black guy in it was trying to copy a character out of the movie, Friday. It's been done before &amp; hearing someone saying the F word over and over is not amusing. There were only a couple of parts in it that made me laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but conflicting target audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the cleverness of the dialog by some of the characters, and especially by Tom Hanks. I did not enjoy the crude humor by others. This is the point I want to make. Films that appeal to a diverse audience with almost opposite qualities are difficult to pull off and I feel that for me this attempt lowered the film's quality and attraction. I have seen this happen before and in particular, the film "Demolition Man", but in this case the draw was action and ironic humor. For me, I happen to enjoy both but I think for the market, these two qualities are not compatible and the result, which I anticipated, was a poor showing.Anyway, if you like Tom, I am sure you will enjoy his performance, and you may enjoy the story. If you do not like crudity, I would still go but expect to suffer a bit and stick around for the rest.And, of course, do see the original version with Alec Guiness, one among a number of great Guiness British comedies done around that time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess Tom Hanks wasn't satisfied with playing the (so-called) villain in 'Road To Perdition' and wanted to wear the bad guy's hat again. Or maybe he just wanted to work with the Coens badly enough that he was okay with dressing like Colonel Sanders. Hey, perhaps the one-time comic actor felt it was time to get back to his goofy root...and who writes better goofy leading characters than the Coens? Whatever the reason, Hanks plays Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr in 'The Ladykillers' and seems to have a hoot rattling off the patented tongue twisters in the Joel/Ethan screenplay. Hanks? The model of normalcy in a movie where he plays a thieving buffoon? Sounds like comic gold. And some of it IS quite funny, especially the dialogue and a few hilarious surprises. On the other hand, I'm surprised to report that this all-star line-up of filmmakers and star doesn't deliver an especially good film.I haven't seen the original '50s British flick with Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers, but the '04 remake is apparently true to its source. Hanks leads a rabble of dullards into the basement of a kindly southern lady's basement to systematically tunnel through the wall and into a riverboat casino office. They're after nothin' but loot, yet the little old lady thinks she's renting out her cellar to five musicians. The kicker comes when they discover they might have to follow the advice of the movie's title and off their hostess, lest she turn them in. Marlon Wayans, J.K. Simmons, Ryan Hurst, and Tzi Ma play the other crooks while Irma P. Hall steals the show as Missus Munson.Even though there are plenty of laughs in this film, the Coens can't sustain the pitch and they end up hitting a few too many snags. There's very little character development and a few too many repetitive jokes. Hanks is definitely not playing his usual upstanding hero character, but he's not threatening enough or funny enough to truly play this scruple-free faux gentleman to the hilt. Wayans is just an annoying stereotype, as is Hurst. Simmons and Hall impressed me the most, but they're pretty stupid characters too. Maybe the Coens just enjoy shaping their movies around simpletons. Their approach usually works, but 'The Ladykillers' is one of their only movies I wouldn't recommend. The last 10 or 15 minutes is unexpected and funny, even if they show us the same body-dumping sight gag once or twice too often. The delicious finale nearly turned my disappointment to joy. Nearly.</fullReview>

I'm glad that I didn't take my children (they are 17 and 13). The storyline was great and Tom Hanks did an excellent job BUT, it was noted that the offensive language was NOT coming from him. I believe I have seen every movie that he has ever made and have been more than pleased with what I saw and I have even purchased a few for later viewing but, this one will not be in my library. I'm sure it will be better when they edit it for tv. Maybe all of the characters should have taken acting lessons from Mr. Pickles, he did the best job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had all the potential to be nearly as great a hit as "O Brother Where Art Thou?", same directors, same soundtrack producer, same southern style. However; I couldn't in good faith recommend this movie to my parents, or let my son see it, the way I have been able to with O Brother, because of the rampant use of foul language.Don't get me wrong, I suppose given the setting the foul language is warranted, and it doesn't offend me personally at all. But to me, the story could have stood just as well with much milder language, and still would have been a great film to share with the family. Some films need that sort of edge, The Big Lebowski, for example, is a great Coen brothers film that in no way would I suggest it be toned down.I love the characters in this film, even if they are exaggerated. I love the setting, and I love the story from the begining to the end. I just didn't like the language.Overall, this film earned a 7 from me, maybe a 7.5 if we could rate on half points. ;) It was entertaining, but certainly not the best we've seen from the Coen brothers. I would have loved to be able to share it with the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the good vs. evil type of movie, this was great. Humor was funny and crisp. I was a bit disappointed in the acting of Tom Hanks, as I expect more from him. I also think they went a bit overboard in the language the janitor used. A few less of "those" words would have been appreciated.The cat was a star in its own right with the expressions and watchfulness it showed and the part it played in the ending. One of the highlights was watching the expression in the painting of Irma's husband.I went to the movie because it was starring Tom Hanks, and therefore I was a bit disappointed in the movie. My 27-year-old daughter fell asleep during the movie as did my husband! So it was a case of mixed reviews on my part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coens have received too many "me too" votes for too many mediocre formulaic walk-throughs. For me the Coens blew all their talent on Blood Simple.As has been noted over and over, the original Ladykillers had a wonderful, lighter touch. Here Tom Hanks needy performance is like a high school thespian who's been encouraged by his mother way too much. He's mastered some mannerist accent but his bizarre performance takes viewers nowhere. There's just nothing the audience can do with it. I'd say it's a case where the talent is too big for the role, but Hanks hasn't been asked to master any talent past throttling audience sympathy into submission. As little time is devoted to the actual heist, the plot is somehow still tedious, having been pushed aside for a dozen scenes of Hanks chronically unfunny blathering. Plot is something the Coens now address if there's time after dealing with cinematography, artifice, their formula, the soundtrack, regional ribbing... The lady-killing sequence here is perfunctory and fails to amuse.It's as if the actor playing Garth Pancake studied the Harry Shearer role in A Mighty Wind (why?), to dream up this character. Wayans isn't much good, but who the hell cares about his swearing? Take your 5-year old mind to a G movie.and hooray... the Coens have discovered toilet humor. Weren't we all clamoring for that? Other jokes recur way too frequently and have dinosaur footprints on them. (A painting that responds to the actions... oh please stop, these ancient gags are killing me.) There's just too much hoary cartoon-level humor. Someone mentioned the cat was a good bit but it's just another lost opportunity in amidst many undeveloped ideas.The gospel songs are terrific. The enthusiastic big-haired (wordless) choir-master is funny. But the movie just sits there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see this movie I suggest not watching the trailer. While there are some funny parts and some really interesting visual motifs that, at least technically, tie the movie together; there is really no point in seeing the movie if you have seen the trailer. Tom Hanks is, admittedly, absolutely hilarious and the other characters certainly have their moments, but there was something about it that seemed absolutely vacuous. The only points where I really laughed out loud were centered around Hanks' character, while everything else seemed a bit forced. At any rate, seeing the trailer you have seen roughly 40% of all that is truly hilarious. Just watch the trailer and put your money in a mutual fund or send it to the Coen brothers so that next time they have a good idea they can spend a bit more time making it consistently interesting, rather than dull with a few bright flashes.</fullReview>

I saw the original film and thought that it was much better than the 2004 version.

		<shortDescription>Lousy. Not funny, constant use of the F word, downer ending, straightforward plot. ***SPOILERS***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see much merit to this film. "Intolerable Cruelty" was amazingly good and clever with great dialog. This one doesn't even come into the "almost clever" range. (Both movies were written by the Coen brothers.)Example: From the trailer, you have seen Tom Hanks insist that "we must all have waffles forthwith." That's not funny. I didn't laugh when he said that. That's one of the big laugh lines in the movie, and it's just not funny.I don't think that much of this movie is funny at all. I don't remember laughing at all and I don't remember the audience laughing either, and I pay attention to that.The plot is completely straightforward. It follows a single thread from beginning to end. There is one twist, but that twist exists in every caper movie you've ever seen (that is, someone turns on the team), so you expect it and it happens right on cue, and in no clever way.Ok, the ending scenes are unexpected. I certainly never expected people to get killed off like that. But I didn't think that was funny, and I don't enjoy watching characters that I have come to like get killed. The first and second killings were in no way funny, they weren't even intended to be funny. The last two killings were especially disturbing. And for the last killing??? What are we watching Hannibal Lechter now? When that happened I felt a cold shock wash over the audience and we were all hushed from there on out.The device used for the second to last killing was also used in "Intolerable Cruelty." That repeat is unforgivable, unless the Coens want to make a running gag in their movies of how many ways people can shoot themselves. However, in "Cruelty" the audience howled with laughter. In this movie I just heard a few nervous laughs, because it flat was not funny. Either way, I, personally, am still not jaded to such an extent to have lost so much sensitivity that I think watching people kill themselves is entertainment. Have you?There is constant use of the F word. When it first began I was quite shocked. After I got used to it I'll admit that it was somewhat funny, the movie is rated "R," and I do know people that talk that way. If you enjoy the kind of humor that depends on foul language, that's fine. I left that behind me in 7th grade and have moved on to higher pursuits by now.My rating: F. Waste of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well... there goes my expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About six months ago, I heard about a film coming out starring two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks, Stephen Root (news radio) and J.K. Simmons (fantastic as the racist villain of HBO's Oz). This film was to be a remake of a great 50's dark comedy starring Alec Guinness and was to be directed by my favorite of the brothers-making-movies teams, the Coen brothers. Joel and Ethan Coen have directed a bunch of great movies, including Fargo and The Big Lebowski, and also one of my all-time favorites, O Brother, Where art thou? This film was to come out in April, 2004 and reestablish Tom Hanks as an exciting comic actor. The film I am talking about is of course The Ladykillers. I've anxiously awaited this movie for months, especially after seeing the hilarious trailers. I was even excited despite the presence of a Wayans brother, which generally signifies the death of any movie.Well we saw it last night. At long last I got to see what was assumed to be the Coen's next great film. After stumbling with the sell-out Intolerable Cruelty, they were gonna rise from the ashes like the proverbial phoenix and reestablish their credibility with movie geeks. After about two thirds of the movie, I had my suspicions; by the end, they were confirmed. This was definitely the worst movie the Coens (and Tom Hanks, for that matter) have ever made. Intolerable Cruelty was Oscar quality compared to The Ladykillers. At long last, after what was probably the longest streak of great films by any actor since Brando, Tom Hanks has (gasp) made a bad movie. A really bad one. I literally found nothing redeeming about this film except the gospel-filled soundtrack, which was along the same lines as O Brother.The plot, revolving around a riverboat casino heist, comes of as remarkably stupid and unbelievable. Tom Hanks puts on his best (or worst) southern accent to play some sort of cross between the devil and an annoyingly turrets-inflicted Colonel Sanders. Master thespian Marlon Wayans gangstas it up (again) as the `inside man' who somehow knows how to flawlessly patch up a huge hole in a vault wall so the casino owners can never know how the money disappeared. And then there's J.K. Simmons, who has the unlucky duty of playing a demolitions expert whose only job is to pick fight after fight with Wayons and nearly crap his pants multiple times. It's a sad thing to say that the one moment of dramatic tension in the heist scene comes when Simmons, in a rush to avoid both a tunnel-collapsing bomb and a craptacular experience in his shorts, shoots out of the tunnel and into the table containing neat stacks of all the stolen loot, which of course launches all 1.6 million dollars flying into the air at the exact same instant that the old lady at whose house the heist takes place comes through the door.The ending, which I won't spoil for those of you stupid enough to ignore my advice, is lame bordering on totally ludicrous, involving a seemingly endless, and conveniently timed, train of barges filled with garbage.It's always disheartening when a movie that was one of the most anticipated movies of the year, turns out to be this bad. I guess it just goes to show that you can have talented writers, directors, and actors, and can still end up with a movie that reeks more than the aforementioned floating garbage. * out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original film, The Lady Killers, but I will most assuredly check it out after hearing from all sources that it's much better than this remake. While this is hardly the best Coen Brothers movie of all time, it's certainly worth the trip, if only for the bent and twisted glee with which it is played out. (It's played out and yet NOT "played out.") Tom Hanks is clearly having a lot of fun in his over-the-top characterization of a deranged buffoon who actually believes himself to be a possible genius, and this is reason enough to see the movie. Irma P. Hall, who's great at slapping and smacking people, is excellent here as well. All the other characters (and they ARE characters) have been written as stereotypes but for some reason that works here too - it adds to the insane quality of the proceedings in a good way. The plot is thin at best but it's the delivery that makes the film worthwhile, particularly the clever way -=-SPOILER ALERT -=- that Hanks' character gets hoisted at the end - literally - by his own petard. Edgar Allen Poe would be very pleased, methinks.</fullReview>

The portrayal of blacks is less than flattering. It is in fact demeaning. Both blacks in the movie, one obese and the other a fowl mouth, are stereotypical of blacks. Fine black actors have come a long way in improving black roles in major motion pictures. This is definitely a step in the wrong direction in their cause for meaningful roles.

		<fullReview>I consider myself to be a genuine Coen Brothers enthusiast. I loved the original LADYKILLERS (Guinness, Sellers) and I was so excited about this remake. I was thrilled when Hanks was cast, but I became concerned when the Coens went away from their traditional supporting group (Goodman, Buscemi, Turturro, etc.). Unfortunately, my concerns were well-founded. While Hanks is amusing, the supporting cast in this film is awful (only one member of the gang is able to form a sentence). Due to the imbecility of the supporting cast, the Coens are unable to flex their writing talents. Also, although I am not usually bothered by "foul language," in this movie all the f-words seemed forced and out of place. With this film and INTOLERABLE CRUELTY back-to-back, I am worried that my favorite filmmakers may be in a rut. I hope their next project will prove me wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O Coen Brothers, Where Art Thou? You leave your partially indie roots to make commercial movies like The Ladykillers and Intolerable Cruelty. Although I don't consider myself to be a huge Coen Bros. fan (the oldest movie of theirs that I have seen is Fargo), I enjoy their movies, and often find their brand of dark humor very funny. However, Cruelty had just one dark moment that had me in stitches, and The Ladykillers doesn't start up with the dark until it's too late.Tom Hanks is G.H. Dorr, a professor who is like a cross between Col. Sanders and Foghorn Leghorn. He rooms in the house of Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall), supposedly just to room while he's studying, and use her basement to practice Renaissance music with his band. However, the real reason why he needs to be in that house is because it's adjoined to a casino that Dorr and his posse are planning to rob. Munson isn't exactly a milquetoast person, and her strict views damper the successfulness of their mission.Throughout the first hour and fifteen minutes or so, The Ladykillers seemed to just be generic and bland. A few laughs here and there, but nothing spectacular. It drew on stereotypes of the south and of race, but wasn't really anything amazing. But then the final part of the movie came, which were some of the funniest moments I've witnessed in a movie theater for a long time. THAT'S where it started getting good. The darkness in the Coens's humor came out, and put a whole new perspective on the movie. However, to get there, we needed to go through over an hour of generic movie. Some of that part even seemed like a teen comedy (I'll just say loose bowels and leave it at that).Although commended for his over-the-top performance, Hanks's character just seemed to bug me. Not only was he hard to understand (actually, almost everyone in the movie was hard to understand), but the way he laughed didn't go with the character, and I don't really think he was right for the role. Hall, however, was good in her over-the-top role. All of the crew involved with the robbery did what they needed to do, but Marlon Wayans's character seemed to belong in a completely different movie. Although occasionally funny, his typical "angry black guy" role just didn't fit in.Some scenes seemed dragged out, especially in the church, and some meaningless scenes went on for fifteen minutes without even attempting to make us laugh. And that's the point of a comedy, isn't it? The Coen Brothers know how to make comedy. They just need to do it all the way through.My rating: 6/10Rated R for language including sexual references.</fullReview>

Stupid people aren't going to get half the jokes but they'll love the plot, while the smarter people will understand the jokes but will probably walk out. The end is surprising, because your not thinking the movie will turn that direction [and by that direction I mean good) but it should have stopped about 10 minutes earlier. oh, and its no mind blowing ending either.

		<shortDescription>To say the character Hanks plays is odd, would be an understatement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers have a sense of humor. Some people get it, some people don't. I'm a little quirky so I guess it's no surprise that I get their humor. If you don't know the Coen brothers by name, you have probably heard of some of their other films: "Raising Arizona", "Fargo", "The Big Lebowski", "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" and many others. "The Ladykillers" may not be their best film, but I laughed out loud many times during this movie.Tom Hanks plays Professor G. H. Dorr a con man. To say he is odd would be an understatement. Irma P. Hall plays Marva Munson who rents a room in her home to the Professor. Conveniently, there is a riverboat casino just blocks from the house where the Professor rents his room. He has hatched a plan to assemble a group of crooks (Wayans, Simmons, Hurst and Ma) to dig a tunnel from the basement of the house to the vault at the casino.This is a very unusual role for Hanks. He's an excellent actor, so I bought him in this role from the start. His laugh is funny and creepy at the same time. Marlon Wayans is responsible for a lot of the funniest one-liners, but Hall is wonderful as the owner of the house. I liked this film a lot, however it falls short of "Fargo" and "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?".If you enjoy off-beat humor, you will enjoy this film a lot. A word of caution, there is a lot of rough language here, so much that it received an "R" rating. If you are sensitive to four letter words, you might want to avoid this one.Watch for the changing expressions on the portrait in Marva's living room - hilarious! If you're still jonesin' for more Coen Brothers humor pick up "Fargo" on your way home. In my opinion, this is their best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Coens are back on form (nearly)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've sensed an anti-Coen brothers backlash building up recently. Most critics agree that they hit their peak with "Fargo" - though "The Big Lebowski" has a huge cult following - but their recent work has not garnered much praise. Indeed, "Intolerably Cruelty," though occasionally amusing, kinda sucked.And now here comes "The Ladykillers," already getting whacked by a number of critics who have grown impatient with the Coens' smarmy humor and lack of discipline (e.g. Ebert). But this movie does not deserve to get hit with the Coen backlash - oh no. While "Ladykillers" doesn't reach the heights of the brothers' work in the 1990s, it is, in fact, pretty damn hilarious. This time around, the critics are all wet.Sure, there's much to criticize here. A lot of the humor relies on stereotypes, which may make some people uncomfortable; personally, I detected enough irony that I was able to laugh without guilt. Let's face it, the Coens take aim at everybody here; they lampoon academics, church groups, bureaucrats, and even the foul-mouthed Wayans brother who annoys so many reviewers. Nothing is sacred here. As for the plot, it is indeed unevenly paced and lacking in traditional tension, but you know what? I'm not watching this movie for the plot; I'm delighting in the over-the-top dialogue and performances. If I want plot, I'll go watch a British movie (maybe the original "Ladykillers?").Enough of the semi-negatives. I saw brilliance in the way this movie juxtaposed opposite characters: an atheist academic with a pious Christian, an angry young man with a pompous middle-aged guy, etc. The film is full of great double acts. Granted, certain elements seem thrown in without having any particular relevance, but hey, that's just the chaos of life..."Chaos of life?" Time for me to end this review! All I can say is, I got the joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I miss something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this last night, and I was let down. Hanks is the only redeeming factor in this dark comedy trying to appeal to a family audience, while retaining some of that quirky Coen brothers charm. I am a fan of their work - my first experience was Raising Arizona, and it will continue to be the marker by which I judge all their films. To the point: this film is unfunny, wandering, and attempts to please too many types of audiences.As a caveat, I have not seen the original, but I am a fan of dark comedy, so let my bias be known. Someone commented that this film is similar to Hudsucker Proxy, but I would say that is an insult to Hudsucker, and the similarities are only in style. While HP had a great art deco/30's style, Ladykillers mixes time periods poorly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd as it sounds, you will probably either love it or hate it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit it has been a long time since I saw the original Alec Guinness version so I do not remember it all that well. This new LK can't match the casting of the original once you get past Tom Hanks and Irma Hall, wonderful in the character of "The Lady." After all, the 1955 version has Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom among the criminal plotters.Clichéd as it sounds, you will probably either love it or hate it and that may depend a lot on what you think of the performance by Hanks. Is his accent spot-on or irritatingly contrived? Is his "professor" over the top or just the eccentric you would expect in the role (in the original the character may have been deranged) and in a universe populated by the Coens? Are the mishaps and ironies dry wit and nicely tuned dark humor or is it all too self-conscious?Hanks arrives dressed as nearly as I can tell more like a southern gentleman out of a movie based in the 19th century. His alternately preternatural calm and edgily nervous affectations seem to suit his E. A. Poe-admiring, politely charming sociopath. His pathology is a very patient one, though, and it drives him to thoughts of actual violence only when pushed beyond his powers of persuasion.The high point other than Hall is the fine use of gospel music, nearly equal to the excellence in the Coens' "O, Brother, Where Art Thou?" It is particularly effective during the robbery sequence itself. I might like to see this again to see how it holds up on a second viewing but, for now, I am coming down on the side of positive interpretations of the questions above. If you are a Coen fan, it is worth seeking out when it opens. Even their flawed films usually have more than a little to recommend them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen Brothers return to bank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Ladykillers, the Coen brothers return to the genre that made them what they are today, screwball heist movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie although not as much as Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou, or The Big Lebowski.The acting is alright but nothing to write home about. Tom Hanks turns in a decent performance but definitely works as part of an ensemble rather than a stand alone star. Marlon Wayans plays the same character he played in Don't Be a Menace and Scary Movie. The real standout is J.K. Simmons, who was great on Oz. He is genuinely funny although some of his plot points seem very forced.The movie in general was very funny. I want to see it again as I couldn't hear alot of the lines because people were laughing too loud. I also want to see the original film to see how much of the movie was original Coen material and how much was taken from the Alec Guiness film.See Ladykillers, it's worth the trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amusing Tidbit from the Coen Bros.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not up there with "O Brother" or "Fargo," but definitely better than "Intolerable Cruelty." Best thing about it is the dialogue -- there are a lot of really funny lines (though some of it is hard to understand). The plot -- a remake -- is a basic black comedy crime caper story where a gang of oddballs gets together to steal a bunch of money from a casino and everything eventually goes wrong. Tom Hanks is solid -- his character is quite a creation -- and the old lady is funny too. Of course -- this being a Coen Bros. creation -- there are lots of minor characters who are really amusing. Marlon Wayans' character is annoying, though -- he's just sort of a typical p***ed-off, smart-ass, black guy. The cinematography is lovely, of course. And by the way, there is an AMAZING gospel choir and great gospel music throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The old woman is a more formidable antagonist than one had imagined."I'm a big fan of the Coens, and I'm always interested in a movie featuring the southern settings and people that I'm so familiar with. So, I can't help but be a little disappointed that The Ladykillers, which should be an excellent combination of both those things, isn't better than it is.Other than Tom Hanks' slimy and loquacious charmer and Irma P. Hall as the elderly religious lady who unwittingly serves as the foil for the would-be thieves of the story, The Ladykillers really has little of note to make it worthy of a recommendation. &nbsp;Only glimpses of the Coens' trademark style shine through from time to time. And surprisingly, other than the two characters I previously mentioned, the rest are unremarkable, boring, annoying, or all of the above.&nbsp;The always watchable Hanls pushes this southern-fried black comedy slightly above mediocrity, but one can't help but guess that the Coens' grasp of their subject matter didn't extend far beyond picking some good gospel music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries, but ultimately doesn't quite succeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These days, the caper movie features criminals of two sorts: high-tech thieves or numbskulls who think they're smarter than they are. The Coen Brothers' remake of "The Ladykillers" clearly falls in the latter category. That's okay, because the area is ripe for comic opportunities. Unfortunately, they're never fully realized.Professor G. H. Dorr, Ph. D. (Tom Hanks in a wonderfully over-the-top performance) rents a room from a little old lady (Irma P. Hall) to play church music with his "ensemble" (it's not a band). Really though, its just a cover to pull off a casino robbery with his cohorts (Marlon Wayans, J.K. Simmons, Tzi Ma, and Ryan Hudson). Of course, complications arise.The problem with "The Ladykillers" is that it's not as clever as it thinks it is. Some of the jokes/plot twists are amusing, but little else. That leaves the movie to land on the shoulders of its biggest star: Tom Hanks. For a while, it works. But after about halfway, it gets old, and the movie falters with it.The acting is fine. Tom Hanks is solid as the Professor, but again, he can't carry the movie for a whole 104 minutes. He is equally matched by Irma P. Hall, who is your standard little old lady that occupies these kinds of movies. The others try their best, but don't leave much of an impression.If you became a fan of the Coen's after "No Country for Old Men," this isn't the next movie of theirs that you should watch. That should be "Fargo."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sorry stolen title of a much loved original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the British original umpteen times and understanding the affection with which it is held in the UK, I fell into the trap of thinking that "The Ladykillers" would remain reasonably to the mood of the older version or at least tip it's cap to it. It didn't. I really can't understand why they used the original title except but to steal some of the goodwill that would inevitably accompany the name. It never caught my imagination, my sympathy and by the end I was resenting it. Too many films keep the name of the older version and do themselves a disservice in so doing. The remake is just half a stolen idea, the title is misrepresented and half the public, the older half, feel cheated. Pinch half the idea if you must but change the name. I ask you, would the public stand for a remake of "The Godfather"? Most remakes remain a huge disappointment. Please stop it or call it something totally different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but the Coen's usually do better than this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected more than this from Tom Hanks and the Coens. Most of the actors turn in an average performance, but Tom Hanks is great as usual. Unfortunately, Marlon Wayans was Razzie worthy. I know his character was supposed to be annoying, but he was so annoying and his dialogue so forced that it significantly detracted from the film. The humor is rather hit and miss, but has some really funny parts. The best gag is the running joke of the old African-American woman who writes checks to Bob Jones University (a far-right, unaccredited Christian college that is known for its racism). I thought the film dragged too much at some points, and could have been shortened a bit. The soundtrack, largely consisting of gospel music, gave the film an unusual (but good) feel to it.I give the movie a 6/10. Not great, but worth watching for a few laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Coen Brothers Bomb!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only bomb by the infamous Coen brothers. The rather impish film barley grossed its sparse 35 million budget in the US. Hard to believe the Coen brothers even directed this extremely light-hearted silly crime comedy. It bares none of the distinct markings of a real Coen brothers film. Most of all the casting is way off! Hanks is goodbut is never really given a chance to shine. The rest of the cast hands in rather cheap performances. But I can't imagine what else they could muster up for this crude tribute to the UK classic. Its all very strange considering that a well picked cast is the heart of any Coen brothers flick. Barry Sonefeld the Cinematographer on "Raising Arizona" and "Miller's Crossing" is listed here on "The Lady Killers" as producer. Can't imagine why he wouldn't of backed his money with his own skills behind the camera. Without him the Coen's have never really been the same. The wide scope and intense angles that B.S. brought to their earlier work is much need here. Too bad... and sorta sad. Looks like the Coen brothers handed this one in... well under cooked!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers have always been hit-and-miss. Raising Arizona - Good. Barton Fink - bad. Hudsucker Proxy - good. Fargo - overrated and unfunny. Big Lebowski - hilarious. etc., etc....This one, a remake of a 1955 Alec Guinness film, just didn't work for me. It seemed like it came so close a few times, but just didn't click. Part of the problem was that the comedy styles of Tom Hanks and Marlon Wayans just didn't work. Both can be funny in their own way, but they conflicted in this film, and not in a good way. And much like in O Brother, Where Art Thou, the filmmakers felt it necessary to bring the movie to a screeching halt every half hour to make us listen music, gospel this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmmmm... this movie was peculiar. For some reason, I don't think I quite got it. I think there was supposed to be more to the story than what appeared. I'm sure there was a deeper meaning and a deeper message than the one I perceived. You had a bantering renaissance man, a muscle bound lug head, a hoodlum, a chain smoking Asian guy, and a talkative guy with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) all trying to rob a casino. The cast of characters was a motley crew and none of them was particularly interesting. The plot was to rob a casino by tunneling to the casino vault through the basement of a spiritual old African American lady's house. The traditional old southern Black woman and the plot weren't all that intriguing either. This movie looked as if it were attempting to be a comedy, if so, it failed miserably. In the end, these bandits were more inept than the criminals in "Fargo". Like I said, I think I missed something, because the movie was unappealing and I only stayed tuned to see if the flawed five could accomplish their goal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coens are so stylish. Or so mainstream viewers and critics now say. Blood Simple was not enjoyable, but Raising Arizona is one of the best comedies ever.But after that, despite more recognition, it's been basically downhill. The Coens fit in the cracks between one genre and another and no one comes away satisfied.Tom Hanks lends credulity to this strange makeover of the 1955 classic with Guinness, Lom, and Sellers, but no matter how good his voices, Hanks can't compensate for the transplant or the total lack of humour.The Coens like to make their humour subtle, but that can backfire, especially if the humour is so subtle as to be nonexistent. As in this case.It's nice to find one's expectations fulfilled or even better: surpassed. But this one does neither. It's fickle writing without purpose, and the end result is a product that falls flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen the original "Lady Killers", so I cannot compare the movie to the first, so I have to judge this movie on it's own standards. "The Ladykillers" was over all a decent film, but wasn't well developed and in my opinion was a waste of some terrific actor's talents. I mean, while it has it's laughs and interesting plot lines, it just didn't really give me anything.Tom Hanks, everyone knows this and will always admit, he is one of the greatest actors in Hollywood. It seems like he could take on any role, but seems out of place in this one. He didn't have much to work with, the other actors who played his sidekick criminals, didn't really match with his performance. You didn't really feel for any of the characters, except for the old lady and Tom Hank's character, because none of the characters were well developed or were just plain not likable.This movie has too many obscenities that are very unnecessary, including the "n" word, in my tastes unless it is necessary to the plot is not needed and I don't like it. I mean, over all, if you have nothing better to do, I might recommend this, but looking at the original on the IMDb page, I might just want to go see that and forget this one ever happened.6/10</fullReview>

Even though there is the code of "honor among thieves" we find out that personal differences can erode this "sacred" institution all well!I would love to have seen the alternate ending with BJU debunked.

		<fullReview>Much like Intolerable Cruelty before it, the Coens' latest film relies on presupposition: inasmuch as the former capitalized on its audience's cynicism about marriage to communicate its satire, this remake of Alexander Mackendrick's 1955 comedy/crime caper assumes of its audience a working knowledge of genre tropes-particularly with noir-to orient themselves temporally before it zooms off into left field with an oblique meditation on spirituality/small-town entrapment/genre films that is as methodical and dark as anything the Coens have done.On first brush, the story is deceptively slight: an elderly church-going widow living in a mansion presided over by a portrait of the erstwhile patriarch is visited by an ingratiating figure looking for a room to let (Tom Hanks, who seems like he's shooting for the down-home erudition of Mark Twain and the preternatural look and appeal of Count Dracula). Like in Stanley Kubrick's The Killing, we are introduced to his would-be cronies, in a series of amusing situations that provides a glimpse of each character's personality and quirks. They begin drilling a hole in the cellar wall that will tunnel them directly into the riverboat's safe; along the inevitable way, they have some close-calls with the matriarch. They blow through the safe wall, the old woman discovers their plan, so they must kill her.Predictably, greed and fear prove divisive and the crooks begin dropping like flies-but decidedly unpredictably, the little old lady seems enveloped by a godly force that thwarts their best-laid and seemingly ineluctable plans. Example: A killer looms with piano wire over her sleeping figure. Mere inches from her neck, a Jesus figurine leaps from a clock, causing him to swallow his cigarette, choke on her dentures in a beside water glass and fall headlong down the stairs when Pickles the cat darts before his legs. I'm positive many critics will jump all over this scenario and others subsequently like it by citing it as part and parcel of the filmmakers' obsession with murderdeathkill (I wouldn't argue that they often highlight scenes of death as punch-lines illustrating the futility of their characters, a peculiar trait of auto-assassination and self-critique that seems enlisted for entertainment's sake)--and it is that, but to think the film's implications can and should be swallowed there is a mistake; the situation depends entirely too much on serendipity.As the bodies pile up, they are dropped from a bridge into a passing repository ship that moves languidly between the town and a trash-heap situated, ironically, on an idyllic island. The Coens' and cinematographer Roger Deakins are deliberately obscure in their depiction of the town--the downtown is a series of ramshackle shops with no signs of life, the police station is framed in medium close-up, a rectangle of bricks seemingly isolated, and the church sits atop a hill, an unspectacular white building--and signify it in a handful of archetypal shots, which signify entropy, a town without an identity, without spatial or temporal referent.The criminals die in increasingly unusual and unbelievable ways--Hanks, for his part, dies in a romantic triumph, concurrently the sole living proprietor of the stolen booty and reciting to himself a line of Poe. Looking up, he sees a raven situated atop a gargoyle, and we see the foundation is crumbling. As he continues the recitation, the statue falls and knocks him headlong into the boat, cruising to the rhythm and exact timing of his death; trash in, trash out. Crime doesn't pay, right? By following this time-honored platitude in as subversive and postmodern a way as possible, the Coens' deus ex machina is one completely informed by and keeping in strict compliance with genre code--they may have cheated to get there, but the Coens have made a true anomaly: an intellectually lazy and meta-textually provocative portraiture of life as a poor, confined genre piece. The inanimate genre as empathic character.</fullReview>

The movie includes a great variety of characters who play off each other in an extremely unique way. It really is a kind of odd and unrealistic story, but it all comes together. There is consistent humor. Although I do not know all of the character's names, they all do an excellent job.

		<shortDescription>The Coens' fall from grace?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we are, then - a new Coen Brother movie. That's always a cause for celebration - and this time they did it astoundingly quickly. I just saw Ladykillers, and frankly I'm slightly taken back by the bad reviews it got. Now, the way I see it, the film falls in a Grey area - it's far too commercial and mainstream for the Coens' fans, and too much of an oddball movie for those looking for a mainstream comedy. Certainly, this isn't the Coens at their best - there's no use comparing Ladykillers to masterpieces like Barton Fink, Big Lebowski, Fargo, Miller's Crossing, Hudsucker Proxy and O Brother, Where Art Thou? or even to lesser Coen projects like The Man Who Wasn't There, Intolerable Cruelty and Raising Arizona. In hindsight, Ladykillers probably is the duo's weakest offering to date. But even when the Coens are at their very worst, they're still the best around. Even when dealing with a weak storyline and one-dimensional characters - and for the first time in their career, the story isn't one of their own - their brilliant, one-of-a-kind scriptwriting and directing make up for it. Nobody writes - or directs - a dialogue like Joel and Ethan. And even though they weren't able to arouse sympathy for any of the characters - not even the charming old woman - they still created some unique, memorable, hilarious characters in the best Coen tradition. Tzi Ma (The Quiet American), Marlon Wayans (Requiem For A Dream), Ryan Hurst (Remember The Titans) and J. K. Simmons (Spider-Man) are each uniquely terrific as the band of robbers, and Irma P. Hall is wonderful and hilarious as a classic god-fearing Big Mama. The show-stopper is Mr. Tom Hanks who, as Professor G. H. Dorr, grants one of his most memorable performances. Tom Hanks' characters usually have a Tom Hanks attitude about them; for this role his disconnected from that, and truly I haven't enjoyed him this much since Forrest Gump. The Coens also do as gorgeous a job with recurring motives as they usually do - in this case, a cat, a hideous statue, and a portrait that seems to change a bit whenever you look at it. The surreal, oddball atmosphere of a Coen Brothers classic is still there - more so, I would say, than in Intolerable Cruelty and even The Man Who Wasn't There. The feeling and the style are there; unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, the film suffers from a weak plot, which only become hilariously funny in the last half hour.So you're more than welcome to follow the dozens of one and two star reviews on this page, if you like; I still think Ladykillers is well worth watching for Coen fans - AS LONG AS YOU REMAIN OBJECTIVE AND IGNORE THE COEN NAME ON IT! (Yeah, that's a tricky one, I know.) If you like the Coens' oddball humor and surrealism, just keep that 'oh, whatever happened to them?' thought out of your head and enjoy the movie. And I'm quite sure you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Just Pretend Allen Smithee Directed It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not recommend this movie to comedy fans and have, instead, included recommendations of better Coen Brothers films below. However...I do recommend The Ladykillers to aspiring filmmakers as a valuable study. This film is an excellent example of what happens when the director has problems getting all the actors (and production crew) to share the same vision for the TONE of the movie. In that respect, it is similar to "She Devil" where all of the actors had wildly different interpretations of the overall comedic tone. Both films illustrate how important it is for the director to NOT ONLY have a distinct vision but how essential it is to select a cast that share and support the director's interpretation of the material. In Hollywood film director's frequently replace their name with the moniker "Allen Smithee" on films they wish to be disassociated from. The Coen Brothers didn't in this case so you have to admire them for standing by it. Although this turkey does alter their otherwise near perfect run of creating some of the most distinctly unique films of their generation they still have a remarkable batting average. I would hate for this film to be anyone's introduction to the Coen Brother's otherwise brilliant body of work, so skip The Ladykillers unless you are viewing it as a lesson in what went wrong. If you are interested in exploring Coen Brothers comedies I suggest:"Oh Brother Where Art Thou" "Intollerable Cruelty" "Raising Arizona" "Barton Fink" ...which are all visually unique as well as side-splitting funny, and brilliantly executed. They all hit home runs with their pitch-perfect tone. I also loved Hudsucker Proxy but it isn't for everyone. Fans of 1930's screwball comedies are likely to appreciate it though. Jennifer Jason Leigh performance is an homage to screwball legend Kate Hepburn and the famous fast-talking literary wit Dorothy Parker. "The Big Lebowski" is especially appreciated by people familiar with Southern California culture but also a cult favorite with laid back dudes and underachievers everywhere. The bowling lane scenes with John Turturro are so visually quirky and hilarious you will laugh until your ribs hurt. Their excellent dramas include their debut "Blood Simple" and "Miller's Crossing." Last of all, if you have been trapped under a rock and somehow missed "Fargo" run as fast as you can and buy or rent it right now! It is the Coen Brother's creme-de-la-creme of film-making achievement.</fullReview>

The problem with this movie, in terms of its commercial appeal, is that the film's message is too overtly Christian for most secular viewers, and there is too much foul language for most Christians.Still, the bad guys get theirs in the end, and the protagonist, Irma P. Hall was absolutely perfect as Marva Munson.Just as they did in their earlier films, especially The Hudsucker Proxy and O Brother Where Art Thou, the message here is the struggle between good and evil, sin and salvation, with good decisively triumphing in the end.Unlike most contemporary movies, which would have ended with Marva driving off in a brand new Porsche or something, her joy at being told to keep the $1.6 million pilfered from the casino behind her home is because she can give it all to Bob Jones University to do the Lord's work.No wonder it only got an average 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious Hollywood Remake - Avoid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Ealing Studios produced in their height, some of British cinema's truly great comedies. Often staring Alec Guiness, Stanley Holloway or Alastair Sim, these films were comedy classics in every sense of the word. So, it shouldn't really be a surprise that in a modern Hollywood where so many films are sequels or remakes, that tedious and irritating remakes of classics are going to happen. In 2004, relocating the story from England to the American South, the normally decent Coen Brothers, have created an abominable remake of Ealing classic "The Ladykillers".Marva Munson (Irma P Hall) is your typical southern old lady. Widowed and spending most of her time at Church, Mrs Munson is a kind old lady who simply wants what's best for everybody. One day, the intellectual Professor G.H.Dorr (Tom Hanks) enters her life with a view to renting a room. Now as Mrs Munson continues her everyday life, the Professor and his partners in crime plot to steal a fortune from a casino. As you'd expect though, not everything runs to plan.It's often remarked that remakes are always inferior to the original. Whilst there are definite exceptions to the rule, the Coen Brothers' remake of "The Ladykillers" doesn't help the case for remakes. Relocated to a religious deep south, from the instant the music kicks in, the signs are there that this film is going to be annoying.From the introduction of the little old lady, the film continues to progress until the introduction of Hanks' character. Taking over from Alec Guiness, Tom Hanks, one of the finest actors of his generation, annoys from the instant that his character appears. Removing all of the tension that Guiness provided, this NEW professor is an Edgar Allan Poe fan who is so well educated, that often the characters don't have a clue what he says, and we don't care. Worse of all is the characters laugh. Sounding like an asthmatic schoolboy, Hanks manages to somehow make an already annoying character, even more infuriating. To his credit, Hanks has gone on record as saying he never watched the original before this remake, purely so that he wasn't biast. A noble thought and an idea which some stars of remakes should take on board. In this case however, perhaps Hanks might have been better studying the exemplary performance by Guiness. He might have learnt a thing or two.Another major flaw with this film is just how infuriating the supporting performances by Marlon Wayans and J.K. Simmons are. Wayans spends his entire screen time acting like he's "cool" and forever swearing. There's nothing wrong with a film containing swearing when it's appropriate (comedies like "South Park" and more serious films like "Reservoir Dogs"), but throughout this film Wayans is at it non-stop and often it's completely irrelevant and pointless. J.K. Simmons as well also annoys from his first appearance. Originally giving the impression of being the remake equivalent of Major Courtney from the original, Simmons plays a character who spends large amounts of his time suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Whatever the feelings of a person towards this condition, the way this film constantly has Simmons needing the toilet is neither funny or relevant. It is yet another pointless addition to a script designed to force laughter out of a public who know better.On a positive note, it is true that the way the film introduces the characters by giving them their own little back history is cleverly done, and Tzi Ma as The General is funny throughout. Ma's trick of hiding the cigarette in his mouth is definitely overused, but there are reasons behind it's consistency, and by constantly keeping a stern face and sporting an Adolf Hitler moustache, he does stand out as being one of the few bright points in this woeful film.If a remake is done well, so remarkably rare that you'd think Hollywood would learn it's lesson by now, then it can be a rewarding encounter. Sadly though, this Americanised remake of a British classic is not just bad, but hideous. Led by a surprisingly dire Tom Hanks, it grates on the nerves throughout, and by the end you wonder whether the Coen Brothers should ever be allowed to work in Hollywood again. This is a film which should be avoided at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's wrong with this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the original LadyKillers, I knew from IMDb that this remake hadn't made grade, but we eventually got to see it anyway. One reviewer said "It's not easy to pinpoint what's wrong". Well I know a few reasons. Tom Hanks (my favorite actor) is unconvincing (stinks?). In the original film, the robbery goes perfectly to plan, and then everything takes place in the house, which becomes more and more claustrophobic. Only Garth starts to develop as a character. They key character is supposed to be the black "Old Lady", but she is not naive enough. In the remake everything is bitty, nothing gels. There were a few really funny moments, but somehow a lack of passion and belief. Filmmakers please don't remake or sequel the classics eg Alfie/The Matrix/Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever you think of this movie you have to admit it has the feel of a Coen brothers movie in the way that it unites odd characters with the south, all having their own quirks and charms. I have not seen the original - though I plan to since this is supposedly vastly different.MINOR SPOILERSThe problem was that the Coens' do not know how to portray black people well, and it shows indeed in this film (and explains why they rarely appear in their other films) with Irma P. Hall's character and particularly Marlon Wayans' character. I do not blame the acting, in fact everyone did fine for what their roles were, but Wayans' character swore a blue streak but it was stereotypical black male speech and wasn't funny (and seemed particularly out of place with the rest of the film, as was the case with the commercial director scene as well) whereas Irma P. Hall's character was a "mammy" character who is gullible and blindly religious. Other blacks in the film were also stereotyped - small time criminals, abusive parents and zealous church folk, both different extremes, but extremes nonetheless. Also, I wish that the music from the gospel choir factored into the movie more than it did - it seemed like an excuse to put music in but didn't seem organic as the Coens have done in their other films (i.e. O Brother Where Art Thou?). I also was beginning to really feel sympathy for Wayans' character when his childhood is explained but then all is lost as Hall's character slaps him a few more times - which seemed like it would have provoked Wayans to shoot her rather than associate her with his mother, whom he seems to fear as a child yet love (?) as an adult.That's not to say this movie wasn't funny, so long as you like dark comedy (including but not limited to: dogs dying, thumbs getting blown off, several murders, accidental deaths and suicides and several injuries and childhood trauma). It did seem like it was trying really hard to be funny at certain parts, but there were some also really well filmed scenes - in particular I really enjoyed the introduction of Lump's character since it is all POV and reminded me of Bill Plympton's animation style, only in live action...too bad that Lump's character was otherwise needless and undeveloped. What makes this film great, aside from the performances (Hanks was particularly interesting to watch since he was not only a villain but also over the top) is the spectacular cinematography which really sells the feel of the romanticized modern south, which the Coens are well known for.All in all this is a decent film, not great, not bad. Worth a watch for Coen brothers and/or dark comedy fans. But you only need to see it once.OVERALL RATING: 6 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a matter of taste, and many will not like 'The Ladykillers' by the Coen brothers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Ladykillers' has a style similar to 'O Brother Where Art Thou'. Tom Hanks plays his character much like the Chinaman in the Nepalese bar in Indiana Jones, smiling and rapidly breathing as he talks, in very flowery prose. He finds a older single black lady who has a room to rent, but more importantly, a root cellar! The music team don't really practice in that root cellar, their plan is something much bigger. A very quirky movie, many will not appreciate, but I found it a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining dark comedy. Tom Hanks is superb in a very different role for him. On DVD, a loan from my local public library.SPOILERS FOLLOW, do not read if you haven't seen the movie yet. Really!!There is a floating gambling casino down at the river, but all the money is kept in a small, heavily guarded brick building on shore. The plan is for these 5 erstwhile musicians to pretend to be practicing in the root cellar, but in fact tunneling to the wall of the fortress. Each of the 5 has a specialty, and must execute his correctly for the team effort. Tunnel to the outer wall, steal the money, brick and plaster the hole for the inside, set off explosives to collapse the tunnel so that it cannot be traced to the house.Bad guys get killed here and there, and the disposition is always the same -- drop the body over the bridge railing as the garbage barge passes under. The heist is pulled, the $1.2Million is in the root cellar, but the old lady suspects something. They try to bribe her, but being an honest, church-going woman, will only agree to turning it in. However, in a series of funny missteps, each of the 5 crooks die, she is left with the money, goes to the local police with her story, they don't believe her, humor her by saying, "Why don't you just keep the money!"The DVD has a very interesting extra on Danny Ferrington of Louisiana, who made from scratch all the ancient instruments featured in the crooks' scam. He is a real life master string instrument maker, and has made guitars for many music professionals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film, and don't worry about the language.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I find offensive is people who are offended by language. It's only words, folks, after all. After thousands of years of civilization, you'd think that people would know that words aren't magic, and that they can't really hurt anyone. This is not the original. In fact, the credits say that it is based upon "The Movie The Ladykillers." Sort of the way "Rat Race" uses the same basic schtick as "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", this film uses the same basic setup as the 1955 English movie. There's just no reason to expect it to be like the original except in basic concept, and if you want Alec Guiness as the star, that's why the original is still for sale or rent. The language is what many consider vulgar, but the word vulgar just means "of the people" in its Latin root, so if the way people speak offends you, then I guess you should avoid this film. If not, then I'd say go for it because it's fresh and funny. If your mother doesn't like it, don't make her watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers can do better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, this is the remake of the 1955 Alexander Mackendrick classic starring Alec Guinness, in what is perhaps my favorite role of his. This Coen Brothers update is one of their weakest films, my second least favorite after the execrable O Brother. That doesn't mean it's terrible. It's actually quite decent. The direction and look are fine, the use of music is wonderful, and Tom Hanks gives a delightful performance. It would have been easier to simply copy Guinness' perfection, but Hanks creates something new. Irma P. Hall is good as the landlady (now a religious black woman from the South), and J.K. Simmons is funny as a demolitions expert, but the rest of the cast just stinks. Marlon Wayans is particularly annoying as one of the most stereotypical black characters I've seen in movies lately. Of course, the Wayans Brothers have been degrading their own race for more than a dozen years now, so what's new in that? The Coens make huge mistakes in their script. The original film has the heist finish up within its first 20 minutes or so, a fact which I highly praised back when I saw it. The Coens stretch it out to 1 hour 20 minutes, and then the last 20 minutes has the criminals trying to take care of the old lady. What a p*ss-poor choice, so bad that I can't believe the Coens, usually among the best screenwriters of their time, wrote it. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original film has little to do with my rather poor impression of this one. It just simply was not up to scratch. The Coen brothers have, in this movie, produced a tired, unfunny and altogether unnecessary film.Tom Hanks is in "amusing" mode here, but he has not really got what it takes to pull off such an interesting character, in fact he is rather too flaccid. He is better off playing rather stolid roles, which is why things like The Terminal will suit him better, a blank canvas on which to dollop his blankness.The remainder of the cast are plainly sub William.H.Macy style losers drafted in to try and round out the cast, I was particularly disappointed with Wayans who seemed not to realise he was not playing in Scary Movie IV.I cannot think of one thing positive about this movie. Even the set-piece comedy (Irritable bowel syndrome, farts, the severed finger) failed to register on any device other than the boredometer. Frankly the cat was the best actor on show. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb Hanks performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this film in a strange state of mind. I loved the original and hated the thought of a remake. But, I also love the work of the Coen's and if anybody could do a half decent remake - it would be them. Sadly the film never really works. Firstly the film never seems to decide what time period it wants to belong to. The setting, the amount of money stolen and Hanks' character all seem to belong in at least the 1950s and this rubs horribly with Wayans' character and a lot of the dialogue. If the film had managed to create an out of time feel for itself then this wouldn't have been a problem. Instead it often feels as if characters have wandered in from a different screenplay. The film also lacks charm in a lot of places. Irma P Hall has been praised for her performance and rightly so, but the character itself never feels believable. She is too similar to the criminals for her to work as a believable foil. There are funny moments in this film and Hanks is a delight. A truly bizarre creation that will hopefully help to bury the persona Hanks has created for himself over the last few years. For me this was his finest performance since Big. The Coen Bros seem to be on a low streak of late. Neither this nor Intolerable Cruelty were bad films but they were more films of good scenes and performances than a complete movie. Hopefully they'll regain greatness with their next outing. See this film, if only for Hanks. But then go straight out and watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the Coen boys have taken the easy route by nicking someone else's idea and the critics have pounced. British critics especially, since they've dared to pilfer one of our Ealing comedies which is like sneezing over the Crown Jewels. But this remake isn't so much sacreligious as just plain lazy.Overall, this is an enjoyable lark, but while the playfulness is catching and Tom Hanks is an eccentrically erudite delight, the build-up is staccato, the denouement feels rushed and the dialogue is hit-and-miss. Disappointingly, from filmmakers whose reputation is based on originality, there are precious few Coen moments here (and some of those are lifted from elsewhere, e.g. the portrait that changes expression ? Young Frankenstein; the body part-snatching animal ? Wild At Heart).And since the Coens have obviously decided to stick with the original's tone of genteel mischief, Marlon Wayans' boy-from-the-hood is a huge misjudgement and ?Mountain Lady' is a pointless distraction. There is also a terrible edit after Dorr's poetry recital which smacks of a hastily ditched scene. Come on fellas, don't get sloppy on us; we'll watch anything you care to make ? with ?care' being the operative word.</fullReview>

Many parts of the movie seemed to drag on and almost every plot twist was rather predictable. Most of the humorous parts were all that appeared in the preview, and the duration of the movie was rather dry. The fact that Tom Hanks was in it helped a little, and it was rather interesting to see him take on the role of Dorr because it was something out of the ordinary for him. However, even that grew old after a time, and Dorr's distinctive laugh started to grate at my nerves. The pinnacle of the disappointment though was certainly the ending, there was no action, and the resolution definitely did not leave me satisfied.</fullReview>

I would recommend that you watch this film if you are a Hanks fan, but do not expect it to be his very best performance at all. If you prefer Hanks in the emotional/goody state watch something else like The Green Mile or Sleepless In Seattle, this is not a film like those two at all.

Don't waste your time or money on this one, not even on DVD.While Hanks stays true to his part, there really seems to be no purpose to the movie. It is the story of a gang of miscreants headed by Hanks who plan a subterranean heist of a riverboat casino's counting room. The gang pretends to practice for their band in the root cellar of an elderly African American widow's home. She is oblivious to the dastardly deeds going on in her cellar, until the end.The ending is a bit too predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grace of the Deus ex Machina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like Intolerable Cruelty before it, the Coens' latest film relies on presupposition: inasmuch as the former capitalized on its audience's cynicism about marriage to communicate its satire, this remake of Alexander Mackendrick's 1955 comedy/crime caper assumes of its audience a working knowledge of genre tropes?particularly with noir?before it zooms off into left field with an oblique meditation on spirituality/small-town entrapment/genre films that is as methodical and dark as anything the Coens have done.At first glance, the story is deceptively slight: an elderly church-going widow living in a mansion presided over by a portrait of the erstwhile patriarch is visited by an ingratiating figure looking for a room to let (Tom Hanks, who seems like he's shooting for the down-home erudition of Mark Twain and the preternatural look and appeal of Count Dracula). As in Kubrick's The Killing, we are introduced to his would-be cronies through a series of amusing situations that provides a glimpse of each character's personality and quirks. They begin drilling a hole in the cellar wall that will tunnel them directly into the riverboat's safe; along the inevitable way, they have some close calls with the matriarch. They blow through the safe wall, the old woman discovers their plan, and so they must kill her.Predictably, greed and fear prove divisive and the crooks begin dropping like flies?but decidedly unpredictably, the little old lady seems enveloped by a godly force that thwarts their best-laid and seemingly ineluctable plans. Example: a killer looms with piano wire over her sleeping figure. Mere inches from her neck, a Jesus figurine leaps from a clock, causing him to swallow his cigarette, choke on her dentures in a beside water glass and fall headlong down the stairs when Pickles the cat darts before his legs. I'm positive many critics will jump all over this scenario and others subsequently like it by citing it as part and parcel of the filmmakers' obsession with murder-death-kill (I wouldn't argue that they often highlight scenes of death as punch-lines illustrating the futility of their characters, a peculiar trait of auto-assassination and self-critique that seems enlisted for entertainment's sake)?and it is that, but to think the film's implications can and should be swallowed there is a mistake; the situation depends entirely too much on serendipity.As the bodies pile up, they are dropped from a bridge into a passing repository ship that moves languidly between the town and a trash heap situated, ironically, on an idyllic island. The Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins are deliberately obscure in their depiction of the town?the downtown is a series of ramshackle shops with no signs of life, the police station is framed in medium shots, a rectangle of bricks seemingly isolated, and the church sits atop a hill, an unspectacular white building?showing it in a handful of archetypal shots, which collectively signify entropy, a town without an identity, without spatial or temporal referent.The criminals die in increasingly unusual and unbelievable ways. Hanks, for his part, dies in romantic triumph, concurrently the sole living proprietor of the stolen booty and reciting to himself a line of Poe. Looking up, he sees a raven situated atop a gargoyle, and we see the foundation is crumbling. As he continues the recitation, the statue falls and knocks him headlong into the boat, cruising to the rhythm and exact timing of his death; trash in, trash out. Crime doesn't pay, right? By following this time-honored platitude in as subversive and postmodern a way as possible, the Coens' deus ex machina is one completely informed by and keeping in strict compliance with genre code. They may have cheated to get there, but the Coens have made a true anomaly: a convention-compliant, meta-textually conversant portrait of life as a poor, confined genre piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colorful and decent attempt by the Coen brothers in remaking "The Ladykillers", a British black comedy made in the mid-fifties that starred the late Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, and Hebert Lom.Tom Hanks is marvelously cast in the Guinness role as G.H. Dorr, a professor (with a weaselly charm and whiny laugh) who rents a small room (while leading a small quartet of thieves and plotting to rob a casino) in the home of a quiet elderly widow, Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall).The only down part of the movie is use of the foul language in when and how it said takes some of the fun away from the film - notably one of the men in Dorr's team, Gawain (Marlon Wayans who was great in "Scary Movie", but very questionable here) delivers most of it.Hanks and Hall both deliver great performances here and Hall presents of the same kind of charm and kindness that you see in anybody. Ah, yes, Marva's cat, Pickles, has a few good moments in the movie, too. The other key part of the film that I enjoyed was use the of gospel music."The Ladykillers" may not be the best work done by the Coen brothers, but it's worth the money.</fullReview>

However the movie maintains suspense and a fast pace which hold the viewer's attention. Tom Hanks as the Professor is especially effective, and his pretended dignity contrasts well with the humorous aspects of his role.The leading lady maintains a very real dignity throughout the story, which contrasts with the sometimes outrageous conduct of the other characters. Although there is some violence, it does not dominate the story. This year's "Ladykillers" compares well with the 1955 original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, my favorite three movies are The Big Lebowski, Fargo, and O' Brother Where Art Thou?. But The Ladykillers was a sad sad disappointment. It lacked all character building so you feel nothing for the people you're watching on screen. Marlan Waynes is by far the most type cast, over animated actor I've ever seen. I was just very sad to leave a Coen Brothers movie wondering why the hell I had sat through the whole thing. The only thing that prevented me from leaving was the people to the right and left of me in the aisle. Although the amount of people in the theater definitely didn't stop the other half of the patrons to show their distaste by getting up and walking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another delicious offering from the Coen Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not my favorite Coen Brothers film ? any film would be hard pressed to top `Fargo' ? it harkens back to the deliciously wicked dark humor of that great film. Tom Hanks is wonderful as the ring leader of the (mostly) inept and colorful gang of thieves who plan to rob a riverboat casino ? if they can get past Hanks' strong-willed, bible-thumping elderly landlady. The Ladykillers is quintessential Coen Brothers ? a seemingly straight-forward plot gone horribly wrong, bizarre characters and since the Big Lebowski, a rousing soundtrack ? this time it's gospel music that literally made me want to start moving my feet and clap. I found the character played by Marlon Wayons a bit over the top, even for a Coen film, but the other supporting players, (namely `The General') more than make up for that slight shortcoming. This is a hard one to recommend, because while I laughed so hard my stomach hurt through a lot of the film, the humor is so dark that if I had any sense of shame I would be embarrassed that I laughed as HARD as I did at WHAT I did.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stale for the most part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be impossible to dislike a film like this considering who made it and who stars in it but I kept asking myself if the comedy that was presented to me on screen was original? For the most part it's not. Story is about a thief in Mississippi named Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr (Tom Hanks) who rents a room from an elderly woman named Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall) but Dorr really wants to use her root cellar to tunnel into a riverboat casino and rob it. Dorr tells her that he is part of a band that plays religious music and that they will use her cellar to practice in. The rest of his cohorts are Pancake (J.K. Simmons), The General (Tzi Ma), Lump (Ryan Hurst), and Gawain (Marlon Wayans) and they all bring their expertise to the heist.*****SPOILER ALERT*****After succeeding in stealing over a million dollars and covering up the tunnel Mrs. Munson finds out who they really are so now they decide to kill her but this proves to be a much more difficult task than it appears.This film is directed by Ethan and Joel Coen and it's one of the reasons why this keeps from being a complete failure. The other reason is the casting of Hanks in a role so over the top that it does become fun to watch and he genuinely seems to be having the time of his life portraying a character that seems to have jumped out of "Gone With The Wind". Hall is a delight as the church going widow who often talks to the painting of her deceased husband and the expression on the face of the painting often changes depending on the events. Hall is a believable force and we can all agree that she would be trouble for anyone but even her character is not solidly written. The rest of the cast comes across as more cartoonish than funny and their is no subtle actions by any of them. Did the film really need Simmons character to have irritable bowel syndrome? I think we can all agree that this film is not one of the better efforts by the Coen brothers when they resort to bathroom humor. But on the other hand the film does offer their trademark dark humor and the disposing of all the bodies is an example of that. I can't argue with anyone that tells me they find this funny because the actors are all fun to watch on a very silly level but I found this to be a more stale effort considering the amount of talent involved behind it. The original 1955 film with Alec Guinness was more subtle and droll but this remake is wildly animated and over the top. This comedy is more depending on your type of humor but I do think that there are to many uninspired scenes. Also, that's Eddie Murphy in a wig as the church choir director in an uncredited cameo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to the Coen Brothers' cleverness and originality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As if the title isn't enough to get the gist of my critique . . . I am at a loss, after last year's dismal "Intolerable Cruelty" and now "The Ladykillers," as to where the Coens' storytelling and stylization prowess has gone. There are hints of their classic morbidly funny style in "The Ladykillers," but those small hints, plus constant collaborator T-Bone Burnett's musical supervision, are the only reminders that you are watching a Coen Brothers movie, or even a movie of the Coen Brothers caliber.What made "Miller's Crossing," "Fargo," "Barton Fink," "Raising Arizona," "O Brother, Where Art Thou" and "The Big Lebowski" such great films is the Coen Brothers' greatness at writing clever scripts that pay homage to and satirize many different genres in film. As strange as Coen Brothers characters are in these movies, they aren't caricatures per se. They have dreams, dilemmas and dimensions. You'd be hard-pressed to find a well-written character in "The Ladykillers." Tom Hanks is fun as an erudite Southern gentleman criminal, but you can see that he's clearly trying too hard. And he's the most defined and complete character in the film. The idea of the Coen Brothers resorting to stupid bathroom humor is appalling. Are they simply phoning in their efforts to make a bigger Hollywood paycheck? "Let's use bigger Hollywood names, get outside help in writing boring Hollywood-reject scripts, and draw bigger box office dollars while working less?" Do they have another full-time job that requires their attention?The Coen Brothers used to write their own scripts and come up with their own ideas, even when they were adapting from another medium. I simply don't know what they're doing any more, other than really slipping in their craftsmanship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT movie but it's still not "The Dude"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was an excellent movie and WELL worth what I paid to see it. The Kohen Brothers never disappoint and this is the first performance by Hanks that I've really enjoyed in quite some time. Irma Hall was excellent and the most endearing character I've connected with at the movies this year. Marion Wayans was hysterical as always and an excellent choice to be cast as Gawain McSam. And although it may seem a small detail I really loved the opening and closing scene shots of "Trash Island" and the "Garbage Ferry". However, I must say that the Kohen Brothers have yet to top "The Big Lebowski" but I would say this movie definitely a vast improvement on the others that are out right now. The script and acting are brilliant and this is by far the best comedic film of the year. Go see it and take friend or family member as it's sure to make you laugh! ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cohen Bros: no longer a sign of taste in filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm used to automatically seeing anything associated with the Cohen Brothers. The previews for The Ladykillers made it look like a charming, Southern US, caper film. Sure enough, there were plenty of grey-haired folks in the theatre. I can't imagine they expected the constant MF swearing from one of the characters.This is a remake of the 1955 hit UK film of the same name starring Peter Sellers and Alec Guiness. The new version relies on repetitive gag humour and the clash between a conservative Christian woman and a foul-mouthed, "hippity-hop" criminal, to get most of its laughs. Some of the other supporting cast members are nothing but dumb cliches (big, dumb jock, quiet, sly Communist Chinese General, etc.) Tom Hanks plays the role of ring leader as if he were a cartoon character. There's really no intrigue or really good humour in this obvious Cohen Brothers sellout. Not a must-see film.by Triniman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen Brothers - More bad than good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another disappointment from the Coen Brothers. I'm giving up on them. Aside from Fargo and The Big Lebowski, they really haven't impressed me much as writers, directors or producers. The LadyKillers is no exception. If you really want to see the funny parts, just watch the trailer. If you just "have to see this movie," then wait for it to come out on DVD. It's absolutely not worth the $7.50. It's actually downright boring. 750 thumbs DOWN!Hanks was great as usual, but even his amazing abilities couldn't save this incredibly boring script. The movie is Rated R for language, but the language was completely unnecessary. It was almost as if the Coen Brothers knew the script was bad, so they threw in a bunch of useless expletives to enhance the black janitor stereotype (Wayans is really the only one who curses the entire movie). Terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although nothing was 'wrong' with the movie; nothing was all that 'right' either. Nothing about the movie sparked my interest. It caught me as an old-school, korny and somewhat low budget comedy. The only thing I was surprised by was the foul language that was woven throughout the movie; not because it offends me but because I wasn't expecting Tom Hank to be part of that movie.Overall I gave it a 6.0/10.0. I think I was being generous as it almost put my partner to sleep.In then end, I suggest waiting until you've seen everything else...then rent it :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Coen's best, but still good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel and Ethan seem to be sliding a bit from the earlier brilliance demonstrated by such films as "Miller's Crossing" or "The Hudsucker Proxy." Their films of late have contained weaker plots and less fulfilling pay-offs which could be attributed to the fact that their last two movies have been remakes. "Intolerable Cruelty" was re-written and cleaned up by the Coens and then produced. "The Ladykillers" was an old 1955 British movie that the Coens bought the rights to and re-vamped. While all the Coen signs are there (witty dialogue, character development, dialects, etc.) the movie still lacks in the area of the final pay-off.Each of the final incidents of the film get farther and farther from reality. The film opens on a realistic note and closes with a strangely pieced together "deux ex machina." The stereotypical Coen darkness is still in tact, but it comes at a much heavier price considering the fact that is breaks the otherwise believable mold of the film.Tom Hanks is amazing in the film. His accent and acting have never been better, and he should be nominated for an Oscar for the work he obviously put into his character. The music is wonderful, reminiscent of the "O Brother Where Art Thou?" soundtrack while being completely contemporary. None of the script suffers, as the witty banter between the characters is never lost on the audience. The Coens also do a wonderful job of mixing the high and low comedy, using word puns and double entendre from Tom Hanks and physical comedy from Marlon Wayons and J.K. Simmons.Overall, the film is enjoyable to watch and is better than your average run-of-the-mill Hollywood comedy. But for the Coens', it is disappointing. As a big fan, I expect to see the same greatness that made "Fargo" a sleeper hit and "Miller's Crossing" a cult classic. Unfortunately, the Coens have not been living up to their earlier brilliance, which may be difficult since their earlier films were nearly flawless. I give "The Ladykillers" a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this film to be a dark satire. It's about 5 criminals who use the hospitality of an elderly black lady to mastermind the robbery of a casino. Tom Hanks was very good as GH Dorr, a fancy talking man of many degrees. He sweet talks Ms. Munson and is the brains of the group. His entourage includes the general (whose introduction is funny with the fingers up the nose), the muscle ( a dumb jock), the explosion expert, and an insider at the casino. They meet in Ms. Munson's basement and pretend to play music while they dig the tunnel.The arguments between them are funny as well as the ways they try to hide the scheme. And the gospel music was entertaining. It added to the film. Since the movie is more of a satire than a comedy, it's not laugh out loud funny, all through I did some; instead it just makes you smile with what they are up to. And once again Tom Hanks plays a great character and was a perfect choice.FINAL VERDICT: This movie was better than reviews made it out to be when it was in theaters. I recommend it as a good choice if you're looking just for an entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Score: Coen Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** The Perfect Score: Coen Style ***POSSIBLE SPOILERSI went to see the teen movie The Perfect Score about a month before seeing this movie, and to be quite honest; there wasn't much of a difference.Both movies focused around a group that are unknown to each other and come together to pull a difficult heist, one for SAT answers, the other for adult themes, money. Both have one Asian, one Black guy and one-dimensional characters that give us nothing more than a bland comedy that vainly tries to be more than it is. The only notable difference is that there are not any girls in the Ladykiller's gang (unless you count Mountain Girl) and that the IMDB uses will give this better rating because the name Coen is attached to it.It seems, however, that our good indie friends the Coen Brothers have found themselves in a bit of a rut. Either that or the success of O' Brother has flattened their taste a bit. Either way, Ladykillers is, at least to me, the worst movie they have put to screen yet. I say this with a great deal of despair since I own each release they have put out since their original Blood Simple.Tom Hanks is over-the-top as The Professor, a Latin reading, Edgar Allan Poe reciting, charming double-talking sociopath who rents a room from a church going black Mississippi lady who has a basement that just happens to be the ideal place to stage a casino robbery. Normally I enjoy over-the-top, hammy villain performances such as Al Pachino's Big Boy Caprice in Dick Tracy and Anthony Hopkins in the two post-Silence Of The Lambs movies, Red Dragon and Hannibal. Hanks was different somehow, in that, although charming, he didn't exude the right flavor to entice my morbid curiosity towards hammy villains. In the realm of double-talkers though, George Clooney was much, much better in O' Brother.With character names like The Professor, The General, Garth Pancake, Mountain Girl and Lump, you know these guys aren't going to be the most fleshed out of characters. In fact, I would say that this movie has the worst stereotypes of any Coen Brothers movie. They've had stereotypical characters before, but have always put a unique spin on either the character or how they are used in this movie.Other problems: the casting was weak. Marlon Waynes is not up to the Coen's stage-like script format, slurs too many words, cusses too harshly and in general cannot act past a stupid hardheaded scoundrel thug-wannabe potsmoking scumbag. His best performance of the movie was after he was shot and face didn't flicker when he died; I was impressed that he could do it. J.K. Simmons as Garth Pancake was also an annoyance. His weak bowels leaked towards the silly fart humor that I didn't expect nor want to see out of a Coen Brothers film. His testimonies towards his condition were laughable in a bad way. Jon Polito would have done a better job with the role and I hope he was unavailable to do the film so I could extend some credibility. The General, played by Tzi Ma and Lump, played by Ryan Hurst are one star characters. Who knows if they could of acted better if they weren't delegated to cheap one-liners without any true explanation as to why they're there. Both are capable with the comedy timing, but both grew thin and wearisome by the end.The church scenes were useless. The gospel music will entice any fan of the said genre, however, for the sake of the movie it was nothing more than filler material. It didn't drive the plot, set the mood or a standard. The only plot device it held was that it showed Irma leaving the church early so she could set-up tea for her church friends and accidentally soil a near-perfect casino robbery. But we didn't need a five minute gospel hymn to show us that. Ten to fifteen seconds would have been sufficient. It is possible that the Coans are trying to cash in on some more potential soundtrack money after the unexpected success of the O' Brother soundtrack. Where that movie was cute and clever with it's usage of music, this is blowing towards the direction of a prettily shot documentary of the Mississippi black church community.I miss the Coen regulars. Francis and the aforementioned Jon hasn't been around since The Man Who Wasn't There, Steve Buscemi and John Goodman haven't been seen since The Big Lebowski, if I'm not mistaken and John Turturro since O' Brother. With the chemistry these people must have from working together, or at least, around each other for so long, it makes it seem that this new bunch lacks the necessary developed work relationship to make scenes work as well as they did in the past.One thing, though, is people's complaints about the language of this movie, and then compares it to The Big Lebowski. Does anyone not remember Walter's relationship with Donny? This is not the first foul-mouthed Coen Brothers movie and we'll probably get another one down the line. Who cares and why? No one called this family material.All in all, even though, unlike Cruel Intentions and The Hudsucker Proxy, which are also Coen Brothers Lite, this ultimately fails. I hope next time they decide to take a little more time in-between movies and give us something a little more worth while to watch. It's a good thing we still have the original to watch, those of us that are willing to watch something nearly fifty years old at the time of this writing.I suppose it's time to wish for the good old days of Miller's Crossing and Raising Arizona. 5/10~Joe</fullReview>

A number of scenes which revealed details about their characters were more like diversions than contributions to the movie. The gospel music was energetic, but not relevant to the movie.The newspaper ad headlined with "Hilarious! An early contender for Best Picture of the Year!" (Jim Svejda, KNX/CBS Radio). Sadly, I think that he must have watched another movie entirely. The only time that I found myself chuckling during movie was in disbelief.

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Marva Munson (Irma P Hall) is an up-front elderly lady who has just been approached by a charming, well-spoken Southern gentleman named Professor GH Dorr (Tom Hanks) to rent space in her house. Little does she know that Dorr and his associates, in the guise of a musical band, are plotting to rob a casino and are using her basement as an operating lair. When she finds out, however, it becomes a desperate quest to kill her before she blabs to the authorities.The Ladykillers is yet another Hollywood re-make of another old (and British!) movie that was before my, and no doubt many others, time. So you can't watch it and appreciate it fully without knowing the greatness of the original (I just can't wait for the day when I'm a bit older and I'll be able to point out how new films are nowhere near as good as the ones they were re-making from my day.) Or maybe you can.It's an alright film on it's own. I can see how some might say Hanks was over-acting, hamming it up and generally being rather embarrassing, but to me he just about managed to be as adept (if not quite as great!) as he ever was. The supporting cast are very good too, them managing to be more funny than the more assured presence of Hanks in the lead role. It's a funny film in parts, and distinctly Coen brothers all the way. And it seems to follow the engaging 'we-all-fall-down' premise from Reservoir Dogs with regards to the elimination of the crooks.So yeah,quite good. Not brilliant and no doubt far from the Coen brothers best work, but fairly pleasing all the same.***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Coen Brothers comeback (but still a little off)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that The Ladykillers is the first time I've really enjoyed a Coen Brothers movie since Fargo. I found that with their last few movies, it was mostly focused on quirky characters and unusually amusing circumstances. That is of course what the Coen's do best, but for a while now they've lost focus on stories. That was the big problem with Intolerable Cruelty. And while I do say that this is the first time I've really enjoyed one of their movies since Fargo, I still think Ladykillers came up short in a lot of ways. The script and their direction puts them back on track, yet I wonder if the Coen's will ever capture the brilliance they displayed so well in Fargo and Raising Arizona.Tom Hanks does give one of his most interesting performances ever. I would say that no other actor could have pulled off something this different, but honestly, I don't know how Tom Hanks even pulled it off. He's so eccentric and complicated. Hanks took a fantastically scripted character and injected an excessive amount of personality into it. The Coen's have a gift for writing the smartest and most original dialogue. If Hanks does get an Oscar nomination for this, and he probably should, the Coen's will be just as much responsible for it. This movie could be the one character speaking for 2 hours straight, and it would never lose my attention. Even with the most intelligent and complicated dialogue using the biggest words in the dictionary, I never lost focus on what he was saying. That's the thing I really appreciate about The Ladykillers. Even when he was spouting off speeches and I had no idea what was being said, I still was able to follow the story and appreciate the performance by Hanks. This brings me to the big complaint I have with The Ladykillers.Marlon Wayans almost ruins this movie. In fact, it's his fault that I'm even writing a complaint in this review. While I was able to follow Tom Hanks no matter how intelligent or complex his dialogue got, I spaced out whenever Marlon Wayans would be speaking. It's kind of sad that I could pay attention to Hanks when his dialogue was overly intelligent, and when Marlon Wayans would start ranting in childish profanity, I would space right out. For a movie that seems to pride itself on how mature and intelligent it is, it throws all dignity out the window when Marlon Wayans is on screen. He doesn't have one intelligent thing to say. His language is very inappropriate as well. I'm not saying that I find the words he's saying to be inappropriate. The problem is the wild contrast between the smart and witty screenplay, and the childish shock language Wayans uses. The two styles do not fit together. This movie and the Coen Brothers are above the dumb Scary Movie name calling that is way too prominent in this film. I also really doubt that the Coen's wrote Wayans dialogue. I have a terrible feeling that they cast Marlon Wayans and told him to just improvise and be funny. If that is the case, I give the Coen's more credit as writers, but I subtract a lot of credit for their competence as Directors. They must know that Wayans didn't belong in this movie.Just as much as Tom Hanks deserves an Oscar for his role, so does Irma Hall. Even when the eccentricities of the story become a little unrealistic, she always grounds it back in reality. Lots of these performances are a slightly exaggerated, perhaps even parodies, but Irma Hall is authentic and believable at all times. She sounds like she's making up a lot of her dialogue on the spot. This is a great performance. I also loved JK Simmons. But my second complaint revolves around his character. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome stuff??? That was completely unnecessary. And like Marlon Wayans, it drags the level of class that the Coen's have down to a childish gross-out level. This movie needed to be mature and funny all the way through. It lost me when it lost it's maturity. But I do have to say that one of JK Simmons best moments was when he described his Irritable Bowels Singles Groups. That was funny, but the character quirk was not. Ryan Hurst and Tzi Ma were maybe the funniest ones in the cast, and they have very little to say. Ryan Hurst is doing a bit of a takeoff on the cartoon-like dummies. He's big and strong and burly, but has no brains in his head and often blanks out. Tzi Ma will speak maybe once every 30 minutes, but when he does, I would always crack up.The climax is very creative and hilarious. Minus the Marlon Wayans flashback, which also didn't fit right. The ongoing garbage barge bit got funnier each time. It felt very refreshing to sit in a theatre and laugh at a smart adult oriented comedy, instead of the overly repetitive childish foul gross out jokes....... which........ This movie also has?????. Mostly good, though.</fullReview>

That's about it with this one other than I really tried to get into the movie enjoying spirit to no avail... But then again I have seen it again and again... That one man's trash is another man's gold! I think the characters were starving for a meatier script perhaps... And too much reliance on old Mamma character.

		<shortDescription>Hanks never saw the Ealing original, can you blame him?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks took on a role left untouchable by Alec Guiness. (A quote from a place I can no longer find.) If you haven't seen the 1955 version, please do. For this to have been taken on by the Coen brothers too..... My goodness, the hubris. 1955 has Alec Guiness, Peter Sellers, Herbert Lom, Frankie Howerd, Jack Warner and Kenneth Connor. How on earth anyone is giving the 2004 version 6.1 stars is just nuts. Please, please, please, please, watch the 1955 original. And for anyone else out there with similar plans, only broach the idea of a remake if you can actually make it better. If you can't, don't. And as for Hanks as a 'great actor' which I've repeatedly seen written, watch 'Big' a few times and then try telling me that. OK, that's unfair, but seriously this remake is just horrible and awful and dreadful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ladykillers is an absolutely terrible movie with a very stupid storyline that insults the original 1955 classic rather than remakes.I was so shocked with how brutal this was,Tom Hanks starring in a movie with the Coen brothers that is a remake of a very famous comedy sounds like gold,but its awful,I don't understand why Academy Award winning people would do this,it also seemed promising that J.K. Simmons is in it,I usually enjoy his performances.Tom Hanks did do a good performance,but it didn't make up for the fact that this movie was just not funny and it had him working with people like Marlon Wayans,they just don't belong in the same movie together.This movie is a complete mess that is sort of hard to forget,I only would give it a one,but since ATom Hanks did do his best,i'm giving it a two,but I would recommend to nobody.A crooked college professor borrows his landlady's basement but when she gets suspicious his gang try to silence her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im usually a huge fan of the Cohen brothers films but this one was definitely not one of my favorites. It was pretty good just not compared to a lot of their other films. Tom Hanks does a great job and so does the rest of the cast except for Marlon Waynes of course whos acting is annoying at best why they felt they needed to add him I will never know.This movie is about an old lady who one day has a knock on her door. There is a very educated intelligent man standing there wishing to rent the room she has. She brings him in and he invites his friends over where they plan to tunnel their way through the wall of the basement and rob a bank.This movie was pretty good and it had its funny moments but its not where near as funny as the big lebowski etc..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens Blow It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers don't hit the mark every time and their uninspired remake of the 1955 British Ealing original comedy serves as an example. This handsomely produced homage to director Alexander Mackendrick's classic is not without some shred of humor, but "The Ladykillers" doesn't show the Coens' at the top of their form. Tom Hanks is ideally cast as a smooth-talking, Southern hustler named Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr who is in fact a criminal mastermind. Indeed, Hanks seems to be channeling the blowhard Warner Brothers' cartoon character Foghorn Leghorn as he tangles with Irma P. Hall's God-fearing, gospel singing matriarchal. Dorr and his dubious accomplices use the cellar of widower Marva Munson after she takes him into her home as a boarder. Dorr and company pretend to be practicing music while they tunnel toward the vault of a riverboat casino. Naturally, they encounter one form of adversity after another as they indulge in their criminal enterprise. Although they fare successfully in their robbery, they are not so fortunate in sharing in the proceeds of their daring scheme. The matronly heroine outwits them at every turn and the harder that they try to dispose of her after she discovered their perfidy proves fruitless.In the words of one of the conspirators named Pancake, this remake should have been "the easiest thing in the world," but the Coens blow it. When they aren't being heavy handed, they are just plain ridiculous. The collection of criminals that Dorr assembles are a motley collection of losers. Pancake (J.K. Simmons of "Spider-Man") is a demolitions expert who blows his own finger off when he tries to blast a rock that blocks the tunnel that they are digging to the underground vault of the Bandit Queen. The man that Dorr has an insider, Gawain (Marlon Wayans), is a smut-mouthed, sex-obsessed janitor on the Bandit Queen with all the information that they require for their robbery. Along with Pancake and Gawain are two others, a thick-headed oaf named Lump (Ryan Hurst) and a tight-lipped, cigarette-puffing former North Vietnamese officer called The General ( Tzi Ma) who knows everything about tunnels owing to his experiences in Vietnam when the French were fighting the war. The cretinous fools are the worst criminals on record and the irony is that a harmless old lady outsmarts them. She winds up with $1.6 million and donates it to Bob Jones University, a religious institution of higher learning. The performances are top-notch as are the production values. The fault lies with the Coens who are tone deaf this time around. If they were hoping to reproduce the hit that they had with their previous Mississippi set comedy "O Brother Where Art Thou?," they failed miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a let-down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an update of the 1955 British comedy, but it seems lost in stylized tics and windy verbiage that never seem to expire.Tom Hanks plays a role as the Southern-gentleman mastermind of a riverboat casino heist should flow effortlessly but isn't particularly engaging--there's no sense of amusing malice in his Professor G.H. Dorr, though he's portrayed, unconvincingly, as some sort of absolute evil--and he doesn't seem to want to connect with much of the cast (though there is some decent interplay with his nemesis, Marva Munson, the landlady whose home he uses as his base of operation, played in over-sized fashion by Irma P. Hall, bucking for an Oscar). The upshot is that Hanks' obstinacy actually slows the rhythms of the film to a crawl and you find yourself increasingly impatient. As for the film itself, it's another empty academic exercise from the Coen Brothers, with elegant art direction by Richard Johnson and clever cinematography from Roger Deakins (the camera angles get skewed as the situation gets darkly violent) but also a misanthropic theological overview: though characters fall from grace (into a garbage barge), the heaven they're cast from is an empty, ghettoized deep-South parish that appears unclean and undesirable. They also possess a cluelessness as to what's funny, smarmily assuming jokes about irritable bowel syndrome are audience-pleasers; and their attempts at surrealist humor (most notably the varying expressions of a portrait meant to comment on the proceedings) falls dismally flat. With a sour Marlon Wayans, Tzi Ma (whose tricks with cigarettes contain the film's most entertaining moments), J.K. Simmons (from 'Spider-Man') and Ryan Hurst as Hanks' partners in crime; they're severely let down by the Coens' indifferent treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely gentle family comedy film with a twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must have been a bit of a departure for Tom Hanks. I think in time this film will become a Christmas type classic, the type of heartwarming film that you can watch cuddled up as a family, provided you don't mind the occasional F word.Being British, I think that the film fails to strike some of the vital chords of the original Ealing Classic.Firstly Hanks could have been introduced to the movie as a potential killer, perhaps stalking Miss Munson to her home, the original was one of the first films I ever saw, and Alec Guiness looked like he was out to murder the old lady, when he first scowled around her home.The minor members of the cast did not seem to get a look in with regard to the plot, the Lump character for example in the original shared a few tender moments with the old lady, which made him turn against the other hoodlums, why else would he decide to want to prevent the Professor from killing her in the end.This film is not a quick gag a minute typical US comedy, and if you decide to watch with the family try and keep the plot a secret, as a youngster I really thought that the old women as well as her friends were going to get done in.All in all a really enjoyable film, the scenes between Hanks and Irma Hall are particularly good.Personally I think that this film is much underrated, because you have to be a little patient with it at the beginning. Tom Hanks has been great at pulling at our heart strings in many roles, but I actually think that this is Tom Hanks's greatest acting performance, it is for Hanks what the Awakenings was to DeNiro, and in time will be recognized as such.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that is a re-make of a 1955 British movie, apparently. I haven't seen it but I read a lot of reviews on this site about this most recent version and most of them do not rate it as highly as the original. The original, it would seem, attributed more vulnerability to the character played by Irma P. Hall in this one. Irma P. Hall is not overly paranoid or aware of deceit that is being done behind her back, but she was not born yesterday either.The end of this movie and the fate of all the characters makes me curious about the fate of the characters in the original and whether the fates are similar. I found this movie to be entertaining and enjoyable but not hilarious or particularly noteworthy. The script by the Coens is fair and the plot, character selections, and music are typically thoughtful and inventive, but this is not one of their finest works. Tom Hanks and Irma P. Hall in particular are excellent. Hanks seems to enjoy playing the role of an erudite shyster and he is fantastic. His line reading and creation of his character are inspired. Hall is fantastic as an old lady who may not be hip to the ways of the world, but she knows when she is being gamed. She conveys heart, soul, and decency in spades and is not outmatched by Hanks when the two share the screen. Marlon Wayans and JK Simmons are also quite good in their roles.There's nothing particularly wrong with this movie, it's a nice diversion for a couple of hours. It is enjoyable. However, the tackiness of the use of irritable bowel syndrome in the film, our lack of concern for the minor characters, and the randomness of this selection as the Coens' project make it not one of their most inspired films. See it for Hall and Hanks most particularly and intriguing plot development from the Coens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened?!?!?! The Coen brothers should be walking in squares scratching their heads trying to figure out whyyyyyyy this movie is the way it is. I mean, it's all there: Tom Hanks, unique soundtrack, intriguing story, interesting dialogue. So why did this movie suck??? Well I could point out a few reasons. First off, they hired Marlon Wayans, who elected to interject a swear word every other 5 seconds. Now I'm not much for censorship, but the language in this movie kinda gets ridiculous to the point of being distracting. And Wayans, along with the other characters in the Professor's (Hanks) little posse, are incredibly stereotypical and not at all original or fresh. And they're unfunny to a spectacular degree. Ryan Hurst's Lump is the most boring stupid person I've ever seen in my life. I don't think it's entirely his fault, but he was just a big disappointment. JK Simmons was OK as the token "person with health problems", but IBS is pretty dumb, and was used too much and was kind of a downer considering this is a Coen brother movie.So remember at the top when i said intriguing story? Well it is, but by the end it is completely put in the shredder, burnt to a crisp, then the ashes are inhaled by a drug addicted sloth. I hated the end. I don't know whose fault it was, and whether or not that is what happened in the old movie as well, but it was just a complete downer. I felt like I'd wasted my time watching this movie, like everything was going to end sweet but then it didn't. I just watched the credits thinking "wow.....i can't decide who wasted their time more: me or tom hanks and team stereotype." The one excellent thing about this movie is the soundtrack. The gospel-blues-who knows exactly that plays throughout the movie creates the only energy in this movie. Sometimes it makes this movie feel better than it actually is. The soundtrack even rivals O, Brother Where Art Thou, which is my favorite Coen brother movie.Tom Hanks was good as usual, but him and the music is about the only reason to watch this. I'm not sure how it compares to the original, but seeing that it has Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers, I'd guess that it is better than this version and should be watched instead. If you're looking for a movie with Tom Hanks in it, just rent Toy Story and be done with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Started off Strong; Lost a Lot of Steam at the End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can we now put this argument to rest? Tom Hanks IS the most versatile actor most of us will ever see. There is simply no role this man cannot take (and perfect). It is no shocker that he carried a movie, all but single-handedly, yet again.The beginning of the movie really pulled me in. A humorous introduction to all of the principles was a classic Coen brothers improvement to a classic in its own right. My favorite performance other than Hanks' was the traditionally underrated Marlon Wayans. I mean, this family has been in comedy for so long for a reason. Sure, his anger was a bit annoying at times, but that was the character. I do not think there was a funnier line (and delivery) than "You brought your bitch to the Waffle Hut?" The end of the movie, however, soured me a bit. I do not not know how many people root for the "bad guys" in movies (obviously, these guys were not inherently bad, just committing an anti-social act), but I do. I wanted them to get off more or less scot-free. It seemed like the offing of each individual at the end was a little too rushed and forced. However, Pancake's death in front of Mountain Girl was hilarious.The "good guy/girl gets the money" theme has obviously been done to death, and the manner by which it occurred in this movie was not satisfying. Mrs. Munson refused Professor Dorr's offer of money to contribute to Bob Jones University prior to the climax. Why would she all of a sudden think it was a great idea because a sheriff told her so? She held to her Christian morals throughout the whole movie, then dropped them like a bad habit.All in all, this was a solid movie. Not great, but it certainly had its moments. The plot was strong, Hanks was amazing, and there were many moments of comic relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMHO, this movie was NOT funny. (The only people in the theater laughing were senior citizens -- who comprised 80% of the audience by the way.) It was NOT deep -- perhaps a bit subtle, but come on, anyone with an IQ near 100 should get it. Although as far as the "moral" (as some people put it) goes, there was nothing subtle about that.That's all the superlatives I have for this movie, however. Tom Hanks was Tom Hanks. He did a good job. I have a feeling he didn't do this movie because of the movie, he did it because he wanted to have fun doing a character role. The other actors did decent jobs playing their stereotypes to the end. The movie was pretty slow.My main disappointment was that I expect more from any movie that doesn't have great special effects, that has one or more big name actors, and that moves slowly. I should leave the theater saying "wow, that was deep", or it should be on my mind for awhile. (Most people who've read 1984 knows what I'm talking about.) I watched the movie 2 weeks ago, and I forgot it so completely that I had to scour IMDB for 20 minutes till I finally remembered what movie I saw. That's how forgettable it was.Did I regret seeing it? Well, I probably wouldn't have been very productive in those 2 hours anyway. But on the other hand, the $7 ticket price hurts. Would I recommend it? Only if it comes out in a very cheap theater, or if you can rent it for a buck in a few months.And if you've already seen about 3/4ths of the movies on the shelves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but not great Coen effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the Coen brothers do best, they do uniformly well, and the dialogue, character development and caper plot all click along perfectly. Tom Hanks shows us that even when he's doing something just for fun, without much serious effort, he can still be amazing to watch. The Coens have a lot of fun themselves, reversing roles (racial and otherwise; if you're not familiar with Bob Jones University, read up on it for an extra note of irony) and showing the unifying theme about the bad kharma that curses this particular enterprise and the way God, Fate, whatever you want to believe (the movie leaves it all up to you) controls your destiny and sometimes even shows favoritism. Jjensen1's criticism was unfair, apparently that person showed up expecting more action and being unfamiliar with the Coens, was woefully impatient with the character development and the slice-of-life scenes. Look for some clever metaphorical touches, like the gospel choir (and look for some R&amp;B and gospel greats in *those* scenes), the ever-changing portrait of Marva's husband, the garbage scow headed to the dump (which the preacher also describes). Granted there is one major downfall and some minor ones. The major one: just the way the plot is constructed keeps you from caring about the characters and what happens to them, in the fascinating way the Coen Brothers usually make us do even in movies like "Fargo". There's also an issue of very foul language, granted it's important for the sake of some of the characters but still could've been toned down a bit. Overall, I would recommend this movie as a worthy Coen effort even if it's not one of their best.</fullReview>

Then there's Irma P. Hall as Mrs. Munson, the church-going, no-nonsense lady who's housing Dorr and his crew.

		<fullReview>"My, My, My, My we must have waffles." We must all have waffles forthwith."These kinds of line coming from Tom Hanks in this movie made me want to see this movie even more. Hanks returns to comedy if only for a short while, but with who better than the Coen Bros. Hanks plays Prof. G.H. Dorr, a "cultured" southern professor who claims to be a musician and a poet, mainly reciting Edgar Allen Poe, adding to his eccentric character. He assembles a crew of trash talking pimps (Wayans), a chinese general who acts like he's still in a war, a hickory demolition man, a simple minded muscle man, all together to break into a casino vault through an old southern, and I mean southern widow's basement in her southern boarding house. Irma P. Hall is Mrs. Munson, "she don't take no crap from no one and she lets you know it um hmm." Hanks and co. have to pull off the heist without Mrs. Munson in their way, and remember, it's hard to get anything by a southern woman who's got the strength of "Almighty God" and the hatred for "hippity hop."Hanks is as always right into character, you forget it's him. The way he acts you just to watch him more and more through the whole movie. He has a number of the funny lines and his comic payoff and his sneakiness are blended into G.H. Dorr. The Coen Bros. really picked a match with Hanks and Hall's characters put together.The movie is brilliant and only the Coen Bros. could have thought of it, but at the same time, I walked out saying, "ya know, it's just too stupid of a movie to hate, and easy to like." It's outlandish unfolding if a story is much like "O Brother Where Art Thou" and "Fargo."IT'S ALSO VERY FUNNY. I LAUGHED LONG, AND HARD.

I amsure there were more than 100 instances of motherf-----r, not tomention numerous "f" words used in every possible configuration, not tomention non-stop "God d--ns" and "Jesus Christs," etc. The onslaught offilth pouring from the speakers was almost unbelievable.My wife said the movie was totally degrading of black people, portrayingthem as stupid hicks.The plot itself is mildly amusing--but for same selection of excitementand filth, just go down to a local high school corner and stand around thebus stop for half an hour. It won't cost you a dime and you'll get roughlythe same experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Southern Gothic, Coen Bros. Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ladykillers" is the latest offering from Joel and Ethan Coen. This movie is clever and well-written. Tom Hanks stars as Prof. G.H. Dorr, Ph.D., a criminal mastermind who leads his gang in a plot to rob a riverboat casino. Hanks plays this role to the hilt, with the look of an antebellum Southern gentleman, and flowery dialogue. Other colorful characters include Marlon Wayans as Gawain McSam, the casino's janitor and the gang's "inside man," and J.K. Simmons as Garth Pancake, the hapless explosives expert. Then there's Irma P. Hall as Mrs. Munson, the church-going, no-nonsense lady who's housing Dorr and his crew. The Coen brothers. have put together a real winner, with a fine cast, and a gospel soundtrack. It's definitely a feather in their caps!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another wonderful Coen Bros. flick, as brilliant as it is stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My, My, My, My we must have waffles." We must all have waffles forthwith."These kinds of line coming from Tom Hanks in this movie made me want to see this movie even more. Hanks returns to comedy if only for a short while, but with who better than the Coen Bros. Hanks plays Prof. G.H. Dorr, a "cultured" southern professor who claims to be a musician and a poet, mainly reciting Edgar Allen Poe, adding to his eccentric character. He assembles a crew of trash talking pimps (Wayans), a chinese general who acts like he's still in a war, a hickory demolition man, a simple minded muscle man, all together to break into a casino vault through an old southern, and I mean southern widow's basement in her southern boarding house. Irma P. Hall is Mrs. Munson, "she don't take no crap from no one and she lets you know it um hmm." Hanks and co. have to pull off the heist without Mrs. Munson in their way, and remember, it's hard to get anything by a southern woman who's got the strength of "Almighty God" and the hatred for "hippity hop."Hanks is as always right into character, you forget it's him. The way he acts you just to watch him more and more through the whole movie. He has a number of the funny lines and his comic payoff and his sneakiness are blended into G.H. Dorr. The Coen Bros. really picked a match with Hanks and Hall's characters put together.The movie is brilliant and only the Coen Bros. could have thought of it, but at the same time, I walked out saying, "ya know, it's just too stupid of a movie to hate, and easy to like." It's outlandish unfolding if a story is much like "O Brother Where Art Thou" and "Fargo."IT'S ALSO VERY FUNNY. I LAUGHED LONG, AND HARD. But remember, don't look to learn anything from it. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful moral fable with lots of big laughs: not without its flaws, but very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As another reviewer commented, I missed quite a few lines of dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so loudly (myself included), and that goes to show one of the greater strengths of the Coen brothers' new film. It is really truly ridiculously funny. The humor is broad at times, often dark, often quirky and bizarre, and may not appeal to an audience that cares for more routine humor and straightfoward punchlines or pandering to the lowest common denomenator. Much of the humor comes from the Coens' trademark dialogue. As usual it is immaculately manicured, beautiful to behold, and hilarious to hear: their use of colloquialisms, slang, jargon, accents, dialects, archaic language, and just plain funny words that one may or may not have ever heard before is simply tremendous. And when put into the mouths of capable character actors those words work magic on my funny bone.The casting, again as usual, is awesome. The whole cast pulls off the not so easy task of creating consistent caricatures whose absurd actions they have to make sense of.However, my favorite part of the film was the highly stylized narrative style. It felt more like a fable or moral tale than any kind of story that one is supposed to take as seriously realistic. The film is set in Mississippi, but presents itself as more of an imagined caricature or archetype constructed of various images and anachronisms that add up to some vague notion of "Mississippiness", rather than an actual earthly location. Whatsmore, the obviously allegorical qualities of the principle characters make for some delightful religious and literary symbolism, that treads the fine line of parody: seeming at once oddly serious but with a healthy dose of dark parodic humor.All in all I recommend this movie rather highly. Mainly because it is so different from the formulaic, prepatterned, pandering drivel that constitutes the majority of mainstream comedy film. It is nice to see a screwball farce that is not afraid of being misunderstood, that does not have to follow the lead of whatever popular trash came before it, and that is willing to at least attempt to conflate broad low-brow humor with intelligently crafted structure, content, and satiric wit.9 out of 10...I hardly ever stopped laughing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite a Coen Bros Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I can't remember laughing so hard for so long at any movie recently. Tom Hanks is almost unrecognizable as G.H. Dorr, PhD, with teeth that cry for orthodontia and a vocabulary that screams for a thesaurus. His crack team of would-be casino robbers are straight out of central casting, but less complicated than the Ocean's Eleven ensemble. There is the dumb (almost drooling) jock, the munition expert who seems accident prone, the quick-as-a-cat Vietnamese General, and the profanity-laden gangsta who works as a janitor (the inside man).The real star of the movie is Irma Hall as a stolid black woman who has been wearing the same house dresses since her beloved husband Othar passed on to glory. Her wonderful portrayal of a Mississippian Christian woman, playing landlord to Tom Hanks and his schemes, works on many levels. I am a bigger fan of other Coen Bros. works, but this is a worthy piece of entertainment. It has clever construction, interesting use of language, and bizarre characters. It can't decide which era it belongs to but jumps between today and the 50's. My biggest complaint is the gratuitous level of cursing, but with the Coens, it can be taken as humorous instead of truly offensive. I give it a 9/10 only because I have seen other Coen movies I liked more, like Fargo and O Brother Where Are Thou.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for Fargo and Big Lebowski, this is my favorite from the Coen Bros. I don't recall having ever seen a movie zip by so quickly, and while this does hamper character development and leaves out some things I would've liked to know(a little more detail on how they all got together would've been nice), the movie is still great. Hanks and Hall are superb, and I while I agree that Wayans plays the same guy he always does, it works well in this unusual context. The dialogue was excellent and very funny, the story, while minimal, was compelling, and the guy with IBS was classic. I'm having difficulty understanding why some people hate it(a few people in my theatre walked out)-I guess its not for everyone. But if you like the Coens in general, see this movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has all of the Coen brothers elements. It had great potential to be an awesome movie. Unfortunately, it falls short. It feels as if the film is much longer than 106 minutes. The film begins to drag in the middle. Tom Hanks is wonderful in this film however, even he can't save this film. There are some wonderful comic breaks. Erma (I believe that is how you spell the characters name) is without a doubt the best character in the film. She provides most of the laughs. Without giving anything away, the ending is quirky but somewhat predictable. It is a typical Coen ending. The film would have been much better if it were about 20 minutes shorter. 5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tom Hanks character reminded me of the George Clooney character (Ulysses) in "Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou." Listening to Tom Hanks deliver some of his monologues (ie., the long toast that I thought would never end!) really cracked me up. Hanks makes the movie really great! My friends kept looking at me in the theater because I was laughing so loud. I thought it was really funny. No great character development, but the acting out of the stereotypes was quite well done. The Coen Brothers always have very artistic cinematography. This film is no exception. Also, the soundtrack with the church choir is wonderful. Stay for the credits if you enjoy the choir. This film will become the sleeper hit of 2004. Definitely worth the price of the ticket. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Coens at their best . . . But still hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even a lesser Coen comedy is infinitely superior to most of the other dreck that passes for comedy these days. Like last year's "Intolerable Cruelty", "The Ladykillers" may not be perfect, but it's awfully funny.In fact, this film has moments that rank up their with the funniest the Coens have ever done. In some respects, it felt to me like a cross between "O Brother, Where ArtThou?" and "The Big Lebowski". Unfortuantely, it falls victim to some the same excess that made "Lebowski" my personal least favorite Coen film - but at least the plot is less meadering and more focused.Tom Hanks plays a character unlike anything he has done before. The supporting cats is adequate, though I found myself wishing some previous COen regulars like John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturoo, etc, and had played some of those roles - much like I wished Goodman had played the role of Gus Petch in "Intolerable Cruelty." The standout supporting performance comes from Irma P. Hall, who can hold her own with Hanks in a way few top Hollywood stars can.For Coen fans, this is a must-see, even if it's not going to alter your top five favorites. For non-fans, this won't convert you. It has a MUCH darker edge than "O Brother", and is just as eccentric.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The awful truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a lot of hype about this movie. I've seen Tom Hanks on a few talk shows promoting the heck out of `The Ladykillers'. While the movie was funny, Tom Hanks' character got on my nerves. He talked way too much and the words, while somewhat funny, were not funny enough to overlook or overcome the constant chatter. I actually found most of the dialog down right boring.This unlikely crew of bandits had a most brilliant plan, which was well executed. However, when it came to the simplest task (the one that really counted), no one could accomplish it. A comedy of errors led to more and more errors which led to the biggest error, The Ladykillers!As usual, Tom Hanks' performance raised the bar but it wasn't enough to raise this movie above it's borderline tale. Ladykillers was somewhat entertaining but not great. I thought George Wallace would have been better cast as part of the gang, rather than the sheriff -- he's a very funny comedian. I particularly enjoyed the performance of J. K. Simmons as Garth Pancake. His voice alone was almost worth the watch.Frankly, I'd wait for this movie to come out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe this is a Coen brothers movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the humor that the Coen brothers bring to their movies and the original 1955 "The Ladykillers" is one great and classic comedy, then why isn't this movie a good one? I kept waiting for this movie to get funny but it just didn't ever seem to happen. The movie its humor is not goofy enough to be funny and it's also not subtle enough to be funny. The movie its humor is somewhere in between and balances constantly between these two styles of comedy, without ever going fully for any of them. The comedy of the movie really doesn't work out too well because of this. You just don't know when to laugh during this movie, since it's hard to tell when the Coen brothers were trying to make you laugh or were being more serious.It's also due to the characters that this movie doesn't work out too well. The characters are some extreme stereotypes, that seemed to have walked straight out off a cartoon. They are over-the-top all but without being funny really. They are kind of like the characters from a Wes Anderson movie; they are all strange looking and have some weird names but they are actually doing very little funny in the movie.Because of its unsuccessful style and approach the story also hardly works out, though it had been proved before in the original 1955 movie that the story itself is great and really humorous. Hopefully the Coen brothers learned from this and shall only write original scripts of their own and not base their work on previous written material.With the writing they still tried to put their mark on the movie. It does have some good dialog at times but again, it just hardly works out ever funny. It often gets more annoying than anything else really.This also really wasn't Tom Hanks greatest moment. In essence he's a comedy actor, that started out his career with movies out of that genre and I also really don't dislike him as an actor. In this movie he is just however hardly being Tom Hanks but more a silly talking character. There are also lots of other great actors in this movie, that just don't get used very well, due to it's poorly written comedy script.But it's a Coen brothers movie, so it still has a good style and look over it. I also never really hated watching this movie but I just never got entertained by it either. I was just constantly waiting for the movie to finally take off and become a good and funny one. It just never happened though.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite his two Academy awards for the dreadful Philadelphia and Forrest Gump Tom Hanks has never, not once, ever sold me on his dramatic acting abilities. I remember him from that lame 1980s transvestite sitcom with the little blond dweeb who later starred on Newhart. Whenever he tries to emote Hanks just looks silly and cannot help but have a goofy grin on his face. As pallid as his dramatic ability is he is, and has always been, a gifted comedian.This talent has never been put to better use than in the most recent comedy from the Coen Brothers, The LadyKillers, which is a remake of a 1950s comedy from the U.K. that starred Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers. Having never seen the original I can only say that even were that at the comedic level of Dr. Strangelove it would not alter the fact that this is one flat-out hilarious film. Basically, it's a comedic heist film in which a sad sack troupe of gangsters tries to rip off a floating casino in Mississippi by tunneling into its vault from an old black lady's cellar. To accomplish this the ringleader, G.H. Dorr (Hanks), poses as a college professor. Along with him are a young black punk, Gawain MacSam (Marlon Wayans), a former Vietnamese general (Tzi Ma), a dopey munitions expert, Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons- who plays J. Jonah Hameson in the Spider-Man franchise), and a big dumb lump of a football player named Lump Hudson (Ryan Hurst). The old lady, Marva Munson, is wonderfully played by Irma P. Hall.The LadyKillers is not a film for the ages, but it is one that when a little blue you can just pop it in the DVD and laugh yourself silly. That said, the DVD had a nice transfer- very crisp and in some places the film even looked like videotape. I don't know whether it was shot digitally, however. The music plays well, especially in assorted gospel scenes. There are only a few extra- standard featurettes on the film, but one extended outtakes scene that is funny- a scene where Marva is slapping Gawain silly for his use of profanity. As with everything else on this DVD it's funny as hell, and most recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about the Sunday service scene in the church</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand how so many of the "reviewers" here fail to see the underlying story, or symbolism, of this movie, especially since it's one of the oldest plots of all: the defeat of the scheming and wicked by the innocent and good. Everything in the movie is directed to underlining this basic story. "Mrs. Munson" is clearly innocent and simple-hearted (unaware of the irony of her fondness for Bob Jones University, for instance). The candles blow out when "Dr. Dorr" arrives--he also becomes more clearly diabolic in appearance by the end. When he dies, he hangs (for a moment) "between heaven and earth" like Judas. And in the end, he and all his accomplices are carried out to Trash Island, which is made into a symbol of hell by the preacher at the church service. Their evil activities--namely, the efforts to murder Mrs. Munson and each other--take place in the dead of night, but with the death of the Professor, it grows light again. And of course, the Gospel choir sings about the "lighthouse" and "shine your light." So, in a way, the church scene sets up the entire symbolism of the rest of the movie. Personally, I thought it was a well done film with a good blending of symbolism and plain old entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of the reviewers who responded very negatively to this film where either: (A)Fans of the original and biased against a remake (B)Put off by the harsh language (C)Upset at the weirdness and wanted a more straight forward brand of comedy (D)Tom Hanks fans, expecting a more typical performance, or Tom Hanks haters who just can't enjoy anything he does.If you like a movie that's not afraid to be a little strange and eccentric, you'll probably enjoy this. The plot revolves around a gang of mismatched criminals trying to tunnel from the basement of a clueless old woman's house to the river-side vault of a riverboat casino.Tom Hanks is excellent as Professor G.H. Dorr, the ringleader. He's sort of a 1920's Southern gentleman in modern times. Or is that his disguise? He never seems to break character, so maybe he's a little crazy as well? The remainder of the heist gang is just as eccentric. There's the strangely creepy Chinese General, an expert at tunneling. The hothead, unreliable "inside man" who's a janitor on the riverboat. There's the hired muscle who might be a little mentally challenged. Finally there's the explosives "expert" who's rather clumsy.One thing that is distracting about the film is it's never clear in what decade this all takes place. Professor G.H. Dorr seems to be from the 1920's. The old, Bible-thumping African-American woman who owns the house is out of the 1950's. The working class maintenance staff of the riverboat is definitely from modern times. It seems this diverse, mismatched cast of characters was randomly picked from different movies. It takes a while to get used to, but it somehow comes together.Professor G.H. Dorr gives some wonderful rambling speeches. He's quite an expert at talking nonsense and making the gibberish sound believable to the small town rubes. When the heist goes bad, things take a murderous turn. It was enjoyable to see the inept criminals killed off one-by-one, usually by happenstance.Looking back, this movie is very hard to categorize. It's partly a heist movie, the comedy element waivers from clever to lowbrow, and the film is also a little surreal (with the strange mix of characters from different times). If you're up for something weird, eccentric and a little goofy, check it out with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated film - and better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the remake and then, later, watched the original.I thought the remake was better and funnier because it worked on more levels. I enjoyed the acting in both but the writing and directing were far better in the remake.I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers and no fan of infantile potty humor. The Coens are careful listeners and lovers of American regional dialects and personalities as they showed in the movies Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou, and Intolerable Cruelty. What some people don't seem to appreciate about "The Ladykillers" remake is that it revels in the completely different ways that each character speaks. It intentionally used totally over-the-top extremes of language from the Professor, to Gawain, Pancake, and Mrs. Munson. Given the absurdity of the plot, I think it was totally OK to push the extremes of the characters and their language. It created all kinds of great set-ups for comedy.As the situation played out and as the pressures and conflicts built, it was hilarious to see these characters trying so hard (and mostly failing!) to get through to each other. It created much bigger laughs for me than watching the British cast play it straight.I thought the character Mrs. Munson was great as a stronger (and more irritating!) personality and it's ridiculous to claim that she was somehow less vulnerable if the gang really wanted to do her in. She was every bit as oblivious to the danger she was in as she smacked Gawain around when he used "hippety hop" language.Alec Guiness, as the gang leader of the original, was a cool, collected criminal who slowly became unraveled as things went out of control. However, I thought Tom Hanks, as the Professor with no criminal experience, was just as funny as his plans went wrong and he tried so hard to use his useless academic knowledge and language, in trying to handle the gang. I loved when he tried to explain the philosophy behind the short straw to Gawain. It reminded me of a scene in the movie "The Rundown" when Chistopher Walken is trying to explain the concept of the tooth fairy to a bunch of South American lowlife criminals.I loved the whole Mountain Girl ("Swiss Miss") scene at the Waffle Hut and the the touching story of how Pancake and Mountain met at an Irritable Bowel Syndrome singles gathering in the Catskills.I didn't like the gag with the painting of the husband changing expressions but, for the most part, I found the remake to be very funny and in fact funnier when watched for the second time because so much of the humor comes from the fact that everyone is speaking a totally different language. I know that it didn't get great reviews but I can only say that I loved the writing of the movie and think it would work great as a stage play as well.I found the original to be funny but not nearly as many real laughs as the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not the greatest criminal minds far from even a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well frankly speaking i didn't expect much from this movie and it didn't give me much. I expected slapstick humour seeing the cover (although the tagline suggested otherwise one look at the cover and you knew the tagline was bull*&amp;^%) but instead i got a completely different kind of funny with some kind of art-house elements in it.Although personally i don't like of this kind of art housish subtle humour, i enjoyed certain parts and scenes of the movie, i even ended up laughing at some more subtle jokes.The movie is spread with great scenes but is equally spread with boring drab moments and also some irritating ones. Tom Hanks could seem annoying to some but i hate to admit it i was most annoyed in the film with the old lady.I wish the ending were different as it left me with a bad taste.In all a OK movie worth a watch if you like subtle humour, but be prepared for some real boring and annoying moments. I just discovered the movie was a remake and i assume that those restrictions may have hampered the film otherwise this movie is like 5 or 5.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marlon Wayans - An Obsence &amp; Unfunny Person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie primarily because it starred Tom Hanks. His scenes with Irma Hall as "Marva" (the landlady) provide the only highlights in this otherwise disappointing movie. I gave the movie 3 stars - one for each of the Hanks &amp; Hall enjoyable performances and another for a slight sprinkling of humor found throughout the film (for example, scenes in the Sheriff's office).The movie had great remake potential but was squandered by the foul-mouthed and unfunny Marlon Wayans. I'm not against the use of swear words in films but the foulness of his language was excessive - and not even remotely humorous. As I watched his performance, I said to myself: "Is this funny? Am I supposed to be laughing at this?"I imagine that Marlon's character was included in the film to provide contrast against the civility of the professor (Hanks) - but the result was an abysmal failure. Why ruin a movie with the inclusion of this kind of character and his obscene language? With a little more imaginative writing a genuinely funny part could have been created. "The Ladykillers" is an example of a very annoying trend in film these days - directors seem to think that they simply have to turn someone like Marlon loose and the obscene results will generate side-splitting laughs. Well, quite the opposite actually occurs. Obscene language and gestures used excessively in films such as this one are actually ugly and repulsive. The use of such language demonstrates a lack of respect both for the other characters being fictionally addressed in the film and also for the audience watching it. Many viewers unfortunately then take such obscene film language/gestures as being the norm in society and hence acceptable for them to use in their outside the theater world - but "cool" it is not.Foul-mouthed humor as presented in this film demonstrates a lack of creativity (i.e. there's nothing imaginative in using the same 4-letter words over and over again). Marlon and his foul-mouthed humor does not result in impressive screen-time. It simply is not funny and and only serves to sour any real comedy presented in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who and What did Tom Hanks owe the Coen Brothers....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adore Tom Hanks. The man is quite possibly the greatest actor Hollywood has ever seen period. He can turn in a performance in any role and have it be absolutely flawless, he's just brilliant!!! In his performance in the Coen Brothers' Ladykillers he is no less brilliant, his portrayal as the seedy, yet charming criminal mastermind Professor G.H. Dorr. The character is creepy, funny in a much more subtle way and seemingly ingenious and eccentric. Unfortunately the good times stop there with Mr. Tom Hanks.I don't know what he did to get roped into this utter crap but I hope he chalks it up to a moment of weakness. The Ladykillers is a caper movie about a group of men who scam an old woman into allowing them to use her basement for "music practice" when in fact they are tunneling into a casino vault and stealing the money. Now as far as caper films go...some are good, and some are bad and this happens to be horribly bad. I don't think it's the characters or the actors for the most part because the crew is rather amusing and they each have their unique quirks and personality traits. I just found the film entirely boring, slow moving, and rather slow witted. It just never really gained any footing at all.As mentioned Tom Hanks' character is definitely the most entertaining and the only redeemable quality in the film. Veteran actress Irma P. Hall plays the uptight, highly religious woman that Hanks imposes himself on, Ms Munson. Marlon Wayans is a completely unfortunate addition to the cast. Any hopes at a serious comedy is completely lost at bringing him on board. His facial expressions and humor is lost on this film and he's definitely on the poorer in the cast. J.K. Simmons, Tzi Ma, and Ryan Hurst round out the rest of the criminal team. They all do a fair job with their roles and they each have a different role to play. Sadly the film has NO action whatsoever, but no drama either and no real comedy to mention. Everything relies on these actors to carry a whole film with really no story, no script, and no film...it's an impossible feat even for Hanks. I realize the Coen Brothers are known for being a might eccentric in their film making style but I think for any average movie goer, this is taking it too far. I also recognize the odd brilliance some people will find in this film with it's small little idiosyncrasies. The one rather interesting aspect is the setting. Although the setting of the film is quite clearly stated as being more modern day, everything about the film...the music, the costumes, the cars....screams out a different generation, a day long past. It's like being shifted back and forth in time. It's easy to see a hint of "O Brother Where Art Thou" in this film as well. But overall for myself I was bored to tears, disappointed and prayed for it to be over and finally it was!!! 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of the general consensus here, I thought Marlon Wayans STOLE THE SHOW on Ladykillers. I laughed out loud with every line. Nothing about his language shocked me -- in fact, I applaud the Coen Brothers for their willingness to step outside the box. That's just how some Black people are.The strange and wonderful combination of several different eras, from Victorian, to 50's Gospel, to current Hip Hop was a great twist that worked well, IMHO.And Wayans was PERFECT for his part -- so relaxed and at ease with himself. Just a naturally funny guy, like his brothers.I loved this movie. No, it was not profound, but it was fun. I fast forwarded through all of Wayan's scenes again the moment the movie was finished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow Tom Hanks is always connected to Forrest or another role. This movie gives away the plot by it's title and it takes a bit long to get to the part where you don't see what's coming. That's about 30 minutes before the end. Really nice ending by the way. My main problem with this one is that Tom Hanks shouldn't have been casted for this one. He plays well, but the character isn't one to choose Hanks for. See this one before anyone gives away the plot. Some nice comedy pieces and sadly some boring monologues from Hanks. It hovers between a dark comedy and a crime story. Could be a stage play since we only see a couple of locations: the cellar, the house, the church, the police station, the bridge... 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks stars in this strange well-worded movie. Its, I think, a departure from his previous works. The movie is filled with minuscule details which takes a few viewings to truly appreciate. I thought it was just an "ok" movie the first time I watched it, but after seeing it a few more times realized that it was very good. The co-conspirators are very funny and each have something about them that adds to the movie's overall appeal. There is a lot of dialog in this movie and I will admit that I put the caption on a few times to see exactly what the characters (mainly Hanks character) was saying. I'd say, overall, very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this was a great movie all around. let me retort to the above condemnation.hanks performance was outstanding, yes it is "over the top" but this is the very flavor of the character and also the flavor of the movie itself. If you've seen the coens' work before, you know they rarely put standard realistic true to life characters in their work. if this is what you are looking for, watch a major-network after school special, or perhaps an afternoon soap opera.the characters are quirky and eminently enjoyable to watch. the juxtaposition of the anachronistic characters with the more contemporary ones is refreshing and hilarious.this is not a remake of the 1955 movie of the same name. the characters are different, the plot is different, it is only similar in title and a very general plot idea. it is much more of an homage. the coens' could have made this movie with a different title and not given any credit to the previous movie. they didn't do this because they are responsible artists and promote other artists ideas and work.this is a masterful work, with quirky and interesting characters, emblazoned with the usual coen brothers flare. if you have watched and enjoyed any coens' brothers movies in the past you will definitely enjoy this movie.The Coens' are masterful filmmakers, thank god there are still some out there willing to make a movie outside of the standard Hollywood cookie cutter nonsense, watch this movie then watch: Blood Simple, Millers Crossing, Raising Arizona, The Hudsucker Proxy, and O Brother Where Art Thou. If your video store doesn't have these in their stock, its not worth patronizing them.kudos to T Bone Burnett, legendary blues man for a masterful soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is hands down the worst film that the Coen brothers have ever made. They need to take a year off and pool their creative genius, so they can give us another gem like O Brother, Raising Arizona or Miller's Crossing.In this film, the Coen brothers attempt to exploit America's ever growing fascination with ebonic speaking thugs. Never have the Coen brothers tried to appeal to the mass audience before, and I wonder why they are trying now.Tom Hanks' performance is cleverly eccentric, but becomes grating as time elapses. The typical Coen brothers characters, complete with a unique feel for dialogue, aren't found here. Marlon Wayans plays his typical loud obnoxious ignorant fool character, and Ryan Hurst was horrible as the Coens attempted to incorporate a blissfully ignorant character.Coen fans, soak in my words.

The movie took a very long time to establish the (generally unsympathetic) characters and weak plot, then pretty much meanders everywhere thereafter. I fast-forwarded through the second half as I became increasingly irritated by Tom Hanks, and the boring shouting matches between Pancake and Gawain. It was a very good thing I missed the theatrical run and only watched it on DVD. So I saved myself a bit of money.

The characters are crude and idiotic social stereotypes, and the "jokes" are stupid, low-brow attempts at humor, clearly the results of intense effort on the part of the writers to make funny gags, but which fail so miserably that it is nauseating and consistently embarrassing to watch. I'm not easily offended, but this was so offensively moronic that I was unable to stomach hardly any of this movie. It tries to cover the cinematic bases, but fails at all of them: it tries to be both old fashioned and modern, and fails at both. It tries to be funny and fails. It tries to be engaging, and fails. It tries to be classy and fails. It tries to be evocative, and fails. I can't think of a single area in which this movie succeeds. It cannot be recommended in any way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'll start out by saying that I really enjoyed the movie.I've never seen the original, and don't know what that has to do with anything anyway. I've never seen the original "Hunchback of Notre Dame" either, but that didn't keep me from enjoying the later Charles Laughton version.For those of you who don't care for how the Coen brothers put together a movie, I would suggest you pass this one by. For their fans, by all means!There always seems to be something worthwhile in one of the bros. films, even if the script is lacking. "Barton Fink" was far from great, but still the scene of John Goodman charging down the hallway while flames burst out from each doorway, made the movie.With "Ladykillers", while the overall quality doesn't really measure up to "Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou", or "The Big Labowski", the camera angles (from inside the football helmet, or from the bridge as the barge goes by) and the quirky characters and dialogue, and the unexpected unraveling of the whole plot make it well worth the time.But as I've already mentioned, if you're not a real fan of the Coens, or prefer movie fare like "Titanic" or "Cold Mountain", then I'd recommend you sit this one out...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you watch a Coen brother's film, you never know what to expect. I have stated before that I normally go into these films not expecting anything. Even if I have seen the preview, with the Coens you never know if they will keep you on the Hollywood path. Luckily, they do not. The Coens are notorious (or at least becoming notorious) for making films that seem mainstream, but after careful viewing you realize that they are not. The Ladykillers is unlike any work they have done before. I may be biased because I have not seen the original version with Sir Alec Guinness, but I thought this was a very well directed film. The Coen's have not forgotten their roots and are a pair of directors that are not afraid to experiment with audiences. I was a fan of Intolerable Cruelty and pretty much every single one of their films, so I can say that with the sincerest confidence. This film was nothing short of spectacular. The Coens crafted this film using big names, small names, ingenious shots, a powerful story, and most importantly hidden messages throughout. This is no O' Brother, Where Art Thou?, but it does stand on its own two feet. I have read reviews that complain about Hanks performance in this film, but to this reviewer it was flawless. The character that he portrays is hysterical and defined. I am impressed with Hanks ability to control this character and make us become interested in him. The expressions alone on Hanks face during this film alone are worth the price of the rental or theater ticket. His banter with Marva Munson (aka Irma P. Hall) is outstanding. Never have I seen such a complete connection between these two characters. I longed for more interactions between them just so that I could witness the Coen's cinematic genius in action. Hanks couldn't have done it alone though. Thanks to Irma Hall, he has the perfect person to counter his dastardly narratives. She nearly steals the scenes from Hanks. Thankfully, their banter is equally sided and enjoyable. I can not be the only one that thinks this since Irma won top prizes at Cannes for her work in this film. It was the characters in this film that gave us the juicy center to a very tasty pie known as The Ladykillers. I have spoken about Hanks and Hall, but so much can be said about Wayans job and the rest of the crew. They each had their own defined actions and personalities that it kept my attention throughout. The great obsession about the Coens is that they take you in so many directions. From the opening scene, you assume that you have the time frame figured out, but thanks to Wayans character you are never sure when this film takes place. This film felt like a classic picture with modern day undertones. I think that was the utmost purpose of the Coens when the decided to remake this film. They didn't want to change it completely, but they wanted to just add onto it. I don't want to go too deeply into this because of my lack of knowing about the original film, but just from watching this version, you get that feeling.Secondly, I would like to add that coupled with the acting is some of the most beautiful cinematography to grace the silver screen. It plays a dual role in this film by not only setting the stage for events to come, but also helps create the very dark theme. The gargoyles, the barge, and even the police station seemed to be from a different world, giving the viewer a mythical feeling. There were times that the Coens had been reading children's books when filming this movie. There were several scenes that I felt came right from children's literature. The barge and Hanks' character are just two of the instances. I do not have much to complain about with this film. I love the Coen brother's films and I will continue to pay my money each time they release something. They are never similar and each time push the envelope of reality. I especially loved in this film the battle between 'good' and 'evil'. One could easily argue that this film was nothing more than a creative way of showing a battle between God and the Devil. There was so many spiritual references throughout the film that you couldn't help wonder if the Coens weren't trying to convert you midway through the film. Ah, I enjoyed this film. Everything from the classic picture on the wall (with changing faces), to the dimwitted burglars, to the beautiful gospel music, all the way to the over-the-top performances by Hanks and Hall, this film was nothing short of perfection. The Coens continue to make quality films that do not speak to the mass audiences, and there is nothing wrong with that. They have their own style and wit, which makes them one of the most creative directors in Hollywood!Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not as zany as 'Oh Brother', "The Ladykillers" is truly a heavenly example of the creative comical talent of Joel and Ethan Coen.Tom Hanks creates another dynamic character and adds to his long list of accomplishments 'in the form of' this out of the past, Victorian type rogue, (a certain Professor Dorr).Irma P Hall shares center stage as the true-to-heart Christian widow, who falls victim to Hank's scheme, and carries the banner for the side of good.Of course, what would a Coen comedy be without music? Well it just wouldn't be! The theme here is the power of Gospel.Subtle and sophisticated, funny and smart, 'The Ladykillers' won't leave you feeling like you've drawn a 'short straw' at the video store!(N.B. : One can not help but notice the Kubrick like technique in this, sharp clean lines, blending of costume and scenery, and the use of filters. It fact, if there are spirits from 'the other side' in this plot, one of them must certainly be Kubrick.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, if you love Coen brothers movies then you are in good company. "O' Brother Where Art Thou" was one of my favorite movies of all time.But this film, quite simply, ends too abruptly. If you are expecting a caper film, filled with laughs and an awesome ending (or at least a satisfying one) then you will be disappointed. Was it a good movie? Yes (if you can get past all of the constant cussing, especially from one of the characters). Is it worth watching? Yes, and it even keeps your attention throughout the majority of the film. It seems to keep getting better and better as the plot unfolds and there are some great comedy moments, as well as a great "feel" which the Coen brothers are famous for.But when you see how the main characters end up "leaving" the town, you will undoubtedly be disappointed and feel that it all happened way too soon and in an unsatisfying manner.It's almost as if they made a great movie and then were told by the distributor that they have to shave off 24 minutes, so they decided to cut the meat out of the last act and then hurry up with the final scene (which does not include Hanks or his thugs, but which, had it been preceded by some tie-ups to some loose ends, would have been great) which happens within seconds of the "action."I guess since the Coens did not create this story and actually were remaking another film, we can give them that excuse for the way the thing ended. I haven't seen the original, but hopefully it fleshed out the end a little better than this version did (those of you who saw this know exactly what I mean).---Shark</fullReview>

Tom Hanks is no Alex Guinness though he has a nice line in fraudulent Southern gentility, and the other members of his ill-assorted gang don't have the pretensions of the originals, but then this is the US, not Britain. Irma P Hall lacks the sweetness of Katie Johnson's original landlady/potential victim and her religiosity soon becomes a bore. The Coen's desire to put their paw prints over everything meant that there were a lot of Joel and Ethan moments, but we've seen them all before. The heist takes too long and the denouement is too short, destroying any tension there might be. A waste of time and talent I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has seen the original version of "The Ladykillers," (1955, a classic of British film comedy) will be greatly disappointed in this version. This version is not up to the Coen brothers' standard, or Tom Hanks' standard, in any respect. Remakes are seldom worth much, but this one is truly terrible. I strongly recommend that everyone try to see the original to see how this plot was handled first time around; the performance of Alec Guinness alone(in the Tom Hanks role)is unforgettable. It should be required viewing for anyone who likes black comedy or just likes movies in general. But this remake should be buried somewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks is technically proficient, I suppose, in this update of the 1955 British comedy, but it's perhaps his most indulgent role to date; whatever humor he attempts is lost in stylized tics and windy verbiage that never seem to expire. His role as the Southern-gentleman mastermind of a riverboat casino heist should flow effortlessly but isn't particularly engaging--there's no sense of amusing malice in his Professor G.H. Dorr, though he's portrayed, unconvincingly, as some sort of absolute evil--and he doesn't seem to want to connect with much of the cast (though there is some decent interplay with his nemesis, Marva Munson, the landlady whose home he uses as his base of operation, played in over-sized fashion by Irma P. Hall, bucking for an Oscar). The upshot is that Hanks' obstinacy actually slows the rhythms of the film to a crawl and you find yourself increasingly impatient. As for the film itself, it's another empty academic exercise from the Coen Brothers, with elegant art direction by Richard Johnson and clever cinematography from Roger Deakins (the camera angles get skewed as the situation gets darkly violent) but also a misanthropic theological overview: though characters fall from grace (into a garbage barge), the heaven they're cast from is an empty, ghettoized deep-South parish that appears unclean and undesirable. They also possess a cluelessness as to what's funny, smarmily assuming jokes about irritable bowel syndrome are audience-pleasers; and their attempts at surrealist humor (most notably the varying expressions of a portrait meant to comment on the proceedings) falls dismally flat. With a sour Marlon Wayans, Tzi Ma (whose tricks with cigarettes contain the film's most entertaining moments), J.K. Simmons (from 'Spider-Man') and Ryan Hurst as Hanks' partners in crime; they're severely let down by the Coens' indifferent treatment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Should Be Renamed to The Classic Film Killers!Alec Guinness' version of this film was far more superior than this dull, one moment of laughter remake, and that was because the film paused halfway through due to poor cinema staff. Tom Hanks' superb acting only just made this bearable to watch for me, hopefully 'Terminal' will overshadow this and it will be long forgotten. This one will go in the list of money and time wasted without a question of a doubt and for their next outing of directing lets hope the Cohen brothers stick to something they can gain pride in.If you have not already seen the original, please watch it as you will like it and it is more pleasurable and more enjoyable to watch than this piece of ****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply not entertaining what so ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not the fact that it is a disappointing remake, it's not because it is a Coen Brothers' film and has nothing to do with high expectations. This movie is simply bad! How possibly could something like this happen to the Cohen Brothers? How possibly could this movie been released by a major studio? What did Tom Hanks think? How can somebody, who saw at least one other movie to compare with, write a decent review about this film?I never thought of the Coen Brothers as the geniuses they often are described as. However, I do admit that they had a couple of incredible creative, entertaining not to say brilliant films! Did the talent just fade away?I can not remember the last time I was so disappointed by a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The brothers Coen were once such Hollywood luminaries that, Midas-like, all they touched turned to gold, and each new release was welcomed and anticipated with certainty of it's quality. Those days ? and here I pause to wipe away a tear ? are gone. With the horrific advent of ?Intolerable Cruelty', seeds that were sown with the less-than-laudable ?The Man Who Wasn't There' flourished into utter tosh, and the Coens almost lost their infallible tag. Here, I'm afraid, the last nail is hammered home.?The Ladykillers' never quite manages to claw itself up from its raucous stereotypes ? a system that normally works (think ?Fargo' and ?The Big Lebowski'), but here only serves to highlight the films inadequacies. Tom Hanks performs admirably and, at times, with the great comic fervour he so often attacks, but something is lacking in his hissing, wheezing, slimy Professor. Irma P. Hall, lady-stalwart, is merely a gabbling southern ?momma', reminiscent of Martin Laurence's awful dress-ups, and even she cannot pull together the unravelling cords of the film. The ?motley crew' are comic relief ? at best Marlon Wayans provides his ?home-boy' jiggling, and at worst Tzi Ma fluffs schtum-faced anger. The premise ? tunnelling underground to empty a casino vault ? is well portrayed, with some fine comic turns from feline and canine alike (!). The intermittent moments of extensive dialogue, however, slow down the movie to a crawl, and allow an overall blandness to pervade the film, making it a bit of a struggle to stay awake and interested.In the end, whether they kill the ?old lady' becomes incidental, as the wish for them all to die just so they stop pontificating becomes the prevailing feeling.However, not to be all bad, the movie does provide some laugh-out-loud moments, which the cinema duly complied with, so I cannot quite write it off completely. My disappointment lies in the fact that I know the Coens can do better ? with a remake of an originally unsatisfying movie, the least they could have done was improved on the original. Peter Sellers, I'm afraid, would turn in his grave!2 out of 5 (report card effort? 'The Coens are capable of more. Must try harder next year.')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The primary and only problem with this movie/film is that people where kind of led (one way or another) into expecting a full-blown comedy. Something closer to movies such as American Pie and Scary movie in which the movie was essentially a comedy. This movie should have been portrayed as a "comic" suspense / drama. That being said, this movie truly deserves at LEAST 9 or 9.5 out of 10. It offers a sense of mystery, comedy, as well as something that keeps you tied and interested in finding out what happens next. Its Kind of like a catchy novel or book you just can't put down. As expected, it had a brilliant and dazzling performance by Tom Hanks, who truly made the role of his character spring into life. If you have not gotten a chance to see this movie, I highly recommend it, and it is most definitely worth your time, but don't watch it expecting a full-blown comedy :D :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I have no doubt some people will enjoy this film. Simply put, however, it was terrible...one of the worst movies I think I've ever seen.Tom Hanks's character was clever for the first few minutes. Then his constant banter starts to gets old...and then you just want to fast forward because you know what he's going to say before it comes out of his mouth, only it takes him 5 minutes to say anything so you start to glaze over and daydream about what to have for breakfast the next day.Marlon Wayan's character provided the only glimpse of humor in the film, but even he starts to get old because you realize there's nothing original about him.The old lady is just...boring. There's nothing really interesting about her. She's what you would expect a widowed, church-going, southern woman who owns a cat to be.Bottom line: If any unknown screenwriter were to shop this script around town, there is no chance on earth this film would ever get made, let around read. Slow pacing, extended dialogue, stereotypical characters...it's really a case study in what a film should NOT be.What boggles my mind is why the immensely talented Coen brothers would waste their time on this remake. They have to have a file cabinet full of new ideas of their own - why not take the chance and make one of those instead of wasting our time with this?2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Racial stereotyping......wtf are you talking about? First off, the characters were given their respective traits (which some are calling racial stereotyping) to give a comical, NON-REALISTIC aspect to the film.You can't expect a film that has a figure on a painting that changes facial expressions all the time to be an accurate, serious portrayal of life, let a alone having ANYTHING purposeful to say about race. The characters were who they were to make the movie interesting.And concerning the issue of stereotyping in our world. Stereotyping isn't the result of a misinformed public; there IS some truth behind most every (MOST every) stereotype. Not every young black male is like Wayans in this movie, but I've sure met a lot who are. If you gone through the public school system of the U.S. in any Suburban/Urban city, or even watch TV, you had to have encountered the rude, gangster wannabe, foul-mouthed black person similar to Wayans in this movie. It's just the honest truth. It exists out there, so complaining about stereotyping is just trying to suppress the truth. And this counts for all the other "stereotypes" in this movie. Haven't you ever encountered an Asian person speaking in broken English (William Hung). Honestly the world would be much better if people would stop and think before ranting on and on about "racial stereotyping."And on a side point, some people think this movie portrays women as subservient. This just crosses the line. It's like over-analyzing a book in English class. First off, the old lady didn't seem to subservient to me in the movie, she was the on who was in charge in the house. And also, no matter how much some people may not want to believe it, different women have different ideas about their role in society. Not all want to be 'on-the-go single working mothers.' Some DO want to be stay at home moms. And it wouldn't be realistic if the old lady in this movie was instead the CEO of some corporation, living as a single, powerful woman just so that the Coen brothers could satisfy a few people's need to see women on the same plane as men when in fact this has not been true. No matter what your take is on the role of women, you can't deny the fact that throughout history for the most part women have been subservient to men. Ignoring this fact is like ignoring the holocaust.All in all, it's a movie so shut up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should have known, with all the pre-release hype. I saw "The Lady Killers" last Saturday, about a month (?) after its release. The theater was only 20% full. We sat in front of a family who seemed really excited about the film, they were chuckling and commenting from the beginning. I should have noticed that the beginning scenes were slow and stretched out, that this was going to be the best part of the movie. I didn't laugh, even once, nor did my date. The family behind us got quiet. People in front left about half way through the movie. I am still waiting for something funny to happen. I remembered seeing a decent IMDB rating on this, so I was not dissuaded from seeing it, but now I remember how much I hate the highly IMDB-rated "Lost In Translation". But this was the work of the Coen Brothers! I love "O Brother...", so this movie HAS to get better. But after they killed off the hip-hop kid, I knew there was no way this movie is going to recover. I asked my date "Are you enjoying this?". "No". So we left. Today I see IMDB rates this as a 6.7. What are all of you smoking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say it with me... "SACKBUTT"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks leads a great ensemble cast in this Coen Brothers remake of the classic Ealing comedy. The Coens attempt to recast the Britishness of the original with American eccentrics, and it comes off rather well. Hanks is Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, at first glance a Southern dandy, but, in fact, a man with equal weaknesses for grandiose criminal enterprises and the classics, particularly Edgar Allan Poe. He rents a room in the house of the elder church woman and widow, Mrs. Munson (Irma P. Hall), under the pretense of needing a place to rehearse a quintet of musicians on period instruments in her cellar. These are, in fact, his gang (including inside man Gawain McSam (Marlon Wayans), ex-South Vietnamese tunnel rat `The General' (Tzi Ma), demolitions expert (and I.B.S. sufferer) Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons) and your basic classic lunkhead Lump Hudson (Ryan Hurst)). The plot this time involves a vault full of money, a riverboat casino, a tunnel, various explosives, and even a sackbutt. Yes, a sackbutt. Much rests on how well you buy Hanks'performance, but he does it for me allright! The only misfit of the cast was the cusses-like-Steve-Buscemi-in-Fargo-gangsta played by Wayans, but in the end it all well fits the dark comic template of the original, with broad slapstick and large bits of typically strange and funny Coen-esque foreshadowings. It's no Fargo or Barton Fink, but it's no shame at all either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why bother to fix perfection? The Coen brothers didn't take into consideration the fact they were messing around with a beloved classic of the English cinema that was the real thing.By placing the story in America's South, a territory that appears often in their films, would have seemed they had the right setting in their update. Well, the Coens, who are one of the most talented people in American films today, don't have a clue of how to make this version better. As far as this movie being fun, judging from the reaction on the screening I attended, it didn't arise any laughter at all.The best thing going for the film is Tom Hanks, as the oily, fake Professor G H Dorr, a man with a gift of glibness. The other reason is Irma P. Hall, as the landlady, Marva Munson. Ms Hall is an actress who tends to steal the show from under more established performers. Having seen her on stage, as well as other films, it is a rare treat whenever she graces anything with just her regal presence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen brothers on autopilot (**)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are two of the most talented and unique filmmakers working these days. They have made some of the best and most interesting movies of the last 20 years ("Raising Arizona", "Fargo", "The Big Lebowski", "The Man Who Wasn't There", and the underrated "The Hudsucker Proxy"). Even their throwaway films, like "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and "Intolerable Cruelty" are well worth watching. Now we have "The Ladykillers", and it's the only Coen brothers movie I've seen that is basically skipable (and I've seen them all except "Miller's Crossing"). That's not to say it's entirely without worth. It definitely has its great moments, but mostly it's a grating and unnecessarily crude, off-putting comedy. Most damaging is that it's clear the brothers are on autopilot, and it shows. Tom Hanks, in a rare villain role, plays a criminal mastermind named Professor G.H. Dorr, and he plays him to the hilt. It's understandable why Hanks (or any other actor) would jump at the chance of being in a Coen brothers movie, and I'm sure he had fun playing this cartoonish villain, but he's been given very few funny lines. Dorr is the most interesting character in the movie, but that's not saying much in this case.Dorr and his ragtag crew of criminals, the most interesting members being an asian man with a Hitler mustache named the General (Tzi Ma), and a demolitions expert named Pancake (J.K. Simmons from HBO's "Oz"), are renting the basement of a house owned by a religious Southern black lady (the very good Irma P. Hall). They are pretending to be a gospel music group, but actually they're planning on tunneling into an office that stores the money of a nearby Casino boat. This should make a perfectly good movie, but unfortunately, "The Ladykillers" is not a good movie. Most of the time it's smug, overly self-conscious and just not that funny (a profoundly irritating Marlon Wayans performance doesn't help). In fact, outside of the last 15 minutes (which I'll get to next), the only time I REALLY laughed was a 2 second gag about a swinging door that doesn't do what it's supposed to. Now, about those last 15 minutes. They're perfect. Honestly, if the whole movie was as enjoyable as the last 15 minutes, it would be a minor masterpiece. The story wraps up perfectly, and Dorr's grimly clever and oddly touching comeuppance is...well, it's actually got a glimmer of that old Coen brothers genius. Too bad it was nowhere to be found in the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplistic comedy ruined by interesting characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Me: Avid movie goer. See 2-3 films in theaters a week.I was very excited about this film as I am a great admirer of the Cohen brothers. So it is hard to describe how truly disappointed I was by this film after watching it.To begin with the character of the mastermind as portrayed by Tom Hanks was truly inspiring and enjoyable to watch. The rest of the cast does a solid job with each of their characters.The thing that absolutely destroys this film is how the plot is unfolded on the screen. I'm not sure I've ever seen situations so contrived and obviously incongruent with the nature of the characters . All though the plot is simplistic and uninspired this oddly enough isn't the main problem. The problem is simply that the actors/screen writers had too much fun and did too good a job making their characters. They forgot that it needs to seem plausible that their characters would in fact be so one-dimensionally stupid as to be in the situations that they find themselves in. If this was some sort of slapstick comedy then there wouldn't be any problem as the characters would be flat and cartoonish. This in NOT a slapstick comedy however so there needs to be explanations as to why these characters would say and do the inexplicably thoughtless things that they do. Because each of the actors does such an excellent job in creating a believable if peculiar character one simply can not suspend disbelief when they do things that not even a four year old would do.I will still look forward to the next Cohen brothers release as even a dog like this is still somewhat watchable do to the interesting characters that they create on film. I just hope they will learn their lesson on this one and realize that their beautifully created characters need at least a token of a credible backdrop on which to display them.Cast: Tom Hanks performance was excellent, probably one of his best. Rest of cast was above average and did credit to each of their characters.Cinematography: Good but not great.Story/Plot: Painfully idiotic, especially the final act.Editing/Direction: Very poor. Overall Rating: 2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are among the darlings of French press specialized in cinema and throughout the years I have warmed to their quirky universe either it is "Barton Fink" (1991) and its unusual climate, this sparkling black diamond that is "Fargo" (1996) or the zany transposition of the Odyssey at the time of the Great Crisis in "O' Brother Where Art Thou" (2000).This commissioned work that was to be directed first by Barry Sonnenfield, "the Ladykillers" met lukewarm reviews in the summer 2004. True, it's a very talky movie in which sometimes too many cues trammel sincere bursts of laughter (the moment when Tom Hanks explains to Irma P. Hall the truth about his real intentions). The interest is uneven about the different installments of the plot because of the care given to them. Too much time is spent about the efforts made by the bunch to achieve their break-in and not enough time is devoted about the means undertook by the bunch of baddies to get rid of their female owner and its results. And the pure linearity of the plot is a bit too blatant.But overall this remake of a British film made in 1955 is fun to watch. This is a remake transcended in a stylish treatment, the one that typifies the Coen brothers trademark. First at the level of the story: a main character who has a somber plan in mind which will go unravel because of unexpected circumstances. Then, the Coen brothers are always on top form when they depict a gallery of like-minded weirdos. Here, a dumb Chinese general with always a cigarette between his lips, a tough football player with nothing in his head, a restless black employee of the casino, a bald technician are under the professor's command and are linked by a ramshackle alliance in which bickering and feuds brew. Laughter are really here with enormous gags which give the film accents of slapstick comedy. This vivid description is doubled with a sharp satire of America imbued with religious values. The casino is located in Sodome and the river is called the Styx.It would also be difficult to resists Tom Hanks who is irresistible as the elegant, mean professor keen on ancient languages and also the brain of the operation. All these assets constitute a solid, defensive alibi to justify the change of scenery. The filmmakers also capture the vibe and mentality of the people who are rooted in the Deep South. So, this oddball overhaul exudes an effervescent, communicative treat and to deem the Coen brothers' 2004 vintage as a miscarriage is exaggerated. Perhaps not as indispensable as "Fargo" or "the Big Lebowski" (1998) but worth a watch all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a remake(no mention of this fact by Coen Bros). The original film,obviously called "The Lady Killers", is "the last great Ealing comedy".Anyone interested in the original film can find it on IMDb under that name. Would the film fall under the category of "PLAGIARISM" rather than (unmentioned) "remake"? In the "original" film (1955), Alec Guiness plays the leader of a gang of thieves who fool their "dotty landlady" into believing they are musicians while they are really planning a robbery.The film gave a first major role to Peter Sellers as one of the gang, but when everything goes wrong,it's the little old lady, a WONDERFUL performance by Katie Johnson,who emerges the winner. The "original" film is also the "winner" rather than the "remake"</fullReview>

The humor continually takes you by surprise. The witty sight gags would have done Buster Keaton proud.I'm glad to think that Joel and Ethan don't let criticism, both good and bad, influence their work. And so they just let their vision take them, and me, to whatever suits their fancy. I'm a ready passenger!In this film, they have taken many diverse characters, blended them together, and came up with a glorious, wonderful stew that I hope to sample often!This is the only film that I've gone back the next week to see again. It gets better with each viewing, and is endlessly entertaining. And I haven't laughed this loud since PULP FICTION. I even bought the DVD the day it came out! (VERY unusual for el cheapo me, who waits years to get dvds used on Amazon!)Joel and Ethan have added another chapter to their ever growing book of great films. They are like another great film maker, John Huston. Each film they make is totally different from another.I think it's a mistake that some reviews compare this film with others in their "oeuvre.' I think of this film as another chapter in the ever growing book of wonderful films that will be the Coen Brothers' legacy. Who else but Joel and Ethan could make a "feel good" movie?where people wind up dead??? This film can only be described as "glorious." It's nice to see the good people wind up winning in the end . . . even if it IS only in the movies!Comparing this version of LADYKILLERS to the 1955 Ealing version is like comparing Rossini's BARBER OF SEVILLE to Mozart's MARRIAGE OF FIGARO. Both are wonderful in their own right.(NOTE: Someone mentioned the bit about the portrait changing. I think it is yet another homage to Preston Sturges 1941 film, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS (which I consider one of the 10 best films of all time). Just as the title "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" came from that 1941 film, so there is a part where a portrait changes in THAT film also.)Will there be ever better film makers than Joel and Ethan Coen?

(that's literally the definition about this latter film I've read seconds ago in a comment and I do stand for it).Instead and quite soon, I was happily delighted, and really enjoyed "Ladykillers" as I did not enjoy any other film in many, many months, if not in a couple of years. Also, I do not like Tom Hanks, because I find his acting roles somewhat stereotypical, but in this one he is just... SUPERB!I keep wondering why this film is so underrated; it's UNDOUBTELY within my best 50 films ever, and I guess maybe it has to do with the fact that it is a remake and consequently there are comparisons. As for myself, I did not watch the original but soon will.Coen brothers are for sure at the best level you can demand for as directors (except again for O Brother), and I guess if John Turturro had had the role of one of the other three ladykillers (again, Tom Hanks is already great, and also is Tzi Ma, the general) then it would have been clearly better than "Big Lebowski", which already is one of the best films ever. Why didn't you hire him!?10/10 for this one, and I haven't given a 10 to more than a dozen films in all. Really deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>robbery comedy in the American South</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find myself disagreement with many of the IMDb viewers who saw and commented on this film, and with many of the critics. I liked the film, and I cannot imagine why other did not. The film is based on an original British comedy in the 50s staring Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers, which I did not see. The story is being transposed to the American South, and without reaching really the picks of 'O, Brother!' the Coen brothers did not land too far. This is a crime story with a gathering of criminals renting a room in an old black American lady home just to establish a base for a casino robbery from the basement of the building. They pretend to be Renaissance music players, although all of them with the exception of the head of the gang look like persons not able to spell properly neither Renaissance, nor music. Tom Hanks is their leader, and the fine actor enjoys himself in the bad guy role, playing the erudite university professor, combining a Southern accent with the charm of a Bernard Shaw character quoting from Edgar Allan Poe. Of course, as the film develops, the old lady will over-wit the criminals plans in a story that has nothing to do with real life logic, but has a lot to do with comedy logic. The film is filmed with style, well acted, and the comic of characters and of language is visible almost in any moment. A special note should be made for the musical score, the Coen brothers gathering again a collection of Southern gospel music, in a collection which makes me want to go and look for the soundtrack CD at the first opportunity. I enjoyed the film, it's an escapist show and not more, but not less either - and a well done one. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first movie I have ever paid for and walked out on. The previews for this movie didn't give a hint of how tasteless the movie was.The language was awful.If I was black, I would have been deeply offended by the movie's portrayal of blacks. Also,I not only didn't care about one of the character's IBS, I didn't care how the movie ended.The only thing that amused me at all was Tom Hanks character. He, as usual, was brilliant in his portrayal of the professor.If only the Tom Hanks character could have been in a better movie.</fullReview>

I'm no prude but , This movie is nothing like I had thought it would be. Mr. Hanks usually doesn't lower himself to such a crude, crass, absolutely foul mouthed garbage of a movie. The dialog is not something that I would want to sit through with my children or grandchildren. The Coen Boys should be proud of themselves theycontinue to sink lower and lower.

		<fullReview>a lot of people have criticised this film for not having any meaning or point to it, no necessary reason for it being madeThis, however, was the aspect that I enjoyed most about it. This is one of those films that, if you are willing to accept the film as tongue-in-cheek rather than a serious work, then it is actually a very, very good film. Hanks I thought was brilliant in his role as the doctor, and Hall was awesome in her role as the old lady. The only slight disappointment in the whole film for me was Wayans' performance, as a slightly over-emphasized black youth whose every other word was f*ck.Overall, a very enjoyable film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a sad portrayal of Black America. If I were a leader in the Black community, the stereo-typing of the characters results in further promotion of blacks as ignorant and drawn to the gangsta lifestyle. The constant use of the f word is horrible. Disrespect toward other blacks and toward women is horrendous. The only redeeming part of the movie was the main female character. An obvious slam on christianity with the Waylan brother wearing a hat which stated Jesus: My Homey while he used the f-word, calls another man's girlfriend a bitch and proceeds to pull out a gun threatening his life. The language caused me to walk out of the movie. I can't believe Tom Hanks is associated with it. Fortunately, the movie theater refunded our money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you really want to cringe,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>pop it in your DVD and turn on English subtitles. Using them is the only way to understand Hanks, who speaks his dialog so softly and into his lapels, that you have to read it. Oh, you could turn up the sound, but then you'd have Wayans screaming MF at the top of his lungs, or Irma Hall doing her Safire Stevens' mother bit at full vibrato. In print Wayans' language looks more puerile than it sounds.I watched this with my in-laws; he needs the subtitles, but for her, the foul mouths and tasteless gags were too much after forty minutes or so. We were there as company, and every minute sister-in-law was grating her teeth, realizing she could have come to our house to see the final episode of 6 Feet Under. I knew it was going to be a long evening when the dog died introducing one character. How funny those Coens are! I knew the plot, having seen Guinness pull the same robbery, and without tons of character introduction, or needless scenes like the gospel singing in the church after which the minister explains 'smite, smote,' stealing some 70's Black Comedian's shtick about the use of the verb 'to be' and rephrasing it. I kept expecting those master thieves, the Coens, to have Robert Duvall walk in and start preaching.How smarmy the Coen's have become! They just have to show us how hip they are with their choice of musical interludes. In 'Brother' it was white down home songs; here they prove to be equal opportunity hipsters. And these are the same people who brought Nathan Arizona to the screen. How low can they sink? We went home, turned on Turner Classic and caught "Hunchback" until ready for sleep. I had this horrible thought that perhaps the Coen's would turn their attention to it for a remake, with maybe Anthony Hopkins playing two or three roles. I kept waking up with nightmares. Avoid this disaster at all costs.</fullReview>

With their track record of great movies such as "Oh Brother Where art Thou"(even managing to get an decent acting performance out of George Clooney )"Fargo" etc (it's a long list of great, funny and entertaining movies) It's truly awful and it looks even worse when compared to the classic original. Attempts to raise laughs rely solely on heavy - handed slapstick, and "comic" accents. I believe Tom Hanks has admitted to not having seen the original, if he had, he surely wouldn't have gone anywhere near this turkey. Still the pay check may have helped ease any hurt to his professional integrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm getting old and my streetworthyness is from another generation but the Coen brothers (who's work I've always admired) have struck out on this abysmal movie. Tom Hanks (another guy I love) looked like he didn't want to be there. All the other characters were unfunny and had no comedy appeal whatsoever. The 'lump' character was an absolute embarrassment as a caricature. As for the character played by Marlon Wayans, his was one of the worst performances since Chris Turner in Rush Hour (remember the guy who thought he was as funny as Eddie Murphy and wasn't). No style, no comedy and who completely ruined the movie. If using the 'M' or 'F' word constantly is supposed to makes us laugh then real comedy has become a sad affair. The only redeeming feature of this shambles was the old lady who carried her part well if only as a stereotype southern black lady. Give me the innocent charm of the original anytime against this turkey. Thank goodness I only wasted money renting the DVD. My advice, for what it's worth, is never try and remake a classic. It fails every time. 'Day of the Jackal' and 'Manchurian Candidate' being prime examples.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens miss the joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes it only takes a single mistake to destroy a movie. The joke in The Ladykillers is a very simple one: namely, that a sweet tiny little old lady who lives in a world of her own and who wouldn't hurt a fly not only thwarts a gang of criminals who want to kill her and ends up with their ill-gotten gains but does it without even knowing it. Unfortunately, the Coens just didn't seem to get it and make one disastrous change in their remake: Mrs Lopsidey is now a huge, loud, obnoxious, hateful and extremely violent black woman who you want dead on sight. Not only do the crooks never stand a chance, but within seconds of her first scene you have no desire to watch a minute more.Things improve slightly when Tom Hanks' loquacious decayed Southern gentleman appears, but he's fighting a losing battle with her spite and vindictiveness. They then compound the error by casting Marlon Wayans, whose ability to spout obscenities is almost miraculously untouched by the ability to make any of them remotely funny. Thus the stage is set for the Coen's worst movie, and one that alternates too few genuinely funny scenes ? most involving J.K. Simmons and Tzi Ma's early scenes before the script run out of good ideas for them ? with moments of pure torture (the less said about Ryan Hurst's painfully misfired performance as the dumb lummox of the gang the better). By the time the miscreants finally put their minds to lady killing, the Coens have long since run out of ammunition, making for a flat, unfunny and painfully unimaginative last half-hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you expect from a film that is starred by one of your favourite actors and is said to have references to your favourite writer? I'm sure your answers would be "I wouldn't expect nothing less than a wonderful movie", right? That was my expectation when I got "Ladykillers" and brought it home to watch. What I saw, however, was a slow story that uses 60 of its 104 minutes to attract some of our attention. For a long hour we see nothing but a comedy with nothing really new to give us.The plot of the film is fairly interesting, but I don't think the directors did a good job in using it. The last half an hour of "Ladykillers" may be considered as the minutes that save the film as a whole, but they don't make it a superb work, as it could be.I must confess I liked the references to Edgar Allan Poe. They're intelligent and well built, so I, as a fan of his tales, gave the movie some positive points in my overall evaluation. Tom Hanks again shows talent and saves the day while saying Poe's words to the old ladies. It's really the best moment of the whole movie picture. I know it's a comedy, and it is surely designed to entertain more than to show us some logic, but there are some "holes" in the story that make us feel a little uncomfortable in some moments. I can't reveal many of these points cause I would be spoiling the story, but I can say many of the situations are far from fitting reality and logical facts. My rate 6 out of 10</fullReview>

This wacky comedy, imbued with the Coen's subtly sardonic humor, reverberates with prayer meeting gospel music and blatant unabashed silliness as the quintet of thieves set about to do their dirty deed. A not-for-everyone comedy which is long on style and short on story, "The Ladykillers" is more likely to elicit the occasional cluck of the tongue than boisterous guffaws. Entertaining though not memorable and worth a look by anyone into the Coen brothers off kilter sense of humor. (B)</fullReview>

If you have to rehash something as masterful as the original Ealing Studios version of The Ladykillers, at least do it with some style.it's bound to be compared with the original, otherwise it would have a different title and be 'inspired by' the classic 1955 film. If you are going to remake a film starring the great Alec Guiness, then you need someone who at least has a small modicum of the talent and gravitas that the late Sir Alec brought to the screen and the woful Hanks is not even worthy of mentioning Guinness name, let alone trying to emulate a role played with such panache. This shoddy remake has angered UK fans of the Eailing Comedies for many reasons: * They tried to make it a bit "wacky" * It has been set in the US * It has one of the poorest set of actors to grace the screen * it soils the name of the original gem of a filmThe only parallel I can think of is if a UK studio remade Goodfellas and set it in Milton Keynes with members of Westlife playing the leads. Atrocious. And to top things, Tom Hanks confessed in an interview he had never seen the original - great research for the role Tom! Lack of respect for the original film and treating it as a basic plot idea for a "wacky" story has made this a travesty that should never have been made. A rather expensive joke...</fullReview>

The plot is filled with largely irrelevant scenes, or if they have some relevance, then it is so filled with pointless dialogue I was searching for a sharp implement to slit my wrists, progress is painfully slow and the audience is never challenged emotionally or intellectually.I may be an un-cultured bohemian by not knowing what the 1955 version was, so maybe i should have had some idea what i was asking for. But there was almost nothing going on in this movie and the characters were way, way tooooo simplistic. Only Tom had any depth in his character and he did his best. But you can only do so much to save a movie with an boring script and plot. There was not a lot of creativity in this one....I will eventually recover from this trip into boring mundane madness but it is an hour and a half of my life i can't get back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was great to hear Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers on the soundtrack of this movie. I have recently been getting into this music, as it has the roots of Sam Cooke's singing style, and shows how he developed into one of the biggest influences in pop music. Seems like so many of the good artists start out with that rich, gospel heritage. Must be something to it. I know that Elvis also had his roots in gospel music, and Sam Cooke was Jackie Wilson's idol, so it's all connected somehow. I think the selection of music for this film was as unique as the "O Brother Where art thou" score, in that they used original and authentic bluegrass groups to sing the songs, and really brought an awareness of this style of music to the mainstream. People who had never heard of the White's or Union Station or Alison Krauss were mesmerized by this music, and all it had to offer. Even in a humorous setting, it still had an effect, and brought "air play" for one of the original American styles. Gospel and bluegrass are as American as you can get. THanks, Coen brothers for bringing these great music genres to the forefront, and giving everyone a chance to expand their musical tastes and acceptance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1955 "Ladykillers" is a great sarcastic black humor British comedy, with five elegant small-time thieves and an irritating old lady. This version of the Coen brothers brought the same story to the Mississipi, changed the armored car by a casino and lost all the glamour of the original movie. I do not know how American viewers feel regarding the accent of Mississipi and the behavior of the locals, but for me it is very boring. Tom Hanks is excellent, as usual, but for those who have appreciate the original movie, I believe it is impossible to like this remake.

		<shortDescription>Hanks Takes the Coen Brothers Hostage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved all the Coen brother movies but, unfortunately, this one was a let down. It kills me to write this but here is my analysis of what went wrong...The Actors &amp; Production Team did not Share the Same Vision.......and it shows on screen. The tone of the scenes and characters are wildly uneven. The movie feels like it was pasted together from other movies of unrelated genres and time periods.The odd combinations of mixed era costumes and set interiors are visually distracting. It takes awhile to figure out what time period the story is supposed to be set in. When introduced to Tom Hank's character it appears the movie will be set in the 1920's but then you meet his landlady, and she is an artifact of the 1950's. Then, suddenly, you are jerked to a casino scene that feels like outtakes from an Ice Cube "Friday" movie. The only cohesive element is that all the characters are underdeveloped stereotypes. Typically the Coens write quirky characters that are meant to be played full tilt boogie but here lack of a developed script leaves the actors running amok. Although the actors try to compensate their overwrought performances just amplify the offensiveness of the humorless material. Hanks' performance as Professor Dorr might have been fun in a short SNL sketch but his over-the-top delivery is hard to take for longer than five minutes. His mugging and affectations are blown even more out of proportion when viewed in the theater (or on a big screen). It is quite like watching the antics of a precocious kid who annoys everyone but his love-blind parents. While Hanks may have amused the Coen brothers, it isn't working on scene. The story might have looked funny on paper but by the time it reached the big screen Tom Hanks had taken the Coen Brother's hostage. Hanks character interpretation looks like it evolved in a bubble, cut off from his fellow actors and unrelated to the stylistic tone of the surrounding production. The effect is jarring and frustrating to watch. The Step'in Fetchit and Mammy era shtick is painfully unfunny. The casino scenes lack the usual Coen whimsy. Visually it feels like you accidentally clicked over to another movie. If you are looking for the usual Coen Brothers whimsy you may wish to skip this one and save yourself the disappointment. I can recommend this movie ONLY to people that enjoy dogging on movies that missed the mark. In that sense it is a good candidate for the at-home game of "Mystery Science Theater 3000." Invite over a few friends and swap smartass comments about movie while you view it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funnier &amp; Better Directed than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't hold the original 1955 version of _The Ladykillers_ in high esteem (and I explain in my review of it why I don't), so my expectations when approaching the Coen brothers' version of _The Ladykillers_ were suitably lowered. Judging by that, I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. This means I got the opposite experience compared to watching the original version: because the original is praised as a masterpiece, I was disappointed by it; not so here. The main thing I bemoaned about the 1955 version of _The Ladykillers_ was its ostentatious lack of realism; for me, I think this began right at the moment when Herbert Lom entered the widow's house wielding his violin as a machine-gun; yet no one can possibly be as dumb as that; with that moment, all semblance to the real world went out the window; it became clear that here was a group of actors trying to do funny things in order to excite laughs from the audience. And in that sense, the 1955 version was successful -- but only moderately so, in my estimation. Now, in the Coen brothers' version, we get the much-needed shift towards and infusion of realism; yes, the 5 gangsters are buffoons just like they are in the original British version -- but they are, at the same time, menacing creatures. The altercations between the risible characters of Garth Pancake and Gawain MacSam (fabulously portrayed by J. K. Simmons and Marlon Wayans) are as real as in any dramatic gangster movie (from the Coens or any other film-maker). And that's nothing compared to the menace exuding from "The General" played by Tzi Ma; I think this is one hallmark of great art: to succeed in portraying something as both funny and menacing at the same time; the character of "The General" is a 100% success in this regard. The transition from London to the Mississippi region succeeds splendidly; the changes and modifications in how the culprits meet their fate are all intelligent and fun to watch; the widow's character is less central in this version than it is in the British version, but Irma P. Hall is thoroughly believable in the role. The gospel-dominated "Southern" soundtrack, once more masterminded by T-Bone Burnett, is as delightful here as it was previously in the Coens' masterpiece _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_. Another shift was made to the "professor" character: Tom Hanks plays him as a far more literary and intellectual person (particularly in his diction) than Alec Guiness's professor in the 1955 version; in Alec Guiness's case, it is all too obvious that this is an impostor masquerading as a professor; whereas Hanks recites Poe so convincingly one might actually believe that that -- professor -- was his original vocation. The cat is, I believe, funnier here than the parrot(s) in the original version; dedicating the final scene of the movie to the cat and the macabre thing it holds in and releases from its mouth -- that is a quintessential Coenesque touch. So is the profanity; in most other films, you might be disturbed by it, but here, the screenwriters (Coens themselves) manage to interlace the profanity with the action so that it makes perfect sense. The addition of characters and events such as "Mountain Girl" and "IBS Singles Weekend" are as ingenious and hilarious as one would expect from the brothers. All in all, _The Ladykillers_ as remade by the Coens is no masterpiece -- there's too little substance in the story for that, I'm afraid -- but it delivers fine, solid entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I need to say I have no idea of who are Coen Brothers and what the remake of this film was about.I just liked the title of this at my local video store and thought it was gonna be at least funny. Not even good I was expecting. But it ended up being boring, perspectiveless, slow, unfunny, pointless, jejune and the only thing you get to think is "will this ever end?" I think even the actors in this film didn't watch this after it was released. I can't imagine someone inviting some friends to watch "The Ladykillers". Knitting may be more entertaining than watching this piece of junk. Keep away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there may have been an Ealing comedy titled The Ladykillers some fifty years previously, this remake of the latter must be one of the Coen Bros' near-miss despite some success on films like No Country for Old Men. Some remakes certainly have some success while others fail and were no better than the originals yet some research shows that sometimes if the remakes were made in the same country as the originals, they were bound to have some success while remakes made in different countries from the originals were 100% more likely to become a failure and this totally-pointless remake was without exception. Even the last of the original Ladykillers, Herbert Lom said that Tom Hanks was good but the film is terrible. Some of dialogue is okay while some of the language is rather crude and sometimes the acting is rather goofy and it doesn't really help with the characters acting more like fools than desperately hardened criminals. In the whole, this film is an unfunny and sorry mess its also difficult to understand why Tom Hanks and the Coen Brothers should have bothered to waste time in making this. Utterly pointless and one to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quirky, amusing black comedy is set up like an undistinguished caper film but elevated by sharp writing, colorful characters, and lively performances. Marva Munson is a devout southern widow who advertises a room for rent. It's quickly obtained by Professor G.H. Dorr (Hanks), an eccentric, self-proclaimed musician and gentleman who's really the ringleader of a zany criminal ensemble, which include a demolitions expert with an erratic case of irritable bowel syndrome, a lewd, foulmouthed man on the inside, a taciturn killer, and a bumbling meathead. Together they plan to pull off a lucrative casino heist, but complications ensue when Marva grows suspicious and their presumably perfect scheme hits some major detours. Effective twists, good lines, and witty, laugh-out loud funny slapstick (along with an energetic cast) make this a lot of fun. Hanks is broadly funny in a campy, cartoonish role as the silver-tongued, duplicitous Dorr, and Hall is a hoot as a sassy southerner. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent video rental that continues to improve with age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not often review films, but a reading of the reviews on this site dating mostly from the time of the release spurred me to add my two cents. A friend introduced me to this film about a year ago; since then I have viewed it five or six times. Each of these sittings revealed new lines, more nuances of acting and direction lying just beneath the surface of what is, as others have already noted here, a simple story.Parodoxically, a movie filled with profanity and toilet humor may have failed in the eyes of many because it is too literate and too subtle. I also suspect many of the naysayers for this Ladykillers remake set in the Deep South are partisans of that region. A Mencken-like satire of southern social and religious institutions ("The State of Mississippi has, in its infinite wisdom, declared that no wagering take place upon its shores") and a mocking of liberal hubris (Garth Pancake's Freedom Rider speech) probably helped to ensure that a large portion of the audience below the Mason Dixon were offended. Added to this are the usual folks everywhere who would have movie language reflect an earlier, more gentile time. Like many Coen Brothers brothers films, this effort seems to appeal more to the guys thus making it even more specialized--a guy flick which relies more upon timing and dialog than it does on action and storyline. Tom Hanks' excellent portrayal of a half-learned, anachronistic sociopath is one of his best in my opinion but my lady friend of the time found him too creepy and smarmy, adding perhaps a further, unintended nuance to the title.</fullReview>

Visually interesting with lots of color. A diverse group of characters with many fun interactions among them. Even the minor characters are fun to watch - how about the young lady followed through the casino by Wayans/MacSam. Of course, the soundtrack and music are great. But Tom Hanks really didn't fit the role of the Professor, although he was probably needed to help the movie at the box office. Tim Currie would have been my choice.

		<shortDescription>A quiet masterpiece from the Coens, and yet, not quite, if I may offer a riddle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is well known, the British can be rather protective of their "classics" (Alfie, Italian Job, Get Carter) so when it was announced that there would be an American remake of the classic Ealing black comedy Ladykillers, the critics obviously got a little, shall we say, snappy? Admittedly, there didn't seem to be any need to remake the original which was near-perfect and in no need of an updating. Fair enough, I can understand the frustration, and yet?I can't. For this is no regular schmo taking on the remake, this is the Coen Brothers' show. And when geniuses are at work, it's often better to shut up and let them do their stuff.The film starts off with a masterful, very dark intro as we descend onto a spooky gargoyle on which a raven is perched and way down below under the bridge, rests the Mississippi river where a boat is carrying trash over to the nearby garbage island. After that promising, visually inspired start, we follow Mrs Munson (Hall), an old righteous African American woman who lives by herself in a big, pretty house. Her peaceful routine is soon disturbed by the unexpected arrival of a strange, snobbish man who calls himself: Professor Gothwaite Higginson Dorr Phd (Hanks). From the moment he darkens her door, it's obvious he's up to something. With his geeky laugh, his insincere snaky smile and his sophisticated manners he starts to dazzle the innocent Mrs Munson with conversation and explains to her why he has come: he is looking to rent one of her rooms and he needs the root cellar in order to practice the music of the Renaissance from the Rococo with his "ensemble" (whatever that means). Or at least that's what he claims. Truth is, he is planning to dig a tunnel in Mrs Munson's cellar with his team of eccentric losers in order to get to the casino offices where all the money lies.In the team is Clark Pancake (Simmons): a strong-ish guy with a bad case of IBS and for whom every situation, no matter how hopeless it seems, can be resolved with a minimum of fuss: "easiest thing in the world!". The others include a quiet, serious Vietnamese man called The General (Ma) whose specialities include tunnelling and hiding cigarettes on his agile tongue. Gawain (Wayans) is the "inside man" of the group as he works at the casino. And of course there's Lump (Hurst), a brainless football player who's only there to provide the muscles. Everything seems to go well but have they underestimated the "harmless" Mrs Munson? When one day she finds out their little game (sort of) it all gets even darker and the group have to get rid of her which proves to be much easier said than done.It's a pity this film was so underrated upon its release because there's a lot to admire in it. Such as Tom Hanks' show-stealing incarnation of the sneaky, Edgar Allan Poe-reciting Professor (pretty much Alec Guinness' role in the original). It's a welcome return to comedy for Hanks which reminds us how terrifically funny he can be, it's a devilish performance which surely deserved an Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast is great, except perhaps for Marlon Wayans' increasingly irritating performance: he is clearly miscast, which is a shame because this creates an unwelcome weak link in the chain. This is a film that's not only very funny but also visually slick and perfectly executed not to mention brilliantly written (Ethan and Joel Coen really surpass themselves with the Professor's pompous dialogs) and very well acted. Having said that, it is probably the Coens' "less good" film (which is impressive in itself) and it is slightly flawed in that a few changes to the original film don't really work. Such as the old woman herself, whereas in the Ealing comedy, she was frail and vulnerable, here, she looks like she could take these bozzos on easily, so there's no real danger present, we know their plan is doomed from the start. Thankfully though, Hall is so good you barely notice the problem. Also, there's a lot of vulgar and crude humour which occasionally works but doesn't quite fit into the old-fashioned setting (hence the miscasting of the abhorrent Wayans). Other than that and a few other minor glitches, it's perfect: a nasty, gloomy, yet clever and very funny black comedy.Overall, the Coens prove once again that they haven't lost their magic touch and that they can effortlessly provide fine films which rise way above the average comedies we get these days (Mr and Mrs Smith my arse!). Wrongfully underrated and well worth all your attention. The Ladykillers is certainly an under-appreciated (if slightly flawed) little gem. I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most deplorable is the fact that I have yet to obtain the assumed pleasure of seeing the original, so what follows may be distorted, for I have no emotional attachments. (Was there a contradiction there?) I saw this, the brothers' second and hopefully final film that they did not themselves conceive, if you will, for the second time now, and slight growth of enjoyment could have been detected, had yours truly been observed with care.The dialogue is, yet again, the strongest feature on display. The exquisite rambling-on of our renowned "phd" is the most giving aspect of the whole film; such quips as "I was a positive lemur" and his everlasting erudition are infinitely hilarious. The others have their share of first-rate verbal wit as well.Dorr is a terrific character, and Hanks, whose troops, not acquainted with certain parties, have been shocked, shocked by his appearing in such an eccentric film, plays him excellently; his mere posture and sight is one for eyes sore from today's many uninspired, run-down works. The remainder of the fine ensemble supports him well, with Simmons and Tzi Ma turning in quite amusing performances, though some of the humour surrounding the former has an unfortunate tendency to appeal more to the part of the audience who have a taste for bowel humour (some have called these "bad fart jokes", which bewilders me). Even the tempestuous Wayans isn't as gut-wrenchingly irritating as one would easily imagine. His extensively foul tongue has been horrendously misinterpreted as lack of imagination from the writers' part. Some have suspected that it is a sign of his being an intentionally flat and stereotypical character; one is perfectly well allowed and able to scrutinise the film and its elements, including the fact that each character has been blessed with only two or three characteristics, against various theories; the task may even prove useful. Root, incidentally, is a fine fellow, and it would not be an unsavory turn of events if he were to partake in the making of another Coen (by which, of course, I mean a film).The discussed film is not as solid a whole as even their fingerquote-weakest-fingerquote pre-"Cruelty" effort ("Raising Arizona"), no, but it is a positive improvement after "Cruelty" (on which, too, I have commented, if I may so shamelessly advertise my petty scribblings). They have not "lost it". These two are mere well-deserved, if still delightful, breathers while preparing for a new masterpiece - hopefully a matter that will be proved with their next work, be it the closing part of "the idiot trilogy" or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Cohen Brothers' best by any measure, but still head and shoulders above the rest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of the original Ladykillers, the 1955 British film, was a clever one, but it had been made into such and ungodly dull and awkward film that it was practically begging to be re-envisioned. In an age where it seems like Hollywood is producing nothing but remakes, this one was handed, for once, to a pair who could really do it justice.Joel and Ethan Cohen, the writer-director pair who have made several masterpieces over the past twenty years, have produced a film that at least looks and feels commercially viable. It has humor, characters and visuals that everyone can appreciate. It moves at a steady pace, the snappy dialog carried swiftly along by an outstanding soundtrack, and is aided in no small part by Dennis Gassner's excellent production design, and by Roger Deakons' gorgeous and vivid camera-work.The sensibility that the Cohen Brothers bring to each of their films is definitely a unique one. Below the humor on the surface, there is something more sinister (and infinitely more humorous) at work. Take for instance the character of Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall), a nice old black lady, a widow with a cat, and her husband's portrait above the mantle. She writes a check every month to a nice bible school named Bob Jones University, a university that has a history of discrimination against blacks. Or take the 'fine colored by' Gawain (Marlon Wayans) who doesn't know anything about the Freedom Riders and, when annoyed by a veteran of the civil rights movement, says 'just tell me when they gonna leave!' Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons) reminds him that it was so people like him could vote, Gawain says he doesn't vote and tells him to where to stick it.By the way, the casino where Gawain works (the target for our 'merry band of miscreants') is staffed entirely by black workers, who are apparently cheaper to hire in the south than whites. When Gawain is laid off, he threatens to sue for punitive damages. His white boss reminds him that 'everyone on the custodial staff is black. Your replacement is gonna be black. His replacement not doubt will be BLACK!'Rather than just accepting this as the norm, the Cohens find humor and intrigue in these situations, and the astute viewer will notice this. Looking past the surface of this movie, which one might call 'zany' or 'farcical', there's some interesting social comment being made about the US and the south.As for the other components of the movie, they are all well assembled. Tom Hanks is great as Professor Dorr. Perfect (off-type) casting has lead to one of the best performances of the year. Hanks is having great fun with this role. The other parts are played just as well. Simmons is great as the self-assured, self-righteous Mr. Pancake, Ryan Hurst is adorable as the thick-headed Lump, and Tsi Ma makes a memorable impression as the silent General. Marlon Wayans is kept in check for once, and demonstrates that he can be tolerated, and actually be very funny, when directed by somebody other than himself or his brothers. As for Irma Hall, she fits her role like a glove. Also very memorable is Stephen Root as the casino boss. The photography is particularly gorgeous and inventive for a comedy; you can never go wrong with Roger Deakins. Despite not being the best film the Cohen brothers have done, this is an excellent and very interesting comedy that I recommend highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It probably wasn't a good idea to remake The Ladykillers, an absolutely brilliant English comedy with a wonderful performance by Katie Johnson. The original was so well done that it would be difficult to match it. But it's surprising exactly how much in this movie that worked in the original fails here. The movie is a series of missteps. The character of Marva Munson simply doesn't work in the story as well as the meek Louisa did in the original, and the ending feels less like a Deus ex Machina than like something contrived and rushed through.Of course, there are some interesting moments, because it is a Coen Brothers film, and they always do a few interesting things, and the southern small-town ambiance is interesting, although I could have done with a little less gospel singing. And I do like Hanks performance; it's always refreshing to see him play something other than those colorless, painfully sincere leading men that have made him a huge success and one of my least favorite actors. This is the only movie I've seen where I can say Hanks is the best thing in it, partially because he is better than usual and partly because it isn't that great a movie.</fullReview>

But then, please don't expect an Ealing comedy! This is a very clever re-interpretation, and none the worse for that.

		<shortDescription>A hint of the Coen and Hanks genius, but barely a hint!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a disappointment!I was hoping for a bit of "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", and that is exactly what I got, a mere hint. Thank goodness the movie only runs 106 minutes because I found myself continually looking at the clock wondering both when it was going to get better and how long before this painful viewing ends. Why anyone would envision matching the genius of Tom Hanks and the extremely limited acting ability of Marlon Wayans in the same film is beyond me. Hanks, though a bit wordy was the best part of the movie. However, even his character was flawed by "Local Dinner Theater" makeup that made him look more like a cartoon than a professor. His awful teeth and his bizarre laugh, make you stare at him rather than watch him.That is part of the problem here, everyone is a cartoon. Instead of unique wonderful characters the the Cohens normally produce, all of the cast seems like they jumped out of some cartoon or comic book. The possible exception is Irma P. Hall, playing the elderly woman who Hanks rents a room from. She lights up the screen and provides most of the very limited chuckles in this boring piece of fluff.The humor is hit-and-miss at best, and it is far from original. Even low budget Disney films would shy away from the portrait that changes with the mood of the scene. And "Irritable Bowel Syndrome" is something best left to Saturday Night Live skits.Wayans language makes this almost unwatchable as it is so grating to the rest of the film. Hopefully, the Coens will get back to their usual strong fare and not put something out for no apparent reason next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The least appealing film out of the Coen Brothers Catalogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never got the chance to catch the original Lady-killers before seeing the Coen Brothers but I made that my point of action because it would feel like a fresh new story which it was. If you're a fan of the Coen brothers films then it will take you no time in spotting that this is a film by them cause it gives you this feeling like O Brother where Art Thou and The Big Lebowski so if you like those movies you will feel right at home. As funny as the movie is you feel cheated completely by both brothers for their lack of characterization throughout. Tom Hanks and co just turn up with no real introduction to how they became there unit, or even why they are doing what they are about to do. This is off putting as far as the story goes because you are kept waiting to hear some of their backgrounds but you are left with nothing. Tom Hanks is excellent but after a while he character kind of fades out of interest with the rest of the film. Marlon Wayans was put there just to make the film more up to date I think as I think he was the one thing about the movie that is really off putting with his cliché jokes which we know him well for and hate hi for to. Wayans a side everyone is very good especially Irma. P Hall Who is great as Marva Munson, that's the merit that the Coen brothers deserve for the casting of her. I have now decided to finally see the original Ladykillers but only to compare, everyone who is a fan of the original do like the remake but believe it is more updated to ever be any better than Guinness's version which I think is actually what the Coen brothers were trying to do anyway so they could see the film as their own. Unfortunately for them it kind of worked but not the way they might have wanted. Ladykillers is most definite the least of The Coen Brothers back catalogue but it fits nicely with Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowksi. The last 20 minutes is where their black comedy humour really begins to show signs as we see more of a darker side to Hanks and co but it doesn't really save it. I do recommend seeing this though even if its not brilliant but definitely interesting enough to keep your attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great. It wasn't the best Cohn bros, but it was a great remake that definitely shows that Tom Hanks is still good at comedy and that making a movie that is just full of intelligent "dumb" comedy is still possible. The original Lady Killers is great. Peter Sellers, Alec Guiness...wonderful. But this one was good too. Now, I know a lot of people said this was a bad movie or an ill-concived movie. I don't agree. Had any other directors worked on it, it would have been much different and not as dark or as funny. So nay sayers, keep nay saying, as it is your right. But this movie tickled me. Every word out of Tom Hank's mouth was amazing. This just proves how good of an actor he is. All of those lines seemed extremely hard to learn and then spew out at the rate he did. I'll soon be adding this one to my film library. And I must, MUST have waffles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those with kids or my case renting this with my mother in mind don't do it. When I rent a Quentin movie like Pulp Fiction I have a good idea of what to expect. This movie is too much; my guess is people look for the shock value, well I don't listen to rap, and the writers use some of the shocking language for the movie's script. Enough of my tirade, and on with the movie review. Hanks' career has been in the dumps for the last seven years. More roles like this one, Tom will hit the skids like Bill Murray, and Chase. Tom Hanks should do an epic type role, for this would be fresh and would fit into Tom's acting style. For comedy to work there has to be a flow to it. The shock attitude and elongated scenes hurt this flow. There are a few very funny scenes, usually with the ex Viet-Cong general, and the garbage boat. I guess the boat is used to dump garbage into the ocean. The story is interesting to follow, I bet if they made this story into an action/drama there is a script too work with. Mike's review is 6 out of 10.Rent it with your girlfriend or wife, but not your mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it's OK-ish. But nothing special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's about as much as I can say about this film. I laughed a few times and I shuffled nervously a few times (mostly due to the tedious dialogue that Hank's character came out with). There was nothing glaringly wrong with the film, it just wasn't that interesting.I can't even really compare it to the original, since it has been so long since I saw the Alec Guiness version that I can't remember it at all.Some things about this version that I did find a little odd, though.1. The seeming anachronism between Hank's characters' 30's southern gentlemen routine and everyone else, who spoke and acted normally. Was this intentional? If so it was rather odd. The contrast between Hank's character and Marlon Wayan's "bro" couldn't have been more marked. It just left me feeling a bit uncertain as to what time period (at least early on) the movie was supposed to be set in.2. Marlon Wayans. Bad enough that there was a Wayans in this film. But do they have some contract clause that states their characters all have to act in the stupidest way possible at all times? It's difficult to see how his character would have become embroiled in the robbery plot without screwing it up long before they got to the old ladies house. His character was just a little too confrontational to have survived long enough.3. A few odd scenes here and there which were just head-scratching. For example, after being bullied into a music recital by the old lady, Hank's politely declines as Wayan's character isn't there to accompany them. When, a few minutes later, the Wayans returns, was I the only one to expect an awful music rendition from the group? Apparently so, as the scene cuts to the ladies leaving the house with not even the hint of any music having been played. What went on there?All in all, Ladykillers is an OK film, but nothing to write home about. The long moments of southern-drawl inconsequential dialogue from Hanks are easily tuned out without the film losing anything in the slightest. Gien this, it's a wonder that they are there at all. Likewise the real laughs are few and far between, making them all the more precious when they do occur.This is a flawed movie that could have been so much better with a couple of cast changes and a lot less meaningless dialogue. As it is, it's a watch-once affair.</fullReview>

See it at least two times, then you'll know what to think of it. The Coen brothers did an excellent directing job, as usual, and the other actors delivered excellent acting jobs.

		<shortDescription>a fantastic remake, and a brilliant Coens film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the original Ladykillers. Yet no film is sacrosanct, you are always entitled to re-imagine the story. Remakes are possible. There needs to be no justification. But a remake often falls in the trap of being nothing more than just a remake of another film. This one isn't. It's both a remake and a Coens film.Transplanting the story to Mississippi is a bold move, but it works. Mrs Munson is not Mrs Wilberforce, but she's just as lovely. And Tom Hanks surely can meet the standards established by Alec Guinness. In fact, there are some things the remake does even better than the original. There is more character exposition, more room given for development, and more concentration on details. The original was more heads-on to the story, this film actually depicts the world it talks about.And how it is done! The attention to detail, the minute observations, the overall love for the characters, and for the characters' goofiness, as if beams of light would grow out of the screen. Unmistakably a Coens film, to every inch.There's just one problem: You have to watch the film with an open heart. That's how it was made. Otherwise, you probably won't give a darn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-executed farce that oozes Gothic charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the Ealing Comedy of the same name, The Ladykillers is the latest film from the ever-reliable Coen brothers. Tom Hanks plays Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr PhD, a loquacious charlatan who takes a room in the house of devout Christian widow, and professional busybody Mrs Munson. Little does she know, however, that Professor Dorr and his gang of miscreants are using her basement to tunnel into a casino's poorly guarded cash room, under the guise of being a practising renaissance music ensemble. As is so often the case in these situations, Mrs Munson discovers the plot, and it is the gang's only option to dispose of her. After all, how hard can it be to kill one little old lady? This film marks a welcome return to comedy for Hanks after years in worthy but dull everyman parts. They may win him Oscars, but you can tell from the moment we meet Professor Dorr, with his immaculate devil beard, higgledy-piggledy teeth and snorting giggle of a laugh that he's never had this much fun playing a role. Hanks utterly steals the show, oozing an uncomfortable oily charm as he does so. The rest of the cast are uniformly excellent as well, as Professor Dorr assembles his gang from the typical movie assortment of comically mismatched criminals. J.K Simmons (Spider-man's J. Jonah Jameson) stands out in particular as a gruff explosive expert with an improbable mustache, but Marlon Wayans as an antagonistic homeboy and Ryan Hurst as an incredibly stupid American football player help round out the gang nicely.The relocation of the film to modern day Mississippi also allows the Coen Brothers to heavily tinge the story with the kind of Southern Gothic that they do so well. The streets are filled with mist, hideous gargoyles with screaming mouths look down on the events taking place, and the boats heading toward the city's Garbage Island are imbued with the grim finality of Charon's boat crossing the river Styx . The gang's preferred method of transport is even a hearse. However, it is against this Gothic backdrop that the Cohen's allow a finely executed farce to develop. Professor Dorr's eloquent wordplay, bringing to mind George Clooney's character from O Brother Where Art Thou, is hilarious in itself, and the bickering between the gang, and the devout Christian outrage of their landlady toward just about everything (especially "that damn hippity-hop music"), make for some genuinely excellent comic moments. There are a few gags that feel out of place, or fail to hit the mark (incongruously the painting of Mrs Munson's dead husband above the fireplace changes its facial expression in most scenes in reaction to what is going on), but the Coens create a cinematic world that is so involving and so enthralling that such misgivings fall by the wayside. Doubtless there will be cries of dissent from fans of the original film, but when a film is simply this fun to watch, such criticism can be easily ignored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an improvement on a brilliant original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film was a delightful entertainment, sending up the chaotic but mysterious atmosphere of postwar London (spoiler coming) and topping the whole charade off with poetic justice as the bad guys got theirs. The Coens' version delivers just as much fun, some marvelous jokes (You shitting me? to the guy with IBS)and crackerjack performances, notably Hanks doing a far more villainous take on the Professor than Alec Guiness with the ill-fitting false teeth, but it also carries a more thoughtful moral message. The old lady is given a much richer part to play, more reflective, more significant. Alexander McKendrick in the original left you thinking that after all there was no moral centre; the Coens set Marva Munson in a clearly conceived moral universe where justice is no longer merely poetic but actual and a product of the individual's own moral values. The cat was an inspiration, too. A splendid film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not classic Coens, but not crap either !MILD SPOILERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original Ealing version of this comedy, so I have no point of reference to it. I have however witnessed the majority of the Coen brothers' films, and so my viewpoint is relative to these films.Before I saw The Ladykillers, I read a few reviews of the film, some bad, the majority good, none brilliant, so I thought it was be a wise decision to enter the auditorium telling myself not to expect too much.The first few minutes of the film are a bit slow. I was eagerly waiting for the entrance of Tom Hanks, and stuck with the Luke-warm antics of Irma P. Hall talking to a portrait, I wondered if the film would be a total let-down. I mean, people were claiming the Coens were losing it. One particular review I read called The Man Who Wasn't There disappointing and Intolerable Cruelty 'frankly poor'. I did, however, enjoy Intolerable Cruelty, and loved The Man Who Wasn't There, in fact, I tore up the paper containing the review on the spot. Regardless, this film seemed slightly lack-lustre. Reviews kinda shakey, and their previous film not really living up to their others' standards, maybe the Coens were running out of talent.But then, just as I was ready to give up all hope, I see Tom Hanks standing at the door, dressed in a gray overcoat, armed with a mouth that could talk the tail off a donkey. His performance was, undoubtedly brilliant, perfect as the phoney Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr PhD.To be fair, the whole cast is brilliant. J.K Simmons (recognisable from Spider-Man as The Daily Bugle's editor, Mr Jameson) is great as the IBS awareness raising, blundering explosives expert, Garth Pancake; Marlon Wayans is pretty good considering some of the other things hes been involved in. Tzi Ma fulfills as 'The General' a quiet but bold man, dangerous with only his bare hands, and Ryan Hurst as lump. Not a particularly demanding role, but he plays it pretty well anyway, and is first scene in the film is great. Even Irma P. Hall pleases, despite my first impressions, more than holding her own pretty much whenever shes on screen.As I'm sure you know, the basic run-down of the story goes like this; Professor G.H. Dorr plans to rob a casino, and employs a team to help him in his plan. He bases their activity in the basement of a house belonging to an aged woman named Marva Munson. He plans to tunnel from this basement to the holding room of the casino and collect its wealth. The whole plan goes well (enough) until Marva finds out about their little scheme, and they're forced to either kill her, or to give up the money. Just around here is when people begin dying, and we're barely given time to breathe between each death. The cast seems so die away so fast, that only the first death makes an impression; the others aren't given enough space to themselves, and so we don't really get the time to contemplate each one.Basically, this film is far from a masterpiece, but its definitely a good 1 hour 45 minutes worth of entertainment. Just don't expect too much, and you should enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable enough, but Minor Coen work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the Coens, I admit I was a little hesitant to watch this film on the big screen but I'm glad I did. I've seen both this and the original Ealing movie in the same week so the original was still fresh in mind.Personally I think there are better Ealing comedies than Mackendrick's The Ladykillers, The Lavender Hill Mob being a particular favourite. That film would've been a great film for the Coens to remake, if anything at all. There's a big hat moment in that one fellas! Their decision to remake the Ladykillers apparently came from working on a script for a big-budget remake, and when the original director dropped out they took it on themselves. Many critics have compared this film as a mere doodle in the Coens filmography...but hey, it's a great doodle!OK, I admit that in comparison to the original there are several big weaknesses. Irma P. Hall as Mrs Munson is too obviously strong-willed to create any humour in the groups bungled attempted murders. Tom Hanks is very funny as Prof. G.H. Dorr Phd, and the Coens clearly haven't lost their knack for some wonderful dialogue. However Alec Guiness is much more unusual in the original, exuding a touch more menace; as if Nosferatu went to public school or something. Many people have complained that the inclusion of various bottom-related jokes are just there for an easy laugh. Well, yes, but the original had some fairly broad and unsubtle slapstick humour too, such as the scene with Frankie Howard's fruit seller. Yes, the Coens are going for a cheap laugh but why not. They are quite funny and one running gag regarding IBS has a decent payoff.Despite all this the film still has some genuinely funny moments and I had me chuckling quietly throughout. Tom Hanks, as mentioned before, is a delight to watch, and the rest of the "ensemble" are all pretty much one-joke characters, but they all have their moments. I particularly enjoyed some of Lump's facial expressions as he attempts to follow the Professor's wonderfully meandering "double-talk", as Mrs Munson describes it and the POV introduction to his character.Roger Deakins' cinematography didn't particularly catch my eye as in other Coen films considering the distinctive Southern location, but their were a couple of nice shots and some amusing cartoon-style whip pans and the ever-changing face of Othar Munson. Carter Burwell's music however was very good, in fact a few vague similarities in his various scores for the Coens was one of the few things that reminded me I was watching one of their films. I think many people have overrated the gospel soundtrack, it's nowhere near as good as T-Bone Burnetts work on "O Brother..." but it fits Mrs Munson's character and the general setting well.Verdict: Comparisons with the original aside, this is fairly forgettable but is great fun while it lasts. Fans of the Coens may still be left wanting more, but I found it more entertaining than their previous effort "Intolerable Cruelty". Hopefully the Coens will be back with more material in the league of "Lebowski" and "Barton Fink" but for now the whimsical "The Ladykillers" is worth a look. Rating: Tricky - an 8 when I left the cinema, maybe a 7 in retrospect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first: if you liked "Fargo", that doesn't make you a Coen Brothers fan. If you liked "O Brother, Where Art Thou", that doesn't make you a Coen Brothers fan. If you have consistently seen and enjoyed their films, THEN you are a Coen Brothers fan. And any Coen Brothers fan will delight in watching "The Ladykillers", a return to form after the very good, but not great, "Intolerable Cruelty". While it is certainly one of their lesser films, that's not saying much considering all of their movies except one (Intolerable) are fantastic. While Marlon Wayans almost kills the movie, Hanks gives a wonderfully strange performance, one of the best of his career, a character who uses about 50 words when 5 would suffice. The movie builds and builds to a brilliant darkly comic ending that is completely fitting with the tone of the movie. With masterful comic performances, great one-liners, and classic Coen direction, either Coen fans or those who enjoy offbeat comedies will love "The Ladykillers" as I do. And only J.K. Simmons could make me laugh as hard as I did just by the way he uses the term "that f***in cat"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God for Marlon Wayans (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a bit predictable (kind of like one of those short stories you read in middle school that had an obvious message or moral, and a predictable outcome), and at first I thought it took place in the 1800s when Tom Hanks spoke in that barely-understandable Southern accent, donned outfits that could've belonged to Colonel Sanders, and quoted Edgar Allan Poe. (Also because the old lady was dressed kind of old-fashioned and her house reminded me of an old Southern home.) I knew I was wrong when I saw Marlon Wayans with his twenty-first-century stereo and his "bling-bling". He was practically the only likable character. But don't get me wrong- the film really wasn't that bad. However, it obviously wouldn't have survived without Marlon Wayans' over-the-top ghetto humor (I was cracking up every five seconds during his scenes). It's one of those movies I'm not dying to see again any time soon, but I'd watch it if there was nothing else on TV. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film, but an ingenious Tom Hanks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I wasn't all that impressed with the original British version. There. I've said it. I thought it had a lacklustre script with poorly drawn characters. The Coen Brothers, on the other hand, have the exact opposite problem. The script isn't much better, but they're so fixated on delineating all five of their criminals into easily identifiable types that they've left realism behind in the dirt and gone for effect alone. And for my money, this approach is the better one for a medium-grade comedy.The one true stroke of genius here is the characterization of Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph.D. He's a character of seemingly limitless vocabulary and infinite lung capacity, and is not afraid to use both. He resembles nothing so much as an evil Colonel Sanders. Tom Hanks takes the ball and runs with it, giving him a style of address that's an odd mixture menace, affability, and condescension, not to mention a bizarrely obsequious laugh that seems to come from a nine-year old. This sole character is worth the price of admission.The thing that's always confused me about this movie is how everyone always assumes G.H. Dorr is only posing as a professor of the Greek and Roman classics. I'm sure he really is one. Only a man who has learned his Gorgias VERY well could conceivably have such mastery over the arts of rhetoric and sophistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not in the habit of writing film reviews, so bear with me, but I thought this movie was absolutely hysterical! I haven't seen the original (though I now intend to), but this one was great! Tom Hanks is perfect in his role, from the oozing charm to the conniving criminality. The other characters are all good too (I do agree that maybe there was a little too much profanity, but that shouldn't be your only reason for bashing a movie...). The trash heap barge routine is funnier every time you see it, I guess at least partially because you know it's coming, but still, it's funny. Hanks' character is perfectly done, right down to his death. Hall is also very good, and you've gotta love her husband's picture! I think the reason people are so down on this film is that they're looking for more in it. There IS no more in it! It's a screwball film! You know the moral three seconds in and you can probably guess the ending! It's the execution that matters, and that was done very well (esp by Hanks). The music is also beautifully used in setting up scenes. I have no ranking system to give, but I would recommend watching this movie AS LONG AS you remember that there is no deeper meaning here. It's entertainment, and that's it, but it's damn good entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Review: **1/2 out of ****. Ladykillers isn't the first time I have been disappointed with the Coen Brothers. I was extremely disappointed with O Brother Where Art Thou. Ladykillers maybe a notch above O Brother, but its still far from The Big Lebowski, Fargo, and Raising Arizona. One of the problems with Ladykillers is one of the problems I had with O Brother: The lead is miscast. Tom Hanks brings charisma to the role (like George Clooney did in O Brother) but he seems like he doesn't belong here(also like Clooney). There are times when his performance is actually irritating (that damn laugh). However, the rest of the cast seems much better. Irma Hall does a good job with her role. Marlon Wayans, J.K. Simmons, Tzi Ma, and Ryan Hurst are sometimes-amusing in their roles.Ladykillers is a funny film, its just not consistently so. The only big laughs I got, Unfortunately, did not come to the end. When the thieves begin to get hurt and die, the film gets really funny. They all die in funny and interesting ways(Especially The General. That had to hurt). However, besides that the comedy is hit and miss(its more of the latter).I have seen two comedies this year (Starsky and Hutch, Ladykillers). Neither were very good but I'd give the edge to Starsky and Hutch (it was much more enjoyable). I hope the Coen Brothers do better next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'm very particular when it comes to movies but this one certainly lived up to my expectations. tom hanks is a fine actor though he isnt the biggest star of this movie as everyone delivers. marva munson is simply delightful and her performance shines above even hanks. most people will agree that the crudeness level may be a bit much at times but aside from that the movie delivers top notch laughs and some very twisted moments. characterizations are a bit over the top but that is intended; this is a comedy, albeit a dark one, and should not be taken over seriously. maybe not for all tastes because of some of the language and content but its so goofy you cant help but laugh. 3 stars out of 4 - easy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are back. This was the feeling I was filled with as I rose from my seat upon seeing their latest release a remake of the 1955 film `The Ladykillers'. Back from where though? It was only last year that their previous film `Intolerable Cruelty' was released. A film that, in my humble opinion, was misunderstood. In everyway this George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones vehicle was a charming film going experience. Certainly not the dud that most purported it to be. But for whatever reason it lacked that `Coen Brother feeling'(Barton Fink is obviously my favorite Coen outing). With `The Ladykillers' the feeling is back and so to many it will seem the brothers are back.Let me state that I have never seen the 1955 comedy on which this version is based. That said let me say I found this film to be enormously funny. From beginning to end the laughs don't stop. Comedy is about timing, period. And this film is so well paced. From its outrageous performances to the rock solid script, it's all right on time. The films comedy is simultaneously outrageous and subtle. The Coen's don't waist a moments screen time. The subtlety comes from how well everything is woven together, how every moment pays off either right away or later. Mr. Hanks as Professor G.H. Dorr is superb and provides much of the afor mentioned outragousness. He gives a performance so convincing you honestly forget this is Tom Hanks, cliché, yes, but completely true. His very presence makes you laugh. If it dosnt you should demand your money back because you wont enjoy this film. J.K Simmons (Spiderman's J. Jonah Jamison) is brilliant as the films `Jack of all trades Garth Pancake. Like Mr. Hanks he seems to enhabit his character so fully as to completely convince you that there is no performance at all. Nothing new here from Marlon Wayans who is funny as usual and in this film doing essentially what he is best known for. Rodger Deakins beautiful eye for all things cinemagraphic once again teams with the brothers for the 8th time. And thank goodness for that. His style is completely without flaw and totally suits this portrayal of the American south. When I think about the cinematography of this movie I think symmetry and repetition. Repetition is also comedy and the Coen's know this. Why else repeat the trash barge shot so many times?So basically.yeah, I liked this flick. The sleight disappointment of Intolerable Cruelty(and I do mean sleight) is now quelled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been so much better. Hanks is the Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps Marlon Wayans is the most typecast performer in the universe; however, the merit of his lowly performance is not enough to sink this film entirely on its own. The mysterious gathering of Hanks and his cohorts into the house of an unsuspecting, church going, widow in Mississippi is nothing less than bizarre. This unconventional caper 'delves' through choppy religious and poetic references that can't save the film. Digging through the sub-terrain towards and eventually into a river-casino boat's vault, the agenda of the men is discovered by the woman of the house. She threatens police action at which point the men , quite oddly, are killed off by.... The only thing that saves this film is the uncanny wit and charm of Tom Hanks. The Ladykillers is no classic, but is worth seeing(renting) for Hanks performance alone. Coen bros really ruined what could have been a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the original version of the film, so I can't compare the two. However, this version did grow on me a few days after seeing it. No, it is not knock down funny, but it is amusing. Unfortunately, the members of the gang, other than Hanks' haughty professor character, didn't have much depth to them. I liked how Hall and Hanks played off of each other. Her character was naive, but not dumb. I liked George Wallace as the small town sheriff. Then came Wayans, playing the typical thugged out character that has been seen in too many films and needs to be put to rest. However, seldom have I seen a movie where the music comments on the characters and the actions perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better if British</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the British must be better at this type of movie, because they don't need to cater to Hollywood taste. And isn't it strange that a movie that seems to challenge Hollywood sensibility, ends up being considerably diminished by its very use. What I mean is that a movie which promises to go with intelligence, too often gives in to stupidity, offensiveness, and yes, more of the f-word crap. Most of the latter is courtesy of the Marlon Wayans character and to a lesser extent, to the JK Simmons role. It's as if smart, good comedy has to be balanced with dumb, bad comedy. The movie also suffers from a kind of flatness because the roles are too stereotypical. What the movie needs is more of Irma Hall (perhaps a more aware character) to match up with the exceptional performance of Tom Hanks. I would love to see this whole project re-done in a more realistic and human vein with an entirely different ending and with convincing roles assigned to all of these very good actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O' Brothers where art thou?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I finally got around to seeing The Ladykillers. I confess, I didn't really have any desire to see it, however, I have seen every Coen Brothers film to date, and I guess I felt obliged to fork up the cash and watch their latest, despite the fact that almost everyone I knew hated it. Well I saw it, and I stand before you now saying that I did not hate this film. It just really didn't do much for me.Visually, the film was simply amazing. Roger Deakin's definitely lived up to his reputation in my mind as one of the greatest cinematographers of our time. The soundtrack was also great, and fit the story nicely in a strange coen brothers kind of way. However, the rest was utterly forgettable.One of the biggest problems with this film is Tom Hanks. Now don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is truly a great actor and he is doing a pretty good southern gentleman impression in this, but after about five minutes he becomes unbelievably annoying. I think the main problem with this character is that it is really more of a supporting role. The Professor he plays is someone who could be a great quirky, eccentric character if he was just another member of the band of "musicians" who are conspiring to relieve a local riverboat casino of 1.6 million. But he is made much more than that and we are forced to sit through nauseatingly long scenes in which he doubletalks endlessly and recites Edgar Allen Poe.In Contrast, Irma P. Hall delivers a wonderful performance as the unwitting host of Hanks' criminal enterprise, Allowing them access to her root cellar for their "rehearsal," unaware that they are actually secretly tunneling into an underground vault. Another noteworthy performance is Eddie Murphy's. He is hysterical here in an uncredited cameo as the eccentric choir director. Marlon wayans has his ups and downs and provides both laughs and squirms. Tzi Ma plays his role well, making the most of his limited dialogue. J.K. Simmons gives us the bathroom humor (where would we be without it?) he has a disease called IBS, which basically consists of random bursts of flagellance at various points in the film.So, is this film a pretty good comedy delivering some good laughs? Yes. Is it a Coen Brothers film though? No. So where are the Coens? You're guess is as good as mine. And while some things about this movie scream Joel and Ethan,They remain decidedly AWOL throughout. Maybe someday they'll come home to their former glory, but right now, they are definitely out of their element.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re: Wow I guess I should have stuck around to see this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was I guess not in the best shape to see this movie, since I walked (or should I say drove) out on it. I like the Coen Brothers movies so I was happy to learn from the intro that it was their movie. Before you persecute me understand that it was playing at a local drive in and I was their with my children who were all sleeping at the time so I thought I could watch it free of interruption. Don't think I am some kind of bad mother, they have video equipment in the car to amuse themselves, and it is because I am so devoted to them that they go everywhere with me. I have to admit I was really there to see the film that was play with Ladykillers and had not really even considered what it was about. However I was just baffled and I found the characters very difficult to understand (could have been the crappy drive in but it does have the latest car stereo sound system). Don't beat me up like that kid who posted that she hated it. I had the sound so loud that it woke the kids who were immediately drawn into their own movie but with the usual kid chatter, following the movie was quite difficult at that point. So I beg of you can someone just explain it to me in a nutshell! I have some off time coming up, is this film worth me spending it in the comforts of a real theater or not?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens have crafted a dark comedy that although not their best work and ludicrous in story, remains to be a laugh-riot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some think that Ethan and Joel Coen films have become trivial considering their former successes with `Raising Arizona' and `Fargo.' Their previous film `Intolerable Cruelty' was nothing special, but still a humorous romantic romp. Their current film, `The Ladykillers,' is a remake of a 1955 film of the same title. This new version stars Tom Hanks and it is a better comedy than `Intolerable Cruelty.' Perhaps one of the reasons that critics are starting to look down on the Coens is that their current releases are more of a simple breed-but one cannot conclude that the Coens are making bad movies. Sometimes filmmakers do not want to break new ground-they simply want to make a movie. With `The Ladykillers,' the Coens have crafted a dark comedy that although not their best work and ludicrous in story, remains to be a laugh-riot. `The Ladykillers' tells the story of Marva Munson, a widow with impeccable values living in a small Southern community. One morning she hears a knock at her door and a man, resembling that of a young Colonel Sanders, is standing there. His name is Professor G.H. Dorr. He speaks with a Southern drawl, has a great deal of intellect and he strikes Ms. Munson as somewhat unusual. Wanting nothing more than to rent a room, she informs the Professor that she is looking for a quiet tenet. His response is, `Madame, you are addressing a man who is quiet and yet?not quiet.' What Ms. Monson does not realize is that the Professor is a criminal mastermind and has plans of his own. The widow has a root cellar and if tunneled through properly, it could lead to an underground counting room of a gaming ship docked nearby to Ms. Monson's home. The professor tricks his new landlord into believing that his visiting friends are non other than musicians and they are practicing music in her basement. But the heist will not be easy-Ms. Monson is a curious old lady and no matter how the men try to allude her, she always ends up in their way. The real scene-stealer of the movie is not Hanks-rather Irma P. Hall who plays Ms. Monson. Her portrayal of a holier than thou old lady is excellent. At the film's beginning, she makes a trip to the local police station where she complains to the sheriff about what she calls, `hippity-hop music with the titles spelled all funny.' Moreover, one of the Professor's accomplices is called Gawain, played by Marlon Wayans. He begins to curse in Ms. Monson's presence and since she is a devout Christian, she will not allow that kind of language in her home. She begins to slap Gawain repeatedly claiming that she tries to smite the wickedness out of him. Beyond Ms. Monson, the Professor himself is hilarious to watch as he constantly refers to Edgar Allen Poe quotes and manages to come up with new and amazing ways to trick Ms. Monson into believing he is someone that he is not. Furthermore, his gang is the funniest combination that has been seen on film so far this year. There is an explosives expert named Garth who suffers from irritable bowel syndrome, a former Chinese General who owns a donut shop, a bad football player named Lump, and a cocky insider into the gaming ship named Gawain. All in all, `The Ladykillers' is nothing remarkable, but it is certainly a funny film to watch that will leave you rolling in the aisles of the theater. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Ladykillers" story doesn't start right away. During the first 10 minutes we have to see how each of the "ladykillers" lives.As always the Coen Brothers attempt to have non-standard characters. Some of them are really good such as Irma P Hall, Tom Hanks and J K Simmons. However, several characters are ridiculous. Marlon Wayans is a good actor but he overplays the stereotype of a black man who uses at least two curse words in each sentence and seems to be unable to do anything right. Also, one of the ladykillers is a tall, muscular, man who is, of course, very stupid, and for some reason, unable to talk clearly. What he did and what he said remains a mystery to me.This film is worth seeing although there are some real flaws. The gospel music is excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Language is Magnificent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much offense taken at the "language" in this film. One of the things that I most loved about it and found most remarkable was the language...ALL of it. From the elegant, erudite Tom Hanks to the old- time Southern Irma P. Hall, to the vulgar Marlon Wayans, to the plainspoken J.K. Simmons, to the monosyllabic Ryan Hurst to the taciturn Tzi Ma. Each character had his/her own manner of speaking that defined their particular character. That is what good dialogue is all about. Far from being offended by Marlon Wayans, I was in awe of how his character was as much a master of "gutter" language as Tom Hanks' character was of high-blown rhetoric, and found the contrast between the two to be hilarious. All too often movie dialogue is seen as secondary to plot and character. Finally, a film where the characters don't all sound alike and sometimes don't sound like anything I've heard before! Thank God for the Coen Brothers, who realize how inextricably dialogue is intertwined with character and continue to amaze me with the way they work AND play with language.</fullReview>

My teenagers would've enjoyed it, but there's no way I'm going to let them see it with the language. There were several people who left the theatre due to the language and I was very tempted to. I was very disappointed in Tom Hanks (even though he didn't use the language) that he was involved with a project that used it so extensively. I had higher expectations of him prior to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I laughed my head off!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other night I went to see the latest version of a 1955 classic, "The Ladykillers," starring Tom Hanks and Irma P. Hall. I had no idea this movie was so funny. I practically laughed my head off in the theater. A few other audience members were likewise laughing like crazy at all of the wild antics going on between a fake music professor and his cronies, and a fine, senior Christian lady who also becomes their landlady of sorts. I did not approve of all of the profanity, which did not contribute very much to the general story line, but I did like the overall screenplay structure, based on the original Oscar-nominated British screenplay by William Rose. The characters, with all of their idiosyncrasies, bear certain traits which are key to the plot. I believe the entire cast truly enjoyed themselves on the set, and must have found it very hard to keep a straight face while the cameras were rolling. I must thank brothers Joel and Ethan Coen for concocting such a wise, zany, and satisfying adaptation such as this new version of "The Ladykillers." When you mix elements such as the Old South with contemporary times, grand theft, classical and gospel music, innocence with deceit, and an expressive portrait of a deceased gentleman, something unusual and crazy is bound to happen. Even without having seen the original movie, this remake gave me a pretty good idea of how well the original version was written and acted. For a great time at the movies, I recommend that you go and see how funny, yet touching "The Ladykillers" really is. If you like black comedy, in the vein of "Brazil" and "American Beauty," then "The Ladykillers" is definitely up your alley.</fullReview>

The members of his "gang" are a little cartoonish, and sometimes irritating, especially the gung-ho Mr. Pancake. Some of the dialog in the scenes in which the gang members interact is a little one-dimensional, and could have been better written. Repeated use of the "f-word" does not add up to humor in my book. The woman who plays the land-lady is marvelous. She held her own on screen with Tom Hanks. How many actors could accomplish that?I loved the cat in the movie as well.

		<fullReview>There is an inevitability about the Ladykillers that I like. The films opens with shots of an island of garbage and a slow moving barge that ferries the trash from the mainland out. And like that barge you can sort of see where everything is headed, it's the genius of the film that it somehow still keeps things interesting. Forget that this is a revisioning of an older film, as the similarities between the two are mostly starting points for the Coens much the way they claim a movie of Homer's Odyssey was the starting point for "Oh, Brother! Where art thou?". Irma P. Hall and Tom Hanks are pure creations and they make the movie. Hanks is the kind of charming but despicable rat that you'll cringe with as he's put in progressively more awkward situations, but you'll never want to cheer him on or see him win. Which is important because the movie has a moral center upon which the comedy and pathos depends. The comedy has a broad appeal. The movie seems to be made to play to two entirely different audiences. Those who enjoy watching a "Mama" character slap around the "man- boy" and those that like Tom Hanks dressed as Colonel Sanders saying "Roh,koko". Mixing high brow and low brow is nothing new to the Coen Bros. but it's never been as obvious as it is here. I feel compelled to mention that the movie looks fabulous. Shots of the police station look so flat they seem almost 2 dimensional. The colors are muted but almost cartoon-like. And the hiphop and gospel soundtrack really further establishes the duality of the movie. I'm sorry if I have not helped you decide whether to see it or not. I will do so now: Watch it. If you don't have a stick up your arse, you'll find enough SOMETHING here to make you smile. Because this is a movie that looks and feels like a FILM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen many of the Coen brothers films and seen practically everything that Tom Hanks has ever done, I was excited with anticipation in seeing the collaboration of this team. I was left disappointed and felt roped in to seeing a film that was OK at best. The movie starts out in a very disjointed way as the main characters are introduced to the audience with harsh edits between scenes. The audience is not given any explanation as to what they are seeing or why they are seeing it. It is only about 25 minutes into the film that Tom Hanks character (The Professor Dorr) actually introduces the members of his band (of criminals). The whole premise of this film is that a group of smalltime criminals sets up operations in an elderly black womans house to tunnel next door into the vaults of a small riverboat casino. The elderly womans character is the only character in the film which the audience connects with and can actually relate to. For the most part all of the criminals characters are drawn up very two dimensional including the character played by Tom Hanks. I have read some reviews stating that Tom looks like he had more fun doing this film than he has had since making Forrest Gump back in the mid nineties. Nevertheless, the Coen brothers fascination with morbid humor does show occasionally throughout the film as well as their decision to use period type folk music to enhance their soundtrack is typical of such films as Raising Arizona and O' brother where Art Thou? The comedic moments in this film contrary to the trailers I have seen are few and far between and I was left with a feeling of wanting more to make this film complete. Having never seen the original movie that this version is based on I can only suggest to the Coen brothers that they start writing their own material again as they seem to have a much better time at it when they come up with everything from scratch. I also felt that there was an excessive amount of profanity in this film that I cannot remember from other films the Coen brothers have made. Ultimately a disappointing film, lucky it was on discount night at the theater or I would feel more cheated than I already do. I won't even consider purchasing the DVD when it comes out!</fullReview>

However there are times when this movie falters. Marlon Wayans's character is a) not funny, b) offensive and stereotypical of black people, c) drags this movie from a PG-13 to an R rating all by himself, d) the least funny Wayans brother. His character undermines the whole movie. The other problem is a subplot about Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This subplot is unnecessary, unfunny, has nothing to do with the rest of the story, and feels like something that should have been discarded in an early draft of the script. After seeing this movie twice, I do recommend it in spite of its flaws. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I can't believe the negative comments this film is getting. My wife and I saw The Ladykillers this afternoon and we both loved it. First, forget that this is a caper movie. The casino heist only serves to offer a minimal plot over which to drape a great cast of characters, impeccable art direction and cinematography, dark, broad humor, and the final trademark of a Coen Bros. film: virtuoso use of language. The film is neatly bookended by Ms. Munson's visit to the County Sheriff, which at the start of the film immediately introduces her rich character. Soon we're off on the Coen Bros. flights of verbal fancy, which enter earth orbit with the introduction of Tom Hanks' Prof. Dorr character. Follow his words closely, for they require a near-encyclopedic knowledge of academia, classical language and allusions, and Southern idiom. But this is not an intellectual exercise... it's all part of the fun, just like translating Hi's faux regionalisms in Raising Arizona.I guess I could go totally P.C. and decry the broadness of Ms. Munson's black southern churchgoer, the "stereotypical" urban street lowlife played by Marlon Wayans, or the fun had at the expense of Irrital Bowel Syndrom sufferers. This is a broad, dark comedy, people. Rarely have I heard the the word m*th*rf*ck*r used with such panache and brio. And the look of distress upon Garth Pancake's face as he suffers an IBS attack is exquisite.And, oh, the trademark Coen visual setpieces. The opening and closing shots of the County Jail, already mentioned. The bridge spanning the river and the plunge of objects to the trash barges below. The glory that is Ms. Munson's parlor and the portrait of her deceased husband that dominates it.So watch the *whole* movie, people... throw out your preconceptions of what a Tom Hanks role should be, what a caper movie should be, or even that this is a remake of a highly regarded heist flick. Revel in the art direction and set decoration, the ear for language, the broadly drawn characters, and the wonderful photography. This is a Coen Bros. film and we are blessed to have another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course the movie has a lot of swears, it has marlon wayans! So what if it saids f**k alot in it. Tom hanks is a funny man everything he saids is a stitch! I thought the general was a cool chinese guy, and mountain girl was hideous. It was funny at the end. the stupid football player was funny sometimes but stupid. The old lady was sometimes annoying because she didnt give them any privacy. I was so mad when she wanted to give the money to the university. Pancake was a greedy man, and it was funny how he blew his finger off. Marlon wayans was hilarious!! I like him better than all the wayans brothers. I like this movie, but i wouldve liked it more if it was a better looking heist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladykillers Is Simply Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm convinced that Tom Hanks can play any part and make it totally believable. In Ladykillers, he plays a well spoken southern gentleman by the name of G. H. Door. He plans to pull off one of the most bizzar robberies you could ever imagine. Irma Hall plays an endearing Black lady who, rents the good professor a room in her house ,along with the use of a large basement. To go further would take away the element of surprise. Actually this film is full of surprises with the ending being the greatest of them all. Marlon Wayans, plays the part of Gawain, one of Dorr's partner's in crime. He delivers one laugh after another. There have been mixed reviews directed at this wonderful film. I hope that you will decide to see Ladykillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Language a TURN-OFF</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that this movie would have language that would not be acceptable to many people being a Coen Brothers movie. I did not expect that every other word out of Wayans or Simmons mouth would begin with "F", "B", or "N". I was embarassed and upset by the foul language. Hanks performed well as the eccentric character, full of himself. Ms. Hall steals the movie, but I think is much too strong for the "little old lady" she is supposed to be. I love the music track, but it is destroyed by what is said by Wayans. I was disappointed and did not have a good feeling upon leaving. I know it is R rated, but it still went too far. Maybe the DVD will be edited or it may be the first Hank's I won't buy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE LADYKILLERS (2004) ***1/2 Tom Hanks, Irma P. Hall, Marlon Wayans, JK Simmons, Tzi Ma, Ryan Hurst, Diane Delano, George Wallace, Stephen Root. The Coen Brothers nutty and very broad interpretation of the cult classic Alec Guinness Brit comedy about a gang of burglars who manipulate a sweet old lady (Hall, a fine straight woman foil) by posing as musicians to gain entry to her root cellar which leads to their target: a casino's bank vault worth millions. Hanks scores his goofiest role to date (all Van Dyke/odd teeth and stifling, sniggering guffaws) as the quintet's ringleader, a Southern-fried (think the bastard son of Colonel Sanders!) self-proclaimed professor of classics whose mellifluous pontifications sooth-says the slapstick proceedings at hand with cool-head and silver tongued deviltry. Funny and inventive with a wonderful production design by Dennis Gassner, lovely cinematography by Roger Deakins and a comic ensemble of truly motley proportions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary vulgarities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a really interesting movie with a fascinating story line. Tom Hanks played a fascinating character. But for some reason the screenwriters found it necessary to make the language as vulgar as possible, which added nothing to the movie or the characters. The gutter language ruined the movie. I felt like I was watching two movies, one with an interest storyline and fascinating characters, the other a raunchy rap movie. It was like the whole movie would have to occasionally stop so some of the characters could spew out a long line of foul language at one another, which was not interesting, not funny and not at all necessary. It seemed completely out of place, for the setting, which I guess was supposed to pass as humor. If this was the point, it got real old, real quick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only the Coen brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what I would call their third "all out" comedy following Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski, the Coens have once again concocted a screwball comedy with a style all their own, and once again they have succeeded in creating a genuinely funny film.The premise here is, by definition, unoriginal. Not only is it a remake, but the same basic story (minus the old woman) has been told countless times. The reality is, this doesn't really matter. The Ladykillers is unlike any other heist film ever made, including the original. The Coens have created a truly bizarre and hilarious cast of characters, with Hanks masterfully playing the incredibly anachronistic ringleader, a man whose vocabulary is unmatched and who is endlessly sly and cunniving. Irma P. Hall does excellent work as Hanks' adversary, the old woman whose room he is renting. The clash of the characters' personalities and the onscreen chemistry between Hanks and Hall is perfect.The rest of the crew consists of a ragtag bunch of stereotypes who have absolutely nothing in common besides their goal of robbing the casino vault. All of these characters are well cast, and the constant bickering between J.K. Simmons' Garth Pancake and Marlon Wayans' Gawain McSam is the source of amusement throughout.In the end, this is a movie where the storyline doesn't really matter; each point in the plot serves more as an excuse for amusing character vignettes. It works because the Coens have once again come through with a script filled with dialogue that switches between witty and excessively verbose to crude and crass, yet remains funny all the way through. But this is a film that will either be loved or hated. The Coens brand of humor is not for everyone, and I imagine that a large number of the older moviegoers who went to see it just because Tom Hanks was starring will be offended by a good deal of the language, and I'm sure others will be offended by the very intentional stereotypes that are portrayed throughout the movie, but anyone who is a fan of the humor in Raising Arizona and/or The Big Lebowski will enjoy this off the wall Coen brothers creation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unoriginal Caper Comedy But It's Fun (Real Fun)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers can be depended on to produce maliciously funny mischief by taking a not particularly original idea and making it work through some very fine acting."The Ladykillers" isn't for everyone - for a start its length will be reduced by two-thirds for ultimate TV viewing when all the "f"-words are excised - there's that many.There aren't too many stereotypes missing in this tale of a master criminal with an assortment of comedic oddballs planning to burglarize and rob a Mississippi River gambling boat's money room. Tom Hanks sparkles as the pseudo-professor with the unpronounceable name of Goldthwait Higgenson Dorr who rents a room from elderly, black mama Marva Munson, played by Irma P. Hall. For her charming portrayal of a gospel-loving, God-fearing widow who won't tolerate any bad language or smoking in her very nice home, Ms. Hall fully earned above-the-title credit.Dorr rents a room and brings in his gang of four. J. K. Simmons, sprung from his shrink role on "Law and Order," is an explosives expert of sorts. Tzi Ma, "The General," is the tactical planner, one of "our" Vietnamese officers now ensconced in the U.S. Ryan Hurst is Lump Hudson, a former football player whose brain was damaged long before he took to the gridiron: the staple idiot in the gang. Lastly is Marlon Wayons as the the inside man, a janitor at the casino, Gawain MacSam. Wayons is sure to win the Oscar next February for Best Actor in a Totally Foulmouthed Role.To complete the picture of a river town on the mighty Mississippi, we have a somnolent sheriff (black) and an equally laid back deputy (white). And, of course, the scene would be unreal without some righteous preaching and foot-stomping singing in a black church.Telling his landlady that he and his friends need her root cellar to practice church music from the Renaissance, they begin tunneling towards the river bank and the coveted millions in anticipated loot.That's enough of the plot which unfolds with few surprises until nearly the end when an identifiably Coen stamp is put on the denouement. Pay particular attention to the antics of Pickles the cat, a superb feline actor with, I suspect, a bright future in movies.Dorr, a nonstop double-talker spouting mellifluous academic argot, is as smooth and as deep as the winter's first sheen of ice. Munson doesn't really know what to make of him at first. Gullible initially, she reveals the steely inside we expect of a caricatured devout churchgoer. Say hallelujah, fellow movie fans."The Ladykillers" is the Coen brothers flip side: "Fargo" is another world. As such it's entertaining because Hanks and Hall are wrapped in their roles.Carefully watching end credits occasionally pays off. Instead of the usual listing for "Legal Counsel," the production's attorney is identified with the label "Serious Matters." :)7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for most movies, average for Coens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I like most about the Coens is their ability to write fantastic dialogue. Even when their characters are terse and laconic, which makes lines like "Where's pancakes house?" memorable, their ability to fill the mouths of actors with some of the best words spoken in movies keeps their mavens returning to their features again and again.I was amazed at their ability to fill Tom Hanks' mouth with flowery pedantries, Marlon Wayans' mouth with inner city Ebonics, and Irma Hall's mouth with sensible southern plain-speak. But the problem I had was that these all seemed to be exercises in writing. It reminded me of the disclaimer Mark Twain wrote at the beginning of Huckleberry Finn where he describes the dialects he attempted to capture in the book. He wanted to disabuse his reader of the notion that "all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding."I could see the Coens exercising their writing chops, and feeling the muscle of their dialogue, skimped on some character development. Don't get me wrong. I would rather watch a poorer Coen effort than watch a dozen pieces of drek offered as movies today. Most of this film delighted me whereas the parts I found wanting I would have gladly overlooked in any Michael Bay film.So if I were to rate this against movies in general **** 1/2 out of five. Against other Coen works ** 1/2. If you're not a Coen fan, you'll be delighted (or appalled if the foul language gets to you), and if you are a Coen fan, you'll be mildly amused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen brothers, Hanks make great combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark, dark, dark. Dark and funny. That's what one can expect from just about any Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan) film. From "Blood Simple" to "Raising Arizona" to "Barton Fink" to "The Hudsucker Proxy" to "Fargo" to "The Big Lebowski" to "O' Brother, Where Art Thou?" to their newest release, "The Ladykillers." The film is a remake of the 1955 classic starring Alec Guiness, Peter Sellers and Katie Johnson. In this version, Tom Hanks portrays a Southern professor who, along with a ragtag gang of reprobates, plans to rob a riverboat casino in Tennessee. To accomplish this, Prof. G.H. Dorr (Hanks) rents a room in the house of a sweet, elderly black lady, Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall), who seems unaware enough, until a series of mishaps plague the group. Suffering these indignities include Gawain McSam (a hilarious Marlon Wayans), martial arts expert, The General (Tzi Ma), explosives man, Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons, "Law &amp; Order: SVU") and hulky Lump Hudson (Ryan Hurst, "Remember The Titans"). Dorr seems to have the perfect plan to execute the heist, simply rent the room, tell Marva they are practicing Medevial musical instruments in her root cellar, dig a short tunnel to the casino's vault and use McSam, a riverboat janitor, as the inside man. Unfortunately, things begin to go south almost immediately.McSam makes rude comments about a customer's posterior and is fired. In a hilarious scene featuring his boss, Ferdinand Gudge (Stephen Root, "News Radio"), he is forced to apologize with chocolates and $100. Pancake, who suffers from severe attacks of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, also brings his girlfriend, Mountain Girl (Diane Delano), into the plan, unbeknownst to any of the others. This results in a riotous running fight between him and McSam. As for Hudson, he is as big and stupid as a person can be, and makes one wonder why he would have been part of such an intricate plan in the first place. Despite these setbacks, as well as a mutilating explosion and near discovery of their plan on several occasions, the gang somehow manages to pull off the robbery and net over $1.6 million. They are finally found out by Marva, however, who gives Prof. Dorr the option of returning the cash to its rightful owners and coming with her to church - or going to jail for the crime. This new development necessitates the plan to off her, but no one wants to do the dirty job. Support is added by comedian George Wallace and John McDonald as disbelieving law enforcement officers. Hanks is in top form, with slow southern drawl interrupted with fits of insanane giggling, but it's Hall who steals this film with a great sincere performance. Don't be surprised if her name appears as a Best Supporting Actress next year. You read it here first. "The Ladykillers" opened on Friday, March 19, but beware of the many F-bombs, causing it's 'R' rating</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joel and Ethan Coen's remake of the well-regarded 1955 British comedy starring Alec Guinness begins wonderfully, with righteous-living Irma P. Hall renting out her spare room to 'professor' Tom Hanks (with funny teeth and Southern drawl). But as soon as Hanks' motley team of casino-robbing cohorts come into the picture, the jokes get stuck in a boring rut, undermined by nasty talk, stereotyping and hyped-up action. The old-fashioned trimmings (such as a lengthy sequence with Hall attending church, presided over by a flamboyant minister and gospel choir) do not jell with the low-ball humor permeating the majority of the film; and, while it's a great-looking movie with a handsome production design, it isn't particularly well-acted or convincing on its comedic terms. A misfire. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Previous Coen brothers movies (The Big Lebowski, Fargo, O Brother Where ARt Thou) have really done nothing for me. Generally the combination of the slow moving south, 1 dominant character and a basic storyline don't do it for me. This movie was a bit more watchable though.The movie revolves around Professor Dorr (Hanks), a mysterious southern professor who rocks up on the doorstep of Marva Munson (Irma P hall) wanting to take the "room for hire" she is advertising. He doesn't want the room just for lodging though and as he requests that he can also use the cellar for band practice with his bunch of quirky friends, it's clear he's up to something.His "bandmates" feature 2 interesting characters in MacSam (Marlon Wayans) and Pancake (JK SImmons) both of whom basically save the movie. Hanks puts in a solid performance and although he makes Dorr his own, the character annoyed the hell out of me and Pancake and MacSam brought some great balance and comic relief.I'm a harsh marker, but I just felt the major action of the movie came too quickly and should have been built up better, and the ending didn't really satisfy me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do creators just like Tim Burton or the Coen Bros. make remakes from old Hollywood hits? Why if they've demonstrated their huge talent to write personal and original stories? Have they ran out of inspiration? Well, watching at "The Ladykillers" it does not look like Coen Bros. (this time they both appear as directors of the movie) have lost their "touch". We have their characteristic weird characters (almost like cartoons), their acid and mostly black humour... no doubt this is a 100% Coen Bros. movie; but in my opinion remakes are completely unnecessary. OK, obviously the plot is the same than in the original movie: a group of thief's pretending to be a music band are planning to rob the money from a Casino. So we gotta focus on those things that make the difference, such as the actors. Tom Hanks gets better and better and his talent seems to have no limits; his character and Irma P. Halls' are the strong points of this version, they're just hilarious. Also you'll wet yourself with that foul-mouthed "brotha". The script is rather powerful, but it gets a little reiterative as we get to the ending part. The ambient are Coen Bros.' trademark, making real spaces look like totally unreal.My rate: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd, odd comedy- I was fascinated by how it wouldn't always work, in a sense...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the Coen brothers may not seem as tuned into quality over quantity in their latest Hollywood efforts, the thing that keeps me interested is that they don't lose their voice along the way. It would be a shame if the Coens perhaps continued on the path they are taking, which is that of star vehicles, but whatever they've done in their career hasn't been messed around with by the men upstairs. In fact, I would imagine that there were very few notes to the Coens about things like content and style. How can you give these guys notes, even when they seem like they're making a comedy for themselves? The Ladykillers is a silly, foul-mouthed little remake exercise that surely isn't as successful as their best (Fargo, Blood Simple, O' Brother, Where Art Thou), however isn't as sad as their worst (Intolerable Cruelty, which wasn't a failure but just at the average mark for them). There's a curious, assured quality in their direction, as their cinematographer Roger Deakins offers up some memorable images in this somewhat picturesque, Southern landscape. Tom Hanks, as the Professor G.H. Dorr, is hard not to look at even when some of his jokes fall on deaf ears in the audience. His performance, believe it or not, is sort of mesmerizing, in his speech, attire, even in how he recites EA Poe. And the supporting cast isn't bad either, with JK Simmons and Marlon Wayans not as bad as they could've been. Irma P. Hall, as the heart of the film, was deserved of her win at Cannes.I guess the main flaw in the film, if their is one to point out, is that the Coens try to combine types of humor that may not quite work for them (flatulence jokes do work, but it's tricky to pull them off unless you're going for full-on, no-holds-barred stupid), and when their film takes some dark turns, they're dark in the blackest comedic sense (i.e. the third act). The plot itself becomes a little more predictable as the thieves' tale unfolds. And as for the style, while still in control, goes off the wall more times than desired. In other words, The Ladykillers is maybe a mess, yet the kind of mess that should appeal to the Coens' die-hard fan base, and to those who like seeing Hanks do something, err, different. And don't forget the catchy gospel soundtrack, which garners as much toe-tapping as O' Brother. B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very decent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The train got replaced by a boat, London with the American Deep south, Alec Guinness with Tom Hanks, The parrot by a cat, the bank with a Casino and the kind, feeble old lady with a more astute black woman; which somewhat misses the point of the original. In the original film, the majority of the comedy element came from the way that the old woman had no idea what was going on in her home; because of her being old and naive, we were able to believe that she wasn't suspicious and had no idea. However, in the remake it's not so believable that this woman would not know what's going on; some attempt is made to establish her as a kindly old lady that knows no bad from her distaste for "hippety Hop" music and the fact that she goes to church, but she doesn't capture the feeble and naiveness of her predecessor, which in my opinion harms the comedy element of which the original did so well.That aside, this movie does have a great deal of good things going for it; most notably a very hammy, eccentric and hilarious performance from Tom Hanks. Alec Guinness is one of the finest actors of all time, and following in his footsteps is no easy feat; but Tom Hanks really proves himself as an actor here by following Guinness remarkably well. From the moment he is introduced, in a very similar if less sinister sequence to that shown in the original masterpiece, we can see that Hanks has got the atmosphere of his character just right. The only slight annoyance of his character is the little laugh he does now and again between lines...it would have served the movie better if that was left out in my opinion, but it isn't even nearly enough to scotch my all time favourite Tom Hanks performance.Unlike the original, and one thing that I think the remake does better is that the gang of small-time, hapless, crooks is fleshed out a little. In the original, the characters turned up the house, without anything made clear about their characters, whereas this time each one is given a little introduction; which aside from being hilarious, also gives the audience a feel for each one of them, which really helps the movie. The gang features two really notable standout performances from J.K. Simmons (the unsung star of Spider-Man) and Marlon Wayans, who does a surprisingly good job as Gawain MacSam (you've got to love the character names!). These two add a third dimension of comedy to an already wonderful comedy thriller.The original was a very dark comedy, and so is this film, although this one is certainly a lot lighter. It doesn't take advantage of the absurdness that the original had (the lop-sided house), and it doesn't get dark till very late on either; and that is something which could have been better. However, cinema audiences have come to expect a lot from Coen brothers films, and this one, despite being a remake, does not disappoint. As an Englishman, and a fan of the original; I say the Coens almost did it justice.</fullReview>

Hall) in the hopes of burrowing to the money-holding area for a casino on a boat in the sea. Naturally he has a group of misfits that will help him in his deviant scheme---there is urban thug Marlon Wayans, college football dud Ryan Hurst, explosives expert J.K. Simmons and crazed Asian donut shop owner Tzi Ma. Together they fight, make stupid mistakes and come up with a crazed plan to kill Hall when their gig is finally up. The would-be hilarious results end up being a mixture of hits, misses and complete misfires with terrible dialogue dominating the demented action. The Coen Brothers (co-writers/co-directors) just continue to disappoint me with their antics. The movie is a pretty big mess, with Hall stealing every scene, Hanks doing arguably the worst work of his career and good supporting players (Wayans and Hurst in particular) being totally wasted in the meaningless venture. Adapted from the vastly better original from 1955, "The Ladykillers" is an unfunny comedy that tries to win its audience over with so many tiring techniques. Few, if any, ever really work. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ladykillers Doesn't Disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the bat, Irma P. Hall deserves an Oscar for her role in this movie; she far outshone Tom Hanks who really didn't do a bad job either. The dog and the cat weren't too shabby either.The music producer, T-Bone Burnette, looks like he deserves another Oscar for his efforts on this gem (first Oscar was for O Brother). He also did Cold Mountain which was above average but his musical selections on this one did far more in giving this movie that certain ambiance that made the viewer feel deeply involved in the action. This movie gets a **** or 10 just for the musical score alone. The only fault may be that the music sometimes took center stage over the acting and the plot.T-Bone's seamless blending of an old Blind Willie Johnson song `Let Your Light Shine On Me' into an upbeat `Let the Light from the Lighthouse' by the Vincent Four at the end of the movie leading into the credits was pure genius and a rousing way to end a movie that hit on all cylinders. Don't get fooled and leave when the credits first appear like most people did.I almost forgot to answer the most important question about all comedies, `Was it funny?' You bet. If you don't get a belly laugh at least once during this movie, consider yourself a dour person who is in desperate need of shock treatment to re-awaken your cerebral lower right side of your brain.</fullReview>

The Coen brothers are great masters at delivering multi-layered psychological, social and political statements with parody and delight. This one is right up there with their best. Tom Hanks in a pure comedy role with a great supporting cast. More than that, the overall casting is a work of genius. The antics and enthusiasm of the Gospel singers is contagious.

		<shortDescription>Thank God for remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother says that it is the job of a remake to sort out all the problems in the original and she is right. The remake of the Ladykillers does it is spades. I never liked the original. The problem was that I cared about the old lady and rather liked the criminals, so I got a bit tense when they went after the old lady and then turned on each other. There's none of that in this film. The Coen Brothers have cleverly created a world of caricatures about whom we do not care one bit, so we don't feel any of that annoying tension when people start to die. I thought the big man with brain damage very funny indeed, and far better suited to this sort of story than the slow but inherently decent wrestler in the original, of whom I was rather fond and whose death upset me (in the story, that is). Mother commented that Tom Hanks seemed to have some speech impediment so I think it's good of the Coens to employ him, even if he is becoming disabled. Mother didn't like all the swearing but I thought it was really funny, especially from the black character, which is something I have never seen before. I would rate this film eleven out of ten but I'm told I can't and this is a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Coen film always outshines the rest...Even when it's a remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The criticism and rumors can be heard already. Now, even the Coen brothers have lost their inspiration and talent. They sort of were the last creative scriptwriters and now they've fallen for the general trend of remakes, too. Big deal! A Coen-brothers film always is worth watching. Their typical, smooth style overrules once more as The Ladykillers features tons of subtle and intelligent humor. A delightful opening sequence, guided by brilliant music and you know already that you're in for a real treat. The terrific eccentric characters and the extremely solid acting performances are the elements that make this film unique. Tom Hanks is brilliant as the charming professor-crook G.H. Dorr. This film actually is Hanks' more successful return to the genre of comedy, since `Catch me if you can' was a real bore. Hanks stars as the leader of an amateurish brat pack that plans on robbing the local casino. Via the cellar of a seemly harmless old lady, they're digging a tunnel that ends in the casino's safe. The Ladykillers contains a few downright brilliant comedy-sequences (like when every gang-member is introduced separately) and an irresistible atmosphere. This is comedy how I like to see it. No tasteless images of sexually obsessed teenagers, but smart, comical situations and extravagant characters. Aside from the flawless performance by Tom Hanks, all the other acting performances are remarkable as well. J.K Simmons is great and proves he can handle more than just small, supportive roles. Heck, even Marlon Wayans' performance is decent as long his directed by professionals like the Coens. This film certainly isn't my favorite Coen film (films like `Blood Simple', `Fargo', `Raising Arizona' or `The Big Lebowski' are almost impossible to top) but it certainly ranks among the best films I've seen this year. Unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to see the original 1955 title on which this one is based. I want to, since it stars one of my all-time favorite actors, Herbert Lom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wrong Comedy !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's more atrocious than unfunny comedy ? I know. It's a bad slasher movie. So how about one movie that can be unfunny comedy and bad slasher movie in the same time !! That's what the worst-of-atrocious could be ! OK, I'll be calm. BUT I CAN'T ! There are big names involved here ! So, I'll take my tranquilizer and try to be at least reasonable : Is it a comedy ? Extremely No ! The characters are so not droll. There is a mean-spirited and nasty feel all over it. If anyone laughed with this dialogue, then they'd be the only creatures from mars that I don't need to know ! The matters of murdered dog, sick bowels, or amputated finger were all sick, disgusting and horrible. Supposedly comic situation like the one in which the sheriff comes to the home, Hanks hides under the bed, the lady discovers him to laugh like a perfect imbecile wasn't : believable, well-done or COMIC !! Even the idea of commentator painting of a late man is recycled from an old Disney movie that I can't remember its title but sure I can remember that it was more entertaining (or rather more useful !). The lady's slaps stand alone in the desert of this movie's hilarity.Tom Hanks can't be bearable in this, with his way too far eccentric costumes, make-up and performance !! His way of talking didn't amuse only but was ridiculously a pace's corrupter ! And you'll ask yourself many times why respectable smart actor like him did that movie in the first place ?! The rest of the actors gave totally nothing to their characters ! No chemistry was shown between the actors and each others. No charisma was delightful or even worked in any way ! I've never seen a comedy with this complete cast of un-comic characters and performers ! For instance the guy they brought to be a human rock; he looked and acted like a real retarded !? I mean were they making an entertaining comic movie or a painful realistic film ?? Well, both ways I didn't like it ! I didn't catch on also the reason why there was this semi-fantasy atmosphere (with the 1930s and the 2000s together) ?? Or this acute irony between the yellow cinematography, the country landscape, and the old soundtrack on one side.. and the colored cinematography, the modern backgrounds, and the rap singing on the other side ?? Do Joel and Ethan Coen refer to the old innocent America that will beat the recent sinful America ?? If they do, then this is so weak, naive and has been done in the most uninteresting way ever.Last but not the least; is it a black comedy ? Well, it's idiot uncreative black comedy about the newest subject : how crime doesn't pay ! (Or how some filmmakers don't click sometimes !!). Thus, sad ladies and gentlemen, THIS IS NO COMEDY AT ALL! So, is it a heist movie ? Yes, but occupies the bottom of the heist movies, not in its year or its decade, but in the history ! The details didn't serve anything : the thrill, the action, or ? sorry folks ? the comedy. It is dreadful when a movie doesn't have anything special. Well, enjoyably special !So, is it a slasher movie ? Yes, but not about killing this gang's members absurdly; it's about killing the audience one by one by a movie that oozes silliness from Tom's fake teeth to the last shot of it with the cat and the finger.One last question : What could be the thing that we gained out of watching (The Ladykillers ? 2004) ?! Hmmm, YEAH, one thing, an inoculation against watching it again ! It's not the wrong comedy. It's the wrong movie.</fullReview>

The nurses came in and started to watch it as well and they all laughed (not quite as hard as I was) but they did all enjoy it. Excellent movie. I heard it was a remake but by me you would never know it as it seemed as fresh as the day I watched it. The old lady (owner if the dwelling) was hysterical (to me). It stretched belief but it was all in fun and who cares if it did? It was just clean good fun.

		<shortDescription>The end is so absurdly logical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers are devastatingly in charge again in this film and their humor is more than black, blacker than black, a blacker shade of black, especially since the main heroin is black and the sheriff is black and the essential member of the gang, the inner agent of the operation, is black too. Black humor indeed. But Jewish humor as you can't even imagine. The humor of influencing people with effete verbosity, with elaborate totally unbelievable lies that are all the more believable because they are unbelievable. People only believe what is unbelievable and everything that is logical, predictable, obviously evident will be rejected without even being considered because all that is obvious can only be false. Isn't it why they did not believe in Auschwitz even when they were arrived? Jewish too their humor because it is shown from the only point of view of the leader who sees every event as a new difficulty and he is so relieved when finally his last accomplice falls into the trash boat after this last accomplice of his has killed himself convinced as he was that the gun was empty. It is so good when it stops, when the raven flying out of Edgar Allen Poe crosses the sky over his head and he jubilates then because he misinterpret the omen: the beginning of his own end whereas he thought it was the beginning of the end of it all, except of course himself. And he was rich. The punch line for him is a real punch line falling from the sky, hard and stony, deadly and fatal. And what his that poor black woman going to do with 1.6 million dollars? Even the sheriff tells her what the effete PhD had told her: no one cares because the insurance is going to pay anyway. So what is she going to do with all that money? And that is the last straw that breaks the camel's back, the drop of water falling into the sea that causes a tsunami, a tidal wave of the old times. It makes the whole film a farce of divine, celestial and even cosmic dimension. Stealing is covered by insurance contracts and the victims are just nearly congratulated with insurance money that looks like some kind of a reward for them having been robbed. So go on robbing the rich and businesspeople that deal with too much money. Anyway we pay we have paid, through our own insurance premiums what they will be compensated with. So at least let us get what we are paying for, once in a while. Very black Jewish humor. If it did not exist we would have to invent it. Thank you so much, Coen Brothers.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ladykillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1955 film starring Sir Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom is a true comedy classic, so many questioned why it was going to be remade, especially by directing brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, True Grit). Basically in Saucier, Mississippi lives elderly, God-fearing and uptight widow Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall) who gets an unexpected visit from the eccentric Southern Professor G.H. Dorr (Tom Hanks). He is interested in letting the room she has for rent, which she accepts, and he is also to be joined by his "band", casino worker Gawain MacSam (Marlon Wayans), explosives expert Garth Pancake (Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons), tunnelling expert The General (Tzi Ma) and thick but thuggish Lump Hudson (Ryan Hurst). Of course they are not musicians, but criminals planning to tunnel their way through the dried earth to the casino vault not far from Mrs. Munson's house, and all their individual skills will come in handy. They manage to reach the vault, and successfully remove the millions of dollars inside, but it is when the tunnel needs to be blown up that things go wrong, because Mrs. Munson comes home early, hears the explosion, and the money is flying everywhere. The Professor tries to lie his way out of it and convince her that they have taken it for good intentions, but of course she doesn't buy it and wants them to return the money, or she will report to the police. The criminals know that the only way they can keep the money is to kill the old woman, and they draw straws to see who is going to do it, and even when Gawain gets it, he refuses. This creates an argument, ending with with Gawain accidentally shooting himself, and while dispensing of the body Pancake sees the opportunity to get away with the money with his wife Mountain Girl (Diane Delano). Of course they end up being killed as well, and the straws are drawn again, The General is the loser, and when it looks like he will kill Mrs. Munson he ends up falling down the stairs. Finally it is just Lump and The Professor left, Lump doesn't want him to kill the old lady and ends up shooting himself, while The Professor dies having a statue head fall on him, hanging by his cloak, and falling into the trash boat below. In the end, all the money has been left behind, and when Mrs. Munson tries to return the money to the police, they think she is crazy and jokingly say that she should do whatever she wants with the money. Also starring George Wallace as Sheriff Wyner, John McConnell as Deputy Sheriff and Heroes' Greg Grunberg as TV Commercial Director. Hanks is reasonable as the Professor with the big teeth and Southern accent, but he's no Sir Alec Guinness, same goes for Hall as the old lady, she isn't lovably kind and innocent like the upstaging and BAFTA winning Katie Johnson, and the supporting cast have their small moments as well. The scripting has its moments of wittiness, and it feels almost as amusingly sinister and quirky like the original, but you know it's not as good and never could be, it is alright black comedy. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>barely passable remake of a comic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the interest of full disclosure, let me state right up front that the 1955 Ealing Brothers classic, "The Ladykillers," ranks as one of my all-time favorite comedies. A masterpiece of tone, the film, written by William Rose and directed by Alexander MacKendrick, is not only a sweet and gentle tale full of subtle wit and endearing whimsy but also a murderously funny black comedy centered on homicide and death. A group of thieves, planning a heist, rent a room from an old lady who lives in her own insulated world of tea parties and Victorian Era innocence. Pretending to be musicians, the crooks use both her and her establishment as convenient blinds for their nefarious activities. The great fun of the film lies in watching the bad guys get their richly deserved comeuppance in the end, while the sweet little old lady escapes unscathed and unharmed.Now a new set of brothers - the Coen Brothers - have decided to take a whack at the same material, but their attempt at modernizing this priceless comic gem falls flat for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the remake systematically violates the spirit and tone of the original. The genius in the '50's film derived from the juxtaposition between the evil motives of the criminals and the utter innocence of the sweet and befuddled old lady. In this new version, which has been awkwardly transplanted from cool, foggy London to steaming Mississippi, the old woman has been conceived as a far more mouthy, far more worldly individual, thereby undercutting the original's comic tension right off the bat. It also doesn't help that the overall tone - as befits the current times - is far more crude, crass and vulgar, whereas it was the extreme gentility of the lady's insulated world that made the original comedy work so well.Tom Hanks has taken over the role, originally filled by the inimitable Alec Guinness, of the group's leader and mastermind, here called Professor G. H. Dorr. Hanks portrays him as a silver-tongued, poetry-spouting, white-suited gentleman (think a young Colonel Sanders), an anachronistic throwback to the days of the pre-bellum genteel South. In fact, there is more of a comic contrast between Dorr and the men he is working with than there is between the crooks and their hostess. Yet, it is a comic tension that pays off less well than the original. The characters all too often turn into caricatures, and the comedy is frequently broader and less subtle in tone than it needs to be. Another problem is that, in the original version, the men actually use Mrs. Wilberforce to innocently tote their ill-gotten gains for them. This clever little way of implicating the little old lady in the crime has been inexplicably dropped from this version.Having said all that, however, I must admit that there are some genuinely amusing moments in the film, particularly in the second half, and the material itself is so ingenious and sturdy that it would be hard for any filmmakers - let alone those of the caliber of the Coen Brothers - to fail utterly in the endeavor. Hanks gives a clever, winning performance as Dorr, despite the fact that filling Guinness' shoes is a tall order for any actor, no matter how talented and skillful. Irma P. Hall does a nice job as Mrs. Munson, even if her performance lacks the subtle shading of Katie Johnson's original.If "The Ladykillers" weren't toiling in the shadow of its great predecessor, it might seem like a clever, offbeat little comedy, and perhaps that's the way it does appear to those unfamiliar with the original. But, as a die-hard fan, I suggest you search out the real thing instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those wild men Joel and Ethen Coen remake a 1955 classic(The LadyKillers) starring Alec Guiness and Peter Sellers. If this was candy it would be double dark chocolate with nuts. This is a slow starting dark comedy that turns into a knee slapper. Tom Hanks plays Professor G.H. Dorr who's criminal mind develops a clever crime. The professor rents a room from a nice church-going Marva Munson(Irma P. Hall). He gathers a motley crew in the basement with every intent to dig a tunnel in order to rob a New Orlean's riverboat casino. Things are almost perfect until the once unsuspecting landlady discovers what has taken place.Things really get funny, or course in a dark way, when each of the crew attempts to kill the landlady. And each to the man in turn lose their own life trying. Prankish comedy at its best. Also in the cast are:J.K. Simmons, Marlon Wayans, Ryan Hurst and Tzi Ma. George Wallace as Sheriff Wyner is a hoot. This a very different Hanks role to say the least. Certainly it is Hanks that draws attention to the movie...even if this isn't even close to his best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie even started like Forrest Gump, Cast Away and other films of Tom Hanks: silent, slow music, slow movements of the camera. in fact, it made me sure that I would see the usual excellent performance from my fave actor. And I did. I can't say anything else but that he swam in this role like a fish in the sea. My favourite line was when he said "I have no performance talent" (I'm not sure that he actually used these words, because I saw it dubbed, but you know what I mean). When I heard this double Oscar-winner guy saying this, I couldn't help laughing. I think Ladykillers is a film to watch once because of the dark and fine humour, which is not necessarily funny for the second, third... time. It's a must for Tom Hanks fans, a good choice for those who like to laugh but also like to choose what to laugh at, and after all, a good film.</fullReview>

While the Coen Brothers always deliver some interesting characters, this time they are mostly just ridiculous cartoon characters. The exceptions are the roles of Tom Hanks and Irma P. Hall. Ms. Hall's character provides a nice polarization to Hanks' as she assumes the best, but is no fool. Hanks' character is really out of place amongst the bumbling. His crackling dialogue reminds of Tennessee Williams at his best. The film weaknesses are the lack of support for this sterling main character, the overboard zanyness of the scheme and the over-the-top "hippity-hop" language. This one at time veers into Farrelly Brothers territory ... not smart or clever at all. The Hanks character could be written into a much better, more interesting script and I would be first in line. The rest of these goofs assuredly have no future. If you need a Coen Brothers fix, rent "Fargo" or "Blood Simple".</fullReview>

Tom Hanks plays one of his better roles, and Marlon Wayans is perfect as a casino employee. Ryan Hurst is also a great fit for the role of 'Lump', the brutish, stupid football player. (His introduction was hysterical.) Garth and "Mountain Girl"'s relationship adds to the atmosphere of the movie, which is set in a time period not employed by a large number of producers. Through the ironic and slightly dark humor, and the ridiculous plot of Hanks' 'musical' group, I laughed through this movie and enjoyed the ending a great deal.</fullReview>

Simply put; You can tell when it's gonna get good. Hilarious and intelligent, I think the reason *some* people (you know the ones) didn't appreciate this movie is because they just don't get it, there's just too much to take in for them. First of all; Tom hanks was mischievously brilliant in his role as the professor, and while we're on the subject of the characters, The supporting roles were filled out perfectly. The General was written especially well. Besides all that, the set was done quite well, having each place exist solitarily, there is absolutely nothing in sight near the sheriff's office, the church, or the old lady's house, and the painting of her dead husband was a perfect touch. the music painted the scene very well and it was all such good music to begin with. (The Coen brothers have wonderful taste in music) In short, this movie can only truly be enjoyed to it's fullest if you pay attention, because everything is significant (and I believe that there is biblical symbolism to a lot of the movie.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a whimsical comforting comedy that will stay with you for many years. Tom Hanks performance was great in what's arguably his most difficult role to date. It's important to note that this film isn't a Tom Hanks film so much as it's a Coen brothers film, don't expect Big or Saving Private Ryan because you'll be disappointed perhaps shocked(if you have never seen a Coen film). Frankly I am a bit surprised at the number of Coen bothers fans here who disliked this film. It seems to me a wonderful piece of work from them mixing beauty and crassness together perfectly, showing their maturity as film makers within every aspect of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever they remake a movie, it's always iffy. But we can count on the Coen brothers. "The Ladykillers" of course has a group of thieves living in an old woman's house to carry out their heist, but she wises up to their scheme; they try to kill her, but murder isn't as easy as it looks! Tom Hanks plays the devilish, very cultured Southern gentleman Prof. Goldthwait Higginson Dorr III, whose speech gives one the impression that he spends all day searching the dictionary for obscure words.The Coen brothers did a really neat job updating Alec Guinness' classic. Marlon Wayans' character was kind of silly, but other than that, the movie had virtually no faults.Just one more thing: I notice that by now, Tom Hanks has acted in movies all around the US part of the Gulf of Mexico. "Forrest Gump" happened in Alabama, "Apollo 13" happened in Texas and Florida, "The Green Mile" happened in Louisiana, and "The Ladykillers" happened in Mississippi. Well...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just amazing! I have not seen anything like in years. Even though it based on an earlier film, it still makes it brand new. Ethan &amp; Joel Coen have done it again. They did not impress me with "Intolerable Cruelty" but this certainly makes up for it. Tom Hanks was astounding! He's never done anything like it. Even though Tom Hanks was "Perfect", he was nothing compared to Irma P. Hall. This is her best performance EVER! The plot takes an impressing turn that I never expected. That was a great choice of music. Some say this was a lame flop. I just can't see why. This I guess is a film for people with different tastes. I really encourage you to see this wonderful film that is filled with top notch performances!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think The Ladykillers is the Coen's funniest film but it will not appeal to everyone. (You might want to consider that I did not think Fargo was very funny.) This film is pure silliness and most of the best lines are done with deadpan seriousness which makes the whole thing absurd. I'm really disappointed this film did not get better reviews. The only thing I can figure is that many of the funniest lines were over the heads of the reviewers or they had trouble understanding the dialog because everyone speaks in a dialect.Although Tom Hanks is the obvious star of the film, the rest of the cast is equally good.Catch this one in the theaters while you still can.</fullReview>
