		<shortDescription>Roger Corman's MAGNIFICENT SEVEN in Space...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS, Roger Corman's 'take' of the STAR WARS saga, is a film justly recognized as a cult classic. Shot in his new studio ("The paint was still wet," Corman has joked), in just five weeks, on a budget that would have paid for one of George Lucas' effects, the end result is proof that with the right talent, anything is possible!A remarkable array of future industry giants participated in the creation of the film; the screenplay was co-written by John Sayles, whose breakthrough film as a maverick writer/director, RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS 7, would be released the same year...young model builder James Cameron impressed Corman so much that he was promoted to Art Director for the film, and it would be the first step in a career that led to TERMINATOR, ALIENS, and eventually, the most Oscar-honored film since BEN-HUR, TITANIC...James Horner, with only three prior film credits, gave Corman the STAR WARS-quality music he wanted, with an orchestra a fraction of the size of John Williams' London Philharmonic; Horner would eventually score two STAR TREK films, and a wide variety of other 'prestige' projects, culminating with two Oscars for TITANIC, and a place as one of America's finest film composers. BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS would have a 'look' and a 'sound' unlike any 'B'-movie ever made.Based on Akira Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI (which was also the source for the classic western, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN), Sayles tried to keep the film as faithful to the original as possible (a tiny, defenseless village hires warriors to defend them against a band of outlaws), even naming the beleaguered people the Akira, as a homage to the director. As warriors from different races ally to face down the nearly invincible forces of Sador (veteran actor John Saxon), Corman paid tribute to John Sturges' western, as well, casting Robert Vaughn in virtually the same role as he'd played in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. Other terrific actors round out the cast; Richard Thomas, still appearing in 'The Waltons' at the time, played young Shad, the film's central character; George Peppard, who was about to achieve a MAJOR career resurgence with 'The A-Team', became boozy Earthman 'Cowboy'; 'B'-movie queen Sybil Danning portrayed Valkyrie-like Saint-Exmin; veteran TV and film 'tough guy' Morgan Woodward was wonderful, if unrecognizable as Cayman of the Lambda Zone; and Darlanne Fluegel, beginning a long career as a popular character actress, was cast as Shad's love, Nanelia. Corman then cast two long-time friends and Hollywood legends in cameo roles; Jeff Corey as blind Zed, who encourages the Akira to fight; and 89-year old Sam Jaffe as the robotics expert who introduces Shad to Nanelia.A note about director Jimmy T. Murakami...a veteran animator, BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS marked his directorial debut, and he does an exceptionally good job, considering his budget restraints. After working on HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP, he married an Irish girl and settled in Europe, limiting his subsequent film career to an occasional project that interested him. Roger Corman's 'family' of filmmakers were NEVER dull...While some of the FX are shaky, the overall production is very impressive, and holds up remarkably well, today. Roger Corman has called BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS one of his favorite films, and he has every right to be proud...the movie is a terrific SF adventure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lotta bang for little bucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is interesting. The movie is another producer's spin on Star Wars; Star Wars obviously being made by George Lucas. The name 'George Lucas' being synonymous with 'epic-scale effects budget.' Battle Beyond the Stars was produced by Roger Corman. The name 'Roger Corman' being synonymous with 'shoe-string budget.' Let me break from my usual critique style to go over some of the plot - Sador (John Saxon) feels the need to conquer, and he's so powerful that he decides to conquer an essentially helpless (not to mention useless) civilization. But instead of conquering, he courteously shows up to conveniently schedule his conquest a week from now in case they want to mount some sort of defense. (Where's Arnold when you need him? 'I'll be back!')In response, Shad takes a road trip (space trip?) in Nell the only ship on the planet to round up some misfits (mercenaries--same thing) who happen to be in the neighborhood. Everyone is interestingly (clichély) unique and has their own reasons for wanting to fight, not to mention the actors have a wide range of performances ranging from sliced ham to frighteningly Shakespearian seriousness. And, ah to hell with it, you get the idea. Point is, I have every reason to really hate the plot, hate the characters (Good God, I've hated characters for much much less), hate this movie . . . but I dunno, I don't really mind it.Through all its narrative faults, Battle Beyond the Stars happens to hit the right goofball mixture of elements from a surprisingly good score by young 'Jamie Horner' to notably weird spaceships and decent effects (for an early 80s low-budget flick) to wacky and tame characters that somehow summons a funky B-movie charm. For the life of me, I can't hate this movie despite the plot that begs me to bash it to oblivion with the Stellar Converter.The spaceship, Nell, proved to be the highpoint of the film . . . not because of the ship's design, rather because of its personality (no really.)I've always wanted to see a spaceship with an attitude (the Star Trek equivalent of Kit from Knight Rider?) A perfect counterpoint to the naivety of Shad, flawlessly delivered by Richard Thomas. If I weren't constantly laughing at the characters cluelessness, I'd want to slap that kid around, and I'd sure as hell wouldn't want to charge him with saving my planet. I'd like to die with my dignity, thank you.Battle Beyond the Stars has a number of positive attributes (especially considering the budget and experience of most people involved on the film at the time), it has a number of reasons to be proud, and it most definitely has a number of charms that surpass its truckload of flaws. I consider Battle Beyond the Stars the spending benchmark for all sci-fi flicks. I mean, if Corman can entertain me with Hollywood pocket change, Lucas, the Wachowskis, and the other heavy spenders better blow my socks off with their ungodly sized budgets . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Samurai in Space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Sayles was asked by Roger Corman to adapt The Seven Samurai into a sci fi picture and the result is this delightfully inventive tongue-in-cheek romp.What is most enjoyable to me about the film is the fact that every mercenary hired by the peaceful "villagers" has a distinct personality and style and their motivations clearly defined. George Peppard, as the only human among them, is laid back and charming. Morgan Woodward seems to be having a grand old time playing the vengeful lizard-man--dig his gonzo war-cry during the climactic battle! Robert Vaughn does seem a bit bored but he effectively communicates his character's unpleasant coldness. Sybill Danning simply has one of the most stunning bodies to ever be stuffed into a styrofoam viking costume, even if she can't act. Add to these characters two elfin aliens who communicate thru heat (the Kelvin, wink, wink) and a troupe of what looks like Mimes called "Nestor" who operate sort of like the collectivist Borg from Star Trek and in disposition seem to anticipate the infectious optimism and curiosity of Mr Data as well.When first introduced they explain, "We believe you are seeking mercenaries for an adventure. We would like to participate." The costumes, sets and spfx are quite striking though obviously done on a low budget but that hardly detracts from the fun. Special mention must be made of John Saxon who, as the evil scourge of the galaxy Lord Sador, grabs his opportunity to chew the scenery with amusing gusto. Check the sequence where he gets to enact what must be every actors dream since Dr Strangelove: to have a battle with his own rebellious arm! He plays it all-out, with just the right mix of comic book theatrics and menacing humor. It is sometimes just enjoyable to watch veteran actors cut loose and have a good time, the spirit is infectious, as it certainly is with this film. Fun for the whole family as well as bonged-out college students and other usually disparaging types.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars clone? Yes, but cheesy sci-fi fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Battle Beyond The Stars was one of the better Star Wars clones. The special effects weren't "great" even back in 1980, but they add to the low budget flavor of the movie. You have to remember that this movie had a substantially lower budget for special effects than an "A" picture like Star Wars. Early detailed models by James Cameron (TERMINATOR/TITANIC) are the high point of the special effects. A lot of people got their career start on this film, and Cameron was only one of many.The script for Battle Beyond The Stars had a lot of things going for it, from the aliens to the quirky characters. I found the race of Nestor to be the most interesting concept of all. Just the thought of a race of beings that can hear/feel/think together as one conscious entity could be a great movie plot in itself.The excellent casting of actors and actresses was another strong point in Battle Beyond The Stars. John Saxon, George Peppard, and Sybil Danning especially shine through in their acting performances in my opinion.Battle Beyond The Stars is, quite simply, one of those movies that's so cheesy that's it's something special. It's a fun movie that never takes itself too seriously, and I don't either. I guess that's why I still enjoy it after all of these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult classic with one of James Horner's best ever scores....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this in the summer of 1981, just before I was due to go back to school for my second year in senior school (around the age of 12-13)Nowadays, BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS is more familar to audiences as the film which helped launch the careers of James Cameron and James Horner, but the success of the film is more down to John Sayles excellent screenplay, one of the earliest he did along with PIRANHA for Roger Corman's New World Pictures.Sayles does some very creative things with the dialogue and Sybil Danning is the standout performance as the Valkyrie warrior St. Exmin. Darlanne Fluegel as Nanelia and Morgan Woodward as Cayman of the Lambda Zone provide adequate support to Richard Thomas and Robert Vaughn.As with Howard Shore and his LOTR scores, Horner's early works were to be found in low-budget film. The limited-edition soundtrack recently released also has the soundtrack to HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP. I have followed Horner's career from BATTLE, through to his music for 48 HRS, BRAINSTORM and GORKY PARK, but BATTLE is undoubtedly one of the best scores he has ever done. As with John Williams' music for STAR WARS, it added a dimension to the film and gave me goosebumps when I first saw it.The FX and design of the film do heighten the experience of watching this low-budget offering in a similar way to how ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 knew the limits of its setting.Worth catching at any time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoy these types of films. When they work it's because of their sheer flamboyance. They aren't afraid to steal from any source, EVERYTHING goes into the pot as long as it's got sparkle, splash, and action. This particular film works real well and I absolutely fell for it when I heard a phrase of music lifted directly from "Alexander Nevsky". It's pure, simple (repeat, simple) fun. The producers of "Battlefield Earth" could have learned something about making entertaining SF movies from repeated viewings of "Battle Beyond the Stars."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the post "Star Wars" films, this one is decidedly the best of its ilk. The dependable storyline, stalwart acting and sometimes humorous special effects (LOVE the female-designed spaceship!) all make for an entertaining film. For all the flak it has received (even getting a "Dog of the Week" label from Siskel and Ebert upon its initial release), it has for all intents and purposes kept itself in the memories of all who have seen it and is most definitely a fantasy that is worthy of seeing again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignore the negative comments and the usual pathetic "cheesy" wisecracks. This movie has more heart and soul than "Star Wars" or any of the big budget space operas floating around at the same time. The characters are more memorable, the dialogue is better and there is nothing "fairytale" about the ending. A lot of the characters we wind up liking die in this one.It's yet another update of the "Seven Samurai" story and just as effective in its milieu as "Magnificent Seven" was in its. A ghoulish galactic conqueror has targeted the peaceful planet Akir for his next attack. Sador and his band of mutants have access to a planet-destroying weapon. The pacifist Akiri have no skill or stomach for fighting except for a select few. Young Shad decides that if his people cannot fight, they will hire mercenaries to fight for them. Onboard a sentient spaceship with a crusty personality, Shad begins to assemble a ragtag collection of misfits. They include: Cowboy, an earthman transporting weapons who is obsessed with Western heroes and lifestyle.Kayman of the Lambda Zone, a theatrical and sinister reptilian who has a score to settle with Sador. Kayman's own crew is pretty off the wall, as well.Nestor, a collection of alien clones who share the same mind and sensations. Nestor joins the battle strictly out of boredom.Gelt, the deadliest and most feared assassin in the galaxy, who joins Shad because he offers "a warm meal and a place to hide".St. Exmin, a bodacious, oversexed Valkyrie who is spoiling for a fight to prove her mettle.This is one of the coolest casts of characters ever assembled for an action film and I fell in love with all of them. The script of John Sayles really brings out the quirks and personality of the mercenaries. I loved it when one of the Nestors is captured by Sador and threatened with torture. "This is Dr. Dako," Sador tells the Nestor. "He is very expert in the art of administering pain." "It is good to have skills," deadpans Nestor.Just as effecting but in a different way is Gelt's final scene, as his ice-cold demeanor cracks at last and he reflects on a friendless and wasted life. Robert Vaughn succeeds once again with basically the same character he played in "Magnificent Seven".Even Sador and his Malmori mutants have personality. John Saxon has a ball playing an evil villain that was different from his usually heroic characters. His second in command comes across as strangely reluctant. Even the scummy mutants Kalo and Tembo are more than mere cannon fodder.Other actors to watch for are Sam Jaffe as the half man/half machine/all crazy Dr. Hephaestus, Jeff Corey as the blind warrior Zed and Lost In Space's Marta Kristen as an Akiri woman who falls in love with Cowboy. Richard Thomas does very well as Shad...not an experienced fighter, but with enough fire to avoid being a wimp.One does wish the effects budgets would have been better. The ship design and make-up is cool, but the space battles were not visually engaging and the sound effects that accompanied them really grated on my nerves.The triumph of this movie, though, is in its characterization and in the nobility of sacrifice. There's nothing cheesy about that. This is pure entertainment and a little bit more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightfully spirited and good-natured early 80's sci-fi action/adventure treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman's highly energetic and enjoyable handy dandy combo blend of "Star Wars" and "The Magnificent Seven" has lost none of its charm or entertainment value over the years. The film still radiates a certain irresistibly sweet and dynamic good-natured quality to this very day. Evil space conqueror Sador (John Saxon having himself a wonderfully wicked field day in a juicy villain part) threatens to kill all the peace-loving people on the planet of Akir unless they willingly submit to his foul desires. It's up to naive, but eager young emissary Shad (earnestly essayed with disarmingly wide-eyed aplomb by Richard Thomas of "The Waltons" fame) to round up seven mercenaries in order to fight back against Sador. Said mercenaries include the delectably busty'n'lusty Sybil Danning as a sexy Amazonian warrior woman, George Peppard as the hilariously booze-sodden Space Cowboy, Morgan Woodward as vengeful reptilian humanoid lizard Cayman, the lovely Darlanne Fluegel as the obligatory hot babe love interest for Shad, and Robert Vaughn doing a deft reprise of his weary, twitchy gunslinger role from "The Magnificent Seven." Jimmy T. Murakami's spirited direction keeps the movie cheery and lively throughout while John Sayles' witty script, the extremely good special effects, James Horner's rousing score and the enthusiastic acting from a tip-top cast (veteran character actor and legendary acting teacher Jeff Corey is especially fine as an old blind man) add substantially to the infectiously frothy merriment. Moreover, there's a real purity and innocence to this picture, a complete dearth of smugness, irony and cynicism, which is both very refreshing and genuinely endearing. A real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GOOD Roger Corman film? Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman was executive producer for this enjoyable and wonderfully campy sci-fi version of `The Magnificent Seven'. It even features Robert Vaughn as the same lost-his-nerve gunslinger he played in the original! John Sayle's script is loaded with fine humor. Director Jimmy T. Murakami obviously knew his film history, since the planet being attacked is called `Kira' -- a tribute to director Akira Kurasowa of `Seven Samurai', the inspiration for the original of this interesting trio of films.Richard Thomas, star of TV's rustic melodrama `The Waltons', plays the brave young man who leaves his besieged home world to find mercenaries to fight against planet-conquering John Saxon. George Peppard plays `Cowboy', a space-going gunrunner with a Western fixation (another tribute to `Mag 7'). Sybil Danning is a feisty female warrior with a costume that defies description.The special effects look a bit dated now, but that isn't the film's fault. Sam Jaffe (`The Day the Earth Stood Still') has a great part. Darlene Flugel is the attractive romantic interest for Thomas. James Horner's rousing score is a golden plus. When the movie was first released, sci-fi fans considered it a rip-off because it was released between `Star Wars - A New Hope' and `The Empire Strikes Back' -- tough competition.Watch this movie as a double feature with `The Magnificent Seven' and you're guaranteed a good time. I've done, and it works just fine . ..Let me know if it works for you, okay?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's pretend we've never heard of Roger Corman nor The Magnificent Seven etc.As a kid, that was me. I heard about this movie through my friends, when I was about 9 or 10. To us, this was another great space epic, along the lines of Star Wars. It had good effects, plenty of laser blasts and bad guy with a massive ship that could destroy planets. Awesome!Many years later, I bought this on DVD and, to my pleasant surprise, found that it hadn't aged too badly. The low budget is very apparent but the movie is slickly edited such that it perhaps feels richer that it should. This is however it's biggest drawback because the character development is poor in places and the stars play second-fiddle to the ships and the costumes they inhabit. Gelt and Space Cowboy are perhaps the most fleshed-out of the pack, the remainder either being weak or there to make up the numbers.The true star of the show is James Horner. It's a great score and all the best moments of Star Trek 2 are audible here first.It's an inventive film, even if the invention is mainly facsimile, and an entertaining one. In the archives of sci-fi, there's no contest between this and its obvious "raison d'?tre" influence, as to which film is the better, but it's a noteworthy addition from the same era, what I consider to be the golden-age of special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, for all of the cheapness of his films, Roger Corman can occasionally turn out a pretty entertaining film. This was one of them.Back in the day, my friends and I clamored for anything remotely like Star Wars. Unfortunately, other than some quickly made knock-offs from Japan and Italy, there weren't many. Then, around 1980, I came across an article in Starlog about this movie. It looked interesting, although it was obviously inspired by The Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven; but, hey, Star Wars stole from Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress. I didn't get a chance to see the film in the theaters, but caught it later on cable. It was a pretty entertaining film, despite the cheesy scenes and hammy acting. Everybody seemed to be having fun and it didn't take itself too seriously.Richard Thomas, fresh from The Waltons, takes to the stars to recruit mercenaries to save his agrarian world from invaders, led by John Saxon (sitting in for Eli Walach). He recruits a motley band of space cowboys (George Peppard), lizards, heat manipulating aliens, clonal telepaths, gunfighters (Robert Vaughn) and T &amp; A valkyries (Sybil Danning). Together, this rag-tag band leads the peace-loving Akirans in battle against Sador.The film is great fun, with good ship designs and exciting space battles (effects supervised by James Cameron). The script (by John Sayles) is good, with many in-jokes and light character moments. The effects, although not as good as ILM, are still eyecatching and work in service to the story. The actors play it straight, but with enough of a twinkle (with the leads making up for some of the really horrible secondary actors). The designs are interesting, especially Shad's ship-with-breasts and Saint-Exmin's costume, which has a decoration that looks like hands clutching her breasts! You can definitely tell that this was made predominantly by young males.Corman is best known as a mentor to great filmmakers and this film features work by future big names John Sayles, James Cameron, Gail Ann Hurd, and music by James Horner.Do yourself a favor, watch this and then compare with more recent films of the genre (i.e. Star Wars prequels) and see which has a greater sense of fun. It's no 2001: A Space Odyssey; but, then again, neither was Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyably Cornball Seven Samurai In Outer Space Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The peaceful planet Akir is threatened by the evil warlord Sador. Having no army of their own, the people hire a strange group of mercenaries with varying agendas to help them. Can they prevail, and can they trust their new protectors ?Cashing in on the Star Wars boom, this cheeky little movie is really more of a science-fiction remake of The Seven Samurai - the people are called the Akira, Vaughn reprises his role from The Magnificent Seven and whole scenes (such as the return to the empty village) are lifted straight from the Kurosawa film. It's a bit cheesy, to be sure, but it's fun and witty and hard not to enjoy. It was made by a bunch of talented young filmmakers at Roger Corman's New World Pictures company; Murakami went on to become a respected animation director; scriptwriter John Sayles is one of the most original directors currently working, composer James Horner is now one of Hollywood's best and many of the special effects crew have had prestigious careers. Its other gift is its mixed cast of bright young things and likable old has-beens. Everybody is good, but I particularly like Peppard's aw-shucks cowboy, Saxon's cartoon villain and the eye-popping Danning's Valkyrie warrior woman. If you have an aversion to B-movies this is probably not the film for you, but I happen to be very fond of them and this one is terrific. Put it on a double-bill with Reds, and I can guarantee you which film you'll enjoy more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle Beyond the Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gung-ho sci-fi action fun featuring a solid B-movie cast, one of many erupting after the enormous success of STAR WARS. While the special effects may seem inferior to today's computer generated graphics, there was something aesthetically pleasing to see real, finely detailed models duking it out with lasers in space battle.Shad's(Richard Thomas) people on the planet Akira are threatened by the evil commander Sador(John Saxon)whose gargantuan ship houses a weapon that can actually disintegrate planets. Sador realizes that Akira has the right kind of habitat for his mutant soldiers and is willing to butcher an entire civilization in order to gain rule over it. Shad volunteers to seek out mercenaries willing to help his people combat Sador.Roger Corman's successful production, BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS, achieves a great deal on a modest budget thanks in part to John Sayles' very sharp, witty, really amusing script which takes the sci-fi genre and adds cultural vernacular(..particularly with George Peppard's Cowboy and Sybil Danning's Saint-Exmin)that a regular modern audience can adhere to, a spectacularly rousing score by James Horner, and some stunning matte work along with visually stimulating details for the varying space ships. I think the cast of characters adds substantially though to the movie. Thomas(..who makes a likable baby-faced hero), Saxon(..wonderfully vile as the arch-villain), Peppard(..as the liquor-swigging, harmonica-blowing, cigarette-smoking, charming freight delivery man who provides Shad with a pal to depend on when needing a leader desperately to help train his non-violent people how to shoot and defend themselves on the ground as Sador's stormtroopers land ready for combat), Darlanne Fluegel(..as the adorable love interest for Shad, Nanelia, who wishes to mate / procreate with him;she's been raised around robotic humanoids so she's a little naive when it comes to human contact), Danning(..as a proud female warrior who operates a small, very fast ship, with one of those very revealing suits allowing us to enjoy her massive melons and superb figure), and especially the voice of Lynn Carlin as Nell, the wise-cracking voice of Shad's ship(..who argues with Shad over his risky decisions and often lets their foes know what she thinks about them!). Robert Vaughn has a great part as a tired killer, Gelt, who is sick of being alone, even though his toxic personality doesn't exactly endear him to anybody due to his harsh existence in a cruel galaxy.This is spirited entertainment, penned by a man who knew how to inject his own brand of humor into these B-movies without insulting the genres themselves. Furthermore, he was able to create nifty roles and snappy dialogue for his casts who understood the material(..and tongue in cheek nature of it all) and went with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it was a good enough plot to service Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven, it's definitely good enough to service a Roger Corman sci-fi romp surfing in on the top of Star Wars' popularity. Yes, it is the familiar story of a bunch of ragbag mercenaries recruited to save the bacon of a bunch of defenceless locals from merciless predatory bandits, assisted by a young man from the oppressed community.With production values and effects a notch above the usual Corman benchmark, a cast of fairly well known faces most of whom were on their way down (instead of on their way up, as was usual with Corman), and a foolproof plot, this entertaining bunch of nonsense only has a faint whiff of cheese about it.Among the cheese are the brassy fanfare theme which becomes a bit much at times, and a hero (or should that be heroine?) spaceship which has a front view like a pair of bosoms topped with eyes on stalks.Conversely, there are some nice sci-fi notions among the various alien groups, John Saxon overacts madly with Ziggy Stardust face makeup, there are engaging performances generally, and it is cool to see Robert Vaughan reprising his Magnificent Seven role in a distant galaxy far, far away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First saw this back on UK t.v. one weekday afternoon in the mid 80s and loved it but then i was about 7. I didn't see it again until about 1990 and the only thing i had remembered about it was the Space Cowboy character and the Robert Vaughn mercenary.Now its on satellite telly virtually every week and i've managed to see it a few times. Half of me wants to like this movie and the other half tells me its really a load of rubbish. James Horner's music is a classic and Robert Vaughn's character is the epitome of cool, especially the way he blows all those enemy ships to pieces and the only thing he seems to move are his eyes! George Peppard's space cowboy is OTT but he has some nice scenes such as the land battle as his final charge at the enemy cruiser. The villains are funny (John Saxon's line about sorting out his odd-number of fingers on the amputated arm so they can fit the glove is hysterical) except for the two guys (surely the ugliest humanoid aliens in movie history) who beam up Richard Thomas' sister and do all sorts of unspeakable things to her (strangely in the rest of the movie Thomas doesn't even bat an eyelid or wonder what happened to her. hmm) These two manage to be both supremely creepy as well as blackly humorous, kind of like Mr Wint and Mr Kidd in Diamonds Are Forever. I spose i'd give this film the benefit of the doubt if only for the fact that Robert Vaughn's planet looks like one big ball of fun. Dial-a-date and dial-a-drug? I'm off on my bitchy voiced, double-breasted spaceship right away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Space tyrant Sador (John Saxon) threatens the pacifist defenseless agricultural planet of Akir with his weapon Stellar Converter. He pledges to return after the harvest in seven risings of their sun as the planet's new master. The elders send young Shad (Richard Thomas) to find mercenaries willing to fight for limited wealth rewards. He recruits Nanelia (Darlanne Fluegel) escaping from her father in her weaponless ship, Space Cowboy from earth (George Peppard) whose customer has just been destroyed by Sador, rich assassin Gelt (Robert Vaughn) looking for a friendly harbor, a Valkyrie named Saint-Exmin (Sybil Danning) looking to prove herself in battle in her tiny ship, five telepathic alien clones from a single consciousness called Nestor and a reptilian slaver named Cayman looking for revenge.It's cheap Roger Corman production with the bones of the great 'Seven Samurai' and the energetic F/X work of a newcomer named James Cameron. There is definitely cheesy goodness in this. It's a fun space thrill ride. There are some good performances. The writing isn't bad. The production is half cheese and half fun adventure. It all adds up to a fun competent 'Star Wars' inspired B-movie.</fullReview>

Among those he gets to help are the A-Team's Hannibal, the bad guy from Superman III, and Stirba the werewolf bitch. It's a fun cast. Roger Corman's sci-fi remake of Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven is also the best Star Wars knockoff of the many that came out in the late '70s and early '80s. While many have called this movie cheap-looking, it's actually fairly impressive for a Corman production. He would reuse these sets and some footage for future crappier low-budgeters. This is a fun sci-fi adventure movie that should entertain you if you don't take it all so seriously.</fullReview>

John Boy Walton, who still acts like that's where he is, a huge Valkyrie warrioress who is there for titillation (and not acting), extras from Strange Encounters all add to make a sad melange of awfulness.

		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWOLet me just say I really liked Battle Beyond The Stars. The plot follows that of the Seven Samurai, in which a galactic conquerer, Sador (John Saxon) attempts to destroy the planet Akir. Shad (Richard Thomas) attempts to save the planet by hiring seven futuristic mercenaries (George Peppard, Robert Vaughn, Morgan Woodward, Sybil Danning, etc.) to protect his planet. The Mercenaries fight Sador's superior numbers in a great, climatic battle. Now, the following will contain a spoiler, so don't read any further, if you haven't seen this movie... The mercenaries are killed off, one by one by Sador's evil group. (I believe Peppard's Space Cowboy was the last of the mercenaries to die.) Shad's ship Nell crashes into the Hammerhead and Akir is saved. The dialogue at the end that Shad and Nanelia have was a great... OK so, summing up, the main reason I loved the movie was the characters. From Peppard's hammy performance as Space Cowboy to Vaughn's deadly serious Gelt, each character is unique, and has something to prove... Oh, did I mention Sybil Danning's boobs???</fullReview>

I love the way Corman and company cheerfully cannibalize whatever movie they want to create their own unique film -- it's like they're giving the audience a sly wink and daring us to guess where this or that character or name or plotline comes from.No matter how many times I see this movie, I still get a kick out of seeing John-Boy fighting alongside Hannibal Smith and Napoleon Solo. Most of the time I find Richard Thomas very irritating, but somehow, surrounded by cowboys, clones and Caiman, he comes through okay in this movie. George Peppard shows us his devil-may-care smile, Robert Vaughn is cool and deadly, and Sybil Danning is... well, it's too bad this movie wasn't made in 3-D, that's all I need to say about that.There are some movies you watch that touch deep emotional chords within you, that portray the human condition on a majestic canvas so the audience can achieve catharsis. Then there are movies like "Battle," which don't aspire to anything more than being a fantastic thrill ride and a good time. Seeing it takes me back to happier days, when all you needed saw a blaster, a disparate group of friends, and a talking starship to defeat any challenge.Ah, warm memories...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are movies, and there are Bad movies. But, BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS is an excellent BAD movie !After STAR WARS, the theaters were flooded with bad rip-offs made with ridiculous budgets that tried to get some left over money from the audiences on the Star Wars genre craze. Many tried but few succeeded to create something really worth mentioning.Whoever but ROGER CORMAN, the king of all rip-offs, could do it?Story ? We don't need that, let's just rip-off the one from the SEVEN MAGNIFICENT, they ripped it off from THE SEVEN SAMURAIS didn't they ?...Special effects ? Now we have to spend a little bit of money...but not to much. We can use the same explosion sequence over and over again, GALACTICA style.Actors ? Well, i guess we can have a bunch of them, for the price of one in Star Wars! This is the B movies after all !Production Design ?!! What for ? We can mix bits and pieces of the cardboard sets we have here around the studio, and pay some kids to do some mate paintings. Hell, we even can use the costumes we have from our barbarian and western movies ! And let's have some almost naked babe playing an amazon from space. With luck she will divert all the attentions to her and the audiences won't even notice the microphones appearing on camera. After all why spend money in higher mic supports ? Short bikinis cost must less !And so a movie was born.And surprisingly it's a great movie. True, it's really crappy stuff, but it has imagination in it, as much strange this may sound. And it has the greatest design for a spaceship ever !Lots of characters, lots of spaceships and all very different, lots of diferent locations, cool riped off story, and evil bad guy in the classical style, cowboys in space, huge almost naked amazon women, battles in space, battles on planets, huge space cruisers, a talking spaceship, and microphones appearing on screen a couple of times ! What more could we ask for ?!!! It even has a good soundtrack.And all this cost very cheap !One of the best bad movies ever. A must see for every one who is into space-operas.I only wished there was a sequel !....Unfortunately there isn't, so enjoy this. BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS, even the title is much cool than Star Wars!I love it !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Magic Happens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make no mistake, Battle Beyond the Stars is a B movie. Coming from the Roger Corman school of film-making the movie is a Star Wars meets Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven homage.Yet somewhere along the way this movie transcended its humble origins to become something more. Perhaps it was the script, written by Oscar Winner John Sayles, the movie explored different attitudes to death from Sador's (John Saxon)obsession with escaping it to Valkerie (Sybil Danning) who's race embrace death. Perhaps it was the incredible looking ships, designed by James Cameron who went on to Art Director for the film after the original Art Director was found to be not up to the task. Perhaps the music, James Horner early in his career creates a sweeping sci-fi soundtrack that easily matches his later scores for movies such as Titanic or Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Or perhaps the actors, John Saxon chews scenery in one of his finest villainous roles, Richard Thomas, fresh from the Waltons gives his 'Luke Skywalker' character Shad, a wonderful innocence which is challenged by his experiences and throughout the movie develops into a fully rounded character. George Peppard gives a soulful performance as Space Cowboy, a character who could easily have been farcical. Robert Vaughn plays Gelt, a deadly mercenary reminiscent of his Magnificent Seven character Lee weary after a successful but empty career as a killer.For whatever reason this film works. Great space battles, great land battles, some great aliens and a plot that keeps the pace exciting yet gives enough that repeat viewing gives you a chance to appreciate the various layers in this film. This movie is coming up on its 30th Anniversary and still has legs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars + exploitation value = great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun, fast moving, and with good one-dimensional heroes (like the movie it obviously owes a lot to, Star Wars), this one takes a different Kurosawa story (Seven Samurai) and does a pretty good sci-fi version of the concept. I thought it was as good if not better than the Magnificent Seven. The stars have real B-movie credentials, too, headed up by the obiquitous Saxon as a darth-vader substitute par excellence. Peppard shines in a great bit as a stoned out space cowboy, and Vaughan appears and is effective as the mercenary member of the group. The guy who played the young hero was also very good, I thought. Too bad he never became a big star, because he seems like a pretty good actor. Anyway, this film represents the best of what Corman is capable of: taking a good, but somewhat stodgy, concept (like space opera a la Buck Rodgers or Star Wars) and adds elements of exploitation (sadistic violence, semi-nude dancers) to make it more lively and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembered seeing "Battle" as a youngish fellow when it first came out, but I didn't remember anything about it except the odd ship designs and that it was basically OK for cheaply made escapist space opera with Star Wars "inspired" themes. I couldn't even remember the exact title for many years - "Oh, yeah, that Roger Corman space opera that was better than it deserved to be, what was the title, I remember kind of liking it."I finally confirmed the title a while back and found I could watch it for free on YouTube, so I did,just to see how it held up.Well...Way more derivative than I remember. Lots of lines that fall flat and lots of scenes that don't work or go anywhere. The Corman "get it finished and get it out the door" feel is all over it. On the plus side, the special effects were, um, enjoyably cheesy, and the music aped John Williams successfully without seeming too much of a rip- off. (Not criticizing James Horner here - he went on to do some great things.) However the sound design for the space battles was really stupid. Laser blasts should not remind me of quacking ducks, that's all I'm saying. I'd also forgotten that there was some talent lined up for this movie, almost enough to elevate it a notch. But Peppard and Vaughn walked through their parts on autopilot, Saxon had no idea how to play a super-villain, and John Thomas as the Luke Skywalker stand- in, was hopelessly bland. At least they never had him pull out a light-saber analogue or "use the Force", although they did have him dress all in white, just like what's-his-name.For all its Corman-derived 2nd-rate shenanigans, though, it was decent, managing to wrap itself in the good-will generated by Star Wars - A New Hope. I got the sub-text,"Man, we LOVED Star Wars, and we wanted to play it ourselves." Well, who doesn't?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Star Trek:The Motion Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is pure entertainment, from its memorable characters and fun storytelling to its Star-Wars-esque (by a young James Cameron) special effects. How it only made $10 million bucks is beyond me when you consider Star Trek released the year earlier made over $100 million and was in my opinion the most boring sci-fi movie ever conceived. This is certainly a hidden gem and the marketing men behind this should have been fired for not turning it a hit.At the centre of the film is a morality tale - A band of space adventures turned mercenaries join together to defeat a space tyrant who threatens to destroy a planet. Richard Thomas (from The Waltons) is given the task as recruiter and hires among others George Peppard (from The A-Team) and Robert Vaughan (Man from Uncle) as a Magnificent Seven space battle ensues.Some of our heroes sadly die and you actually care about them which is a credit to the writers. Also I love some of the dialogue such as the exchange between our villain and Nestor 2 (1 of a set of clones) who gets captured. Sador: Are you capable of speech? Nestor 2: Yes, quite capable.Sador: And do you have a high tolerance for pain?Nestor 2: Almost none at all, I'm afraid.Sador: How unfortunate for you. So... How many ships do the Akira have, and what are their capabilities?Nestor 2: If I told you that, it would give you an unfair advantage.Sador: This is Frojo, my Third Officer. Frojo is expert at inflicting pain... while keeping the victim alive.Nestor 2: ...It's good to have skills." Better than the Black Hole and funnier than Flash Gordon (the leads back chatting ships computer Nell is a hoot), this film has the heart of Star Wars. A great popcorn movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>certainly not all a waste, but not as fun as I'd hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It kind of pains me to give this movie such a low rating. You might be thinking 'but wait, that's not exactly too low, is it, like it's not a "Bad" rating, right?' I was quite hopeful for Battle Beyond the Stars, however, from some of the scuttlebutt that I'd heard over the years, its cult status and how Roger Corman wanted to make a Magnificent Seven in space (or Seven Samurai if you want to be more cineastey about it) and, naturally, following on the coattails of Star Wars (and Alien to a smaller extent, which itself was made thanks to Star Wars), with a cast that included John Saxon and George Pappard, and art direction by none other than James Cameron(!) Oh boy I was hoping for some world class awesome cheese (maybe a so-bad-it's-spectacular) experience. And at the end I discovered it's ultimately... OK. That's it.Actually, that's not all true - Cameron's art direction, whether that was work on the ships (which do look like they had some money for them, albeit one of the ships looks like a cross between the one dude's head from the Cantina in Star Wars, you know the one, and with a pair of boobs on the bottom as so many have noted), or on the sets (which are standard but eye-catching), is wonderful, and I did really enjoy just the look of the film as far as it being "retro" in 2016. It's impossible to see this being made today with this technology, since everything still had to be built from the ships to the sets to the costumes (that woman's awesome silver crown-headpiece-whatever) and the explosions and planets and so on, but the charm comes from seeing everything moving at the same speed and tech as a Star Wars did in 77 but with slightly less budget. And James Horner delivers a pretty good score - not great, but pretty good. And Peppard as the 'Cowboy' is my favorite part of the film, with his scotch belt (yes, a belt that makes scotch, eat your heart out Ron Burgundy), and his demeanor of kind of seeming to be half drunk most of the time, if not fully blitzed. He's having the time of his life and it shows.But the rest of the movie is just dull, at least for me. It does have some oddly not even subtextual but textual sexual stuff to it, lots of talk about impregnation (though we never see it as this is PG so, hey, not in front of the kids unless it's a spaceship or some massive cleavage at one point), and with certain talk in scenes and how Richard Thomas looks and talks at Darlane Fluegel's Nanelia, and that is kind of campy and interesting and fun. The rest of the time we're seeing a cast, including also, sadly, John Saxon, performing a lot of dialog (by John Sayles of all the friggin people! that is leaden and serious and, except maybe for Cowboy, not much fun. It's largely perfunctory, plot-driven, and when it tries too hard for comedy like the voice of the ship our hero pilots (Lynn Carlin as Nell sounding like an old Jewish mother), it's ridiculous but not in a clever way.Who knows, maybe I needed a much different environment to see it, like with a full theater crowd at the Alamo Drafthouse and with some good booze and good cheer (I watched it with friends but that didn't change much of the mood of 'Ok but so what?') It's also hard to not notice in nearly every moment that it's taking wholesale from Magnificent Seven (or maybe by 3rd degree Seven Samurai), and yet by it being in space and with so many strange yet cold creatures, like those fully white guys with the eyes on their foreheads, it mostly lacks the personality and warmth of those previous genre films. In other words, it's cheese but it's almost like cheese that's been left out too long and has lost its punch; the same year Flash Gordon also came out which is a much better example, to me, of how to do this sort of campy-crappy space epic adventure serial stuff. While it has the look initially (and at times with the characters and fx) of something extraordinary, it's really far from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This ain't "Star Wars" but it's not too bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the budget of this Roger Corman production is greater than his usual, it it still far less than a big-time sci-fi production of the era. For example, if you watch any of the three original "Star Wars" films, they are light years ahead of "Battle Beyond the Stars" when it comes to special effects. Clearly, it cannot keep up with these top-notch movies. But, if you accept that its effects are a bit cheesy and this doesn't bother you, the film is surprisingly enjoyable.Richard Thomas stars as an alien living on a very peaceful planet. They are so peaceful when an intergalactic baddie threatens to destroy them, his people don't have the first idea about how to fight back and protect themselves. So, he goes on a mission to hire fighters who will protect them....and he comes up with a rag-tag group of heroes. Can these assorted heroes somehow fight back against this baddie and ignore, at least temporarily, Sybil Danning and her ever-present and very noticeable cleavage?!The film offers quite a few B-list actors--a surprising number. In fact, apparently that is where they spent most of the money for the film hiring the likes of George Peppard, Robert Vaughn and the like. Overall, this is probably a film more for kids and die-hard sci-fi fans but it's reasonably entertaining and offers a few interesting characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Seven... in Space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story concerns a young farmer, Shad (Richard Thomas), from the peaceful planet Akir (named for Akira Kurosawa), that is under threat from the warlord Sador (John Saxon), of the Malmori. Being a peace- loving people they have no way to defend themselves, so Shad takes an old spacecraft and goes looking for some mercenaries to help defend his planet. These include, Nanelia (Darlanne Fluegel); Space Cowboy (George Peppard); Nestor (Five Alien clones, who share a group consciousness); Gelt (Robert Vaughn); Saint-Exmin (Sybil Danning); Cayman (Morgan Woodward) and The Kelvin (Larry Meyers &amp; Lara Cody).When Sador returns he is met by Shad, leading seven ships in a bid to safe his planet from destruction.The film is a remake of The Magnificent Seven (1960), which was a remake of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai (1954), so there is no time wasted on in-depth character development or storytelling, as the story should be familiar. Everything we need to know about each character we learn in our first meeting with them. Space Cowboy is a space trucker, from Earth, looking for adventure. Saint-Exmin is from a female warrior race, who has a very fast ship, and wishes to have a glorious death. Gelt is the best assassin in the galaxy, but is alone and paranoid, only joining Shad for the reward of a safe and peaceful place to live.The effects aren't the best, but are by no means poor. This could be down to a number of reasons;While Star Wars (1977) had an estimated budget of $11 million, Battle Beyond the Stars had an estimated budget of just $2 million.The man who was in charge of the miniature design and construction, special photographic effects and was also the additional director of photography was none other than James Cameron. (It was while working on Battle Beyond the Stars that James Cameron met Gale Ann Hurd, the films assistant production manager, who he would team up with to make his 1984 classic, The Terminator.)Battle Beyond the Stars was filmed in just five weeks.The score was composed by James Horner and is very upbeat and full of brass instruments, fanfare and goes very well with the pace of the film. James Horner also scored the soundtracks to Star Trek II (1982) and Star Trek III (1984), the latter of which has pieces of score that sound as if they were simply 'lifted' from the Battle Beyond the Stars score.Each of the characters appears to have been given the same amount of screen time, which works in the movie's favour. John Saxon plays Sador with a particular ruthlessness, while George Peppard is almost playful as the Space Truckin' Cowboy. Meanwhile, Robert Vaughn's, Gelt, is so closely based on the character of Lee, from The Magnificent Seven (1960), that some of Gelt's dialogue is almost identical, to that of Lee's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah it's a pretty good movie. A nice early temp from filmmaking Juggernaut, James Cameron whose talents got him promoted to head of visual effects. His crowning achievement being a really cool looking ship that looks like it has a set of boobs. Thanks Jim! Not the only set of boobs in the flick, it also features B-Queen icon, Sybill Danning in strange battle armor made out of foam. I recognized George Papard and Robert Vaughn, who were big stars to my childhood thanks to their run on the A-Team. I'm sure it brought people into the box-Office,despite their performance being so-so. Also great about the movie is the film composing of James Horner that somehow made the cheap effects look a little better. But it is worth seeing just to check out what Mr. Avatar was able to do with so little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corman's Greatest Space Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young farmer (Richard Thomas) sets out to recruit mercenaries to defend his peaceful planet, which is under threat of invasion by an evil tyrant (John Saxon) and his armada.What happens if you take Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" and put it in space? Well, it might be something like this, because that was the direct inspiration behind this film. Is this as great a film as Kurosawa's? Of course not. Is it as good as the western remake, "Magnificent Seven"? No. But this is still a worthy film, and it has a very tongue-in-cheek temperament that strongly suggests they knew what they were doing was out of love but not necessarily top notch.Although I enjoyed the appearance of John Saxon as a space villain (in his pre-"Elm Street" days), the real praise must go to James Horner, whose score was quite good for a Corman production. Should we be surprised that we went on to great things? Allegedly, this is also the film that sparked the partnership between Gale Anne Hurd and James Cameron, too... so it can be indirectly responsible for such great films as "Aliens".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining low budget sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the evil tyrant Sador arrives at the planet Akir he announces that that if the people don't surrender when he returns in seven days he will use his 'stellar converter' to destroy the planet. Being a peaceful populace they have no chance of defeating him but one elderly man, Zed; who was their last warrior, says he has a fighting ship; he is too old to use it himself but another man, named Shad, offers to leave Akir in the ship and go and recruit mercenaries to fight the battle for them. He then sets about securing the services of a varied group that includes a wealthy assassin; the Nestor, a group of five clones that share a consciousness; a voluptuous Valkyrie warrior; Cowboy, a space-trucker from Earth; Nanelia, the daughter of an old friend of Zed. By the time they return to Akir they have seven ships ready to fight Sador; they are severely outgunned and many of them won't make it but they will fight him anyway!This film's low budget shows; the special effects look distinctly ropey when compared to big budget films of the time; for the most part they aren't terrible though and it is interesting to know that James Cameron; master of mega-budget special effects learnt his craft on a film like this. The story is solid enough; which one would expect given that is basically the plot of 'Magnificent Seven'... which itself is based on 'The Seven Samurai'. When the action starts it pretty good and there are plenty of comic moments that should raise a smile. The cast to a decent enough with Richard 'John-boy Walton' Thomas playing protagonist Shad and John Saxon hamming it up as the evil Sador, also present are two better known actors; Robert Vaughn and George Peppard... it isn't their best work by a long way but they do add to the proceedings. This is hardly a must see film but if you like moderately camp low budget sci-fi it is worth watching on television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle Beyond the Stars (1980)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Samurai is my favorite film of all time. It's perfection. The Magnificent Seven is also a fantastic movie. In 1980, Roger Corman brought us this slice of budget sci-fi. Taking the classic story and reworking it to slide nicely into the Star Wars excitement, Battle Beyond the Stars is a mishmash tapestry of cheapness, but some genuinely great bits. The recruitment scenes go on far too long, with Thomas having to travel through space, rather than just one city. The warriors themselves are boiled down to pretty darn simple emotions/motives. Obviously, Seven Samurai had the benefit of a 220 Minute running time, but they could have tried a bit harder. Thomas is a great hero, the simple, gentle man thrown into a world of war. His progression is well charted and works a treat. Some of the practical effects are nice, and some are even too cheap for my taste. A space setting is a great way to update the classic tale, but unfortunately this film wrote checks that it was unable to cash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Co-produced by Roger Corman and Ed Carlin, Battle Beyond the Stars is directed by Jimmy T. Murakami and written by Anne Dyer and John Sayles. It stars Richard Thomas, Robert Vaughn, George Peppard, John Saxton and Darlanne Fluegel. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by Daniel Lacambre. Plot is Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven as Star Wars.We know it's a rip-off, but it's a lovingly crafted cheesy rip-off, the kind of cheap space adventure we thrilled to when our age was in single figures. Budget has been spent on securing "names" Vaughn (reprising his role from Mag 7) and Peppard, leaving one James Cameron to produce a set design out of McDonalds cartons and hypermarket boxes, with that knowledge in mind, it comes out as a glorious achievement. From Russ Meyer influenced spaceships, to the trippy costumes, the look and feel of the film is a triumph over adversity. Story moves briskly and the recycled action gladdens the heart, and there's no little imagination used to form the narrative, telegraphic beings feeling as one, woo-hoo! While the cast can not be faulted for effort, attacking the material with gusto and a glint in the eye. Endearing and fun for those prepared to let the inner child out during the viewing. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the wake of Star Wars a lot of movies were produced trying to score on the popularity of sci-fi at the time. Eager studios surprised by the success of the George Lucas movies were all too glad to pour money into these productions for the hope of some fast bucks."Battle Beyond the Stars" even goes so far to mimic the title of it's role model, along with several spaceship designs. To mix up the stars'n'lasers-theme they throw in a "seven samurai"-plot, several known actors and a playmate sex bomb as the cherry on top. Alas, the special effects pale in comparison, the design is visibly inferior and the story barely scrapes the surface.Yet to say that the movie is a plain ripoff wouldn't do it right. There are some funny ideas, interesting characters and some humorous scenes, that can surely be enjoyed. So if you refrain from comparing it with the Star Wars series, you surely can have a fun time here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just caught this for the first time and was wondering why I never saw this in the theaters or VHS as I grew up with the original Star Wars trilogy. This must've had an age limit of 16 (altho there seem to have been a cut version also) in Finland. And rightly so, as cheeky and childish as it may seem, there are scenes where you have blood spraying from ones ear. Back in the day this was enough to restrict a movie from anyone below 16, today we have a different world..It's pretty entertaining for a Star Wars geek with all the similarities in music, wipe cuts and so on, it really did strike a few goose bumps here and there, even having never seen it before. There are some amazing optical effects and matte paintings, altho it often falls into Star Trek world where some of the supposed outdoor scenes are painfully studiolike. Now that I think about it, this is where Lucas could've gone wrong, but luckily he shot his on location.The script and dialog are good, but the actors just don't cut it. There's nothing heroic or cool with the leading couple. I'm not sure how they've stacked up in the 80's, but now they are just geeky and nerdy, and not in a good way. Michael York in Logan's Run comes to mind. But then again the whole movie is very geeky, it's difficult to say if there was anything cool ever.Must be seen for any movie geek just for it's amazing crew (Corman, Sayles, Cameron, Horner..).The spaceship with titties has been discussed already, but there are other "references" too. Look for a rock wall that looks exactly like a pu.. well, you'll see it when you see it.</fullReview>

I have seen the same ships in so many other low-budget movies. I think the footage of the spaceship exteriors is getting licensed. I just saw them in "Last Exit to Earth" (1996). It is funny to see the same footage represent good guys in one movie and then bad guys in another movie. All of them are sub par but must be loved for the earnest messes they are. Right when Science Fiction films were becoming big budget blockbusters "Battle Beyond the Stars" was the answer no one asked for. This movie has a shock value derived from it's schlock value. This movie would have been forgotten if it weren't so amateurish that it was available cheap for endless showings on cheap cable channels. I ought to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An almost-good movie, but not quite. "Battle Beyond the Stars" (1980) presents us with Richard Thomas, three years after quitting his "Waltons" gig, as Shad, a young man from the defenseless and peaceful planet of Akira, who goes searching for soldier-of-fortune help when Sador, a galactic bully with a fondness for destroying worlds, threatens. And, with the assistance of his moosehead-shaped spaceship, run by the snarkiest computer in film history, he finds that help, times seven: Nanelia, the virginal daughter of a nearby scientist; Gelt, a mercenary ("Gelt" means "money" in Yiddish; ha ha!), played by Robert Vaughn; Cowboy, a drunken space-cargo hauler from good ol' Earth, played by George Peppard; Nestor, a group of albino clones with a hive mind; a lizardlike captain; the Kelvin (oy!) heat creatures; AND a Valkyrie, as portrayed by Sybil Danning. Of course, this is yet another remake of the 1954 epic "The Seven Samurai," but is, ultimately, a poor man's "Star Trek/Wars," with an inferior script, characters and background setting. The FX here, it should be said, are pretty darn good, although the requisite space battles are hard to follow. The main problem with the picture is that we never really get to know or care about any of the characters; this film desperately needs the charismatic presence of a Takashi Shimura or Toshiro Mifune type to ground it. Even "The Magnificent Seven" (1960), the first remake of the original, gave us a chance to get acquainted with its principals. And while it IS fun to see Robert Vaughn reprise his role here from the 1960 film, his character is not on screen barely long enough. This film has some inventive ideas, but it all feels so rushed and undeveloped. (The only thing not undeveloped here is Ms. Danning...yowza!) With more money, another hour of screen time, a more leisurely exposition and a beefier plot, they may have had something here. As it is, a fun failure.</fullReview>

Imagine my surprise when the local video store had it on DVD. I immediately grabbed it and enjoyed it again. Aside from the stock footage and the low budget, I think what makes this such a good B-movie is the names attached. I mean, its not like anyone knows who Gale Anne Hurd is, or James Cameron. It was the tricks of the special effects trade that Cameron learned under Corman that led to the glorious special effects we saw in The Terminator.Speaking of stock everything.

		<fullReview>This space-set sci-fi fantasy that bares no resemblance to STAR WARS is probably the most watchable movie Roger Corman ever made (not to diss "The Terror" or "Night of the Blood Beast"). It's about John-Boy Walton, who has seven days to find mercenaries to save his disgustingly peaceful planet (named Akira, not to be confused with planets Tetsuo or Kei) from evil TENEBRE star John Saxon (who hails from the planet Comb-Over). John-Boy's planet only has two dozen citizens and all they do is mill around all day, so they're not really worth saving, but what the hell, if he doesn't there'll be no movie.So John-Boy sets out in his sassy, back-talking spaceship (which has a great pair of breasts) and recruits seven saviors (like SEVEN SAMERAI, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, or A BUG'S LIFE). George "Lieutenant-Colonel John 'Hannibal' Smith" Peppard plays a stoned space trucker (BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S was a loooong time ago). TEENAGE CAVEMAN's Robert Vaugn is bad-ass Gelt, and well-endowed Sybill Danning is Saint X-Men. There's also a bland computer expert, a Lizard pimp and his sidekicks who communicate in heat, and Observer-like aliens called Nestor. The first half of the movie is watching John-Boy recruit them, and the second half is **SPOILER AHEAD** watching them all die. John-Boy finally crashes his bitchy spaceship into John Saxon and Akira is free to mill around in peace. The end.It's a fun movie with lots of special effects (which range from awful to passable) and some nice characters. There are no monsters or cute robots, though, so beware. It's written by John Sayles, who went on to make LONE STAR, LIMBO, and SUNSHINE STATE (none of which feature a Lizard pimp).In conclusion, it's better than THE PHANTOM MENACE but not as good as SPACEBALLS.</fullReview>

This is a surprisingly pleasant experience. It won't change the way you view the world but it is a big slab of fun.The graphics and the plot are sympathetic and interesting. The main body of the film is the hunt for mercenaries to defend the helpless agricultural planet. It builds to a good final battle and the redemption of the fallen heroes.A note about the baddy, Sador, played by John Saxon. Like all the best villains he has an interesting twitch. Some wear a black hat (Jack Palance in Shane), some wear womens clothing (Anthony Perkins in Psycho), Sador goes just that bit further.I watched this film about 18 years ago, but it has stayed with me.

Mr. Corman saved some money by doing the special effects in-house at his studio,New World Pictures, which helps to explain why the spaceships and alien creatures look, well, homegrown(check out the breasts on Richard Thomas' talking ship!). Some of the dialogue and acting are pretty cheesy too, but it all makes for a fun, guilty-pleasure romp when all is said and done.

Many people in Hollywood, who have gone onto bigger and better things, have worked for or with ROGER CORMAN (ie. BILL PAXTON, GALE ANNE HURD, JAMES CAMERON, etc.). This film has long winded sequences of EXTREMELY LONG starships flying across the screen to sinister music like in STAR WARS. We even have a villian named SADOR...(wonder which STAR WARS character they we trying to equate him with?????) The film starred RICHARD THOMAS (JOHN BOY), GEORGE PEPPARD (A TEAM) and ROBERT VAUGHN (THE MAN FROM UNCLE) and a cast of then unknowns including F. MURRAY ABRAHAM and SYBIL DANNING. The plot is familar, here goes: a bad guys flys thorugh space in a huge spacecraft with a death beam gun and he likes to blow up planets. everywhere he goes he leaves a wake of destruction and sinister villian music in his quest for galactic power. He wants to take over a small planet but a rag tag band of space heros are lead into battle by a mere boy in a spaceship that looks like a milk cow....EVERYBODY GOT THAT??????(Whew!)

		<fullReview>This movie was made in 1980, during the height of the popularity of Star Wars and the revival of Star Trek, when anyone could shop a Science Fiction concept past a major studio and not get laughed out the door. Lo and behold, the king of cheesy movies, Roger Corman, did exactly that in this film, and actually did it with a fairly major budget. I mean, he had stars in this you've actually heard of, like John Saxon and George Peppard and Robert Vaughn. One can almost imagine the pitch. "Well, it's like the Seven Samurai. Oh, wait, that's Japanese, you probably never saw that. Okay, it's like the Maginficent Seven. A planet is threatened by bad guys and they recruit an unlikely crew of hired guns to defend them." So the bad guys lead by John Saxon threaten this peaceful planet, and a wise old mentor sends out Richard Thomas (aka John Boy Walton) to recruit a bunch of mercenaries (no doubt, because Mark Hamill had better things to do at that time), including Robert Vaughn of original Magnificent Seven fame, and George Peppard, who continued his downward spiral as an actor that would eventually lead him to star in "The A-Team". Also included is Sybil Danning, queen of B-movies, who at least showed enormous restraint and kept her clothes on for the whole movie. The space battle scenes might be familiar to aficionados of low-rent Science fiction films. That because old Roger, that sly dog, recouped some of his production costs by selling the FX shots to a lot of other B-list movies, and I think one or two porn films. If you think you've seen these shots before, just remember, in this film, THEY ALMOST MAKE SENSE. There were a lot of interesting SF concepts pitched in this film, such as an alien with collective intelligence, aliens capable of storing radiant energy, a young woman raised entirely by androids, and a few others. Unfortunately, Roger takes no time to dwell on any of them. Not to say that this film is all bad. It's just that we've seen better. Better acting, better special effects, better concepts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Even Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From time to time i really enjoy to watch cheesy and trashy movies especially set in space, i always feel good and happy after watching that kind of movies, but this is even not a funny it is bad very bad, from plot, characters, actors, costumes, space fighters, everything looks terrible. You can compensate with good story and atmosphere but there is nothing there. The most terrible acting comes from main character Shad (Played by Richard Thomas), he is unconvincing, dull, half of the crew looks like they are totally bored, also there is a cowboy yes cowboy he is not funny at all. Only reason why i gave this movie 3 is great soundtrack by James Horner and sex Valkyrie warrior played by Austrian Sybil Danning. My recommendation is not to watch this, better watch Space Raiders which is also produced by Corman this movie use space scenes and music from this film but it is better and has more heart and story. If you want hard to laugh just watch Italian Starcrash or Turkish Star Wars, avoid this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wooden lead and boring first hour, but the last bit is cheesy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman's remake of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN - in outer space - is more like a lousy STAR WARS rip-off, a cheap and cheesy affair packed with terrible special effects and appalling acting from Richard Thomas, hideously miscast in the heroic leading role as he cannot portray anything other other than an unconvincing wimp. Seriously, Thomas is totally wooden, failing to display any type of emotion and reading his lines like one would read a book aloud to a class of small children. His attempts at romance are pathetic, his heroic acts weak and laughable. I think the only thing I actually liked Thomas in was STALKING LAURA in which he played against type.I never thought an effects-packed film such as this could be boring, but after the umpteenth lame outer-space battle with ships flying to and fro (no idea who was who) I was utterly tired of the whole affair. The first hour is very slow with very little confrontation, only picking up in the last half an hour to offer some fairly good scenes of laser battles in an underground cave system and the final confrontation between good and evil, fought in outer space of course. The special effects are pretty tacky, especially the dodgy spaceships, but there are some nice visual shots of planets and some good back projection to make up for this. Shots of people disintegrating are cheesy but fun, while the many alien races (including a green lizard man and two alien humanoid children who expire and turn cold) are imaginative and good for a laugh.What's most astonishing is the well-known cast of actors rounded up to support Thomas in the lead role. You can see where all the budget went. Best-known of all is Robert Vaughn, actually quite good here as the mercenary Gelt; all he wants is a meal and somewhere to rest. George Peppard (DAMNATION ALLEY) supports as Cowboy, an old-time human fighter who has a ship full of weaponry, and aside from his false wig, he's not too bad as the good-old-boy fighter. Darlanne Fluegel portrays an icy beauty as the love interest, but her thunder is stolen by the far more interesting character played by Sybil Danning (THE HOWLING II), who dresses in outlandish costumes made to emphasise her breasts (so what else is new?) and is some sort of futuristic Valkyrie! Sam Jaffe's head appears in a cameo role whilst you may recognise the voice of Earl Boen (THE TERMINATOR), but not the face as he appears as a weird white alien creature who shares a collected consciousness with the rest of his race years before the Borg came about.The mean bad guy is John Saxon, a performance he repeated in the even cheaper PRISONERS OF THE LOST UNIVERSE a couple of years down the line. Blue-lit and with weird markings on his face, Saxon enjoys himself in a hammy turn as the baddie Sador, and he even loses an arm before the film's close. A tweak to the pacing of the flick, a different lead and more imagination would have made BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS an enjoyable movie. As it is, it's a mildly entertaining bad film only for lovers of the genre or those feeling charitable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darlanne Fluegel, Beauty Beyond the Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie not my scene at all. My interest was because of tantalizing glimpses from this and STARCRASH in Early 80s magazines, of pretty girls in revealing outfits. It was somehow lodged in my mind that Sybil Danning was something extra-exciting. So, decades later, I acquired this title on DVD, very expensively as I had to have it imported, and it was ridiculously overpriced, something like more than a hundred $$$ and I had to face the dismal exchange rate. Only to be utterly disappointed by the oh-so-fake-looking plastic person. Believe me, she was not at all what I expected. She looks like she's years ahead of her time. In a bad way. She looks like the very epitome of the current never-ending plastic surgery trend. Implants. About as much fun as a blow- up doll. Well, to each their own. But there is a very lovely girl in this spaced-out saga, and it beats the hell out of me that nobody latched onto the real star way back then. Darlanne Fluegel, a sight worth traveling to the stars. And paying a hefty amount for an overpriced DVD.Suffice to say, I do not want my money back. I am more than satisfied with my purchase. Had it not been for Darlanne, though, it would have been a waste. Embarrassingly bad movie. To be avoided unless you wanna see a really pretty girl, the overlooked starlet.One thing, I must admit, I cannot really say in all certainty whether or not the whole Sybil Danning obsession was caused by getting confused with other images or whatever. I well remember the character's exotic name in the captions, so I might just have been naively influenced by her costume, but I sure as hell know better today than to fall for a fake nip/tucked creation with silicon bags or whatever. Look, that stuff is okay for accident victims, but man (with scalpel) cannot improve on Nature.So, for those of you judging whether to watch this on telly tonight, you sure as hell can't lose. You could die laughing at the unlikely- looking special effects, and overall have a fun time. Rent it, but only pay a tremendous sum for it if you're a Mad Collector in pursuit of All The Pretty Actresses like me. But don't fall for the unEarthly looking Sybil, I promise you she's not worth it. Darlanne IS, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Depressing To Be Any Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I have to say, this is certainly one of the most visually striking films Roger Corman has ever done. The effects are excellent, and the soundtrack is also fantastic. The cast are mostly fantastic...except unfortunately the main two leads, who manage to be the least likable of the whole thing. Part of that is due to the terrible script which, while it rather heavily borrows from a film classic, also has all the pitfalls of said classic: namely that it's depressing as hell.And ultimately, that's a failure when the film is essentially a sci-fi B movie. Those aren't watched to be depressing, they're watched to be enjoyable and even funny, silly, campy...whatever you might say about them, they're not supposed to be so dour. The smarmy Akir, by the end, are simply not characters the audience cares about, and I for one hated them and wished they'd been blown to smithereens at the beginning of the film -- it would've at least saved us the pain of having to sit through it. Their stupid religious precepts were nothing but smug and irritating, and the idiot Shad, our unfortunate 'hero', nothing but a placeholder who had no consistency whatsoever with his values.Who could possibly enjoy a film where everyone is barely vaguely- defined, and despite massive casualties, none of the heroes really gets a meaningful final scene? It's all dull and unhappy, and that makes it even more depressing. Characters are introduced, contribute little to the plot, and then when they dare to show any kind of development are then hastily removed from that plot, with nothing to show for their involvement. The ships were also, on the whole, not distinct enough aside from a few examples, to avoid confusion; by the end of it there was no ability to really tell who was good and who was bad, aside from the embarrassingly-designed Nell, the only spacecraft with boobs I've ever seen.Some have claimed that comparisons to Star Wars, its contemporary, were responsible for the ultimate failure of Battle Beyond the Stars. They're completely incorrect. The reason why it failed was because people simply do not want to see relentlessly depressing and downbeat B-grade science- fiction. Something as ridiculous as Battle Beyond the Stars only comes off as lacking and pretentious, utterly unable to reach its attempted goal and wholly contemptible for the attempt.</fullReview>

IT is pretty campy but I did not find it very funny nor were the fights any good either. Based on the Seven Samurai it was not even farcical. Even in 1980 they knew there was no noise in space and yet there were the engine noises and the weapons noise. Now these weapons appear to be lasers and they have no sound any way. Had some decent actors listed but I guess any thing with Jon Boy (Richard Thomas)in it will be kinda lame. A couple of the characters were okay but most were very undeveloped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly dreadful film, actors ( ha ) leaving massive pauses between dialogue, awful special effects and a risible script. So WHAT that this pile of rubbish had a limited budget....That's no excuse for ridiculous performances, totally unbelievable characterisations and dialogue. For all that, it will probably attain cult status for BEING so bad. John Boy's spacecraft is shaped like a 3D womb, very bizarre I must say !The plot involves trouble in the form of John Saxon ( he of Enter the Dragon alongside Bruce Lee ) a bully boy, planet stealer/destroyer throwing his weight around. Unless the planet surrenders to him within one week, he will return to set it on fire......making you wonder what's the point. John Boy, a human amongst androids, picks himself to save the planet by recruiting anyone who can fight, seeing as he doesn't like to. Escaping from the under threat planet, he meets up with enough to recreate The Magnificent Seven ( including a bored looking and space weary Robert Vaughan who WAS in that film too )....The pacing of BBtS is all over the place but mainly painfully S-L-O-W......I recommend avoiding this altogether unless you want to spend 104 minutes with your jaw on your chest from shock at how this ever got to be made or from yawning your way through it......There is a third way of watching this but it entails you WANTING it to be as bad as possible....in which case, you will NOT be disappointed.</fullReview>

Maybe if I had seen The 7 Samurai, I'd appreciate the reference, but I haven't seen it, and now I'm not going to. That's right, I mean I'd rather watch the Black Hole.

		<shortDescription>Weak entry into the Space Opera genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of the stupendous success of Star Wars, every producer in Hollywood seemed to be in a rush to put out his/her own space opera - such a rush that what made Star Wars a hit (wit, charm, originality and epic production values) were often left out of the mix. This typical example is a reprise of The Magnificent Seven, with seven fighting specialists recruited to rescue a beleaguered star colony that looks like a backlot in Burbank. Fully two-thirds of the picture goes to the recruiting sequence, so there is little action going on for much of the movie's middle part. And the final showdown is fought by such small groups of combatants that each side looks as if it could get stomped by a reasonably well stocked scout troop. In short, don't be fooled by the box art: this is anything but a space epic. The sets and effects are cheap looking, the script is pedestrian, and the whole thing has a shot-in-one-weekend quality to it, like they edited together take one of everything. Approach with caution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) was a cheesy remake of the Seven Samurai. Instead of taking place in a dusty small Japanese Village, this film takes place deep in space. An evil alien named Sador (John Saxon) is threatening a small planet with death and violence. The frightened inhabitants seek the help of mercenaries who'll drive away the invaders. One young dude and his girl (Richard Thomas and Darlene Fluegal) seek the help of a motley crew of outcasts and odd fellows (George Peppard, Robert Vaughn, Sybil Danning). Will they be enough to crush the evil Sador? How will this peaceful planet be able to stave off an invasion? To find out you'll just have to watch BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS!!A fun film that doesn't pretend to be something it's not (cough*STAR WARS*cough). Just a sappy movie with funny dialog and a lot of action and strange looking aliens.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not cheese. `Flash Gordon' was cheese (and very tasty cheese, too). This film is a kind of imitation cheese. It's made from the same substance that goes into those `cheese' flavoured snacks that have never so much as been in the same room as real cheese in their lives. The substances from which this film was made don't even have names - at least, not English names, although I presume there is a way of describing them in chemical notation.I guess what I am trying to express is that everything here leaves a bitter, inorganic aftertaste. `After' taste, my foot: it makes the very surface of my tongue cringe even as I watch it. I long to be looking at something else. And the score ...! James Horner leapt to prominence as a result of it, and this puzzles me. The indescribably vile music that follows the cowboy character around wherever he goes is like a concentrated dose of factory-made raspberry substitute.No doubt the makers knew that they were making something bad. Does this excuse them? Of course not: if anything it makes their actions worse. Let me, though, knock down one or two of the makeshift defences usually constructed for this type of movie. If is NOT a cheaply made film that nonetheless looks good. As I have intimated several times it looks surpassingly bad. The art direction is terrible. Neither sets nor costumes nor props look like they were worth the effort of constructing - they look deeply ugly, and there is an end of it. The world created is neither interesting nor, in any sense whatsoever, poetic. There is no beauty even behind the scenes TO shine through the lousy production design; so of course none does. I struggle to think of a single redeeming feature. No doubt the actors do their best under trying circumstances, but the same could be said of a man who's just been thrown into the lion's den.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people who were so disappointed in The Phantom Menace, need only look at this movie for explanation. This was billed as SERIOUS competition for Star Wars. Compared to this, anything would have been good. Although released three years earlier, Star Wars' special effects are decades above Battle Beyond the Stars; the characters were likeable, the story made sense, the world was presented as a living place, the villain really was a villain. Battle Beyond the Stars fails on these counts. I remember seeing it just before The Empire Strikes Back was released, and we were all excited because we thought it would be The Empire Strikes Back's Matrix. Unfortunately, we got a movie that was completely forgettable. The only reasons to watch it would be 1) You want to remind yourself that despite George Lucas' shortcomings, his movies really were a step above the times, or 2) you want to see just how far James Cameron has come since his work as art director on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the theaters 20 years ago, and it was every bit as good as I remember it! The special effects are as good at George Lucas and Industrial Light and Magic can do, and that is saying something: for years I thought that no one could approach ILM's work. (I forgot about this one!) The characters were so much fun, the sexual innuendos are a riot, but subtle enough that this movie is fine for kids. (A bit violent!) George Peppard is so right as Cowboy (a space trucker!) and Robert Vaughn's nasty mercenary... by the end you actually LIKE him. This is NOT John Boy in space, for one thing, it ISN'T Star Wars. Star Wars was a high fantasy (with MAGIC) this one is more hard science. But it is very fun and hasn't dated at all. It goes on my "I gotta own this one." list.By now you probably know this movie has the same plot as Seven Samurai, The Magnificent Seven, Seven Magnificent Gladiators, and The Three Amigos. A couple points of trivia. Robert Vaughn was asked to repeat his Magnificent Seven role in MS2 , and reminded the producers that his character had been killed in the first film. He does repeat the same role in Battle Beyond The Stars. The FX crew was particularly proud that they built a ship with boobs for Sybil Danning. Although totally predictable, the movie is good natured, has a few laughs, and is an easy way to pass an hour and a half.Roger Corman films are generally just un-polished enough to be great. This is no exception. The "B" movies of today just don't seem to have the audience connection that the older ones do. Maybe the kids of today will look back and say the same thing about this time. If you can remember George Peppard, Sybil Danning, and Robert Vaughn, you just might enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage to The Seven Samarai</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Seven Samurai is one of the greatest films ever made. It tells the story of seven warriors who take up the cause of protecting a village from bandits. This story has been adapted many times into movies that include the Magnificent Seven and A Bugs Life. Roger Corman so admired this movie that he decided to create a Sci Fi tribute to it, even adapting the directors name as a planet name. In keeping to this theme and in the same style as Battle Beyond the Stars, I have suggestions for additional movie tributes that Roger Corman may want to consider:1. A tribute to the Godfather, wherein a character named Michael (played by Leo DeCaprio) drops a pizza on the ground and comments for an hour about the mess it makes.2. A tribute to Gone with the Wind, with Cindy Lauper as Scarlett trying to keep her home together as the neighbors develop severe gas problems.3. Richard Thomas as Citizen Cane, about a washed-up TV actor who travels to a small east-asian country, does something stupid, and gets the title treatment, forms a media empire on the Internet, builds a giant mansion with breasts, and dies with the words "Good night Mary Ellen" on his lips. Sometimes you wish directors had the right of first refusal on tributes to their work. I'm sure this one would not have made it far?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa Meets Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) ** 1/2 (out of 4)Part homage to Akira Kurosawa and part rip-off of STAR WARS, this "B" movie from producer Roger Corman benefits greatly from the screenplay of John Sayles and the special effects work of James Cameron (among others). Obviously set in space, a poor village comes under attack from the evil Sador (John Saxon) who is threatening to blow up their homes. The group send out Shad (Richard Thomas) to try and find some mercenaries to protect them and come home with seven (including Robert Vaughn). I can only imagine that Roger Corman requested a STAR WARS rip and then writer Sayles came back with a little more "twist" and that's how the Kurosawa/SEVEN SAMURAI stuff came into play. I think Sayles screenplay is a major blessing but at the same time I think it was partly a curse. I say curse because the biggest problem with this film is the fact that it runs way too long at 102-minutes so I think a little less story might have actually been a good things because there's no question that things drag along during the middle portion. With that said, the film being above average can also be credited to Sayles who at least tried to spice things up with all the influences. The added bits of SEVEN SAMURAI (or THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN if you will) certainly make for some fun moments including the scenes where they're all gathered up. Apparently the budget of this was $2-million, which was a pretty big sum for the studio but it's easy to see it on the screen. I was really amazed at how terrific the film looked and it really didn't come as a shock when after it was over I realized that Cameron had worked on the miniatures, the effects and a few other pieces. During the film I thought it must have been his work because the stuff looks terrific. I'm not sure how they managed to do all of this stuff on such a small budget but kudos to everyone. This looks better than most larger budgeted studio films. The performances are what you'd expect from a movie like this meaning they range from bad to someone just picking up a check. BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS isn't going to appeal to everyone but fans of "B" sci-fi should have a good time with it.</fullReview>

Sador threatens the people of Akira with his 'Stellar Convertor' which sends shivers down their spines, the people of Akira put it to a vote &amp; a young farmer named Shad (Richard Thomas) is charged with piloting a spaceship to find &amp; gather up as many warriors as he can to help them fight Sador &amp; his evil minions. Shad meets all sorts of lifeforms on his journey &amp; manages to convince them to join him &amp; fight Sador but they all have their own reasons for doing so, can this untrained &amp; unprepared group of strangers take on the fearsome might &amp; power of Sador &amp; win?Directed by Jimmy T. Murakami along with an uncredited Roger Corman who also produced it Battle Beyond the Stars is low budget rip-off master Roger Corman's attempt to cash-on on the huge success of Star Wars (1977) &amp; the two films share many similarities, the only problem is that while Star wars is a true sci-fi classic with great effects, exhilarating set-pieces &amp; character's you care about Battle Beyond the Stars is the polar opposite. The script is an outer space futuristic reworking of The Magnificent Seven (1960) which itself was a reworking of The Seven Samurai (1954) &amp; there are various references &amp; direct parallels between the three films, however Battle Beyond the Stars never really comes across as anything more than a cheap &amp; bland Star Wars rip-off because that's what it is despite it's prestigious inspirations. A lot of the Star wars clichés are here, a young farmer who has to set out on a great quest &amp; fight an evil empire, the huge ship &amp; the planet destroying weapon that must be defeated, the evil leader &amp; his idiot henchmen, a bit of a love interest &amp; a likable cowboy style hero who gets caught up in things, a climactic dogfight in space at the end &amp; the similarities don't stop at conceptual themes as the whole look &amp; feel of Battle Beyond the Stars is that of wanting to be Star Wars. At just over 100 minutes this drags, I never cared for anyone, the character's reasons for fighting are flimsy &amp; forgettable while it's completely predictable as well. Throughly routine &amp; boring Battle Bayond the Stars is a film that some seem to like but don't count me in that group.The special effect sequences are reasonable considering the budget but they are dull &amp; unexciting, the dogfights are hard to follow &amp; understand as everyone keeps missing everyone else for no apparent reason. Some of the ship designs are quite cool &amp; unusual but that's hardly a saving grace. Some of the aliens look strange &amp; have some unusual powers like the Kevlar communicating with each other using temperature &amp; the collective consciousness of the Nestor but it all amounts to little in the end.With a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 this looks pretty good but it's just so lifeless &amp; boring with dull set-pieces that I couldn't get into it at all. Footage from Battle Beyond the Stars has been edited into various other films like Astron Belt (1983), Space Raiders (1983), Not of this Earth (1988), Starquest II (1996) &amp; Star Portal (1997) while Wizards of the Lost Kingdom (1985) reused the entire score. The acting is as dull as the rest of the film, Richard Thomas in particular gives a very wooden performance.Battle Beyond the Stars is your basic Star wars rip-off with slightly better special effects &amp; a slightly better cast than one might expect but the boring set-pieces &amp; dull story means I won't be in any hurry to ever see it again. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Space version of "Shichinin no samurai". Blah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has got some of the worst storytelling I've experienced in a long while. Scene's rapidly follow each other, without often feeling an obvious connection. It's a very disjointed movie, in which some sequence, mostly the action one's, happen without no apparent reason. It makes this one of those annoying hard to watch movies, that is not because of its intelligence or well layered and constructed story. Unfortunately the movie gets only worse as it progresses.It uses the exact same plot and characters as Akira Kurosawa's "Shichinin no samurai", which is of course fine on its own, since it's also something "The Magnificent Seven" did but it also heavily 'borrows' from other movies such as "Star Wars ", "Superman", "Alien" and the "Star Trek" franchise. In other words every other popular genre piece released before at that time and without any shame. Also especially annoying how the movie uses the same sounds effects as in those previous mentioned movies. For instance, hear Darth Vader's breathing as a door opens...ridicules. It could had worked as this movie was supposed to be a spoof, which it isn't.Yes the movie is supposed to be comical and has humorous moments, characters and dialogs at times. It helps to give the movie a certain camp and cheesy entertaining value.The action is a complete bore within this movie, mostly because halve of the time you don't know what is going on and who is fighting who, plus it's all done extremely formulaic and standard. Nothing spectacular or groundbreaking happens ever in this movie.The special-effects are pretty dodgy looking in the movie (directed by James Cameron by the way). But no, perhaps not as bad as you would expect from a B-movie. Fairly much the same goes for the sets and costumes. Through some of the make-up effects and clothing are hilariously bad. There's a weird bunch of character in this movie!Perhaps the greatest and only real good thing about this movie is the fine and rather well known musical score by James Horner. Guess this movie also was the reason why he got the "Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan" job, which is still one of his best and most appreciated works.Pretty amazing how many well known actors agreed to be in this movie, also especially when considering producer's's Roger Corman's notorious reputation in B and some even Z-grade movies. But in that regard this one perhaps isn't even among his worst movies. Robert Vaughn, George Peppard and Sam Jaffe were no small time actors, although admittedly it's true that their careers were already declining at the time. Jaffe was almost 90 while starring in this movie!The storytelling makes this absolutely one of the worst genre movie you'll ever see! Two big fat thumbs down for this one.2/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>
