		<shortDescription>Black And White And Shades Of Gray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of Barbara Graham, party girl and petty criminal, who was charged, along with two men, in the March, 1953, real life slaying of Mabel Monohan, a wealthy and elderly widow who lived in Burbank, California. Technically, "I Want To Live" is a high quality production. It has excellent B&amp;W photography, superb editing, a jazzy score; and, it features Susan Hayward's Oscar winning performance as Barbara Graham, a young woman portrayed as independent-minded, tough as nails, feisty, defiant, vulnerable, and a good mother.Both at the beginning and at the end of this Robert Wise directed film the viewer is informed that the story is "factual". But the screenplay never delves into the actual "facts" of the murder. We don't learn anything about the victim, her relationships, the crime scene, or any of a thousand important details that must surely have surrounded this high profile case. Instead, the film focuses entirely on Graham, and goes out of its way to portray her as innocent, in the Monohan murder.Even a cursory review of available literature suggests that the film, while "factual" in some respects, is fictional in others. For example, in reality, the police did not capture Graham and her two male friends in a warehouse at night, as the film portrays; they captured the three in a seedy apartment in daytime. The film omits her addiction to heroin. In more than one way, the film presents Graham sympathetically, and as a victim of the criminal justice system. There's an interesting story about the film's producer, and his motivations for making this film the way he did.Nevertheless, I am not convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she was guilty, mainly because I do not have access to the detailed "facts" of the Monohan case. After all these years, the truth regarding the murder has become cloudy, obscure.It is the thick fog surrounding the real life case that makes the film's final thirty minutes so gut-wrenching, as we await Barbara Graham's fate. Suspense is heightened by a deadline-induced outcome that will either be black or white, all or nothing, but certainly not gray. In setting out to portray a woman wrongly accused of murder, the filmmakers have thus created an ending that is amazingly effective."I Want To Live" is a well made Hollywood production with riveting suspense. But keep in mind the film presents only the case for the defense, which may or may not be consistent with the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wise+Heyward=a must.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's begin with the minus side.This is necessarily a one-side movie,because Barbara Graham is deemed innocent whereas nobody knows exactly the truth.And the movie does not help much for that matter:we know little of Graham's life before her arrest:a woman of easy virtue,but this is not enough to convince;her background,her childhood,everything is overshadowed.However,this is a tour de force of a movie.Robert Wise,one of the masters of film noir,was the man who could pull off this harsh story,because he had always been a restrained director,and mainly,mainly,because,he was one of these artists who could make the best of black and white;I will only mention one scene:the arrest:Barbara is holding a soft toy,and she faces a blinding searchlight,while a jazz music is heard.Eerie indeed.Susan Hayward,at her peak,is fabulous.I can't think of another actor or actress who gave such a heart-wrenching,such a harrowing performance as far as the death row is concerned(Sean Penn is her closer contender,in his extraordinary "dead man walking" part).The "preparations" of the gas chamber are detailed with an unbearable accuracy:nothing is spared the audience.Wise was not the first to depictthe capital execution:André Cayatte did it before in "nous sommes tous des assassins"(1952)but he used too many characters and the movie seems today obsolete,and not only because the death penalty was abolished in France in 1981.Then José Giovanni in "deux hommes dans la ville"(1972),and the best French attempt "le pull-over rouge" (Michel Drach,1979) the latter based on a true story like Graham's.This movie remains commendable,the French TV never showed it,that speaks volumes. Two American movies tackled the topic in the nineties:"the last dance"(Sharon Stone being the only asset) and the already mentioned (and much better ) "dead man's walking".Nothing comes close to Wise's and Heyward 's collaboration.Forget your bias and watch these two artists show us what the seventh art can achieve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Susan Hayward's powerful performance as Barbara Graham has been much written about, and it is the single best part of this film. But there are so many other perfectly pitched performances surrounding her as well, mostly by actors relatively unknown even to film buffs, or early turns by actors whose faces, if not names, did find a national audience--Virginia Vincent as Peg (she played the mother in The Hills Have Eyes), Gas chamber guard Dabbs Greer (the Rev. on Little House on the Prairie and Picket Fences), and especially Raymond Bailey who plays the San Quentin warden. His understated forthrightness and humaneness are a far cry from his later manic turn as Mr Drysdale on The Beverly Hillbillies (with the addition of a toupee). Robert Wise handles the execution preparations with a clinicism that turns the stomach more than any posturing would do, bringing the horror of impending death home. And following the clock's second with a moving camera closeup, instead of just cutting to the clock on the wall, done so many times, is craftsmanship of the highest order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the American tragedies because it's a true story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in stark black and white as I think all films of this nature should be, one sees the stark realism unfold of a woman's already messed up and sad life become a pitiful situation of which there isn't a return. One of America's real true tragedies where a woman is used as a pawn by the judicial system so that the State of California can really punish those that should have been and were punished. If it weren't for Barbara Graham's final outcome, the bad guys would still be alive today. If you are like me and love criminology and hate injustice, you must see this picture. Susan Hayward gave the performance of a lifetime and deservedly won the Oscar for best actress. The piece has this blues/jazzy type of music in the background which I think makes the film more realistic because it was the type of music that Barbara Graham loved. Do yourself a favor and see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravado Performance In Intense Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barbara Graham was a known prostitute with criminal associates. In the early 1950s, Graham and two men were accused of and arrested for the brutal murder of elderly Mable Monahan during the course of a robbery. Convicted and sentenced to death in California's gas chamber, Graham protested her innocence to the end--and many considered that she was less a criminal than a victim of circumstance and that she had been railroaded to conviction and execution. The celebrated 1958 film I WANT TO LIVE follows this point of view, presenting Graham as a thoroughly tough gal who in spite of her background was essentially more sinned against than sinner, and the result is an extremely intense, gripping film that shakes its viewers to the core.The film has a stark, realistic look, an excellent script, a pounding jazz score, and a strong supporting cast--but it is Susan Hayward's legendary performance that makes the film work. She gives us a Graham who is half gun moll, half good time girl, and tough as nails all the way through--but who is nonetheless likable, perhaps even admirable in her flat rebellion against a sickeningly hypocritical and repulsively white-bread society. Although Hayward seems slightly artificial in the film's opening scenes, she quickly rises to the challenge of the role and gives an explosive performance as notable for its emotional hysteria as for its touching humanity.As the story moves toward its climax, the detail with which director Wise shows preparations for execution in the gas chamber and the intensity of Hayward's performance add up to one of the most powerful sequences in film history. Ironically, Hayward privately stated that her own research led her to believe that Graham was guilty as sin--and today most people who have studied the case tend to believe that Graham was guilty indeed. But whether the real-life Barbara Graham was innocent or guilty, this is a film that delivers one memorable, jolting, and very, very disturbing ride. Strongly recommended, but not for the faint of heart.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Role That Comes Along Once in a Lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Want to Live was a film from it's inception was guaranteed to create controversy. There are all kinds of opinions about the death penalty and it's application all over the world. Barbara Graham's story, so fresh in the minds of the movie going public in 1958, was going to be a source of controversy.Did she actually kill the widow Monahan? The film cleverly sidesteps that issue in the screenplay. What exactly was Graham's role in the botched robbery? All the people who could actually tell us are dead. Should a woman be subject to capital punishment. Ethel Rosenberg went to the electric chair on less evidence than Graham and for a crime that was not a homicide.But all these questions aside, there is one absolute in this film. Susan Hayward gave a performance that must have been inspired by the angels. From the first half of the film dealing with her early life, the homicide she was charged with until the second half covering her sentence and her attempts to avoid the gas chamber, Hayward will keep you glued to your seat.I can't imagine another actress in this part. She of course was the Best Actress for 1958, but in my lifetime only Hillary Swank in her role in Boys Don't Cry was the Oscar ever conceded before the envelope was opened at the ceremony. EVERYONE knew that both Hayward and Swank were winners going in, that's how good both of them were.Susan Hayward was simply the best at her job. She had a number of great parts in Fifties and a few clinkers at the height of her career. But to get the Oscar for the part that was her signature role, made the ceremonies in 1959 a great occasion.She's got a good cast of supporting players in I Want to Live, Simon Oakland, Theodore Bikel, Wesley Lau, Phillip Coolidge. But it is Hayward's film totally.A part like Barbara Graham given to an actress like Susan Hayward only comes along once or twice in a lifetime. Don't miss this one, however you feel about capital punishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary performance by Susan Hayward.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people recognize Susan Hayward as a great actress but if you ask them in what movie they thought she was remarkable, they'll usually tell you that they can't remember any particular classic in which she played. They'll tell you that they think she is a great actress for all the movies and roles in her career. Let's face it. She never played in a classic. There isn't one movie on AFI's top 100 list that stares her. But if you ask anybody what her best performance was, anybody will answer that it was her role as Barbara Graham in "I want to live". Sure the movie's not a classic. But she totally deserved the best actress Oscar she won for her role in it.Barbara Graham (Hayward) is a tough, wisecracking prostitute. A real party-girl. Even when she gets arrested for murder, she keeps on joking around and p***ing-off the cops. But when she realizes that this thing is going to court and that if she's convicted, she could be executed in the gas-chamber, she doesn't see things the same way anymore. And when she thinks she has found a man that is willing to testify that she was with him on the night of the murder, he gets her to tell him that she was present at the scene of the crime. She tells him all this. But when he is summoned in court, he is the prosecution's witness and he appears to be a cop who has trapped her into telling all the evidence the prosecution needs to convict her.Robert Wise's directing is pretty good but the two things that make this one worth watching are the music and Hayward's performance. John Mandel's choice of the blues for the music is excellent and allows us to hang on with Barbara until her very last second alive. Be forewarned: This one is 100% of a tear-jerker and requires nerves of steel to make it through the whole thing without crying. If you like Hayward, see it at all costs. However, Robert Wise has directed some better ones like "West side story" for example. But still, it's pretty good.</fullReview>

In this True to Live Story, Susan plays, Barbara Graham,(Valley of the Dolls",'67, who loves life, having a good time and also a con-artist who does petty things. However, Barbara gets involved with some so called friends who sort of sell her down the river and her life becomes very complicated and at times very tragic. Susan Hayward holds the picture together with outstanding acting and portrays the horrible facts of life Barbara Graham had to encounter in all kinds of disappointing situations.

		<shortDescription>powerful and unrelenting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Want To Live" is a powerful albeit fictional account of the Barbara Graham case. Graham was accused of murdering a Mrs. Monahan along with two male colleagues during a robbery. In the story, they had her take the rap for the murder, figuring a woman would never be given the death penalty. They figured wrong. Not only did she get it, but we see her get it in agonizing detail at the end of the film.This was tough stuff for 1958. Susan Hayward does a great job, although I have to admit that my favorite performance of hers remains "I'll Cry Tomorrow." Nevertheless, she sinks her teeth into this role. There are different opinions among those posting reviews here about her acting. Granted, Hayward was of her time, and this is not the kind of performance one would see today. She was an overt actress where, for instance, Olivia de Havilland was more subtle. Nevertheless, she's excellent. She's playing Barbara Graham, a prostitute, drinker, and good time girl, and the performance fits that woman's tough character. Could Hayward overdo the histrionics? Sure, but she generally didn't with a good director, and she had one here in Robert Wise.Barbara Graham in real life was on her fourth marriage and apparently involved sexually with her two compatriots - she was in the nude when she was arrested with them at their hotel. She also was a heroin addict. Though the film allows you to believe that she was present during the killing but didn't actually do it, the real Barbra Graham supposedly did confess to the warden of the prison.No matter how you feel about the death penalty, or Barbara Graham's guilt or innocence, this film will have a powerful effect on you. You won't forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This hidden masterpiece seems contemporary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This seems like a documentary film and is so powerful and persuasive that all the viewers would be forced to concentrate on it. Susan Hayward, a Hollywood actor out of Hollywood actors, is never trying to act well, but only "exists" in the film. She really deserved an Oscar of this year. All the other supporting actors are so real that they do not look like actors. Thus this film looks so contemporary that we cannot believe it was shot 50 years ago. Whether the ending is happy or not, such method of filming gives us a strong impression which lasts for a long time. I adore this film, which must be one of the best Robert Wise films, and it is a pity that relatively few people have seen it. I would be most delighted to advise all my friends and acquaintances to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>....and the winner is Susan Hayward for " I Want To Live"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I surely hope someone somewhere can retrieve the great night Susan Hayward won her Oscar...I recall Kim Novak and James Cagney presenting the Oscar with Kim Novak in her fabulous voice asking Mr. Cagney to "hurry up" when he sliced open the envelope, as Cagney saying "And the Winner is Susan Hayward for "I Want To Live". Thunderous applause and Susan Hayward was in fact called back for a curtain call. Has that ever happened before or since? ( It was no easy win for Susan Hayward was competing with Four fine actresses Liz Taylor, Roz Russell, Deborah Kerr and Shirley MacLaine all in well regarded performances)I cannot imagine any actress other than Susan Hayward in this part. Robert Wise expert direction creates enormous tension as we know that Susan's character is going to die in the gas chamber. Susan Hayward, Robert Wise, Producer Walter Wanger, and cinematographer Lionel Linden deserve great applause for their fine work. Filmed at Goldwyn Studio not Susan Hayward's home studio 20th, I always felt this gave her both more freedom to lose some of her famous 'on camera tricks' and experiment more, and also sans Hayward's usual crew she may have felt more vulnerable..whatever Hayward's performance is a wonder and all actors and actresses should study Susan Hayward's fine work in this film.Robert Osborne on TCM praises this performance as one especially noteworthy in the history of female film acting. Ms. Hayward won the New York Film Critics and Golden Globe Awards prior to her great Oscar win. Ms. Hayward died nearly 40 years ago yet Ms. Hayward's work remains topical and powerfully moving. Few could show the agony of a woman the way Ms. Hayward could. Her death at a relatively early age deprived us of many more performances from an Artist noted for brilliant work.</fullReview>

As Susan Hayward lay dying of brain cancer none other than Garbo showed up at Susan Haywad's house to pay respects in person! As did Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck.Walter Wanger's I Want To Live, in black and white, with a great jazz score and expertly directed by Robert Wise and photographed by Lionel Lindon is the peak of Susan Hayward's acting career. As most actresses and a few stars Susan Hayward had well known "tricks" but for this movie Ms. Hayward played this role as naturally as Susan Hayward ever played any role. Susan Hayward dominates this movie and is brilliant in a career noted for great acting. Susan Hayward won the New York Film Critics, National Board of Review, Golden Globe and awards in France and Italy, for her performance in this movie, all leading up to her deserved Oscar win for I Want To Live.

		<shortDescription>A true dramatic showcase for the fabulous Susan Hayward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susan Hayward really knew how to pick a good role. From the intensity of 1947's "Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman", to the gutsiness of 1955's "I'll Cry Tomorrow", to everything in between, Hayward left a legacy of amazing characters. Even when the role was horrid (such as 1967's trash-fest "Valley of the Dolls"), Hayward was a real trooper and made it work. Always one to tackle unusual and, oftentimes, unglamorous roles, Hayward really got a chance to sink her teeth into this one - and received an Oscar for her efforts.In this tough-to-take biopic, Hayward plays Barbara Graham, a party girl who gets in over her head with drug use, prostitution, perjury, and various other illegal acts. As a known "goodtime girl", she has a reputation with the local authorities. One brilliant sequence has the police tracking Barbara across town - apparent fellow neighbors are actually tapped and following her every move. Finally, a supposedly innocent "Babs" gets thrown in the slammer for the brutal murder of an elderly woman. Losing her sense of freedom and any contact with her baby boy, Barbara's life goes from bad (on the street) to worse (in jail). Watching Barbara act-up and defy authority in the prison is actually funny, but what happens next to this wild woman is no laughing matter. Things get as bad as they possibly can when Barbara realizes that she may have to face the gas chamber.Hayward goes all out in portraying this fascinating character and is totally over-the-top, but completely on target, right up until the very end - and what an ending it is! It'll send shivers up your spine, and the images will linger in your head long after the show is over. The dark, moody photography is top-notch, although the rambunctious jazz score wears out its welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can only assume people not liking this film are either really young or in denial of it's impact...possibly both. Hayward is one of the greats...especially at playing real people, as in I'll Cry Tomorrow and With A Song In My Heart. Long before women were allowing themselves to look and act like this on screen, Hayward was more than willing to. Her dt's scene in I'll Cry Tomorrow has only been done as well by Diana Ross in Lady Sings The Blues. The gas chamber scene in I Want To Live is still one of the most unnerving scenes ever. No one really knows if Barbara Graham was guilty or innocent. It is strange, however, that many people who were screaming for her death...at the end...were convinced she was innocent and had been railroaded by the courts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good cinema has rhythm. Most classic cinema moves to the flow of orchestral film music, but for a certain kind of picture in the mid-50s to mid-60s, the images would skip to the modish sounds of bossa nova and free jazz. This isn't the most melodic or listenable music ever created, and often it was used simply to be hip and different. However, I Want to Live! has a jazz score that runs right through the picture, regulating its pace and complementing its relentlessly gritty tone.The picture opens in a jazz club, in a short sequence which has nothing to do with the plot, but sets the scene. From this point on, a musical feel pervades the picture. The director is Robert Wise, an exceptional but seldom recognised filmmaker whose pictures had always been sensitive to rhythm, and would later win Oscars for directing musicals. Wise was an expert when it came to matching music, image and performance. In an early scene with a party aboard a boat, we hear some staccato Latin American music. The frame seems excessively crowded and filled with movement, while the lighting gives numerous shades of grey. The whole thing appears natural, but also looks precisely choreographed to the rhythm of the scene. At other times we get a slow, moody melody, and here the tones are stark and the movements lethargic. Even in scenes without music, there is a complex and eerie sound design of closing doors, photographers' flashes, telephone rings and suchlike, not to mention the sharp vocal delivery. This rhythmic approach, which is always present but never seems overdone, adds character to each moment, gives abrupt changes between scenes, and makes the whole picture fast-moving. Some commentators on Wise's career try to draw a line separating films like this from West Side Story, Sound of Music and so forth, but Wise's style and intention is consistent.But the central pillar in I Want to Live! is of course the captivating performance of Susan Hayward. Hayward's acting is the size of a house, and she absolutely dominates the screen. However it is the littlest things that make this performance work ? a tiny flash of her eyes or shrug of her shoulders. These small things are what bring out our sympathy for the character, while it is the powerhouse acting that gives the picture its passion. So overpowering is Hayward, that every other performance becomes somewhat forgettable. Except that is for Simon Oakland, who is rather impressive in his film debut, with a role which is complex because there is often a discrepancy between what his character says and what he is really feeling. Lou Krugman is also very memorable in his small role as Jack Santo, simply because he comes across as genuinely menacing and sadistic. No-one else really stands out, but at least no-one is conspicuously bad, and besides it helps to have a supporting cast that is a little bland because you would not want anyone to upstage Hayward.We will never know for sure, but it is now widely agreed that the real Barbara Graham was in fact guilty, and while this movie never openly commits itself either way, it makes every allowance for the likelihood of her being innocent. However, the point of I Want to Live! was probably not to exonerate Barbara Graham, it was instead to demonstrate the horror and inhumanity of the death penalty. What matters is that we are convinced of the humanity of the character, and the desolateness of the situation. The ins and outs of the case are never really clearly defined, whereas the tone and force of the picture most definitely is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hayward's Oscar winning performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt that some of this film seems dated today but if you stick with it the last 30 minutes should have some sort of an effect on most viewers and it's hard to forget the performance that took home the almighty Oscar. Based on a true story (To some degree) about Barbara Graham (Susan Hayward) who we first see as a prostitute and a check forger who has had numerous run-ins with the law. She tries to change her life and gets married to Henry (Wesley Lau) and they end up having a son but shortly after a year Henry turns out to be a heroin addict and Barbara leaves him. She gets mixed up with two lowlifes and gets arrested and while in jail she learns that she is being tried for the murder of an elderly woman.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Barbara tells everyone that she is innocent but during her trial the press uses her to sell papers and print horrible things including reporter Ed Montgomery (Simon Oakland) but once the trial is over and the appeals begin he gets involved in the case and starts to write positive things about her. The prison psychiatrist Carl Palmberg (Theodore Bikel) studies her and he concludes that she didn't commit the murder but the endless appeals keep getting turned down until Barbara becomes the first woman to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin.This film is directed by the great Robert Wise who actually witnessed a real execution to prepare him for this project and we can see through his direction that it affected him tremendously. While some say that the film has to many supporting characters and takes to long for Hayward to get to jail I thought that the film was just giving the viewer the opportunity to see what kind of person Barbara is. This film was made when method acting was at full steam and critics of Hayward will point out how over the top her performance is but I think she does a terrific job of making this role her own and leaving an indelible mark. At first it was difficult to care for this character but what was very interesting was how Barbara changed from the first half of the film to the second. Barbara can hold her own and battle anyone but once she gets locked up she is forced to trust people and rely on others for help in her cause. Under Wise's direction there is incredible tension built up as Hayward waits for a reprieve and then has to make her final walk to her ultimate execution. I'm not sure if I would call this a great film but it is one that is extremely well made and Hayward delivers the performance of her career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful performance and imagery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capital Punishment was, is, and probably always will be immensely controversial. "I Want to Live" offers an argument against the practice, approaching the issue with a fervently emotional message.Susan Hayward (perhaps the finest work of her career) portrays the real-life convicted murderess Barbara Graham with urgency, strength, and sensitivity. We follow the story of Graham as she gets in trouble with the law repeatedly. Eventually, she is involved with a couple of thugs; a woman is murdered, and the three are accused. Which one actually killed the woman is uncertain. The movie provides information from Graham's trial (after she is implicated by the other two), but cleverly skirts the issue of guilt, and leaves the viewer to come to one's own opinion about this.Whatever your view on capital punishment is, and whether or not you believe Graham was the actual killer should not skew your opinion of the movie; artistically, it's a gem. It is guaranteed to get you thinking about the issue of capital punishment, and some of the questions that are inherent in the arguments for and against it.The final sequence of the movie is poignant and eloquent in depicting the preparations for a gas chamber execution. These images are haunting and will stay with you long after you see the movie.This movie is artistic and masterfully done; but one must set aside preconceived opinions on the issue (pro OR con) to fully appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As it was once reported, I can echo, that Susan Hayward gives the finest performance in a career noted for brilliant work. The fine work of the great Director Robert Wise is seen here and together Hayward and Wise created one of the screen's greatest drama's and a searing indictment of Capital Punishment. The final scenes in the Jail as Miss Hayward's character Barbara Graham awaits execution are harrowing, and Miss Hayward's control in these scenes is so great that she gets more sympathy than any other actress ever could. I cannot think of anyone who could have done this role as well as Susan Hayward, and it is said Walter Wanger waited a few years to get Susan Hayward to free up her schedule to star in this filmMiss Hayward loses some of the great tricks she always used in her work and is more natural here. A truly landmark performance. Bravo Susan Hayward. Bravo Robert Wise and Bravo Walter Wanger. RIP</fullReview>

Always a great actress, she finally took home gold playing a not-always likable party girl who gets mixed up on the road to perdition.A 7 out of 10. Best performance = Susan Hayward. Simon Oakland always adds a touch of authentic flavoring American sweating style. Good cinematography and for a 50's flick, fairly realistic in the right ways and the ending is incredible.

		<fullReview>Whether Barbara Graham was really framed for murder or not is never really the point of this melodramatic look at a woman on death row, played to the hilt by SUSAN HAYWARD in one of her gutsiest performances. The main point seems to be showing us what a devastating time any prisoner on death row has while waiting for that execution to proceed. And in this, Robert Wise succeeds with his powerful film about the accused murderess Barbara Graham.That Hayward can actually make us feel sympathy for her character when she's depicted as a tough-talking, bitter dame who takes no nonsense from anyone (even those trying to help her), is a credit her talent as an actress who never tries to soften her portrayal of the party girl paying for a life of petty crimes that may include murder.SIMON OAKLAND as a reporter who begins to have doubts about her guilt, is excellent. There's an almost documentary feel to the whole film and this is partly due to the uniform excellence of the entire cast, all of whom come across as real people. But the main credit must be given to director Robert Wise who does a fine job with some truly harsh material.The jazz score background effectively balances the look and feel of the story. Well worth watching as an inside look at how justice sometimes works, while raising questions in the viewer's mind as to Graham's guilt or innocence.</fullReview>

Susan Hayward gives a tour-de-force performance as the tough prostitute (for which she won an Oscar) who insists that, if anything, she was no more than a petty criminal framed for murder.Robert Wise's direction (nominated for an Oscar) included emphasis on minute detail, most noteworthy being the compelling way in which the particulars of the execution are shown. After viewing this film, viewers on either side of the death penalty issue will search their souls for answers to how they truly feel about a human being's "legal murder", regardless of innocence or guilt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your liking or not liking, or even your understanding of this film depends on where you see it.In the version shown in England, the opening scene establishing the fact that Barbara Graham was a prostitute lasts for almost seven minutes. It shows Barbara getting dressed. It shows Barbara pulling the sheet off her John and heartily laughing at him as he tries to cover himself. And it shows her putting her fee into her handbag.The closing scenes of the film merely show the cyanide pellets being placed in the bucket, then a few quick intercuts of white mist enveloping Barbara, and the reporter leaving the building: with everything over and done with in five minutes flat.If you see this film in America, however, you will see the reverse of this. The opening scene lasts barely a minute. No laughing at John, no fees put into handbags. You would be hard pressed to puzzle out what Barbara was up to. Yet the ending, showing every single awful detail of what transpires lasts for over twenty five sickening minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that struck me with this film was just how real it seemed to be, be it the characters being acted out so deftly, or the whole composition of director Robert Wise's work. It's a film that somehow manages to put you in there with its central character so that you feel all the emotions that Barbara Graham feels. It really is a first rate piece of work.The plot centering around the murky life of Barbara Graham and the subsequent trial that would culminate in her execution is decidedly dark and troubling. Broken home upbringing (merely alluded to here) right through drugs, perjury, prostitution, shilling, robbery and ultimately murder? It's all in there, yet why does the viewer feel complete sympathy with Barbara? Could it be that she is portrayed as a victim of society? Or merely that it's just so shattering watching this woman get knocked from pillar to post at every turn? Either way the film is a triumph as a character piece, a cracking look at the destruction of one woman's hopes and dreams, a murky look at the impact the press can have on such trials, turning them into national parties and the accused into stars.As a criminal biography it is handled adroitly, I only hesitate to give it the maximum 10/10 because the film hints at Barbara actually being innocent, but nothing is offered up as substantial to put meat on the bones of such a hint other than Barbara's own repeated claims of innocence, it's just a daft slant for the film to hint at, and any research into the real life case leads you to her being guilty anyway.It's a minor complaint, hell most of my favourite films of all time are historically twisted, and so many great things are right with the film it would be churlish of me to not love this film. Susan Hayward gives what I can only say is a faultless display, I really can't find fault with her portrayal of Barbara Graham, her feisty shows are a delight, whilst her scenes of heartbreak and bewilderment look as genuine as anything I have witnessed for some time. Oh yes the academy got this one right, a long overdue Oscar for Susan Hayward, I'm sure it must have been impossible to ignore such a layered masterclass back in 1958. The rest of the cast are splendid, and I would be doing a disservice if I didn't mention the wonderful jazz arrangement from Johnny Mandel (well done Gerry Mulligan) that tones in perfect with the film.The film looks and sounds fantastic, from the first reel right through to the last where this viewer was holding his breath to the point where I felt I had been in a fight. Oh yes, this film is special. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a major tribute to the divine Susan Hayward. Any actress who can take an amoral convicted murderess and arouse sympathy has accomplished something significant. It is a shame that she made so many movies, but there doesn't seem to be a single masterpiece that stands out today. Hayward is perfect 10 out of 10.On other fronts, the movie is very dated, much more so than many 50's era pieces. Perhaps the black and white, dull surroundings, and frankly loud music add to the atmosphere. While the rest of the cast is credible, none of the others are very memorable.This is mostly a liberal Hollywood propaganda film against the death penalty. Looking at what little evidence is discussed in the film, it seems likely that Barbara Graham was present as an accessory but did not commit the murder.

She is released to probation and joins two con-men. She tries for a family but her husband turns into a drug addict. The cops follow her and arrests her, Emmett Perkins and John R. Santo. She's arrested for passing bad cheques among many charges. The men throw her under the bus and claim she's the murderer. She becomes a media sensation and maintains her innocence throughout.Hayward is terrific as a ballsy broad. She's not an innocent naive character although the movie portray her as innocent of the murder. The media sensation adds another layer to the movie. It is a bit hard to root for the character but Hayward makes the movie work. She gets to do some juicy acting as she prepares to be executed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story attacks a very difficult subject matter, and specific honor goes to the writer who addresses a woman's digressions, and pays the ultimate price for them.Hayward is so very believable as party girl Barbara Graham, a down-at-heel party girl who makes many mistakes in her life.Initially, her criminal violations are minor, the acts of an alcoholic (who needed therapy, but none was available in the 1940's.). The problems escalate during her third marriage, she is physically abused and finds alcohol to be the sole escape.These issues are still a problem today. Women and young teen mothers are not given psychological support, and ramifications are horrendous. Just look at the case of Casey Anthony, a child murderer who felt she had no options, never saw a physician, and will probably face the death penalty.I am not empathizing with murder, but in this day and age, insurance must cover mental illness, as we can verify this every evening when we see the horrific tragedies in families in America. Highly recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite impressed with this film, which was made by a great director Robert Wise, who has also given us films like "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "West Side Story," in 1958. This film is still relevant and timely as our federal and state governments here in the USA still practice the savage heinous human rights violation that is the death penalty. When one sees this film, one thinks of how many people are hypocrtical president executed while he was in office as the governor of Texas. One of which included a born-again Christian, whose crimes were admittedly heinous though she did repent before the government murdered her themselves, named Karla Fay Tucker. This film also proves that we have not come very far as a society in spite of the sincere efforts of many people. Susan Hayward deserved the Oscar for this. Some of the film's scenes may seem melodramatic by today's standards, but Wise brilliantly captured the emotions of the wrongly condemned. This is made more absorbing because it is based on a true story. The film also includes a brilliant jazz score, and a fine supporting cast. I hope every governor in America has a chance to see this film before they make the ultimate judgment call. We still have a long, long way to go folks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's something about the use of words that always makes me stop and think, and that's precisely what happened as I read the opening sequence attributed to newspaper reporter Edward S. Montgomery. The story of Barbara Graham was presented as 'factual', which to me implied right out of the gate that it might not necessarily be true. Then upon reading other viewers' thoughts about the film, I learned that the real life story of Barbara Graham might have been entirely glossed over for the sake of a sympathetic picture where an innocent woman went to her death as the result of a frame up.Setting aside the actual 'facts' of the Monahan murder, the picture succeeds at the level of a dramatic noir thriller. However I had some trouble adjusting to Susan Hayward's portrayal of petty criminal Barbara Graham. She had a number of emotional tirades that seemed to be entirely over the top, and those imaginary throws of the dice seemed to add an unwelcome comic element to her character. I didn't perceive her performance to be particularly notable, much less an Oscar worthy one. Even the scenes at the finale that hinged on the prospect of a phone call reprieve seemed to lose their impact after the first couple of times, thereby diminishing the suspense factor. Perhaps the real Ms. Graham went to her death with a whimper, but wouldn't it have been great (as long as so many liberties were taken with the story anyway), if she went out like Cagney in "Angels With Dirty Faces", kicking and screaming while proclaiming her innocence right to the last breath.Keep an eye on the scene when the cops flush out the bad guys from the warehouse by calling them out one by one. As Graham cleans herself up in the mirror, the right side of her face is shown to be heavily scratched and her left cheek is clear, but as soon as she turns away to give herself up, the pattern is reversed. I always wonder why such an obvious error isn't caught and corrected by film makers before the final cut is made.The other thing I got a kick out of was the sign in the women's prison cell - 'Stay Healthy, Keep Clean'. Which made me consider, was there another option when you live behind bars?I guess the most intriguing part of the picture for me had to do with the cyanide preparations and the intricacy of checking over all the details to make sure a properly staged death sentence would be carried out. I never actually pictured a gas chamber as being a glass structure that officials could watch while a person was executed. In hindsight, that makes perfect sense given the fact that public executions throughout history were often times given to spectator sport. It was rather jarring to note that after the grim death sentence was carried out in the picture, the reporters left with their car horns honking as if in celebration instead of quiet reflection. It beats me how human behavior is sometimes anything but.</fullReview>

Graham was 31 at the time of her death.Filmed in stark b&amp;w, and masterfully directed by Robert Wise, this picture won actress Susan Hayward an Oscar for "Best Actress".Featuring a moody Jazz score, this is the sort of film that requires the viewer to have nerves of steel, especially during the agonizing moments of its riveting finale.</fullReview>

The preparations and procedures related to capital punishment are even more chilling depicted than those of "In Cold Blood". The camera angles and the jazz score add to the uncomfortable and off-kilter events of this other world that most of us know about and sometimes visit but do not inhabit.

		<shortDescription>Flawed Justice &amp; Capital Punishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Want To Live!" is an incredibly powerful drama about a woman who was found guilty of murder in the early 1950s. The events depicted are claimed to be factual and the convicted murderess is portrayed as the innocent victim of a flawed judicial system which found her guilty because of her lack of credibility as a witness, her previous criminal behaviour and the testimony of other criminals who had their own ulterior motives. The lack of hard evidence against her makes the outcome of the trial seem to be a travesty and this plays into the strong position that this movie takes against the use of capital punishment.Following the failure of her third marriage, Barbara "Bonnie" Graham (Susan Hayward) who'd been involved in petty crime throughout her life, returns to work with one of her previous bosses Emmett Perkins (Philip Coolidge). She's unaware that Perkins and his associates John Santo (Lou Krugman) and Bruce King (James Philbrook) had recently carried out an attempted robbery during which an elderly widow called Mabel Monahan had been pistol-whipped to death. It comes as a great surprise, therefore, when she, Perkins and Santo are arrested by the police and charged with involvement in the old lady's murder.Despite her protestations of innocence, Graham becomes the prime suspect after Perkins, Santo and King all claim that she was responsible for the killing. Perkins and Santo think that if she's convicted, it will reduce their chances of being sentenced to death and King is granted immunity for turning state's evidence. Graham is subsequently found guilty of murder and is sentenced to be executed at San Quentin prison. A whole series of appeals and stays of execution then follow as every effort is made to prevent Graham's sentence from being carried out.Barbara Graham is depicted as a sympathetic character who, as the product of a broken home, had known no other way of life than being involved with the criminal fraternity. Her various convictions provide evidence of her reprehensible lifestyle but her propensity to eschew self-interest to help others (as she does in the circumstances which result in her being found guilty of prostitution and perjury) is also shown as a redeeming quality. Similarly, the circumstances under which she's tricked into incriminating herself by a fellow prison inmate and an undercover police officer are also conveyed as being just as odious as the way in which she was betrayed by her criminal associates.Judged purely on its merits as a drama, "I Want To Live!" is top class and Robert Wise's direction is terrific as so much pace is injected into the early part of the movie and then later it slows down very effectively as the tension intensifies when the story's conclusion approaches. Susan Hayward's Oscar-winning performance is also integral to the film's success because so much of the focus is on her throughout. Her ability to capture her character's range of emotions and behaviours at different stages of her life is flawless and a considerable achievement by any standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may take nerves of steel and a calloused heart to sit through this hard hitting drama directed by Robert Wise. Based on a sad, but true story. Susan Hayward won the Oscar for her portrayal of Barbara Graham, a woman with a troubled past of being involved with various petty crimes and known for frequenting seedy bars and dives. Stupidly she got too close to a couple of men that finger her for being part of a robbery-murder. Possibly payback for thinking she ratted on them to the police. The brash and brazen Graham is pretty well screwed and tattooed; indicted, and railroaded to conviction leading to her sentencing to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin. All along, she claimed she didn't do it; her reputation foreshadowing her fate. Several scenes somehow got by the straight-laced censors of the time. Filmed in dramatic black and white. At times Hayward can be accused of over-acting, but she did win the Oscar for giving the role her all. Even if her character appeared to be a woman of loose morals and maybe just a victim of bad luck...you can't help but feel sorry for her. Graham was a tough woman and wasn't afraid to tell you so.

		<fullReview>I want to like this movie! But I just can't. Bob Wise is a good director, and Susan Hayward is a good actress. Simon Oakland's not a bad actor either, although this movie gave him basically no chance to show it. The story is reasonably compelling, giving us not too much time to think about its contrivances at least until the final reel comes on. It has a dark ending that feels true to life. So why do I feel cheated? The film starts out amazingly well. The way that Wise shot the seedy nightclubs and the jazz music is wonderful. Hayward's bad girl is sexy but believable. The style and feel of it in these early parts is similar to Wise's good noir "Odds Against Tomorrow." But the movie starts to unravel as soon as it becomes apparent that it's actually more of a prison drama than a crime drama. And it's ultimately buried by its insufferable sense of moral and ethical righteousness. How much would it matter in the end if Hayward's character is or is not guilty of the crime? Should she be executed? This is not a question the film asks. In fact Hayward's guilt is never in doubt, which makes the film feel preachy and melodramatic.It's a two hankie picture folks, old school and only pretending to be reasonably sophisticated. It plays to the audience's sympathy in ways that become almost grotesque, parading around the character's infant child like a totem of its own heavy righteousness. Oakland's character is a mere facilitator of the plot and the hints that there might be some fire or drama in his relationship with the Hayward character are not followed through on. The movie has conviction all right, but too much of it. It's hard to get an interesting idea out of a movie that already has such a specific agenda. It's a "message picture" in the worst possible way, and it leaves no room for ambiguity or dissent.</fullReview>

This film supported my belief only during the final moments that illustrated very precisely how to prepare a gas chamber for a death sentence. Fascinating, but looks like a decent way to go vs Chemo/Radiation for years.I am not a fan of Hayward and her histrionic performance did not lend well to portraying an innocent woman. The incessant cacophony of avant garde jazz only distracted from the capture of a fallen woman who went way astray in life. I know there are innocents in prison, on death row, etc., but this one-sided operation annoyed me more than instigate sympathy.I cannot recommend this film due to the poor performance of Hayward who supposedly was not a heroin addict but surely acted like one. Too many elements of the film were incongruous. With the strong emphasis on how this is based on actual facts, letters, discussions by a newspaper sensationalist headliner only debased the content vs enhance.If you are on the fence about the Death Penaly watch the three films aforementioned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film starred by Susan Hayward is just an invitation to see it and much more if it is directed by Robert Wise. "I want to live" is the case of a real story shown incompletely. Barbara Graham (Hayward) was what we call a "happy" woman ready to go to parties, dancing, drinking and enjoying her life. She was a woman of doubtful ethics always involved in dirty businesses, and several times punished by the law. The film shows all this well, but not the fact for the one she is sentenced to capital execution. At this point one has to imagine or to guess whether she really participated in the murder of another woman. This question still remains because the film never answered to it. Another characteristic of the film is that Wise shows in details how the gas camera execution is prepared and how it is carried out. Moreover, her execution was a real torture since it was delayed several times. These scenes are certainly tough for any cinema spectator. One may suppose that she was really guilty but definitely not for such a sentence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good people are always so sure they're right": Barbara Graham's last words June 3, 1955</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** With the possible exception of Caryl Chessman no other death row inmate in the US penal system put the death penalty on trial more then convicted murderess and party girl Barbara Graham played with almost religious conviction by actress Susan Hayward who's performance won her, as best actress of 1958,the Academy Award. What I feel hurts the movie "I Want to Live" is the main reason for it being made by focusing in on the trials and tribulations of Barbara Graham and completely overlooking her and her cohorts' petty criminals Emmett Perkins and Jack Santo, Philip Coolidge &amp; Lou Krugman, victim 63 year-old and crippled Mabel Monahan. Who was the victim of a home invasion and brutal murder where her head was so viciously smashed in that it looked like it was run over by an 18 wheeler truck.Being picked up by the L.A police Barbara Graham is totally unaware for what she's being accused of. When told at the police station that it's for the murder of Mabel Monahan it finally hits her that she's facing something a lot more serious then what she's used to being busted for; prostitution petty theft and bouncing bad checks. The film attempts to prove that Barbara was railroaded into the San Quentin gas chamber by one her unsavory friends Bruce King, James Philbrook. King made a deal with the D.A to save his own neck by fingering her as Mrs. Monahans killer as well as undercover cop Matthaws, Joe De Santis, who pretended to provide her with an alibi. This in order to get her to admit, which Babara claimed she that didn't do up to her dying breath, out of sheer fright and desperation that she was at the murder scene and thus actual killer of Mrs.Monahan. Not Perkins and Santo or even the unedited co-conspirator Bruce King.Besides the very obvious slant in the movie in favor of the late Barbara Graham it still is a powerful statement even now some 50 years later against the death penalty.That within ten years after it's release it had been all but totally eliminated in the United States with the last execution, until it was reinstated in 1976, taking place in 1967. It was Susan Haywards both touching and sensitive performance that made you completely come over to Barbara's side. Feeling that she could not have possibly committed such a brutal crime since her record showed not the slightest bit of violence in any of the previous crimes she was charged or convicted of.Concentrating mostly on the last 24 hours of Barbara Graham's life, June 2/3, 1955, "I Want to Live" really grabs it's audience by the gut. As were shown just how step by step a convicted convict is prepared to go to his, or in this case her, final reward by being executed or gassed to death by the state of California in its notorious San Quentin gas chamber. The facts that the movie does bring out is that Barbara despite her background as a career criminal wasn't capable of murdering, much less physically harming, anybody. Which we were show by the diagnosis from prison psychoanalyst Carl C.C Plamberg, Theodore Bikel, as well as the San Francisco newspaper reporter Ed Montgomery, Simon Oakland. Montgomery covered her trial and later became Barbars biggest supporter when he realized, after at first being for her conviction and execution, that she was totally innocent. It was his news articles of her trial and conviction as well as the events leading up to her execution that are the bases of the movies screenplay.Was Barbara Graham innocent of the brutal March 9,1953 murder of the frail and helpless Mabel Monahan? Was she implicated by her fellow crooks Bruce King, who got off Scot-free, and Emmett Pirkens &amp; Jack Santo, who were both gassed together with her, in order to save themselves. Where at the same time feeling that Barbara by being both a woman and single mother would save her, unlike themselves, from a trip to the gas chamber? Did undercover policeman Al Matthews take advantage of a hysterical and desperate woman by getting her to admit, without her knowledge that she was being taped, to a crime that she didn't commit? We'll probably never know if Barbara Graham was guilty or innocent of murder. One thing that the film "I Want to Live" did bring out with total clarity was in showing its audience just how brutal and barbaric both mentally as well as physically the death penalty really is. Which by using it we can never really consider ourselves to be a both civilized and caring, even for the worse of us, society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does the Empress Have No Clothes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to what many have said, I believe that Susan Hayward's performance in this movie is way over the top in the sense of over-acting. For me this detracts from the movie. She certainly is effective at times in portraying a tough, passionate character, but I wouldn't call it a realistic portrayal. Often, her melodramatic outbursts are unintentionally funny.I also resent the way the movie strongly suggests that her character was innocent of murder, since the known facts seem to be present a much more uncertain case. Granted, movie-makers should have some license to present things as they see fit, but they should also be called on the carpet when their interpretations are questionable.The movie does contain some well-done elements, such as the frenetic, jazzy score, and the suggestiveness of the sleazy side of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hayward's Oscar Win Is Not Her Best Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I WANT TO LIVE! is a highly fictionalized account of the life of crime and the death in San Quentin's gas chamber of Barbara Graham. A petty thief and prostitute for most of her life, Graham sealed her fate by taking part in a robbery that went bad and the victim ended up dead.In real life, the evidence against Graham was pretty clear; the film casts several shadows of doubt and implies that she was railroaded, an unnecessary device insofar as the truth was just as compelling, particularly the numerous last minute stays of half an hour at a time.Barbara Graham obviously was a meaty role for any actress, and it won Susan Hayward her only Oscar after laboring in Hollywood for more than twenty years. Only problem: it is neither her best role nor her best performance. The whitewashing of the character of Graham weakens the film, and Robert Wise uncharacteristically lets Hayward overact all over the place; the end result is more Hollywood than San Quentin.Now, I've never thought Hayward was a great actress, but she was by no means incapable of an Oscar-worthy performance; it's just that this wasn't it. She was nominated for three Oscars for playing real-life people, and I just wish she could have won for her Lillian Roth in I'LL CRY TOMORROW or, even better, her Jane Froman in WITH A SONG IN MY HEART, which I have always thought was her best performance even though she did not do her own singing (Froman did the vocals). In fact, watching I WANT TO LIVE! the other night, it struck me that Ida Lupino would have been a much better choice for the role: she was just a few months younger than Hayward and the resemblance between the two was more than a passing one, and I think Lupino had the necessary chops to play the part without the mechanics showing. When I was in acting school one of the things I heard constantly when working on scenes was "STOP ACTING!", a phrase which stems from a piece of advice to young actors from the great Spencer Tracy: "Never let them (the audience) catch you at it." The one thing the film does have is the unbearable tension as the clock ticks away for Graham, with several last-minute stays, and the final scene in the gas chamber is more harrowing than the death chamber scene more than a generation later in DEAD MAN WALKING. DMW is a great film but the lethal injection is harder to make horrifying than the gas chamber, particularly in light of World War II.Interestingly, the two films together do make a cogent argument against the death penalty. Punishment and revenge are not the same thing, and a civilized society has to ask itself the question: if we as a people put criminals to death are we not lowering ourselves to their level? I wish I liked this movie better. Wise was a great director, and Hayward worked her shapely behind off in this role. But in the end she tried too hard and for some reason Wise did not rein her in. Hayward proved in WITH A SONG IN MY HEART that she was capable of underplaying for effect; Wise should have put that talent to better use here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Want to Live- Susan Hayward's Compensation Award ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susan Hayward finally won the academy award for her 1958 gritty performance in "I Want to Live!" Who can forget her death scene as convicted murderess Barbara Grahame? Yet with it all, this Oscar was basically the compensation award given to Hayward for losing 3 years before in the best performance that she ever, ever gave as Lillian Roth in "I'll Cry Tomorrow." No one can tell me that she was better in 'Live.' Yes, she was once again vulnerable, but 'Tomorrow' was her true grit all the way.The film itself is shown through the eyes of Grahame's defense. Was she really a victim of circumstance?The real true performances for best actress of 1958 were for Deborah Kerr's "Separate Tables," and Shirley MacLaine's "Some Came Running."Hayward basically succeeded as an actress because she was so good at conveying the idea of a vulnerable, emotionally unbalanced woman in so many of her films. "I Want to Live!" was no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bummer movie about a bad situation (2nd Edition)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I want to deal with the fact that this review was deleted by IMDb due to some sort of abuse complaint: I am going to resubmit my comment, And I will try to edit this a little. But as I feel strongly about what I originally said about this film, I need to make a couple of points about my review: First off, I stand by most of my first "edition" of my comment for this film. Second, I think I have the right to comment on this film and my feelings about it, and my personal beliefs about the legal system, which this film is about.Please consider that in this case that complaint ought to be made to the producers of this film, as this film says basically the same thing I said in my original review about the situation.I Want to Live is certainly an offensive film to certain kinds of people: A Lot of people have said that this is a "Hollywood Attempt" to re-write history, sort of like what Stone did with the film "JFK."In my reviews I like to deal with the honesty of films. THIS is an honest film, and is important as making a statement against something that MAY have happened: The possibility of the State of California executing an innocent person.Lots of effort went into this film and the telling of this story in this way: And we have to ask WHY would Hollywood use such resources to tell such a story, unless someone really believed Barbara Graham had been given the business end? By her alleged accomplices, by her husband, by the press and mostly by the LA Police? This film shows certain methods of how the police elicit "confessions"- And from experience, I have to say, and still say, regardless of anyone's personal feelings, that this portrayal is SPOT-ON. I say this not to offer offence, but to state that in fact this is what happens in the Legal System, when ethics is not more highly regarded. Perhaps today, Graham would have had a better ability to defend herself. And this is a film chiefly about Ethics. IN THIS FILM the prosecutors are shown to be be quite unethical.The purpose of this comment however, is not to claim that Graham was in fact innocent, but to consider this film.Now I am going to revise this paragraph which I think was taken the wrong way by somebody: This film shows the viewer the POSSIBILITY that police departments may have used any dirty trick in any dirty book... Possibly planting Shills in the general population of a Jail just to be able to use duplicity and coercion and other tactics to get someone to "admit" to a crime. This film causes the viewer to consider: In relation to more recent events, were tactics like this attempted to be used in a certain famous trail roughly 10 years ago? People do not realize that at any given time of any given day anything they say WILL be recorded in some way and used against them later, regardless of how intended the speech. And according to this film, Graham was pretty slow on the realisation of this fact. But also, this film accurately depicts the frustration and desperation of a person in such a situation as Graham.Was Barbara Graham badgered into "confessing" that she was with the men who performed the crime? IN THE FILM, the fact of coercion did not even enter in to it: All that mattered is the so-called "Confession" In that film and in real life, the jury appears to have disregarded the coercion methods used.Susan Hayward in real life had a legal situation that possibly dealt with the same type of duplicity in people, making her the best person to play that part, and she does a swell job of being a Bad Girl, just on the edge of a precipice, that falls in or gets sucked in to circumstances she may have not wanted to be complicit in. It does not matter if this was the case with the real Barbara Graham, it is the case in the FILM- And Hayward makes you believe this, or you walk out of the film... I do know several people who are greatly offended by this film.Robert Wise clearly depicts how nasty people can be, especially the press. Coercion or not, this film shows the foul effect of bad press, which has existed since the day of Christ: Another person who 'got the shaft' so to speak. In the film, The woman of the press, who near the end needles Graham about the future of her baby, is as near to a vulture-ess as I can imagine. I actually know people of the press today, and they are not like that, in general, in relation to "real" newspapers... The "Tabloids" however, still use those tactics, but they do not have the "power of the press" that once existed.Wise was wise. He knew situations, he painted a valid picture of basic human nastiness- Lies, deceit, duplicity, and one of the best things in this film is the turnaround of Ed Montgomery played by Si Oakland (General Moore, from T.V.s Black Sheep Squadron).This film tells us just one thing: Be smart and do everything you can to AVOID being sucked in the the US Legal System. In other words, don't give them a reason to come after you. Barbara Graham, regardless of guilt or innocence, gave them a trail of bad circumstances about three miles long. Of course, this is not encouragement to go out and do crime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badly dated film with a great score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Want To Live" is based on the story of convicted killer Barbara Grahm. Whether or not you believe she is actually guilty or wrongly convicted may depend on what beliefs you bring to the movie. My opinion is that director Robert Wise bends over backwards to show that many people believe she was innocent.I'm sure that in 1958 this movie may have been seen as innovative and shocking (this is the earliest movie I can think of that shows to guys smoking a joint in a nightclub). Maybe some people even thought that it was "realistic". By today's standards, those same people may find it melodramatic. I believe the latter opinion is true.While the movie tries to tackle issues like guilt and innocence, choices available to women, etc., it all looks so phony. It tries to be gritty, but all the while takes great pains to make Susan Hayward remain attractive to look at.Her performance, by 1958 standards may have been daring and explosive. Today, it is best described as over the top. I'm sure she deserved the Oscar at the time, but now... a golden Razzie.The best part of the movie is the score. This must have been one of the first times that jazz was used so extensively. If it weren't for the score, I would have turned this movie off midway through.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a perfect example of a bad performance that turns into an award winner. I have nothing against Susan Hayward, but bellowing and shrieking at high volume is not great acting by any stretch, although frequently confused as such.The rest of the movie, nifty and cool atmosphere, with crazy camera angles and an uncompromising jazz soundtrack to delight any latter day hipster. You can also see the anti-death penalty propaganda from a mile away, although it's easy to understand from the evidence as presented why a jury, judge and the decisive legal system of the day would have her and her buddies on the express to San Quentin. Nothing wrong with propaganda--movies were made for it and it's a highly respected genre when done effectively.The movie is also interesting as it mixes four genres into one--film noir, "women's picture," liberal guilt string puller, andprison movie. There's some very interesting interplay between the 50's home and hearth lifestyle and the deviantly criminal. Here's there's no middle ground between fulfilling domesticity and a sordid life of crime. One slip, and they're carefully wrapping the cyanide in cheesecloth just for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise provides a perfect visual style for the material here, with appropriately dark scenes, captured well in black and white photography, and the audio side is notable too, with a jazzy soundtrack invoking a seedy atmosphere. Haywood is also rather good, but there is one thing that Robert Wise and his team have failed to do here, and that is to provide some glimmer of light or hope at the end of the tunnel. As it stands, it is endlessly bleak - one can tell where it is heading, and for this reason it is hard to sit through. The film is just so nasty that it is unbearable to watch at times. The messages against capital punishment are also handled too heavily and are as a result too obvious to be effective. It is not a bad film though, even if very hard to watch, as Haywood and Wise both do a lot on their behalves, but neither does it make excellent viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood twists facts to push own agenda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not an enjoyable movie to watch. It's BASED on the true story of Barbara Graham, accused of murdering an elderly woman during a botched home invasion robbery attempt. But while the movie opens with a title screen stating its based on a "FACTUAL story gathered from newspaper reports, interviews..etc" - let me warn you, what you are presented is far from objective truth.It bothers me that the film attempts to paint Ms. Graham as innocent - when all the facts I looked up on the case point to her guilt. It appears the movie may be trying to change the slant of the film in order to create sympathy for what was a despicable woman - in order to crucify the death penalty instead. So it isn't really Graham who is on trial, but the death penalty. Hollywood is quite good at promoting its own agenda at the expense of truth. I wonder how the murder victim's family felt after this film was released.While I do hate this film's twisting of the facts, I do think Hayward gives a fine performance. All of her co-conspirators were adequately cast as well. I did find the musical score rather annoying. It's a kind of jazzy, bongo, neurotic mess. I guess it was used to help heighten the tension and discomfort of the audience - but I just found it annoying.But regardless of what I saw of the technical merits or shortcomings of the film, I can't overlook the bottom line that the writers, director and producers decided to take the side of a despicable woman and try to make her look innocent - all for their own agenda of painting the death penalty as the true villain. I'm sorry, but the death penalty isn't who killed the poor widow Monohan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realism in film or simply bad acting, bad writing, and bad directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my friend (a film professor at the college where I work) and I were watching I Want to Live, we had to pause the movie for about ten minutes while we discussed realism in film. I brought up the character David Helfgott played by Geoffrey Rush in the movie "Shine" When I first saw Shine, I thought that Rush's portrayal of Helfgott was a little overdone. It seemed unnecessarily manic and jittery. That is until I saw the real David Helfgott play the piano at the Academy Awards broadcast that year. Rush's portrayal was absolutely spot-on. The David Helfgott that came out on stage was the David Helfgott played by Rush. It was as if Rush had channeled Helfgott.I was comparing the Geoffrey Rush performance of Helfgott with the Susan Hayward performance of Barbara Graham. If Hayward were really channeling Graham, she was doing a great job.Here's the rub. Neither of us thought that Hayward was really channeling Graham. We thought that someone, probably the misbegotten director, had told Hayward to play Graham as a tough girl. I our opinion she didn't play Graham like a tough girl. She played her like a middle-class college graduate girl who was trying to fake her way through the criminal underworld by talking tough. Big difference. It ended up sounding like a not-so-good B-movie, not an academy award winning movie. It is possible that the real Barbara Graham was like that. If so, I stand corrected. It's not the first time I've been wrong?see the first paragraph.We endured the rest of the movie by making fun of it MST-3000 style. We normally don't do that to movies, if it tells you how much we disliked it. What was more interesting though, was our discussion of realism in film, which was ten minutes not thirty because we'd talked about it before. According to my friend there is a LOT of critical discussion on realism in film. The question that he brought up was whether it was better or more truthful to create a film that has the illusion of reality (a believable Barbara Graham) or a film that plays Barbara Graham as she really might have been?not that we think they did a good job at either. Much of the critical thinking on the subject says that there is no one universal timeless and culturally unbiased way to present realism in film, even in documentaries. All methods of creating realism are based on contemporary culturally-based notions. Since realism in film is culturally relative and artificial and attempts to actually bring reality into film ironically have the effect often of making it seem contrived and artificial, it is often better to err on the side of seeming realistic rather than "being" realistic, if anything captured on film can actually be realistic.Final note: Inititially I loved the musical score. It got tiresome after about twenty minutes.</fullReview>

Hayward plays a shrill, unlikeable &amp; dumb character who wastes oxygen shrieking at the drop of a hat. Successful communication is always 2nd to verbal flailing. There's a reason no one wants to know low class loud-mouths. Just because your subject is unrefined doesn't mean your drama has to be unsubtle.Hayward and her cronies are bizarre: hepcats and such, who couldn't find a beat if they were convulsing. The jazz angle is overplayed again though not as obnoxiously as in The Man with the Golden Arm, and In Cold Blood. Regardless of how many stays she received, these delays just prolong the movie. It's called dramatic license. It goes on far too long for a movie whose ending is obvious.Where did Hayward come from, and where did she go? I can't name another one of her movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having owned the soundtrack for several years, I had to see the movie. According to the liner notes, this was the first time jazz was employed as a movie soundtrack. The music, however, is the strongest suit of this movie.I should take into account the time and circumstances of the movie, but that's a tall order. Susan Hayward chews the scenery with the ferocity of a starved tiger. Tiger trainer Roy obviously never saw the film, or he'd have likely been more careful. I want to dress up as Barbara Graham for Halloween - no drag queen on Halsted Street could match the drama.The film is worth seeing for its camp value. Hayward's hair is only lightly tussled after a severe beating, and her lipstick is always flawless. The directing is by-the-numbers, and early on establishes its heroine in the stereotype as a whore with a heart of gold, a good girl who wasn't perfect but clung to enough virtue that you're supposed to feel sorry for her as she faces an unjust demise.I felt manipulated by the story and the directing, amused by the over acting, and never felt like I got to know any real person named Barbara Graham.By today's standards, with Tim Robbins' wrenching Dead Man Walking and Charlize Theron's intense portrayal of Aileen Wournos in Monster, I Want to Live is little more than dated, melodramatic pulp. But pulpy in that good, campy way. A perfect bookend to a Lana Turner film on a cold and rainy Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

However, Wise goes over the top, with tilted camera angles, extreme closeups, and a loud jazzy score. Speaking of over-the-top, Hayward's one-note performance was certainly not deserving of the Oscar. The first half hour is quite disjointed, making it difficult to get involved in the story. Hayward's character is not likable, which is fine, but she is also unconvincing, veering between not giving a damn and wanting to live. The execution scene is well, uh, executed.</fullReview>

Spitting out lines like "It's nothing PERSONAL!", "I'm not your MAID!" or "Take it, it's all I've GOT!" (always with the inflection on the last word). It's a piece of non-acting, really, in the same dated vein as Joan Crawford in "Mildred Pierce"--which also got awards! The score is heavy on the bongos; it's jazzy all right, too jazzy. It provides all the nervy emotions that the screenplay couldn't put into words, but who wants the background score to do all the work? The direction is textbook, all the way up until the final moments, which aren't exactly subtle but do provide some much-needed tension. Graham gets a send-off, and for once the movie doesn't deteriorate into camp. ** from ****</fullReview>

Since this occurred in the 1950s (before widespread use of LSD), I assume the members must have been either blackmailed or just plain nuts! The movie is about an incredibly obnoxious party-girl who is convicted of murder. Whether or not she really did it was a little unclear, but I wanted her executed anyway--just to shut her up! Ms. Hayward's performance is bad and WAY over-the-top. It's as if she's starring in a high school production (and a rather poor one at that)--with loud bellowing, dramatics that appear more akin to epilepsy and the DUMB trademark "dice rolling" move she makes throughout the picture. I think Edward G. Robinson in drag would have been more believable in this role! FYI--I seem to be one of the only people I know who thinks Susan Hayward was a bad actress and I'm not sure why. Just as few of her stinker roles include: the red-headed Bortai in the classic(?) The Conquerer, Bathsheba, and what's-her-face in Valley of the Dolls. Subtle she ain't. I wonder though, if perhaps some of Divine's histrionics in John Waters' films MIGHT have been inspired by Miss Hayward's performance!

While living a life permeated by non-stop bad behavior choices, you keep wondering: "When is she going to stop playing victim and start making healthy decisions?" Okay, she didn't murder the poor woman, but she knowingly and continually associated with people quite capable of murdering. Well, she ends up on death roll and suddenly, she realizes, "I want to live." Not only is this realization far too late, she never gives even a hint of recognizing her life of crime and any sense of rehabilitation. Is there any reason to believe that if she had suddenly been found innocent and set free that she would do anything other than continue a life of crime and be a menace to society?! Moreover, the dramatic, anti-capital punishment message is rather pathetic. Why, for example, do we not see the actual murder and the consequences of both the victim and her loved ones?

		<shortDescription>When people who commit murder are victims.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When are people who commit murder the true victims, rather than the murdered person lying face down in the street? Answer: When you're watching a Fodder for Liberal Empty-Heads movie from Hollywood 1958 -- a time when the sacred-liberal-cause-of-the-day was the way "society" intrudes on criminals and fails to empathize with their lifestyle.I Want to Live was a particularly obnoxious liberal rant whereby we are supposed to shed crocodile tears for poor Susan Hayward, a person convicted -- with others -- in the robbery/murder of two men. Trapped like a rat in her prison cell, Miss Hayward has ample opportunity to rant and rave in allegedly Academy Award level acting. Gag me, please.There is no mention of -- nor compassion for -- the two dead victims. Heavens, no. According to this movie Hayward is the only victim, and her immoral lawyers will play any trick to help her avoid -- also breaking their arms with self-congratulatory back-pats.Liberals did a lot of damage to society in that era, with propaganda films that undermined justice and kept criminals in circulation. And they're darn proud of it.</fullReview>
