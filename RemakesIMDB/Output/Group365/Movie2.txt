		<shortDescription>Wrong-headed, blasphemous piece of drek.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's little sense in "reviewing" something so devoid of logic, appeal, captivation, construction or even suspense, so instead a few of the many mistakes in attempting to remake the memorable 1972 feature film will be listed.~~The insertion of a terrorist plot. All this did was prolong the capsizement, add characters no one cares about and feebly try to appear timely when actually the full force of nature has proved to the world to be plenty to deal with! ~~The removal of a strong leading character and his antagonist. Half the suspense of the original was wondering if the survivors were doing the right thing and they often fought about it in between climbing and trying to stay alive. No one really seems in charge here. ~~The complete stripping of any Biblical symbolism, which added a subtle gravity to the original as the characters followed their leader, sometimes with great sacrifice. The book gave Reverend Scott twelve followers. This thing doesn't even have Rev. Scott! ~~The omission of the most popular character among die-hard fans -- Linda Rogo. She provided sass and comic relief throughout the suspenseful original. She's scarcely even mentioned here. Also, the removal of Manny Rosen lessens the interest and the meaning of Belle Rosen's character despite endless references to him. ~~The absence of great music, which enhanced the original tremendously. ~~The lack of urgency. The original survivors could only barely keep ahead of the water pouring in. Here, the ballroom survivors stay alive much longer and most characters hardly get wet at all! Except for Belle, no one of any importance is killed. Only the non-name performers die and their deaths are telegraphed to where a six year-old could see them coming. It was never a "given" in the original that there would even be a rescue as there is here with all the endless naval sequences. ~~One of the key sequences of the original film, Belle's swim and heart attack, is so poorly handled as to be laughable. There's no discussion beforehand, no need for her to go first and no benefit from it, since the priest swims right beside her all the way. The whole point was that no one was sure it could be done. Since the priest kept up with her, he obviously could have done it alone first!These are only a few of the major points. In addition, there are countless inanities and confounding changes which do nothing to enhance the story. The capsizement no longer takes place at midnight and no further reference is made to a new year. Why? Was it so wrong to have the explosion happen at 12:00? Part of the drama was that everyone went from so jubilant to so terrified within minutes! A singer preposterously strips off her dress at the drop of a hat in order to provide masks for people, yet Mrs. Rosen has a large flowy jacket that could have easily done (for three times as many people!) This film asks the audience to believe that a teen girl can follow instructions left by a Sharpie marker on the walls and ceilings of an overturned liner. Additionally, a teen boy films everything with a video recorder even when death is at hand. He never once wonders where his father is, but just keeps taping everything. Ridiculous. The film provides a massive insult to professional massage therapists as a female one practically has her left breast exposed during a session and proceeds to flirt with and eventually sleep with the married client. The characters are practically bereft of engrossing traits or texture. They don't even get to the point of stereotypes. They're merely props!Is anything good? The overturning sequences aren't bad, actually, and this time the viewer gets to see other areas of the ship such as the kitchen and (ridiculously) a bedroom with a copulating couple in it. Also, the sets tend to be fairly decent throughout. Otherwise, it's a pretty dire affair.Several of the actors (Hauer, Brown, Van Wyk, Hamilton) attempt to inject some presence into their nondescript roles. Most of them are wasting their time and get no thanks for their efforts. Time and gravity have been very cruel to several of the people on hand here (Guttenberg, Weller, Howell and Syms) and it's depressing to see them wallowing in such a poorly conceived project. It was a pointless idea to begin with. The producers should have just made up their own story and left the name Poseidon out of it. One can only hope that Wolfgang Peterson, director of the upcoming feature remake (!) learned something from this futile mess. It should be noted that this was originally a FOUR HOUR mini-series and so a great deal of character development was cut out to make it a three hour movie. they should have trimmed down the rescue and government scenes and left the emphasis on the ship, where it always should have been! Lastly, 5 out of the original's 10 primary cast members were Oscar-winning actors. With talent like that you can rely on the performers to fill in the blanks. Unfortunately, most of the people in this would be lucky to work as a seat-filler at the Academy Awards ceremony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the original 1972 classic......They ruined, butchered the original. How this ever got approved is beyond me? They should of retitled this "The Love Boat: The Sinking"......I mean that is what I felt like I was watching. You get a bunch of actors that should of put on The Surreal Life and put them in this......There is nothing about this remake that even comes close to the original. The whole entire movie was rewritten......Not even a tidal wave, guys come on.......Oh and the terrorist plot how genius....NOT!! This piece of garbage is laughable and a disgrace......I would rather sit and watch Barney by myself for two hours! I have never seen a worse remake of a movie. The remake of Carrie came close but this takes the cake!!!! This is S.S. Disaster!!!!! Way to go!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A clarification: Another commenter seems concerned that people should not be allowed to comment on how the film compares to the original. Let me make this clear: This telemovie is dreadful on it's own terms. Some might find it regrettable that it associates itself with the earlier '70's movie, but it is poorly executed regardless of that fact. Still there is nothing wrong with drawing legitimate comparisons for the purpose of highlighting some of the many weaknesses in this new version. I also wonder whether those who rated this movie as 10 stars honestly believe that it deserves such a rating, and if so, what kind of rating they would give to a even a reasonably well-regarded film let alone the truly great films. I saw the original Poseidon Adventure as a 12 year old, so I am conscious of the fact that there may well be young kids out there today who will see this with fresh young eyes and enjoy it, perhaps even as much as I did the original.Having said that, this TV movie sunk to new depths of "bad", perhaps even plunging to "evil", in some respects.One of the more amusing goofs in this TV movie is that most of the cast still had their eventual fate clearly written on their foreheads with magic markers ("dies early", "dies mid-way", or "saved") during many of the early scenes! OK, I exaggerated slightly - their fates weren't literally visible, but it's generally easy to see who will live and who must ultimately die to keep the "drama" from flat-lining.On the positive side, the change of plot to incorporate a terrorist attack as the cause of the disaster is in some ways more plausible than the original "Tsunami at sea", and the CGI special effects are generally obvious but passable, especially considering it's a TV movie.Major weaknesses involve the dialogue and the none-too-subtle way in which the survivors all turn out to be "good" (or at least clearly repentant) white folk.There are far too many long-winded, schmaltzy speeches at points where the pace should be frantic from both a logical (within the plot) and a dramatic point of view. A classic example is when the ship is just minutes from sinking, and the survivors are crossing a makeshift bridge, one by one, interspersed by obligatory pep-talks, expressions of love, etc... and the would be rescuers radio in "It's taking too long! What's the hold-up?" (eerily echoing the viewer's thoughts precisely).Alec Baldwin, the Sea Marshal character, should have replied "there's too much talk, not enough action", but instead, he somehow manages to calculate the load-bearing capacity of this makeshift bridge and says "this looks like it will take two at a time". Not wanting to give too much away, I'll just note that he may have been correct in theory, but perhaps didn't take into account the extra "weight" of the sins being carried by certain people. The "fire of hell" burning below at the time was perhaps a missed hint.At the end, after the cheers go up at HQ with the news that there are about nine survivors (out of the thousand plus passengers and crew)...the one person with a bit of perspective in the room sums up the entire show with the very last line: " This isn't a miracle... it's a bloody mess".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Will Turn Your Frown Rightside-Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By accident, we rented this instead of the original. I couldn't imagine this movie being any worse. Several scenes and characters have been added, which have no real value. There's the guy from police academy in some awful "divorce" angle. A fake ex-American idol contestant sings a whole song for no reason. There's a kids who's not just annoying, but is making humorous handi-cam films with the help of the zany crew. And oh yeah, there's a terror attack, because the dead horse is only half-beaten by TV standards, I guess. There's also a creepy old crewman who's trying to get with some teenager, and the priest in this film is a far weaker character/actor.Add in some of the most un-inspired editing, music, and dialogue imaginable and that sums up the worst of this movie. I'd rather draw a picture of boat upside-down and stare at it for two hours rather than repeat watching 10 min. of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "New" Poseidon Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watch the first remake of the classic Poseidon Adventure to be released, I can now safely say "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!" Not to say that this was a bad remake but it was not great either. Disappointing characters, none of which were endearing and it would not have been a huge loss if none of them got out. Good special effects, but not spectacular - lots of very average CG effects. The capsizing of the ship had no shock/horror effect of the original - it looked like it could be a lot of fun to go sliding across the polished floors, landing on your feet to walk up the wall to the roof of the ballroom. Let's just hope that the big screen "POSEIDON" due for release in 2006 is better than this small screen adaption. My last comment is "STELLA, STELLA, WHERE ARE YOU STELLA?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember the tag line on the poster for the original? It was "Hell, Upside Down". Well, this little TV movie of the week is definitely from hell. And it does, of course, turn upside down. It may also turn your stomach upside down if you're stupid enough to sit through this garbage.I can't believe anyone in their right minds would associate their names with this piece of dreck. Oh, I forgot. If I were Steve Guttenberg, I suppose I'd be thrilled if the phone rang with a job. Too bad he was home the day his agent called with this audition. Too bad he auditioned. Too bad he got it. Too bad he took it. But, I suppose he does have mortgage to pay. Bless his heart. But I shouldn't just pick on poor Steve. Ditto Rutger Hauer. Bless his heart, too.The producer should be taken out and beaten with a stick. So should the executives at the network who decided to buy and air this. It must have been bring your toddler to work week at NBC, and some little one got into an office he shouldn't have, pushed a button and sent TV Guide their weekly listings with this reject in the Sunday night slot.I can't believe I was able to sit through this whole thing. What an embarrassment. If you've got a few hours of your life to kill and don't mind throwing a chunk of it away, watch this if it ever comes out on DVD, which I pray to my personal God, for YOUR sake, Poseidon enthusiast, it wont! Let's hope for something better when the film remake comes out.I'm not holding my breath.PS - for those of you who don't know, Shande is a Yiddish word which translates to: THE MOST HORRENDOUS DISGRACE EVER! Belle would know. Well, Shelley would DEFINITELY know. This other hack cast in her part, I'm not so sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Paul Gallico must be spinning in his grave to see such an excruciatingly bad production of his adventure novel, The Poseidon Adventure (it says so in the credits; "based on the novel by Paul Gallico")and then to have it so blatantly based on the Irwin Allen disaster movie. Come to think of it,Irwin is probably doing about 500 RPM's himself.To start, the teleproduction committed the very worst of sins. It bored. There was little suspense or tension. The characters evoked no charm, no life, and no spark. Most of the actors may as well have been carrying cardboard standees of themselves and reading from the script as they moved about. With few exceptions, most of the portrayals made Sharon Tate and Pia Zadora's worst performances look like Sarah Bernhardt and Ethel Barrymore. Even Mamie Van Doren and John Agar were never this tedious.There were characters who did not emit waves of blandness. The castrating shrew of a wife, Mrs. Rosen and the terrorist "high value prisoner". No, they just annoyed the hell out of me. The wife was so emotionally disaffected, my jaw dropped. Here you are on a capsized, sinking ship. Would you let your teen daughter stay behind to help the injured? For all the reaction she showed to the idea, the girl might as well have been her favorite manicurist. Mrs. Rosen would not have been too bad if she had not kept blathering on about her deceased husband, and as far as the terrorist went, he might as well have had a turban and a Kris and a handlebar mustache to twirl.The screenplay had the feel of a high school play that was written by the drama coach and cast with the popular students, rather than the ones who had talent. It was trite, mediocre, and awkward. With lines such as "We'll burn and drown at the same time!", my eyes were rolling more than a hooker at a craps table. Mrs. Rosen's death scene was excruciatingly horrible, I cringed with embarrassment for Sylvia Sims. And that was the only time I felt anything for anyone in the production.The special effects were okay at best and unbelievable at worst. The best were the actual capsize scenes in the ballroom, but even there it felt matter of fact. The worst were the scenes of the oil fire,burning on water,in the engine room. It was obviously computer created and done by people who have never seen an oil fire.The worst mistake the director made was to take us outside of the ship. By doing so, any sense of immediacy, tension, and mystery were completely lost. by switching back and forth, the viewers were not able to put themselves into the story. One could only watch as a distanced and disaffected viewer.One of the most wonderful things about seeing a film is to be able to become part of the film; to forget yourself and merge with the story. The most magnificent example of this I ever noted was in the original 1972 film. When Shelly Winters and Gene Hackman emerged from the water, I was startled to hear this odd noise in the theater. And I was delighted to realize that it was the sound of almost 700 theater patrons releasing their breathe at the same time. Had this film been shown theatrically, there may have been a similar incident, that of hundreds of people losing their dinners at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the part where the bishop goes into a room and comes out saying that there are toxic fumes. He suggests everyone needs to cover their face with a cloth so they can breathe long enough to make it through the room. An old lady screems because she sees a dead body, the person right behind her isn't covering his face. He talks for about 30-40 seconds about how she needs to move on. Then they pan out and multiple people are shown coughing and hacking like crazy while they have a cloth over their face. For some reason this one guy had no problem breathing and talking in a smoke infested room.If a boat is upside down, wouldn't you have to reach up for the door knobs, plus step over the trim where the wall where it meets the ceiling...not on this boat you don't.I love how they explode a 15 ft hole in the boat at the end, but they only needed to be 20 feet away from the explosion. If they were that close to the explosion i would think their ears would have been bleeding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this meant to be a comedy? I and my family were laughing either way. I just finished watching this, and at 3 and a half hours, i have to say it was definitely not worth staying up for. The sets are bad, the story is very predictable and corny, the effects are in their own right, disastrous, the cast tries their best, but with dialogue like this, how could you help it? The navy were a pack of idiots who didn't end up helping at all, just sitting in the ocean (the still water-like pool) outside the ship and making them inside the ship all risk their lives instead of actually blowing a hole in the ship with THEIR OWN resources. And everyone at the end was celebrating that only 9 people out of about 1000 survived! What heartless monsters. As with the other comment, I agree. That annoying little kid with the fake accent and the water proof video camera (that also has a 1000hr tape inside it) should have perished with the ship and the film.

		<fullReview>This film is only entertaining if you like watching bad movies. It's full of clichés, bad special effects huge plot holes, random acts of death and even a gratuitous hot chick in her underwear.This adventure is over acted, poorly directed, poorly written, contrived (of course) and predictable. It could have been saved if they had done it using Legos. (cast included) There is no reason this needed to be 3 hours but no doubt NBC wanted to fit as many commercials into this time slot as possible.If you like crap, then this is the film for you. Why did I watch it? Because I like to study disasters (in film) and this turned out to certainly be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrorists Try To Sink The Love Boat . I Know How They Feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This turned up on one of the more obscure film channels and instantly thought I was going to be watching the 2006 remake of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE only to find out relatively late that this is a Hallmark production no doubt produced to tie in with the big budget remake , a sort of cynical marketing ploy used by The Asylum company and their infamous " mockbusters " . I'll say one thing about Hallmark and that is no one is capable of making a film as bad as the ones at The Asylum . However we are talking about a very well regarded disaster movie from the 1970s and that alone may come close to cinematic blasphemy . After seeing the whole TVM I'm afraid Hallmark have done their level best to make a shipwreck of a movie Being effectively a three hour miniseries the producers have split the story in to two halves , one setting up the characters and backstory and the second half featuring the disaster of a capsized ship . Watching the first half you're not reminded of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE but that most dreadful and twee of American comedies THE LOVE BOAT . Most of the characters are looking for either romance or success where as the relatively big name actors playing them should have started looking for a new agent circa 1990 . The actresses seem to be slightly more fortunate since they've seemingly found a plastic surgeon , but the trouble is he wasn't a very good one who seems to have a fetish for botox . Honestly I'm not trying to get a cheap laugh but more than a few women seen here look like they're emulating waxworks and I'm not just referring to to the wooden acting Being a TVM means that it's family friendly fare . This means for the sake of audience identification we've got a little irritating kid as a relatively major figure . He also spends much of he first half of the story hanging around with one of the crew filming home made vampire movies in dark remote spots of the ship without any hint of an adult having an unhealthy interest in children . This jars greatly with one of the main aspect of the story where the cause of the ship capsizing is by an act of cold blooded terrorism. When the bombs explode and the terrorists start murdering the ship's crew it's almost like watching another film . That said after watching something that resembles THE LOVE BOAT I started thinking perhaps the terrorists were the good guys</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THREE HOURS. It has the same basic plot and lasts three hours. Scenes drag on for minutes with the ending of each scene obvious. The catwalk scene is a perfect example, it is clear that someone is going to die. We wait for a few minutes as everyone walks over, instead of crawling safely, only to see the annoying terrorist and the wussy masseuse die. Yawn. This predictability is worsened by movie of the week acting complete with cheesy close-ups and heart wrenching music. Add in effects look like they were done on a high school computer and you have a snore fest filled with over the hill B-actors. I found myself wanting all the people to die so that the movie could END.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but a long way from Hell, last year's Hallmark mini-series version of The Poseidon Adventure doesn't live down to its reputation. Aside from Peter Weller's every other line being "I'm Captain Paul Gallico" or "This is your captain, Paul Gallico" just in case anyone doesn't get the joke or Steve Guttenberg (looking increasingly like a failed attempt at cloning Albert Brooks) constantly endangering everyone's life to stop them to tell him how much he likes them with what he thinks is his best sincere voice but which really sounds like someone trying to have a conversation while having a particularly difficult bowel movement, there aren't many unintentional laughs to be had.Rutger Hauer simply looks bewildered, as if he wandered onto the wrong set by mistake and somebody gave him a hat and a dog collar, Sylvia Syms looks alarmingly like Shelley Winters, C. Thomas Howell is starting to look even more alarmingly like an ageing 80s porn star and only Bryan Brown and Adam Baldwin look like they're having any fun. The spirit of Irwin Allen is briefly resurrected near the finale: sadly, it's not the Allen of The Towering Inferno or the original Poseidon but the one who spent nearly two reels having people very, very slowly cross a bridge one by one for the last two reels of When Time Ran Out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I expected, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin? Of course this movie was cheesy and it could've been much better, but it also could've been much worse (i.e. some other film about a capsizing ship was made and the only upside down scenes were in corridors! I apologize for not remembering the name of it). There was no sense of suspense whatsoever. The scenes taking place outside the ship of the rescue effort absolutely RUINED the movie. The ending was too pat; you knew what going to live and who was going to die---James Martin has been so helpful getting Mrs. Rosen thru the air duct: dead! slutty maseusse who sleeps with a married man: dead! The terrorist who Rogo dragged thru the inverted ship: DEAD! However, I do choose to give the writer and the director the benefit of the doubt. The scuttlebutt is that the TV movie was severely altered from what was originally planned by some network exec who played up the terrorist angle. (IN THE SPIRIT OF FULL DISCLOSURE, I SHOULD ADD THAT I AM A MEMBER OF THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE FAN CLUB). The one bit of casting that I truly hated was Steve Guttenberg. If you see his name in a movie, you know it's going to have a cheese factor. And he is still in great shape but his body looks 20 years younger than his face. scary. Plus, he was quoted in an EW article in a review of this movie and he came off sounding like a self-important jerk. You're Steve Guttenberg!!! I would've much rather seen someone like Jimmy Smits, Gary Sinise, William Petersen, etc. in the role of the duplicitous husband.I also agree with one of the earlier posts pondering how someone could survive getting bounced about in a 3-story tall ballroom, while others die from massive trauma in a corridor. huh?I also found it a tad disappointing that the survivors found the other bomb---in the mess of the overturned engine room, the bomb is just sitting on a platform waiting to be tapped--blew a hole in the hull and just jumped to safety. Reminds me of Lindo Rogo's lambasting of her husband in the original: "Why don't you just say this is the police, kick out the hull, and swim to shore!"That being said, when the movie is released on DVD (according to Netflix, that will be in March), I will buy it. Maybe it will be the director's real cut.Personally, I'm not going to complain about not being emotionally vested in the characters because I watched The Simpsons during the movie's first half hour. oops!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Hollywood redoing everything from the sixties and seventies it should be no surprise that they would try and remake on of their disaster movies so popular in the early/mid seventies. This time, the idea should have stayed that... an idea! Adam Baldwin was a no-nonsense Homeland security officer that works with a priest (Rutger Hauer) to save a handful of survivors of a terrorist act that capsizes a HUGE luxury liner... PUUULLLEEEZZE!! I still can't get over seeing Rutger Hauer as anything but a killing creation going after Harrison Ford in Bladerunner... now, he's a priest? Does he need the money to lend his face and name to such a weak story? C Thomas Howell who has fallen off the face of the earth since somewhere in 1992 made an appearance as a doctor that smiles a lot at Steve Guttenburg's daughter... and where has Steve Guttenburg been since 1992? Did he and C. Thomas Howell escape from the same B list actors island to star in this silly interpretation of a classic? Go back to the island guys... you escaped to star in a real razz-berry of a movie... I'm just glad it was a freebie on TV, I would be demanding my money if they had tried to release this in the theaters first!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like The Ship In This Movie, Irwin Allen Turns Over In His Grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(I don't believe I've actually made a spoiler here, but I do mention some character and technical differences between this and the original and for that reason I'm not taking any chances in ruining your viewing if that were possible.) As a movie lover I often watch remakes of movies just to compare the new interpretation, even if I think they might not be any good. Such was the case with NBC's "The Poseidon Adventure". I must admit I thought it might actually work but the entire viewing experience came across as a thin shadow of the original seasoned well with television melodrama. Frankly it wasn't even a fair tribute to Irwin Allen's work, which although "cheesy" at times (ya gotta love those explosions in his television work when aliens appear and disappear!) always entertained the audience and helped them suspend their disbelief for awhile.Although rich with CGI television special effects, the best image in this movie was the image of the ship upside down between commercial breaks with the lights going out.For the most part, the actors gave it a good try, but for the life of me I can't understand Rutger Hower's interpretation of the former Gene Hackman "Reverend" character. Hower, whom I've watched over the years and first saw in "The Hitcher", always brought a strong and when necessary, evil and eerie presence to the screen. Here he seems so reserved and meek as the Reverend - save for one brief moment with an ax that comes across as totally out of his character - that I wondered if he felt this movie didn't deserve his best effort.It was obvious that political correctness altered some of the plot in NBC's version, because the character of "Belle" became an "old" woman instead of a "large" woman. Face it, people come in different shapes and sizes but that doesn't make them any less lovable. The character in the original as played by Shelly Winters was lovable and added spice to the survivors of the original capsizing of the ship. Changing that character's trait to "old" simply moves the supposed offense to people over middle age and valiant as Sylvia Sim's attempt at the role, her Belle, minus her husband Manny, simply doesn't touch our hearts like the original.I've always thought Adam Baldwin's acting was underrated, and although good here, this isn't "Rogo" as Rogo was meant to be - the antithesis of Reverend Scott. Here he is simply overconfident and too stuffy at times to get on the same plane as the other survivors.Enough about the miscast and misplayed characters. Technically, as another commenter pointed out,there is no way an explosion on one side of a ship would cause it capsize. Sink from that side maybe with a large enough hole, but not capsize. The original,although also stretching things, was much more plausible with it's tidal wave scenario.What this whole thing is missing is the major portion of entertainment equation and that is Mr. Allen's oversight and direction in an undertaking such as this. The actors in 1972's movie worked hard and some of them nearly drowned while filming as he fired gallons upon gallons of water upon them from water canons. 2005's television attempt takes much of the realism away and the CGI fire and water make it obvious no one is ever in any real danger.Rest in peace, Irwin Allen. Your shoes are in no danger of being filled here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure" Look Like "Titanic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly from the school of "what the ...?", this production is ground-breaking on so many levels; terrible TV movies; needless remakes; mind boggling lack of logic; one dimensional characters; questionable casting of forgotten "C" listers; and how bad can Steve Guttenberg act - and now look?I watched it because I love the original, and disaster movies in general. It was a chore to sit through the entire commercial-padded three hours. Wolfgang Peterson's "Poseidon" has only up to go from this trash. One note: this is definitely NOT based on the original novel, as one piece of Trivia states. The ship of the novel flipped at dinner the day after Christmas; there were many more characters involved; a large number of passengers were rescued from the bow. Not even fun in the bad movie realm. It stinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You wouldn't think that 3 hours of something as iconic as the Poseidon Adventure would be forgettable, but this is.The insertion of a wholly unnecessary (an massively unconvincing) terrorist plot subplot draws attention away from the main course - do our survivors escape? The fact that we don't care very much about the survivors (and particularly about the adultery-and-its-consequences subplot which impinges on a good chunk of them doesn't help).The TV movie budget means that we are never looking at masses of production value on screen, but instead we are looking at very dim lighting to disguise the absence of production budget - OK, I know there wouldn't be much light, but this is ridiculous.And there is too much of it, given that it is plodding and fairly uninteresting a lot of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They were joking, right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This appeared at first to be a joke. But I realized quickly that I was laughing for the wrong reasons. I critiqued another stupid remake recently (I can't remember which), but that one was actually so bad it was funny. This remake only took some of the story from the original and added a bunch of crap (I wish I could use that other word). The scenes that were copied from the original had no soul, no feeling, and just flowed past like people waiting in line at a urinal. The characters were dull and looked quite bored, except Steve. He looked like a desperate actor who paid to get his role in this movie so he could over-act. He might have unintentionally made some people laugh. I laughed a bit, but it wasn't happy laughter. It was absolutely disgusted laughter. As others here have said, the scenes outside of the ship killed any tension that might have helped this movie. A not quite white person being made into a terrorist (probably from the middle east) is one more example of racist Hollywood. Why does Hollywood almost always cast people with a particular physical racial look as being terrorists? The incredibly honorable military saviors from outside of the ship were obviously tools of propaganda for increasing the giving of our tax-dollars to the weapons industry. The moral majority must have also had a hand in this production, since the good looking blond who had sex with Steve's character dies in the symbolic "FIRES OF HELL". Of course, Steve doesn't join her there, since he now cares about 'family values'. He's the adulterer, but only the woman suffers the penalty, from our vengeful God. I'll summarize quickly. Realism is not there. How much can anyone enjoy a movie (that's already been made and is a classic) about natural disaster and people struggling to survive it, being remade into a movie about a terrorist disaster with a bunch of soul-free people, only a few being saved by our strong military. And, who would really care about any of the characters in this movie? Can Hollywood sink any lower.....Oh boy.... I shouldn't ask that. You know they will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films that aren't really that bad will receive a rating like this, not because they are horrible in relation to other films of the same rating or better, but because they had so much potential and really not much excuse for failing as a film.This is one of those. A strong cast, a good (remake) concept, plenty of budget- all which leave the viewers with a nagging question, "why did it suck?"It certainly had plenty going for it, which is the main reason I am so disappointed and feel that it deserves a rating of 3 or less. The entire movie is a montage of ripped off scenes from other big budget flicks, and it's almost as if the writers were deliberately trying to flip off the audience by implying they were too dumb to recognize the same scene/situational format from Armageddon, Titanic, hell- even finding Nemo!Maybe they thought a remake didn't warrant a great script, or maybe they were in too much of a hurry to actually come up with their own so they decided "borrow" from other movies. Either way, it's the main reason I gave the movie such a low rating, as it was pretty insulting when the father acknowledges his daughters boyfriend is the one that has to go on a suicide mission to save them all, only to trick the boyfriend and go in his place, so that his daughter wouldn't lose the love of her life. (Gee, reminds me of a certain Bruce Willis/ Ben Affleck scene in Armageddon).This movie has little to offer, other than watching a ship get knocked around and broken up, and some of the drowning scenes are indeed interesting, but overall it didn't deliver.Skip it unless you enjoy made for TV movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take it for what it is and it'll be an enjoyable ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that the first remake of The Poseidon Adventure is "flawed" is the understatement of the decade. The film is rampant with bad acting, a poor script, a film that drags on far longer than necessary, and a hacked up editing job with poor special effects. So how can I give a film like this a 6.5/10....well it also deserves kudos for taking the story in a slightly different direction than it's original predecessor. Some of the characters are not badly done and some of the action is as edge of your seat as the original...just not nearly as much. It's a very watchable Made-For-TV, LOW BUDGET film. If you go into it expecting millions of dollars in budget you'll be shocked, dismayed and probably very disappointed. But if you take it for what it is than you'll see the magic and appreciate it a little more.The unfortunate part of this remake is they don't ever truly capture any of the main casts characters. Within the first half of the original film you were so taken by each character, you felt connected to them and although this TV Version works on that, it never quites make it. The biggest headliner in this film is probably former big screen star Steve Guttenberg who plays Richard Clarke, aboard the Poseidon with his family to try and have a relaxing vacation and work things out with his estranged wife. I miss Guttenberg, but he's definitely washed up. He looks awful, old, and he doesn't have the spark he once had for being a leading man. His character is quite shallow and you never feel one way or another for him. Rutger Hauer plays Bishop Schmidt, a loose interpretation of Gene Hackman's character from the original. He actually does pretty well, he's one of the better actors and characters but even still they never give it time to really unfold. C. Thomas Howell plays Doctor Ballard and he too does an adequate job and no he doesn't share hardly any screen time with his former Horror film nemesis (obscure pop culture reference that few of you will likely get.) Sylvia Syms tries to take over the role of Belle Rosen from the incomparable Shelley Winters. She too does alright but the character of Belle Rosen is written to shreds in this remake. She doesn't die a hero like she did in the original. Amber Sainsbury and Rory Copus takes over as the brother and sister in the film but this time they are joined by their parents. Copus does a good job as the young film maker, probably one of the better performances and Sainsbury is more eye candy than anything else, her character is underused a lot and the romance between her and C. Thomas Howell is never explored at all. Alexa Hamilton plays their mother (Guttenberg's wife) and her character too is underdeveloped and used. They seem to imply her intelligence and leadership but she never shows it. The only real redeemable performance in the movie is by Adam Baldwin. This guy has been around a long time and done pretty much everything but he is the one person in the film whose character does get explored and you do attach yourself to him. He plays Homeland Security Office Mike Rogo. He's a leader and a fighter and a tough guy but still a heart of gold and he does make the cast tolerable by being in it. Bravo to him!! Direcot John Putch has never really done anything of huge significance and unfortunately this won't turn the tide for him because it is campy and poorly written BUT it is watchable.The story is quite different from the original film in that Terrorists set off bombs on The Poseidon causing her to capsize. The story begins with these terrorists which is quite different. We also get much more of a story in those who are working to rescue survivors from The Poseidon. This is interesting but also might take a little of the claustrophobic, disaster feel that the original had, away from it. There are still some edge of your seat moments and some great stunts and disturbing deaths that make the film watchable. Also it was nice to see some full fledged moments that pay homage to the original master piece (see my review.) The scene in the ball room with the Christmas Tree is practically pulled right from the original. This is not a good movie by any means but it's also not disgustingly bad. For a TV film it's just fine and if you loved the original you'll enjoy this little homage to it. It's a little long and a little too "Made-For-TV" but it's worth checking out anyways. It'll amuse you if nothing else. 6.5/10</fullReview>

When the old woman dies in the original you feel like you had a real connection with her and you are sad. In this one you didn't really even care because there was no real character development with her. In fact there is no real character development with any of them. And why switch to terrorist? That whole sub-plot just wasted time. I think everyone could predict what was going to happen to the terrorist ... I knew exactly when it was going to happen and how it would happen (loved the Captain Kirk kick in the face). They should have just stuck with the original tidal-wave and then they would have had time to develop the characters better (or they could have taken out a half hour worth of advertisements and developed the characters better). In the end I just didn't care about any of these characters.</fullReview>

And I bought the second one. When I saw it, it's very hard to believe the movie was so jerky. The ship picture are a computer 3D rendering, and the quality are so bad. You can't compare the quality with those pixar's work. The story line contaminated with "stupid" plot line here and there...too many talks, and too many kiss even when the character is in the middle fire-a-hell-like. The worst of all, in the final part of the movie, when the 11 guys has to cross a catwalk with fire down below, there too many chit chat between the character, as you were walk in the park, not in the bloody hell situation, considering the ship will sink in every second.. I'm very surprised in the middle of the movies, when I read "To Be Continued".. and then I realized, this movie was impossible for cinema. Its to jerk to see.</fullReview>

As an earlier commentator has pointed out, the best line in the whole thing came right at the end: "It's a bloody mess".Some say this version shouldn't be compared to the original movie but you can't help it when the title, the basic plot, many of the characters and even some of the scenes are identical. It's as though the makers of this version never understood what made the original so entertaining and figured they could do better. They couldn't - and didn't.Apart from the bad script, bad acting and bad directing, this film demanded far too much suspension of disbelief to be a straight drama.

		<fullReview>I yelled, screamed, and carried on months before this remake. And yet, I still watched it. I'm not too happy about the trivia section saying that it was more like the book. It wasn't. Aside from having the entire Shelby family (or Clarke wasn't it?), Mike Rogo, Belle Rosen and the name Poseidon, nothing really was. A terrorist attack? Please. Haven't we had enough of that to go around? I felt that way about movies even before 9/11, but I digress. The bishop had no real gusto as he had in the book, or 1972 version. Getting rid of Manny Rosen, was a huge mistake, because it took away another element of survival for Belle. No Linda Rogo was not a good choice, either, taking away any warmth Mike Rogo might have had. How can corridors be flooded above a nice, dry ballroom? Why are the hallways all lit up from bow to stern? Those must be some emergency batteries. Could a used a few of those during the blackout of '03. Having the bishop swim with Belle during her underwater ballet, took away all of the heroics from Mrs. Rosen. In the 1972 movie, she saves Rev. Scott, in the book she swims through three times all by herself with a flashlight, because Poseidon was in a total blackout. She didn't get to talk about being a swimming champion, just a few lines tossed off about trophies. Plus, giving her grandson a diamond necklace? She's either one hip grandma, or she knows he can get a lot for it on ebay. I was very saddened by this. I encourage remakes, as long as they are, indeed, remakes. Going for a darker version by following the book would have been a better idea. How very sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I was seriously disappointed with this retelling of the 1972 film. I'm not a huge fan of that film, mind you--try watching it now and it's almost campy. However, at the time, it was made in the tradition of Irwin Allen disaster movies and can be taken as such. No big plot twists, no analysis needed--it was just a good popcorn movie.This new version doesn't even come close.This version was plodding, the acting laughable, dialogue worse, and the direction frankly boring. I found the terrorist subplot to be completely inane and superfluous. (And why terrorists? What was wrong w/the rogue wave? I would say a creative decision was made in deference to tsunami and/or hurricane victims, but then why focus on terrorists? Are terrorist victims less offended?) You only need the plot device to turn the ship over. After that, then you can focus on the characters &amp; action/suspense. Unfortunately, this version contains very little action and even less suspense. Another reviewer already noted that, since the story switches between the ship &amp; rescue operations, the suspense is distilled. Unlike the original, here the entire world knows where the Poseidon is and we watch rescue operations unfold. In the original, part of the tension was that, even if Gene Hackman and his band got to the hull, there was no guarantee of anyone being there to meet them.Most disappointing of all was the utter lack of tension or drama during the ballroom scene as the ship flips over. The direction here was so uninspired that it sapped any and all interest from what should have been the best scene in the movie. Instead we're treated to jump cuts between the ballroom &amp; Steve Guttenberg's stateroom. Even the scene where the guy falls through the light fixture felt like an afterthought! I've seen documentaries with more suspense and tension.Whether you look at this version on its own or compare it to the original, you're going to be disappointed. It's a poorly executed story, directed badly. Listen folks, just because it's TV doesn't mean it has to be bad. Unfortunately, this one just is.</fullReview>

Poseidon capsizes and a hardy band of survivors make their way to the hull of the ship and most of them escape.Unlike the original, this Thanksgiving turkey has "made-for-cable" written all over it (NBC bought it from The Hallmark Channel). From the "seen-better-days" cast, to the by-the-numbers script and direction to the cheap-looking sets and the average CGI effects, this film has little to recommend it. Bad movies always raise lots of questions. Aside from the obvious question of how a bomb disguised as a keg of beer could wreak enough havoc to capsize a huge ship like the Poseidon:-- Why, exactly, are the terrorists bombing the Poseidon?-- How do the feds think that a lone "sea marshal" is going to thwart a terrorist plot on a ship with 3,700 people on board?-- What is a "sea marshal" anyway?-- After the ship turns over, how come the ballroom remains dry, when the deck above it is flooded?-- Why was this movie even made?I could go on and on.In short -- lame, but not a (heh) disaster. Unfortunately, it's not quite in the "so bad it's good" category. Just another sub-par TV movie, nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Example of How Directors can't direct (these days)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've noticed, in the last 5 years or so, that many directors (and I suppose script writers have to take some of the blame) have no idea how to create suspense and tension. This movie is yet another example of such poor skill. For example, the capsizing, which is supposed to be a pivot point in the plot, is instead treated as yet just another minor scene. Post flip-over people fall from the ceiling in the background-like big fat rain drops-while characters are chatting in the foreground. Another opportunity for drama and pathos lost in the world of cheese. In the original (which really isn't that good of a film either, to be frank) we along with the stranded characters didn't know if any rescue was coming, yet in this film that thread of suspense is completely removed: we see the rather inept rescue as it begins from the get go.The dialog is bad, the effects bad to just okay, the acting nothing impressive, really just local dinner theater level, all topped off with offensive stereotypes. And, as usual, the so called morally upright survive while the rather more human don't. All in all the result is pathetic, silly, and totally unnecessary. And to think NBC pre-empted "Law and Order: Criminal Intent" for this pile of junk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so Irwin Allen HIMSELF would call this one a stinker. I have seen better developed characters on Sylvan Learning Center commercials. I mean, who wrote this?? AND WHY?? Now, the original, for its time, was FUN!! Everyone was into the disaster movies (See the Irwin Allen comment). But, this one. First of all, did anyone ever figure out WHY they bombed the ship? Was I sleeping or did I TiVo right past it? It was good to see them "Dredge Up" some old faves from the 80's. I always wondered what happened to "C. Thomas Howell" and "Steve Guttenberg". I mean, Police Academy movies at least made you laugh.I love the scene at the end, where they are at the hull, trying to get out and they set this "Bomb" made from a keg of beer. This same bomb was so strong it cause the ship to sink, and now they set it to blow a hole in the hull. and the warning "Stand back at least 20 feet, that should be safe!" WOW!!! SOME BOMB!! The effects were VERY cruddy. I have seen better set design on "Saved by the Bell". And better ACTING!! I think the MOST offensive was the poor old woman who got to be Mrs Rosen, you know "The Shelly Winters Role". Well, she was VERY stereotypically "Jewish" to the point where it was almost disgusting. Granted, Shelly was too back in the day, but that was 1972. And she WAS Jewish.As the other reviewers have stated. There was NO suspense. The capsizing made NO logical sense. (Not that physics HAS to play a role in a disaster flick). And the performances were as best as could be expected. I think I REALLY have to blame the writers. I mean, all of these people have put in GREAT performances in OTHER movies. But, like the S.S. Poseidon, this one was doomed from the start. THANK GOD WE Don't HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO A REMAKE OF THE SEQUEL!!!! This does not bode well for the upcoming Kurt Russell "Blockbuster" due next spring. "Poseidon" has more money behind it, but how many ways can you escape from a sinking ship? In this case, I wanted to be one of the passengers who drowned early in the film. "TELL MY FAMILY I LOVE THEM, and I'm SORRY I AGREED TO BE IN THIS PILE OF EXCREMENT!!" Now for a moment of silence for all those lost to BAD WRITING..........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you expect from a made for TV movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only seen the ending of the original, so I will not be making comparisons to it in this review.First off, this is a made for TV movie, which generally don't carry the big budgets that a theatrical release would have. I am not even going to bother to try to convert the dollar in 2005 to the dollar in 1972, but what I will say is there were probably corners cut that would be completely unacceptable in a theater version.With that said, it is understandable but not unforgivable on why this is just a bad movie. The special effects were OK...nothing that really stood out, and probably was really the only thing that could be considered redeemable about it.Dr. Seuss probably could have come up with better dialogue, and these actors probably took a few too many lessons from William Shattner on over acting. It probably didn't help though that none of the actors seemed interested in the parts that they played.Here's the real sad thing though. NBC couldn't come up with something on their own merrit and had to resort to reinterpreting a film that some people consider to be a real disaster movie classic. Once you have the combination of poor acting, poor writing, and zero creativity, you end up with a bigger disaster than the S.S. Poseidon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to give this film a 3 rather than the 2 I gave the Peterson version. As horrible and laughable as the characters were I still think they were slightly less wooden and predictable than Peterson's. And I wanted to see if Steve Guttenburg would die a horrible death.I think the worst thing about the film, though, was during the capsizing. I swear that they actually doctored up footage from the 1972 film. I'd like to confirm it but I really can't bring myself to watch it again. All I kept thinking was "why?" This film is so bad I kept thinking that the producers must have been trying for a tax-loss. It takes a lot for me to sympathize with on-screen terrorists but this film did it. After the first few minutes of the film I wanted to grab a screwdriver and puncture holes in it until it sank for good. If the original ship was a grand, old lady heading for retirement then this one is the cheap, crack-ho passing out in the alley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really awful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the 1972 movie. I was to young to have seen it in the theater, but have watched it on TV. I'm sorry to say the remake is awful. The acting is bad, A bomb blows up and capsizes the luxury liner is just laughable. The original film was capsized by a title wave which is more believable. The TV version was 3 hours including commercials. Why ? The remake has some of the same characters as the original and even some of the same scenes, minus the terrorists. This remake has many has been stars like Guttenburg, Hauer, Weller to name a few. I hope the 2006 version (Poseiden) is much better. The special effects were pretty good for TV. The liner upside was pretty fake though. Rent the original, its great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thing had 'first draft' written all over it. A prologue that takes away any suspense, a new way of capsizing that doesn't make any sense, completely unnecessary subplots and an excruciatingly drawn out 'climax'. The original had a scene where one character goes off alone, valiantly sacrificing themselves on a one-way trip. In this remake they're accompanied by someone else, making the sacrifice totally unnecessary and robbing the scene of any power! It's so bad that some characters at the end of the movie (in another unnecessary subplot) sit around literally looking at their watches in the middle of the 'climax'. Rutger has the only half decent performance, and struggles valiantly with the lines he's given. Utterly woeful. Very worthy of the names Guttenberg and Baldwin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original 72' film I was looking forward to this miniseries - how disappointing. The premise was quite good (although poorly executed) about terrorists on board blowing a hole in the hull of the S.S. Poseidon. After that, it's flail city as a bunch of has-beens and never-was actors slip and slide along walls, ceilings and staterooms. Steve Guttenberg gives arguably the worst performance in his not-so illustrious career as a weak, philandering husband of Alexa Hamilton. Bryan Brown and Tinarie Van Wyk-Loots play a TV producer and a reality TV singer respectively with little conviction. Brown's character even asks the little brat (the son of Guttenberg &amp; Hamilton) to film their escape. The CG effects are average (especially when the boat starts to capsize the water in the pool stays put ?!?). Without an all-star cast there is no building tension in the entire production. Even if you ignore the gaping holes in the story (the group climb three decks and are swimming underwater while the ballroom is still dry) the editing is so bad that you are not sure where they are in the ship or how they even get to the hull. When one of the characters asks where to tie the end of the rope I felt like saying "how about the scriptwriters neck?" The one bright spot in the whole mess is Alexa Hamilton as Rachel Clarke. Her performance (while not spectacular) manages to convey her bitterness at her two-timing husband while trying to keep her family together (if you ignore the hokey bit where she sends an e-mail Christmas list as a may-day). 2 stars for Alexa, that's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Poseidon Adventure" was exactly that - an adventure, and for audiences, it really was new and exciting.This "new" version fails to be either "new" or exciting from the start. It relies so heavily on stereotypical cliché characters and plot lines, that, as another reviewer implied, they could just as well have had labels written on their foreheads.Shamefully, this reliance on stereotyping bleeds over into the story itself. Blatant racial profiling seems to be given a big thumbs up by the lead character. The "sea marshal" on board (Adam Baldwin) explains to the ship's security guy that in selecting suspects to keep an eye on from the list of ship's employees, he always follows the most obvious leads to their conclusion. The "moral" of his lesson? If you have a middle-Eastern or other "suspicious" sounding name, or your skin is the wrong colour, watch out, you're probably a terrorist.Of course, turns out he's exactly right in this super-simplified piece of trash. And the terrorist characters don't just look evil, they bend over backwards to look evil. Perhaps the director was concerned that they may not be sufficiently recognizable as terrorists since they weren't wearing all the overdone headgear that the terrorists wore during the earlier terrorism-plotting scenes.Certain characters also have an interesting habit of giving long, disapproving looks of contempt to others who are clearly less worthy of salvation than themselves. Of course plenty of films have flawed characters who are found wanting in various ways, but there's something about the smarmy judgementalism in this film that just detracts from the characters who display it.Young children might get something from this (though I'm not sure exactly whether it would be anything intellectually or morally healthy), but it rarely reaches beyond infantile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Putch (who starred as Sean Brody in Jaws 3D) directed this Hallmark mini-series based on the novel by Paul Gallico and Irwin Allen's production of The Poseidon Adventure. The story concerns itself with the luxury liner S.S. Poseidon which is destined to be capsized when terrorists detonate an explosive device in the cargo hold and a handful of survivors who must transverse the dangerous path up to the hull if they hope to escape before the ship sinks. This quality television movie benefits from a strong cast including Rutger Hauer, C. Thomas Howell, Adam Baldwin and Steve Guttenberg capably playing out the melodrama and plight of their characters in a believable fashion. The Poseidon Adventure may not be the classic the original was or as spectacular as Wolfgang Petersen's remake the following year but it's a solid entertainment for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film totally lacks the fire of the 1972 original.Rutger Hauer, cast in the Gene Hackman role of the priest, is definitely miscast here. Based on his past performances, you would expect Hauer to be dressed up as a terrorist since a terrorist act has been committed on the boat. That is not the case here. In fact, Hauer lacks the emotional impact of Hackman who questioned his faith after witnessing so many horrors on the boat.The same may be said for Sylvia Syms, who has the Shelley Winters role of Belle Rosen. In this version, Manny Rosen, who was played by Jack Albertson so beautifully in the original, is already dead when the picture begins. Syms gives a totally lackluster performance. Even when she turns over her jewelry to be given to her grandson, there is so little emotion shown.To qualify for the modern scene, this time around a terrorist bomb goes off on the ship creating the havoc. You needed more than that here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked up this copy of The Poseidon Adventure as part of a four pack for five bucks. I was curious because of so many of the almost great actors that was listed that I've haven't seen in a while.First of all, I'm not going to compare this to the original 1972 version. Nor the recent remake. I think that any movie should be critiqued as a stand alone for its own merits. So, as far as the acting goes, I enjoyed it. Rutger Hauer, Adam Baldwin, C. Thomas Howell, Steve Guttenberg, Bryan Brown and even Peter Weller put on an enjoyable performance. I like the fact that it was set in a more modern times with a more modern ship, the Poseidon of 1972 was an older ship on her last legs with a host of mechanical problems, and even with the element of the terrorist. But where this one fell short was; 1. The blast would never have caused that ship to capsize. Their explanations in the film were very weak and untrue.2. All modern ships have water tight integrity. While the ship was underway the water tight integrity would have been set and even if that ship capsized it would have stilled floated for weeks to come.3. Little incidentals like the Naval Captain that wore Commander Insignias. Chief Petty Offices that looked like that still had to rub cream on their face and call the cat in to "shave".The blast though that capsized the ship was the biggest blunder. I was laughing at that. If the director has used the terrorist and those blast to cripple the ship and the steering and then use a handy tsunami to capsize the ship then the movie would have been more believe able and enjoyable.So to any one that wants to watch this movie, watch it for the actors; but not for the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very weak remake of 70s classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clichés abound like faux Father Christmases in December in this extremely weak remake of the 1972 movie which, when all is said in done, spawned a Hollywood love affair with disaster flicks which continues to this day.The problem, of course, is that everything resembling an original idea has evidently been long exhausted. So what do we get in the space of a few months? Not one, but two, rehashes of the Poseidon Adventure. Put together, the two cannot hold a candle to the original.The first and most obvious cliché is that inevitable phenomenon of our post 9/11 world - the terrorist plot. Exactly why terrorists wanted to blow up the good ship Poseidon is something I have already forgotten. Which leads me to one of the biggest flaws in a seriously flawed production. The characters are so poorly sketched that you don't really give a stuff about who is doing what, or why.I watched this in its mini-series format, spread out over two nights, which of course didn't help. The whole premise is so weak that after 24 hours I had already forgotten almost all of part one. One thing that does stick in my mind is how ludicrously miscast Rutger Hauer is as a bishop, presumably reviving more-or-less the role played with such Godfearing gusto by Gene Hackman in 1972. At least, though, Hauer makes some attempt at injecting a bit of passion into his part, even if he is utterly the wrong actor for the job. Most of the rest of the cast goes through the motions as best as could be expected from a C-Grade crowd, looking for all the world as if they are doing whatever needs to be done to ensure a pay cheque and stuff-all else.The capsizing scene actually isn't bad. It's no worse than what we see in the woefully disappointing "Poseidon" which followed a few months later, and in some ways the made-for-TV effort is actually better than its big-screen successor. But that is saying very little, and ultimately the "Poseidon Adventure" 2005 is a mess, drawn out, poorly cast, woefully written, and about as gripping as a slap in the face with a dead goldfish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got the wrong movie. I thought I was getting the recent theatrical remake of the old Poseidon Adventure, but I got this one instead. While it is not awful, it definitely has a 'made for TV' look and feel to it. There are some pretty seasoned actors in it --Adam Baldwin, Rutger Hauer, Steve Guttenberg (hasn't aged well), Bryan Brown, C. Thomas Howell, Peter Weller -- but they can only do so much with the script.In most respects this is the traditional Poseidon story. A cruise ship full of happy passengers gets into a bind and soon everyone finds themselves upside down. The movie then becomes a test to see who can survive. The 'twist' which is a reflection of the mood of the world right now -- terrorism being responsible for the mishap. Not a very bad movie, just not a very good one.SPOILERS. The terrorists manage to sneak explosive devices on the ship disguised as beer kegs. Each has a bar code strip over the window that is used via a remote to trigger the countdown mechanism. |The US Marshall on-board gets suspicious and manages to shoot some of the terrorists before they have a chance to detonate their bombs. So, instead of the ship sinking, which was the plan, it only capsized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to negotiate, no, beg my family to let me watch this TV-remake over all their favourite TV shows. Now I am regretting that decision.I must say, I have never really hated a film, just disliked it. This has to be one of those on the "hate" list. I don't even know where to start! The characters are so 2-dimensional. You'd may as well watch the paint peel on the hull of the ship than see their often campy, crappy dialogue. It had to be the special effects that did it for me. Based on a real ship, I think, I thought the new look over the 70's original was really good. I liked the fact they had brought it into the 21st century. But when I saw the terrorist plot, I said "uh-oh". The plot was to sink the ship. They didn't just do that, they sunk the whole TV show. How could a small hole in the ship tip the whole thing over? Titanic had a hole in it, yet it never rolled. (Not to mention Titanic had better graphics, and it was made in 1997!). I remember watching the capsize scene in disbelief. It was stupid! Everyone followed the motion of the ship, or should I say walked to the other side of the room, waiting for it to "roll". The actors and extras knew this was going to happen, you saw them practically waiting for the first sign of the ship tipping, then they all ran to the edge, running up the walls as the ship went over. Practically nothing hit anyone. Sure, one woman held onto a table, yippee! I also remember seeing the swimming pool tip. I never saw -any- water come out of it. I was like "huh? Isn't water supposed to be in there?" But enough about the bad stuff. Let's focus on the positives shall we? Oh, there aren't any, my bad!</fullReview>

It has no scale; no suspense; no characters that we can relate to, or sympathize with. The music sucks. Likewise, most of the acting. There are no bravura performances, such as the one Gene Hackman delivered in the original with his portrayal of the radical, ultimately doomed, Reverend Scott.What the film does have is a sophomoric script that is reinforced with layer upon adamantine layer of filler. The end result is less Poseidon Adventure, and more of a patriotic send-up of Homeland Security.In truth, this was so horrible, I wonder if the production team ever saw (or cared to see) the original.Such a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was made for TV. I understand that it could not possibly have the visual impact of the 1972 version. Still, a good script and good acting can make up for that. This 3 hour disaster, unfortunately, had neither.The only resemblance this unfortunate offering has to the novel it was supposedly "based on" is its title. While I must give credit to the writers for attempting to include some of the sleaze factor that made the characters in the novel more human and less "camp" than those in the 1972 blockbuster, they just didn't pull it off.The terrorist plot which results in the capsize of the ship (which, incidentally, completely ignores the laws of physics) is unexplained. Is this act by two-dimensional, vaguely "Arab" characters supposed to make us angry, in a post-911-flag-waving sort of way? Yawn. There is none of the suspense, none of the fear, none of the comic relief of the original novel.This ship was sunk not by terrorists, but by the preachy, long-winded orations of the undeveloped characters and a plodding, disjointed plot line which takes us nowhere but down.</fullReview>

As the first of many fatal errors, they decided for this goofy remake to change the catastrophe from a rogue wave, an event of sheer natural force actually capable of delivering enough power to capsize a full sized ocean liner into a terrorist bomb, probably the dumbest thing imaginable to have placed into a movie and expect the audience to believe that it could flip the ship over.Consider, if you will, the Lusitania, which was shot by a German torpedo in almost the exact same spot that the terrorist bomb exploded in this movie. A hole was torn in the hull very similar to the one torn in the Poseidon here, and despite having been much better built than the Titanic, which took hours to sink despite having been perforated all along one side by the iceberg, the Lusitania sank in less than fifteen minutes. When a ship experiences a breach in the hull like that, needless to say, it tends to sink because water flows in, making the bottom of the ship too heavy to stay afloat. This movie wants you to believe that the part of the ship suddenly pulling the ship underwater has miraculously decided to spin up into the air, submerging its lightest side. The logic here is the same that will allow a bowl made of solid lead and filled with marshmallows to suddenly flip upside down. Sigh.The groan inducing performances are equaled only by the astonishingly bad special effects, particularly the exterior shots. I'd rather they had gone with miniatures rather than such god awful CGI. Also, if you happen to get this from Netflix, pay no attention to the 2 hr. label. It's in two parts and each is 90 minutes long. Torturous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the law of the sea, not to mention physics, that you should not overload a vessel, nor for that matter render it top heavy. Alas, it is not an obvious bit of logic that is well heeded by certain filmmakers. And the bigger the boat, it seems, the greater the eagerness to pack the excess cargo high and heavy, disregarding the reality that such actions will, if not sink the ship, at least slow it down considerably.Alas, no matter how rough the seas, the mighty sailing men of Hollywood never seem to grasp the logic of such mathematics. Case in point: this wholly unnecessary and pointless TV remake of the great popcorn classic THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. Among many of the flaws in this leaky tub of a movie is that, because it was made for television, it has been hopelessly padded to extend its length. The reasoning for this is purely commercial: The longer the movie, the more commercial ads that the broadcasters can shoehorn into the allotted time. Say what you will about Irwin Allen's 1972 original -- sappy, silly, hokey, whatever -- it is undeniably one of the most efficiently told films of its era. The filmmakers waste little time getting through the mandatory introductions of the characters, getting the ship to go belly-up and the climb for survival underway.The TV remake plods along for nearly a third of its running time introducing its trite cast of characters, not one of whom is worth knowing in the first place. Tiresomely nondescript, the characters don't even have the benefit of being embodied by movie stars, or for that matter even television favorites. Celebrity casting may have been a mere gimmick during the heyday of the Disaster Movie, but it was also clever storytelling. No need to waste time developing characters when the casting of a Roddy McDowall or a Red Buttons or a Shelley Winters instantly brought on board a ready-made persona or at least the spark of comfortable recognition. But what can you say when the biggest star in this cast is Steve Guttenberg? The makers of this remake don't even have faith in their material. Apparently a natural disaster taking thousands of lives isn't exciting enough, so the tidal wave of the original film has been replaced with an attack by some generic terrorists. Which, I suppose, makes this a remake of 1976's JUGGERNAUT as well. Certainly all the cloak-and-dagger plotting is supposed to build suspense, and it might, if we didn't know in advance the true fate awaiting the SS Poseidon.Whatever the case, all the excess cargo adds no pleasure to this cruise and the vessel sinks long before the big wave good-bye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OMG What a Disaster of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this one because of both fond memories of the first PA, and the fact that there were the same strong values shown as in the original. Someone managed to make a movie with a priest and a Homeland Security agent that weren't somehow the objects of deliberate ridicule.But the cheesiness simply proliferated until it got out of hand, unsalvageable by the second rate special effects. This is one of those movies that is probably best watched with a group of friends who enjoy making funny remarks at all the plot holes and ridiculous assumptions.To begin with, the idea that a hole created by a small shaped charge can capsize a ship the size of the Poseidon as quickly as it does is simply absurd. The ship would list for hours before flipping. But it gets much better. Where is the storm? There is continual talk in the movie of a huge storm, by the Poseidon's crew, the trawler crew, and the Navy. On the satellite there is what appears to be cloud cover in the area. Yet we never see so much as a drop of rain or a gusty breeze. In fact in the outdoor shots most of the time it looks like there are scattered clouds. Except when there are not.One would expect a group of passengers desperately trying to get off the ship to constantly try to move, and conserve energy when resting. But there seems to be time for long and rather pointless dialogue at every turn in the escape route. The kid with the camera is utterly annoying.Apparently the director thinks we haven't had enough of it because by the end of the film, with everyone talking about how every second counts and worried about imminent destruction, there is time for an endless series of minidramas on a metal catwalk. The catwalk is situated over a fiery inferno, but apparently the metal never heats up because people can walk hand and knee across it without a problem, and even hang from it without so much as a blister forming on their hands. And, of course, each person that walks across consumes the efforts of the entire group. One might suppose that the first ones across would immediately begin looking for the second charge, but no. They sit their like boobs and wait and watch as each person has their dramatic bit in crossing the catwalk. The camera boy, who zipped up and down the Christmas tree like a little monkey suddenly freezes. Long speeches are made while the Seals floating around fret about the imminence of their demise.The whole concept of a second bomb is a preposterous device in and of itself -- apparently they were looking for a way to stretch the movie out further. Imagine that rather than clearing a bit of debris out of the first hole they decided to find another charge, wire it, and blow a whole new hole that is miraculously clear of any debris.The hole is blown in the ship, and the debris manages to completely miss the SEALS in rubberized rafts waiting right outside the blast zone. In fact the blast hole rim is not even warm, and the explosion appears to have left no real debris at all. Nice and tidy indeed. And here is the ship from the outside, which does not appear to have sunk much at all from a few hours earlier in the movie. Yet moments later it dives into the briny. I am no expert in aquatic balance and equilibrium but it is hard to fathom (cough) how the forces of gravity would cause a perfect dive of this nature.Overall, an inadvertently funny movie. Unfortunately, I don't think that was what was intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intellect Insultingly Poor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was recently screened on UK TV and we got the full whack, four hour mini series. I believed I approached viewing the TV TPA in the right frame of mind as I had read many reviews on here and was aware that my expectations should not be high.Even so, the end result of four Wednesday evenings was a mind-numbing bore. I am a big fan of the original and am looking forward to the 2006 theatrical remake, however this version was lame-brained and insulting to the intelligence.Hallmark Entertainment is renowned for third-rate, low budget drama and this was no exception. The CGI varied from reasonable to rubbish, the external capsize sequences being the better of the bunch. The sets however looked cheap and wooden which coupled with poor lighting gave the whole "low budget" aura! But the biggest failings were by far the screenplay, associated acting, story and editing. This was "Writing Drama for Beginners" material, with the assumption that the writers have actually failed the course. The fact that the scriptwriters were paid for this junk is an insult to anyone in paid employment. Every cringe making cliché in movie history was wheeled out and delivered through gritted teeth. There was no imagination in any line nor any attempt at realistic dialogue. It could not have been worse!! The acting itself varied for "passibly competent" to "utterly appalling." Falling squarely into the latter category was Mr Steve Guttenberg whose performance was more wooden than a timber yard. Peter Weller spent most of his shortish role looking like he'd wished he'd never agreed to the part! British actor Clive Mantle made past roles in "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Casualty" look positively Oscar winning! Most of the rest did as best they could with the material provided.The story itself was more catastrophic than the events being portrayed. Perhaps the Hallmark execs simply are not familiar with the concept of "suspension of disbelief" but events in this film beggared belief! Firstly of course was the ludicrous replacement of a tidal wave with terrorists. This relates to the next part, a 136,000 ton cruise liner rolling over after having a 3 metre wide hole blown in its stern!! I'm no naval architect, but even I can spot the even bigger hole in the plot! But it's the survivors reaching an inverted internet café after the capsize, powering up a PC and sending an email for help when any vague semblance of credibility runs screaming from the room! Desperate attempts to recreate scenes from the 1972 original grate on the minds of those familiar with the film and added no value to the whole debacle.Finally, the editing ensured that any hint of suspense was destroyed, key scenes were played out far longer than needed, particularly the last scene in the engine room. Couple this with no attempt at continuity, which included two groups of survivors going in different direction yet meeting back up and satellite images showing the ship sinking when it wasn't, and the finished result is a totally shambolic mess.By all means watch it if you want, just be forewarned!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sink, sank, sunk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment! I really like the 1972 film with Gene Hackman, not so much the bloated remake, but this is by far the worst of anything to do with The Poseidon Adventure. Granted, the production values are great on the whole, but everything else sinks faster than you can shout anchor.Pace is a huge problem with this. The Poseidon Adventure(2005) is incredibly dull, with over an hour of sluggish pacing and little else. It does try to liven things up towards the end, but in the process trying too hard and trying to do too much. The story is very hackneyed, at first it seems as though it never leaves the deck then later on it feels bloated, also it is completely devoid of suspense, poignancy and foreboding. I would blame some of the plot additions for this, especially the terrorist one, which was stupid and added nothing to the story.The Poseidon Adventure also feels very under-directed. Never in a TV series/movie have I seen a more soulless and clumsy directing job. And the dialogue is dreadful, often convoluted, very silly and unsure of which direction it wants to go. The acting doesn't fare that much better, Adam Baldwin and Steve Guttenberg are decent actors but because of the material being so poor not to mention their badly written and thoroughly unlikeable characters they and all the actors for that matter deserve much better than this.Overall, had potential but ended up being a shipwreck. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. The plot was not well executed, the acting sucked and the graphics were so unbelievable. There were parts in this movie that made no sense and when you saw them it took you out of the movie. For example, there is a scene where the windows break in the ballroom and water comes rushing in. However, when the passengers are scrambling to escape, they look like they're walking in two feet of water for a couple of minutes! In reality, they would have been literally swept off their feet because of so much water coming in.Also, there was a character who walks out of a room, barefoot, then of course, slices his foot. Who walks barefoot when they know the ship is upside down with unknown objects in his walking path!? But, that was to set up a "dramatic" scene where he steals shoes off of a dead persons feet so he "can survive." Oh Puh-lease! Another part that bothered me, but wasn't a big deal, had to do with a little boy and a video camera permanently attached to his hand. At one point he has to swim underwater, which leads you to believe the equipment would of course be damaged, but nope! At the very end he whips out his camera and tapes the ship slowly sinking. Uh! Like I said, if you can't believe it to be real, then it becomes a terrible movie.Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time on this.</fullReview>

Couldn't afford to make the tidal wave? A terrorist plot...that is the most stupid idea ever. Oh and thanks for giving them an idea how to really blow up a ship. I hope the Director of Homeland Security watched this so he could get an idea that YOU guys just put into the terrorists heads. I don't think they need any help. Thank goodness you had a gratuitous sex scene in the movie...a little T &amp; A goes a long way. However, next time leave Steve G. out of it. What scares me is next year 2006 they are releasing a new movie titled what "Posiden". This movie has real actors and probably a better budget. I hope this movies follows through with the actual Posiden Adventure. Lastly, I think the TV producers knew about the 2006 movie and pushed to release this garbage. Hopefully this garbage doesn't affect the movie's release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe one day this thing will be fun to sit and watch with the 1972 original film, like I have done "Five Came Back" &amp; "Back From Eternity" or the two versions of "I Saw What You Did and I Know Who You Are" but that isn't now.I was surprised when I saw the original after a good fifteen year gap and saw how dated it had become, and overacted.But it had some good moments too; Winters' swim, but I loved Red Buttons' breaking up Hackman and Borgnine with "we'd all feel a lot better if you two would stop yelling at one another!" None of this was in this version.And clearly to watch this one, there was some intention that you had to be aware of the original, otherwise how would anyone have known who Manny Rosen was? Not that he was just Belle Rosen's husband, but who else were you supposed to have seen when she talked (too much) about Manny, but Jack Albertson? I didn't understand that this movie was supposed to be based more on the book. The father in the book had committed adultery, but it was another character who was traveling with his mistress.All the characters in the first movie were from the book.But in this film, characters died at the same points that they did in the original; the smokestack, after the swim, two died at the catwalk.In the book, belle Rosen would die just before the rescue and no one fell down the smokestack.In the book, the boy was lost in the ship, not to be found, but in this remake, he survives just as he did in the original film.So this movie was based more on the first movie than it was the book.I got half an impression that there was some intention that Mike Rogo get his own series from this, much like there seemed to be some intention from the horrible recent Carrie telemovie remake with Carrie and Sue Ross going across the country like Bill Bixby in the Hulk.Interestingly, this is what Paul Gallico's written sequel did; Mike Rogo and Manny Rosen returned to the ship it seems.This didn't happen in the movie sequel.Funny thing is, the remake could have taken all those characters removed from the book and put them in this movie, making a completely separate film.About five or six years ago, after Titanic mania, two soap operas would do their own ship disasters.One, As The World Turns, was terrible as well. They showed no ship, and the sinking consisted of the lights blinking and sparking and sections of ceiling falling here and there (never did understand that). We didn't even see a lifeboat or anyone in much water.But the other, the cancelled Sunset Beach, did a dead-on takeoff of Poseidon with Bernie Kopell (Dr. Adam Bricker from Love Boat) as the doomed captain on deck, and it was excellent.I guess the cookie cutter characters in a soap opera looked so awkward in the concept of an upside-down ship that they made it all the more suspenseful.There was also a jilted husband wielding a sword and a villianess reporter who was attacked by a shark (supposedly killed, she would return later on on land with a fake leg) but it worked better than this thing did.Sunset Beach's offering would get a special hour showing in primetime. Pity it will never be seen again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This television version of the classic POSEIDON ADVENTURE(1972)is really not as bad as one might think. The SS Poseidon luxury liner is in the Indian Ocean on a New Years cruise, when it succumbs to a terrorist attack. The first of three well placed bombs on board turns the ship topsy-turvy. A homeland security agent(Adam Baldwin) and a priest(Rutger Hauer)guide a small group of survivors through the upside down, sinking cruise liner. F/X in the large part is the real star of the show. The cast may be better looking than talented. Notables being: C. Thomas Howell, Bryan Brown, Steve Guttenberg, Amber Sainsbury, Natalie Boltt and Alex Kingston. This sinker is not a total stinker.

		<fullReview>Normally I do not like remakes! But - this is an exception to the rule.OK - so there is no tidal wave ? but there is a modern slant on things and they have used a terrorist threat. By doing this, it is not just a 'copy' of an old film.I loved the way that the main characters were introduced at the beginning of the film - quite a novel idea.I thought Rutger Hauer was a great improvement on Gene Hackman - a lot more believable as the Bishop. It is so good to see more of such a great actor. C. Thomas Howell was the Doctor and played the part very well. This was the first time that he had met Rutger Hauer since the film The Hitcher - I wonder he felt! It was said back then that he was a little afraid of Mr Hauer in that film! Sylvia Syms was superb as Belle Rosen even though I was a little fed up with her antidotes about her late Husband - but that is a personal view.Considering that this was a TV movie I think it was very well made. The cast are to be really admired considering that they spent so much of their time in the water and in wet clothes.What a shame there is another remake out later this year, this great TV movie is going to be forgotten all too soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember much about the original because it has been so many years. But surely it was better than this. The sight of a man falling through a stained glass window (one of the clips shown numerous times over the years) seemed much more exciting the first time around.If this version had any redeeming qualities, it was the story of the troubled Clarke family. Teenage daughter Shelby was cute when she complained and when she fell for the doctor immediately. Later her skills as a nursing student proved valuable. I really liked her younger brother Dylan as he tried to film what was happening on the ship. The parents bickered like any couple having a hard time, and we found out their marriage may have been in real trouble.I also liked Bishop Schmidt and sort of liked the romantic storyline (assuming he wasn't Catholic, though he probably was) with Belle Rosen.The woman in charge of the rescue operation, whose name I don't remember, had such a wonderful attitude. Regardless of how many people are saved, it's a tragedy if any die. The actress playing her was good.The first five minutes were a waste, though, with the type violence one might find in the movies of Jean-Claude Van Damme. I can't really evaluate the quality of what happened after the terrorist act which, combined with some poor judgment by the captain during a storm, led to you-know-what. For one thing, my NBC signal wasn't good that night. From what I could tell, nothing was spectacular. The rescue efforts by those on the ship and outside the ship were interesting at best. I really got tired of the fighting over who was in charge.The only purpose for a remake was introducing modern technology. Not really worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sequel Never Equals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great fan of the 1972 hit and had a bias going into this movie. First of all, it was made for TV and was presented by the same network that gave us "10.5" and "Asteroid". I also did not recognize most of the cast and those that I did, I thought had left acting for the infomercial industry.The CGI effects were cheap, at best. As the Poseidon capsized, it looked like a cartoon. I did like the effect of switching from the ballroom to the kitchen to the ship. But it did not show many of the characters falling and sliding during the capsizing. If you remember from the 1972 movie, there were close-ups (even if for a few seconds) on each major character (except Roddy McDowell and Leslie Nielsen). Also in the 1972 movie, the ship was very dark after it capsized. In this version, it looked like there were more lights on in the ballroom after the ship capsized than when it was upright! Now the script?..what a yawn! I could not care less about any of the characters. When any of them died, I said "hmm" instead of "damn!" And showing the rescue effort took away from the claustrophobia and feeling of doom of the original picture.There were two groups of survivors, the first group did a fire walk, crawled up the steam pipe and swam under water. The second group seems to have found a short cut around all that and ended up near the big hole with the first group within a few minutes of leaving their drowning shipmates in the dining room.If you are going to do a sequel, then either go all the way with the characters from the original (e.g. "Psycho") or have all new characters. Don't go half-way with some new characters with the same names and issues as the original characters. And please don't use lines verbatim from the original movie (I was expecting Sylvia Sims to pull out the Hebrew symbol for "life" and hand it to the bishop) In looking at the IMDb file on the cast, I noticed that the actresses who played the "homewrecker" and the French singer are both South African. The Poseidon was leaving from South Africa. These characters could have worked as well if they were South African. I also thought that in the 33 years since the original, the new cast would be more diverse. But the bad guys were Middle Eastern, the heroes were American, the by-the-book-crew was British, and everyone was white.I will have to remember next time I am on a cruise to take my thumb-drive with Christmas card list so in case the ship capsizes, I can hang upside down and send an S.O.S. to them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame the screenwriter and director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, a movie like the Poseidon Adventure is almost impossible to screw up. Put a bunch of well known faces on the screen in a life or death situation and you should have something compelling and interesting. Sadly, this is not the case in this below average remake. That's because the script never developed the characters enough to allow us to empathize with or feel for them. The death of Mrs. Rosen is a prime example: in the original it made you cry, not only for her, but for her husband and Gene Hackman's Reverand Scott. Here, she was a widow who's only contribution was to udder silly reminisces about her dead husband Manny. Her death was like "Goodbye Mrs. Rosen, we hardly knew yee", as Rutger Haurer's character appears only mildy disturbed, as if her death is an unneeded distraction. Furthermore, the direction was unsuccessful in creating the suspense and sense of impending doom that dominated the original. There is no conflict or tension between the characters like in the first either, mainly because there is no definitive leader of the group akin to Reverand Scott. What it comes down to is you can't have a disaster movie where you can't relate to the characters and fully appreciate the danger they're in. That's what it's about. Any discussion of special effects and the plausibility of the plot is just ancillary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The point of any made-for-TV movie, particularly one to be shown during November sweeps, is to entertain and draw in viewers. This one has succeeded as far as I am concerned. It has the standard set of flaws common to nearly all made-for-TV movies -- substandard writing, cheesy effects and an overall lingering sense of unrealism -- but criticizing it on that basis, while valid, is trivial. People don't really watch Sunday night TV unless they don't have much anything better to do anyway. So I look at this movie in terms of what it was trying to accomplish, and its intended audience -- and the fact of the matter is, it worked for me.Apparently, Austrailian views saw this movie well before we in the States did, so this positive review may not apply, and you should feel free to remove four or five stars.

		<shortDescription>One of those "eh" films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me just say people overreact ridiculously to this film. I've seen it a number of times in the past few years, so I know it well enough to know it isn't the worst film in the world. However, that's not to say it isn't bad, or isn't laughable at times. This is one of those films that's fun to put on on one of those "curl up on the couch and watch a bad movie" sort of day.For those familiar with the classic disaster film "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972) or the most recent remake "Poseidon" (2006), it's the same story - on New Years Eve, a cruise ship capsizes while hundreds of people celebrate the holiday in the ship's ballroom. A group of them decide that, instead of sitting and waiting for help, to climb up, through, and find a way out of the ship before it sinks would be the smarter idea. The original film was a massive smash hit that can be claimed to be the "classic" disaster film. Sure, there were disaster films before that, but the original film is what set the genre in motion. Certainly without it, films like "The Towering Inferno", "Titanic", "The Day After Tomorrow" might not have never existed.So what do we have here? Like most NBC projects, you've got a great idea, a decent cast who desperately needs direction, yet you hire a terrible director and an even worse screenwriter. I'm going to start and say this - the writing in this film is an absolute joke. It's hard to believe that, at some points, the director didn't have scenes cut or the studio didn't step in and stop things from going bad to worse.There's a hilarious attempt at "realism" here. The original film has the ship capsizing due to a massive tsunami wave - unlikely, yes, but explained well enough so it's passable. But this... I'm not sure why they did what they did here. Instead of a massive wave, it's a terrorist attack. Stay with me here - terrorists are working on the ship and have bombs hidden in kegs of beer, yet only one bomb detonates on one side of the ship, and we get a bunch of bull---t science exposition about how it "can happen" even though it'd be obvious to an eight grade student it can't happen. This idea backfired sharply.We've actually got some veteran actors here, and some aren't bad. Rutger Hauer, who does well with what he's given. Adam Baldwin shows his teeth a lot. Steve Guttenberg being Steven Guttenberg. Alexa Hamilton gives everyone bizarre looks as she turns her head slowly (about eight times in the film). C. Thomas Howell, however, is the most natural at what he's given and does fine. The younger actors, however, are literally CRYING for some direction here, but it's like the director is just sitting back and eating a taco while watching his film sink. It's awful to see at parts. The characterization... wow. Not only are the majority of characters uninteresting, the ones that have potential to be interesting are either annoying, one-dimensional, or begin to do things that have no real purpose. None of the characters ever act like they're in a disaster. It just seems like they're going through a haunted house at Six Flags. Belle Rosen starts nearly every sentence she says with "My husband Manny..." and goes to worship him like he's the sun god or something. The good characters are good, the bad characters are bad, and there's very little in between.And for a disaster film, there's no tension or horror. It's really, really easy to figure out who's going to get killed off in the main group - character's with few lines, or with little to do. It's really as if they had little left to do with the characters and just killed them off for the "shock value", but considering they die and no one ever mentions them again, it's a bit pointless. We also, for the first time, get to see the rescue operations taking place outside of the ship. This adds an extra 20 minutes in run-time with a bunch of characters we don't care about (but they try to get us to) and takes away any mystery if there's help outside of the ship. A big plus the 1972 film had was that it focused on what was happening inside the ship and only that - we had no idea if there was help outside at all. Was it all worth it in the end? Did it all come to a dead end? , in this film, you KNOW who's going to live and who's going to die. NO risks are taken.Now don't get me wrong, this film does have quite a bit of positive aspects to it. For a TV miniseries, the effects are quite good. Surprisingly good in some scenes, in fact (and surprisingly bad in other scenes - it's odd). The set pieces are well done, such as the ballroom and some other places. A lot of it seems to be like they modeled after Cruise Ship Tycoon or something, but it's passable. There's also some clever references to the original novel here that other films haven't done yet, and some subtle references to the original film that make Poseidon fans a bit more excited. Some scenes are even very well acted and well done. The capsizing scene is quite effective as well, though a bit silly at times. Give credit where credit is due.Overall, is it good? No. Perhaps slightly enjoyable. Such a thing is rare, considering this film is pretty much hated among both the Poseidon fan community and just humankind in general, but it's fun to watch every now and again. It's quite a good lesson to aspiring filmmakers on how not to make a disaster movie.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Let's give a big Poseidon welcome," ...to this feeble turd.My mouth was hanging open. This is like a crappy movie-making master-class. OK for starters, the project is immediately being yanked in two directions - It's a grandiose, money-devouring adventure, but they'd prefer not to spend more than $12.99 on any sequence. It's supposed to be an exciting, dynamic movie but the creators heads are stuck in static, made-for-TV mode. Every second of this smells like cost-cutting. They even split the original one-two punch of the ship rolling, followed quickly by the ballroom flooding into two moments hours apart not because the narrative is improved, but to pad things.In terms of style, it doesn't have a casual or natural idea in it's three hour running time. Whatever is happening on screen is overtly introduced, and hierarchically approved by a team that is most pleased with themselves when the resulting footage is inert and generic. i.e. If you're tired of limp duct-escape sequences, somehow this move found a way to make them staler AND duller. You know something is wrong from the get-go because you're looking at some of the ugliest Bo-Rics hairstyles you've ever seen. It's like the make-up team under financial pressure gave up the fight and just told everyone to do their own hair. And there's a team of haggard looking actors who haven't had work in ten years. (Gutenberg, Hauer, C. Thomas Howell). My apologies to Adam Baldwin who is better than this. Peter Weller is looking more like Richard Widmark than anyone expected. Gutenberg is morphing into 70s actor David Groh. 40 minutes into it, it still hasn't started. An hour is gone and wasted before the show even gets rolling. Newsflash - No one tuned in for the characters or the plot. They've got the wrong look for the visuals. The initial night-shot of the ship looks like it was designed for a cruise commercial not a movie about a ship. We don't need a nineteenth flyover shot of the overturned hull. (Half the CGI budget must've been spent on these) We could sure use some thrills though. At one point there's even a ridiculous 5 second cutaway to a crappy CGI satellite (a box with lights flashing), because someone sends a fricking e-mail. I mean, really...This made-for-TV movie has a box that says WIDESCREEN edition on it (um. OK.) which it's not. This is a head-scratching lie which can only be attributed to deliberately tricking viewers into renting this, thinking they're getting the big screen remake.Thrill-proof. I've never been happier to have a F-Fwd button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a totally big fan of the original film. Nothing could beat the effects or the star power that film had. When I heard there was a TV version coming out, I sort of got worried - then a second one for theatres and I really got worried!! I saw most of the TV one - tuned in a bit late - but had to sit through it to give it a chance. No tidal wave? Where are the famous characters? Terrorists? Then I went to see the movie release only because Sheila Allen (the nurse in the original and the Mayor's wife in Towering Inferno) and Irwin Allen productions were involved. That was a bit mistake. THAT one was a waste of celluloid. A month or so ago in a $6.98 DVD bin at WallMart I found the DVD of the TV version. The selling point for me was on the cover - 40 minutes of unseen footage - it said. The price was right so I risked the purchase. Today I had nothing to do, and came across it and watched it. I can now say that this time I DID enjoy it. If I sat back and looked at it as a film on its own and not a remake of a classic, it was somewhat enjoyable. I think that missing 40 minutes made all the difference. I still think that remakes like these are not worth the time, but this one, on it's own and with the missing footage, did make a decent drama in the disaster mode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the idea of the Poseidon being capsized by terrorist is idiotic, some of the actors can not act (Shoshanna, Leo) and the script is pretty cheesy, but it has some really good actors on board, too. C. Thomas Howell is good, Rutger Hauer plays his reverend way better than Gene Hackman's overacting, Adam Baldwin is surprisingly good and the kids are not annoying (although Dylan had the premises), unlike the 80% of annoyingness of the original cast (especially NONNIE and ROBIN).Besides, the CGI is hilariously bad (the fire, the Poseidon's sinking), the dialogue is even worse, (Ren?e's 'We'll drown and get burned at the same time' takes the cake), logic takes a hike (Dylan's camera), and the acting is lacking (one of the survivors, at the end is *laughing* while the ship is sinking.It's the perfect MST3K movie; bad, but not so much as to be unbearableTPA (2005): on its own, a 4 (without Baldwin and Howell would be a 1), but as a comedy, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The popularity of the original "Poseidon Adventure" has always baffled me. Almost all of the "special" effects were on screen fairly early in the film, while the rest of the movie basically focused on a diminishing number of survivors crawling through the ship's corridors and pipes. The remake at least updated things with the terrorist plot, and there were a number of other changes from the original as well. The acting in the newer version was a trade-off--at least no one gnawed the scenery as gratingly as Shelley Winters in the original. It seems to me that one version of "Poseidon" was about as mediocre as the other. As for the "wonderful" music in the original--apparently the version I saw had a different soundtrack.</fullReview>

They Used the ship Voyager of The Seas as the SS Poseidon. The idea of terrorists is stupid, but this should have been made as a different movie. They should have done better with the capsizing scene, the ship would have sank backwards with the bombs going off in the back. The actors the director picked were OK. Don't think this is as good as the first, cause it is not. Not worth buying at wal-mart. You cant send an email when the ship is capsized. the water would have disrupted the signal. the ship lost all comunication and the email woudn't have worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Certainly Sinks the Damn Ship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the Navy Seals gets to say towards the end of the film "It's taking too long" - and he's right on the money there. This overlong version is even sillier than the original. The first film at least had a very strong cast, and despite the mouthing of some nonsense, it was put together with a degree of suspense and originality, the idea of the ship inverting. Plus the sets rather gave credibility to this concept and were well designed. Here the lesser cast (with perhaps the exception of Byran Brown) are given even sillier lines to handle, with a nice lack of continuity and poor editing. And the sets are not as effective. It simply doesn't wash, even in the ocean. While some of original storyline is kept intact, updating with terrorists and a heap of footage on the rescue attempt, cause the long sequences lose much impact especially on the small screen. We also have the most irritating child with a video camera who certainly doesn't add much to anything. Better just watch the original film and be done with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Posiedon Adventure...(without all the silly puns)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At 7 30pm last night while having dinner, i was fortunate enough to catch this new TV Movie adventure after having seen the adds calling it the "Best Thriller on TV Yet!!!" I've never seen any of the other Posiedon versions so I liked this movie from a "newbies" perspective. The plot line was very awesome and fast moving which is good when watching, unlike Titanic where you're sitting there going "Just DIE ALREADY!!!" It kept the viewer on edge and constantly glued to the screen which i found was excellent since not many movies in this day and age seem to comprehend the concept of GOOD suspense. The level of violence was another thing i liked about it, if you can sit down and have a family meal and watch this sort of thing at the same time is awesome, you get to have two good things a meal and a good movie. Many movies today turn to senseless gore for the answer of entertainment and me having a weak stomach, i don't think this is very fair. This movie opened up hope for me. Its a good movie to watch if the only other thing on television is Cricket and i'm very glad i found this movie!!! However, i do have to say a few things i saw that didn't impress me about the movie. The digital imaging left much to be desired in a few spots with the frames being visibly fake. In some places such as when the group of 11 are walking across the fire pit in the ship, i found that there was too much talking to make it seem like a real panic. By the time they all got across the ship should have sunk already. Also at the end when their all watching the ship sink, one, it sunk way to fast too quickly to have not sunk more before hand, and two as soon as the ship sunk the credits rolled... and your left wondering, is that really it? What happens??!!?!?! That is a good thing in most cases however for me its really annoying.On the whole, i liked it for a Sunday night entertainer and if movies build more on this concept in this day and age and improve further on the path that this movie is going on, i shall be much happier to actually get my moneys worth at the Cinema again...</fullReview>

The casting was solid alongside the pacing, and I felt that all of the characters were fleshed out in interesting ways. If you're going to comment, you need to evaluate this based on it's own merits, not be fanatical based on truthfulness to the original. How many times have we seen the "boat sinking" story? This new angle feels a lot more fresh and contemporary to me.So that's my two cents. At least watch it and come up with your own opinion rather than just going along with what everyone else has said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the best TV disaster movie ever. But that's not saying much. It still has it's moments of the "made for TV movie badness" with some shoddy CGI and a little bad acting (not that much). The story is pretty much the same. In this version however, terrorists blow a hole in the ship and it flips. A small group of survivors including a child, his mom, a famous French singer and her big time producer husband, an widow, the ship marshal, the terrorist, a preacher and other members of the crew then head up to safety. Meanwhile, the husband of one of the women and his lover (who were in her room) make their way to the ball room and when they get there, they too along with 2 others head up the same way. All of a sudden, a huge wave wipes out the ballroom. I'll let you figure out the rest, but only 9 people make. This movie is more character-based than the original, but is still a fitting tribute to the 1972 hay day we all know and love. Some mistakes made include not have Linda Rogo on board (everyone's favorite character in the first) and the character of Belle Rosen. Belle is a lot weaker person in this version (emotionally) and is often rambling about her late husband Manny. I still loved it and think it was worth the $10 I spent on it at Wal-Mart. There still gonna be a few people mad about this made-for-TV flick, but who can blame them? STILL BETTER THAN BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE!</fullReview>

Painfully written for the same lobotomized audience that thought "Mork and Mindy" and "Happy Days" were actually funny, this movie retains as much cheese factor as the overstuffed original, even down to the same cheap Christmas tree. True to form, it has been staffed with the exact brand of "out of work" actors that sank the first bloated epic disaster.

I for one loved the original and this film could never hold up to it. However, there are some people out there that just don't get the enjoyment out of older movies. I don't narrow this down to the younger generation because I am only 23 and I watch a lot of old movies. Some people can't though and that is why it is necessary to do remakes. Now, onto this film. It had a lot of problems. The main one for me was the looks of the boat after it was upside down and the navy seals were right next to it. It looked embarrassingly fake. And the hole in the boat, WHAT WAS THAT?!!! Some of the dialogue and the acting was kind of lame as well. However, I like that fact that a lot of the actors were people that we haven't seen for a while, mainly steve guttenberg and c. thomas howell. Once I knew that they were in the movie it didn't matter if there acting was any good or not. It was just nice to see that they are still around and acting. i don't think they'll ever be big again but they are still good. this movie will never be a classic and soon will be forgotten, but the main reason why i gave it a seven is it didn't leave me bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original 1972 Poseidon Adventure a couple years ago and I loved it. I saw this hoping that it just did the original justice. And I think it did. This version is about a cruise liner, the S.S. Poseidon, that has terrorists on board that intend to blow up the ship. They plant a bomb and the ship takes in too much water and it capsizes. Only a group survive and head to the bottom of the ship that is above water. The group is lead by Mike Rogo, a homeland security agent, and a terrorist that he captured. It includes many of the original characters in different names, and a couple added. The deaths in the movie are predictable and many of them are pretty weak, but overall, it updated a great movie.</fullReview>

There is crossing of a steel ladder with flames flying up at the last survivors, as they proceeded to get to a higher deck on the sunken vessel. The music was different compared to the "Morning After". This was great entertainment and a great TV Production.

The special effects looked like that had been done during the 1950's and the storyline was ridiculous, it is extremely unlikely that a ship would completely turn over from having a whole in the hull. Also that one keg of beer that was used made a mighty big hole and how is it that in the last sequence all that debris was in the way stopping them from escaping when thats where the water entered from - there was a wall of metal furniture, there is no way that would have been left there!

		<fullReview>While the original movie was quite suspenseful this movie is over three hours long which not only makes the suspense last longer but also allows you to focus more on the characters and their own personal issues. This movie really had me really excited especially during the final twenty minutes, which grabbed me by the throat and refused to let go! This movie has the same basic storyline as the original film, a capsized cruise ship the Poseidon and a group of survivors makes an audacious attempt to reach the hull of ship while trying to bypass many life threatening hazards and death traps. But while the Poseidon was capsized by as tsunami in the original film, in this TV remake the Poseidon is capsized by a terrorist bombing. Also while the original film only told the story from the survivors point of view, this film also explains the situation outside the Poseidon. For example the ocean radio monitoring service trying to figure out what happened to the Poseidon when all radio contact is lost, and once the situation is learned we see the navy and marines racing against time to reach the Poseidon and discussing how they are going to rescue any survivors. However there will also be another remake of 'The Poseidon Adventure' released early next year. This time it will be a major film called 'Poseidon'. Why are they making to remakes so close together? I'm not sure but it has been done before. For example in 1996 a TV movie was released of 'Titanic' just a year before James Camerons multiple Oscar winning film was released. Also I wonder why this TV movie was released in Australia before it is even released in America? But it's good that we Aussies get to be the first to see this great TV remake of a classic suspense thriller. All together this is certainly one highly suspenseful movie and I certainly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the original film.</fullReview>
