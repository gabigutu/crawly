		<fullReview>what can I say about a perfect movie? Poltergeist is a very entertaining and scary movie. Sam Rockwell is perfection in the role of the dad buying a haunted house and Rosemarie Dewitt was great in the role as the mom.Poltergeist 2015 updates us on the movie of the same name in the 80's and it is refreshing to see the new model by director Gil Kennan who in my opinion did a great job executing new entities.I think the movie was fun and recommend it to old and new fans.The kids did a great job too, OK maybe there was a few laughable scenes like when Griffin gets pulled out of the house by the tree? But all and all I enjoyed the film.Go see it!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honored the original, but stands well on it's own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. As a lover of the original Poltergeist movies, I felt that they really honored the original. I could see it's influence in this. But unlike many remakes it wasn't a line by line. It was adapted well to fit 2015 culture and storytelling standards and regardless of a few bad lines, had crisp direction and very believable acting.The effects were good, most of the time. Scary level was moderate. Not a whole lot of adult situations, so possibly safe for children over a certain age. And had some surprisingly funny bits thrown in. I enjoyed each of the actors and their characters... except for the older girl the first half of the movie... too spoiled.Overall, very enjoyable. If you love the originals, and aren't biased when it comes to remakes, you might like this adaption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to critics. It's an amazing film. (From a big horror fan)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep. I'm a big horror films fan who had seen almost every single horror films had been release including Asians and European horror films.American horror classic is all about those cliché where a family moves into a new house which is hunted with a few jump scare and then the family conquer the ghost and it ends.But this film had almost none of that. They move into a new house and sh*ts happen. Like real scary sh*t. Not those cheesy jump scare but really scary sh*t.I was scare the whole film until the end and the storyline is just amazing. this is way way more better than any horror film I had ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting to get scared at all during this movie but scared I got! They had some really good jump scares! I know most scary movie enthusiasts don't like jump scares and say they are cheap but I love them because that's why I go to scary movies... To get scared! I also love how they used elements from the original but also threw in some new stuff that made it scarier than the original. I don't know why this movie got bad reviews because I loved it!!! It gave me all i am looking for in scary movies: jump scares, suspense, good acting, and having you on the edge of your seat. This is one of the better scary movies that I have seen in a while. I highly recommend going to see this movie! it is worth the money!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not that scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a bit of a fan of the original Poltergeist. It's got that great 80's Spielberg factor I grew up with, but with a Tobe Hoopers horror touch. I wasn't really looking forward or planning on seeing this remake, but since it popped up on the new movies list on an on-demand movie site, I decided to give it a go.Have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't read anything about it beforehand, so I didn't know if it was crap or gold. It's kind of a weird movie actually, it's not excessively scary, no gore and the tone is somewhat light. There are creepy moments and definitely some good mild scares, but the overall feel is entertaining rather than scary. Which in my opinion works for the benefit of this movie.Acting, directing, cinematography, editing, fx .. all good. Can't remember how the music was actually, but I suppose it worked fine if it didn't stick out.Recommended. Not for hardcore horror freaks, but as a Friday night entertainment it's pretty good. Simple, back to basics kind of movie, not filled with hundreds of underlying themes and endless plot twists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Gil Kenan, with some advise from a master of fright, Sam Raimi, brings an original up to date. WOW; it is like moving from kindergarten to grad school. Eric Bowen(Sam Rockwell)moves his family to a new home, against most of their wishes. Son Griffin(Kyle Catlett)is the major objector, but who listens to a kid? When Griffin finds his little sister Madison(Kennedi Clements)talking to the TV screen in the middle of the night...this is the big hint that malevolent spirits are the real owners of the house. When apparitions take little Maddie hostage...hellish activities commence. Serious enough to call in TV "ghost hunter" Carrigan Burke(Jared Harris).I really like this version over the 1982 original. Sure, graphics have improved and frightening sequences are intense and creepy. This film is good enough to leave the story alone. Cynical Rockwell brings a bit of humor to the horror. Harris is almost over-the-top, but actually a hoot. Miss Catlett is a cutie for sure.Also in the cast: Rosemarie DeWitt, Saxon Sharbino, Jane Adams and Nicolas Braun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the better remakes (possible spoilers but not really nothing that would ruin it&#x1f606;)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course it would be nice to see more original stuff but seems as tho there are many remakes both in the movies and on television however here is one that is pretty good. When watching a remake i try not to compare it to the original much but rather focus on the directors interpretation of a classic and the original poltergeist is truly a classic. If you have seen the original then the easiest way to describe this is a modernized version with tablets cell phones and flat screen TV rather than those big box things that you could sit a dozen family photos and the VHS player on top. There are a few subtle differences between the two which are welcome so its not the exact same movie with different actors of course. This version did explore "the other side " a bit more which i found interesting. No complaints on the acting tho I did enjoy the pot smoking craig and jobeth in the original but the current actors did a fine job. Unfortunately if you are looking forward to the mom being tossed around in her tshirt and underwear well watch the original. I do have the original on DVD as it is a favorite of mine and I would probably get this as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love it when a remake pays its dues to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the original, I was pleasantly surprised that this remake respects and echoes the original in the main, but adds twists and effects and tech that we use everyday to make it comfortably contemporary. But don't get comfortable. Once the scares start, they fly thick and fast. I recommend sitting close to the screen and have the volume turned right up. And wear old pants. And don't, whatever you do, use an electric drill again in your life ever. It's just not worth the risk. Don't set your expectations too high for adult acting - the kids steal the show here and run rings around their grown up colleagues. For the acting I've taken off a star. Summary - juicily horrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrifying Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to tell you all a story. Not a happy story, filled with fun and adventure...but a terrifying tale that began about 27 years ago, when I was just a child...one who found joy in simple things...like toys, clowns, and fun TV shows. That is...until one dark night...a night not unlike many other nights (or so I thought)...when everything changed.I was supposed to be in bed, asleep...but as usual, I'd crept-out into the hallway to sneak a peek at what my parents were watching on TV...and as usual, I was a bit anxious about what I might see. It may be something a kid my age shouldn't see. At first, everything seemed fine. I didn't know what it was that they were watching...but there was a clown (not a REAL clown...but a toy clown, similar to the clowns in my own bedroom), and that couldn't possibly be a BAD thing. Right? WRONG. Almost immediately, things went from "fine" to "the stuff of nightmares". The clown wasn't funny...not funny AT ALL. It was terror like I'd never known! I hurried back to my room, only to find the terror had FOLLOWED ME! In a state of panic, I grabbed every last toy clown in my room and placed them all outside of my door, then took shelter under my bed-covers where I eventually drifted-off into nightmare-land. From that day forward, I've been creeped-out by clowns, and never again did I allow them into my room.Fast-forward to present day. I now know that my fear of clowns is a result of witnessing one of the creepiest scenes from the original 'Poltergeist' film...and that's also the reason why I love that movie. Anything that can frighten a person so badly that it creates a lasting phobia, is a MASTERPIECE as far as this horror junkie is concerned.After much anticipation for this remake...I must admit, I was a bit nervous prior to watching it. The trailers looked GREAT, and I feared the film would disappoint (as so many films with epic trailers DO). It DIDN'T. Yesterday, I feared clowns. TODAY, I fear clowns more than EVER...but also stuffed pig-unicorns; the dark; light bulbs; closets; TV's; electricity in general; power tools; mini-vans; mud; cemeteries; the ground; walls; doors; sub-divisions; trees; windows; furniture; and any kind of ball. THANK YOU, Sam Raimi, for that. Just PLEASE don't ever make me fear coffee, cheeseburgers, or anything involving chocolate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It wasn't too bad, guys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you have a remake you can't really set it up to the original to be EXACTLY like the original. That would be boring and a waste of film. I watched the original when it was on TV one Halloween, and I fell in love with the film! Everything about it was wonderful! I think I was...7? 8? Anyways, I went to go see this the Friday that it opened because I was so excited to see it. Sam Rockwell was one of my favorite actors from the forgetful time between 1986 and 1991 as he starred in "Clownhouse" which was a marvel. Anyways, I was watching this movie and even though it does have jump scares, the idea that they were able to remake the movie and still have a good idea of the cast and how the characters were was good enough for me. Sure it was no Spielburg, but nothing will ever be the same as the original. I like to view this as its own movie and not one connected to an original, because then it looks better, feels better, and all in all is better. The character Madison was well thought out and was a good new take on Carol Anne. I liked how well the family reacted, they felt more like a family than other remakes (or sequels *cough cough* Poltergeist 3 *cough cough*) they felt more human. I do have cons for it though, I hate jump scares. They aren't scary, but they are a tacky waste. Given that, some movies kind of need at least a few to keep the ball rolling. This movie desperately needed it as if it hadn't most people would call it a yawn-fest or a snoozeathon. And not only that, but it would make the teenagers nowadays want to know more and seek the original. That's why this movie helps, rather than destroys this series' reputation. I liked the movie and will gladly see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd there was a remake of Jaws it would automatically be shunned by most shallow movie watchers that's why happened to many other remakes that actually happened like The omen, Psycho and now Poltergeist. If this movie was renamed it would of not been unfairly compared and the reviews would of been better.Sam Rockwell was as entertaining as ever and even in a horror he has a way of putting a light on things. Not to get all that detailed Poltergeist has many scary moments and was well acted and written. I have no regrets spending a few bucks in seeing it at the movie theater. I prefer enjoying a movie for what it is instead of picking on every scene while comparing a totally different movie with the same name..come on people</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you call a remake of a classic horror, that's not quite a remake ? Poltergeist 2015 edition, that's what ! And personally I would like to thank them for making it 'not quite a remake' as I was about 30 or so mins into the film I realized I didn't feel like I was watching a film I'd seen before, sure they'd kept some of the old clichés, but lost some as well, replacing them with modern interpretations and it all just jelled together really well, so I felt like I was watching a new movie, in and of itself, and might I say, enjoying the hell out of it ! If you liked the original, you'll love this, if you were born after the original had its hey day, as such, you'll still love this, there's screams and creepy things, tender moments and a few laughs, and no sex, which will please all parents worldwide, while managing to disappoint teenage boys, also world wide. It's a fun ( but creepy ) family horror everyone can enjoy, if there is an award for best remake at the Oscars then this film should win hands down !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awesome remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'd like to say Maddie, the little girl, is so sweet and such a little cu-tie. Everything about the family was normal, not a Hollywood fairytale family (which is awesome). The actors seemed like they had some experience before this movie, done pretty well. This movie definitely makes you wonder "what would I do if I was in that situation?" It's pretty creepy. It's got a few good jump scares, and some pretty creepy images. Especially if you are afraid of clowns. They could have kept it a little more original, like the TV instead of the closet but still, This was definitely a good remake. Most remakes today just come out stupid. Definitely worth the time and money! I don't this movie gets enough credit because of the older one. But let's face it, if it was the only one, it would be HUGE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Reminder!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, remake movies aren't meant to be better than originals. The mission of remaking movies is to reminding people to appreciate films along in years ago. Aside from the originals is the special effects and filling them into modern era like FaceTime, remote plane, and etc. If they change anything more than the originals, it'll consider as a failure. I want to praise Gil Kenan who directed the remake of Poltergeist. It wasn't easy to remake a movie that's directed by one of the most respected directors, Steven Spielberg! I don't think it's fair to put Kennedi Clements and Heather O'Rourke in comparison because Heather O'Rourke had appearance as her advantage. Her blond hair, pretty eyes and cute baby face or say All American baby girl. People could feel attached to her and didn't want anything bad happen to her. While Kennedi Clements, yes, she's cute and all that, but she's not an All American baby girl like Heather O'Rourke. Although, she did great job. I wouldn't choose someone else to fill in Heather O'Rourke's shoes. Just stated my theory why people's emotions were involved more with Heather than Kennedi. I can't ignore the fact that Saxon Sharbino is unbelievable pretty! I was surprised to find out that she's only 15. She definitely has a bright future in either modeling or acting world.This movie does have several flaws. All of the flaws were excused except for one. The neighbors weren't calling. It's like nobody is in town even though many nice houses were in sight. Again for the people who were disappointed with this film, you have to remember that your mindset was different in 80s. More people were religious in 80s than today. Therefore, they were likely to believe in these kind of spooky stories. Plus, PG-13 wasn't existed during that time. It's a PG film and kids under 10 years old watched this film. Of course, they got scared and slept with their parents from time to time. It hugely boosted the hype of this film. Bottomline, the modern one is nearly good as the previous one. It's all about timing along with several advantages. That's it. I didn't rate it eight out of ten because it's great movie in general. I rated it based on how well they did make up from the original and it's still a terrified movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Underrated - Very Good Modern Take On The Original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible Spoiler - just being cautious even though I am being vague about the new film) The original Poltergeist '82 was more spiritual, afterlife, evil creepy slimy things of lost souls, and it focused on that.As times have changed in the world, we have witnessed more real-life human atrocities, disasters, and horrors, that the general public is severely desensitized to horror films of that era.Unfortunately, with remakes, you get a majority of the population comparing it to the original, then giving it a bad review.The remake is designed around modern-day 'ghost-hunting', the focus on how spirit energy can be channeled through electricity (which, again, 99% of 'ghost hunters' focus on this in their investigations; EMF readings, ectoplasm, etc..), has some creepy spooks, some real good shockers, surprises, a lot of fun, and has all kinds of 'Easter Eggs' paying homage to the original film - a trademark that Sam Raimi follows in any of the films he has worked on.The film audiences need to go into a recreation of an original title with a fresh slate in their head, and not compare it to the original.....One final point, the Blu-Ray Director's Cut is a lot better than the theatrical release - you can blame Fox / MGM for that one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It Knows What Scares You" .. not the scariest but still decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all i'm a huge fan of horror films, so when i heard about a remake to the Poltergeist i was so excited and couldn't wait to see the trailer which actually surprised me. And I've went to the movies expecting to watch the old movie but with a few changes.The thing is , they changed A LOT! So if you have the same expectation well it's not what you think it is. The pace of the movie was really fast in a good way but the only problem was the build up and that it lacked the feelings between the family.The Scare factor: It basically relies on jump scares but i have to admit they were perfectly done and well timed . There were some clowns in a box which were sort of creepy. and also some edge-of- your seat moments. It's similar to "Insidious" and James Wan effects. So yes when it says from the producer of "Evil Dead" you know what to expect, But it won't prevent you from sleeping.The acting was fine, CGI was okay and there were wonderful visuals. The 3D was mainly used for the jump out of your seat moments in a gimmicky way (Throwing stuff at the audience).In the end, I had fun watching Poltergeist and it delivers a few thrills,Sam Raimi did a great job producing this film,for Gil Kenan (Director of Monster House) i think it's a huge step forward. But don't go in with very high expectations or you will be disappointed. Although you should watch it if you're a true horror fan and you're looking for some good scares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best remakes! They stay pretty close to the original story without ripping off the original. A few slight changes that I feel worked in their favor and it was quite interesting to see into the ghost realm with the drone cause we didn't get to see that in the original. However, I feel like the acting was kinda bad in a few areas. Even though I am a fan of Sam Rockwell I think the film could of worked a bit better with different actors. Plus, the parents were horrible parents in my opinion. They were kind of mean in the beginning making fun of their kids.Then the actress who played the mom copied JoBeth Williams character too much,and the movie felt a bit rushed cause the original was so long but overall I thoroughly enjoyed the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw all the negative reviews - some horribly written, and, they all seem to have one thing in common; comparing it Rotherham original.I'm NOT a Spielberg fan, and I never saw the original.BUT... saying this, I - like many, MANY others are ALL too familiar with it - esp. such things as Zelda Rubenstein, 'Carol-Ann,' 'They're he-ere,' etc.I'm also NOT a fan of remakes, reboots, I'm mostly sick of ANY garbage made in/by Hollywood in the past 2-or so decades. They've seemed to literally either run out of original ideas, or have become so afraid of original, they'll only stick with what's been already done.So, I come to THIS Poltergeist as so,some without any preconceived ideas, notions.I'm not going to get mad at this director and writer, for not saying/doing exactly what was done in the first.I come to this as someone who - while they make their filthy lucre from this place, but, definitely not in love with it (not even close).I love Sam Rockwell. I always find him taking interesting films - rather than always sticking to the (most-likely) hollow-souled project which will most likely make scads of moolah.I also like Jared Harris. I think he's a quirky guy, and, he does a nice job here - not overblown, not hammy, but, fun... considering.The rest of the cast, is, honestly - to me - unknowns.I've never seen any of them before.What I liked about this film was it took a story so well-known, that, someone such as I - who never seen it - can still find this version refreshing.The story is very similar to the original - the only differences being the character's names, and the sex of the 'specialist' (Zelda in the original, Jared in this version), and other than these minors changes, the big difference is the imagery.Back when the original was made, there were always articles about how the 'cool' never- seen-before SFX were done, as this was before CGI.Here, it's all CGi, and I think the images of the other place, and its inhabitants brought to mind Hieronymous Bosch's phantasmagorical imagery.Something which is very important to me is the younger actors.Most kids in films will only make one, perhaps two. Then, the magic of puberty hits, and what was 'cute,' is now oily, and pimply'Cute' doesn't age well, and I can't stand films which put youngsters in a film simply because they're 'cute.'They can't act, and it gets tiring VEEY fast - and becomes irritating.However, I was. Sry pleasantly surprised by the two youngest; the young girl who plays Madison (the 'Carol-Ann' part) is Kennedi (I HATE 'cutesy' spelling) Clements, and her older brother - what they call a 'tween' - Kyle Catlett, plays Griffin, and both of them really owned their scenes, I'm very pleasantly happy to say. Mr. Catlett- who's age I don't know - appeared to be very close to getting those first few hormones surging through his body.What I mean, is, they film movies not in order of the story, and on quite a few occasions, Kyle's face was noticeably more mature. No, his voice didn't come close to dropping, and, in some long-shots, he didn't seem very tall, but, boys shoot up in spurts, and, if I'm correct about Kyle, I really hope the acting ability I saw on the screen will see him through the 'terrible teens,,' because this young man definitely has a future.The rest of the cast are all perfunctory in a good way.The usual feeling I get from remakes - the feeling of 'we've only made this for money,' wasn't that noticeable. Again - I saw his from a new perspective - someone familiar with the first, but, who'd never seem it, and it really seemed care was put into making this a good film.At one point, something happens (don't worry - no spoilers), and it really seemed for a moment,they were setting the stage for a 'Poltergeist 2,' but, I'm happy to say I was wrong about that.Listen; there's way too. Any terrible films these days - not just remakes, but, remakes are usually much worse than the rest. If you've not seen the original Poltergeist, I hope you find this version as fun as I did, and, if you are someone who's seen the original, I'm sorry you didn't like this, but, perhaps, if you try to not compare the two - and just take this one for a creepy film, I'd hope you like it, as well.</fullReview>

The mom SUCKED in terms of modern parenting, and the dad felt like the original dad, sarcastic and dickish.The issue I think people have is that their heads are up their elitist butts. This movie was really good, scary and fun. I hated the ending, but that's me. I'm glad they didn't do a shot for shot remake, the idea and some recognizable themes and scenes pulled it together just enough.If you want some good scares, with a happy ending, this is a good movie.

There seems to be a trend here...Take a look at the ratings for Grave Encounters, 100 Feet, The Haunting and Dead Silence. All in the 4-6 rating range. All truly paranormal stories with some really amazing and innovative scenes. I can still picture them in my mind all these years later! The only thing that makes sense as to why they were all rated so low is that here must be some kind of bias against this type of film, and for things that are bloody, dark, hopeless, morbid and macabre.If you are looking for a good ghost story, horror that does not involve nudity or sex, rivers of blood and mountains of body parts; horror that sucks away all hope, leaving you disgusted by the end, then this is the film for you. If you want all that other crap, get the latest episode of AHS or whatever Rob Zombie has recently made.I have been watching the horror genre since the 70's. Every Nightmare on Elm Street. Every Friday the 13th (including the remake.) Every Candyman, as many Hellraisers as I could stand, every Phantasm, and every single haunted house film I could lay my hands on, from the original Poltergeist movies to The Changling and Burnt Offerings. Throw both Shinings in there and Rose Red.The last good scary movie or mini-series I have enjoyed, until this one, was the first Woman In Black remake (not the sequel.) Oh yes, I did watch the original Woman In Black as well. I am an expert. After 3 decades, that is not surprising.The trend lately, exemplified in AHS, is towards the bloody, dark and macabre. True haunted house movies of any quality, featuring ghosts (not demons, monsters or possessed people) are extremely rare. In fact the person behind this movie also did Monster House, which was another excellent haunted house movie, just more for children. The only thing rarer than a true haunted house movie are science fiction movies that are not about survival in some form. Where are the movie versions of Rama? But I digress...This movie is one you can watch with your kids. They won't be able to sleep that night, unless you have allowed them to watch Game of Thrones and American Horror Story. If they have been watching these nothing will shock them. The same is true of most adults. If you are into decapitation, evisceration and things that are seriously depressing, hopeless and screwed up, you probably won't like this movie. It's just not dark and gross enough for your tastes.Poltergeist is unique, yet it retains the spirit of the original. A family fights against a paranormal force. They stand together and overcome it. The special effects are simple but high quality. I do not understand one reviewer's comments about them. In fact there are some scenes in this movie that are like nothing I have seen before, in 30 years of watching these kinds of movies. I was surprised and seriously freaked out, neither of which happens much anymore when I watch a movie. The people behind this did some good work. There is only one scene that doesn't fit this kind of film which involves a drill. Otherwise it is all about the ghosts and paranormal. Acting is also good.I am glad they made this, and I hope they do more, improving on what they got right (which is just about everything), keeping the focus right where it is, on the paranormal and supernatural. If you like a good ghost story, ignore the reviews as well as the overall rating and try this movie. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining to watch, not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching the original Poltergeist movies when I was younger and after watching them I could not sleep at night. Idk what was with them but they were truly scary. This movie was also pretty scary but I can go to sleep at night without any nightmares or bad dreams (which I am happy with). It isn't that it was a bad movie it definitely wasn't and if you haven't seen it I would recommend it... but it isn't something I am going to keep thinking about.If you want to watch this so that you just cannot sleep for the next few days then this movie is not for you. If you want to watch it though to see very cool special effects, get scared when watching it (the first half), and to be engaged in an "original" horror movie idea then this is for you! Original of course being it is different than most horror movies other than its original counterpart. Mostly the movie is entertaining moreso than scary.The scenes in the movie were very well directed, acted, and edited. I really liked how the special effects were done. The movie didn't look all CGI but it did have good scenes well edited. It also had a good pace to it and I was left with wanting more.In conclusion, Poltergeist (2015) is a very good horror movie for 'our time'. It has good acting, good effects, and a good "original" story. If you like horror movies this is for you BUT it isn't something you are going to have a hard time forgetting. If you haven't seen it watch it! If you have seen it watch it again as it is very entertaining unlike most horror movies nowadays.</fullReview>

One of the scariest movies made in the last fifteen years. If you like really scary movies then you need to see this movie. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. A family find out that there house is haunted. See this movie. See all the Poltergeists movies. They are some of the scariest movies ever made. If you do not get scared of this movie then no movie will scary you. Sam Rockwell is a great actor. Rosemarie D.e.W.i.t.t is a great actress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great flick - highly enjoyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe all the negative reviews I've seen of this movie. I always wonder if they're written by people who even actually like the horror genre, much less have a passion for it. This movie is a remake. Do not expect a remake to be better than the original. That is pretty much impossible. It's lost the element of surprise.How many horrors have we watched that are "B" or lower? Asylum Films anyone? We watch them because we love the genre. We look for redeeming qualities in any horror, no matter how bad. Humour, or effects, or acting. Sometimes it's just laughing at how fake the effects are and how bad the acting is. But we retain the passion for the horror genre and we appreciate any contributors.I do not like remakes that are exact copies of the original. This movie brought some differences, although the essence of the original was there.I appreciated this movie because it is a horror and one that had a significant budget. I thought some of the effects were great! If I had a complaint about this movie, it is that I wish it was a little bit longer, and put a little more complexity into the plot. If you love horror, I recommend this movie. If you love horror, you're not going to be disappointed. Just don't expect that a remake is going to be anymore than a pleasant trip into yesteryear to see an old friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why i like this film: 1) good effects (loved the clown doll)2) great acting and well selected actors ( the little girl is very cute )3) good script ( was not cheesy like the original)4) good cinematography and lighting As a beginner film maker ( age 13 ), I compare originals to remakes to see what could be improved of already well known films or classics. I watched the original first and found it particularly slow and cheesy. The medium was super annoying and overall a poorly chosen actor. In the remake, there was no cheese. There was lots of good elements which add to the quality of the film rather than take away from it. I gave this film an 8 because I am not fond of the idea of remakes. Todays directors need to find new ideas to create new and original masterpieces like the original. The only reason i watched it was to see what another director with a different interpretation can do with an already great film. And how it could get even better. Overall, I liked the film more than the original but still think it was wrong to make a remake in the first place... I know, it is confusing... Give it a chance though even though it is a remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story template is on par with the original but it is more of a reflection of generations. When compared with the original it reflects family dynamics change from the 70s - 80s and now. It actually makes it easier to connect to in its content.Looking at this film I found it very entertaining and Rockwell stayed true to form as in the Green Mile. I was disappointed in the acting of the mother. That could have been much better. It is however its own beast. I think that most critics do not really look at film based on content but go in with a preset notion that this is a carbon copy and that is what they expect. Personally I have a large collection of movies and this one will also be added to that collection.If you are skeptical I say give it a peak and you may be pleasantly surprised. :) Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better than expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who can forget little Carroll-Ann and her famous line 'They're here'? Quite recently I decided to watch the 1982 flick by Tobe Hooper again, as it terrified me in my younger years. Watching it again, I was very disappointed. Craig T. Nelson and all the other actors did a good job, but the effects surely didn't survive the test of time and it seemed production designers tried way too hard and created a boy's bedroom way over the top, for example.I read all the bad reviews about this remake, but today I thought 'Why not?' and decided to give it a chance. And yes, it has some bad moments, and I still think 'The Conjuring' still is the most terrifying supernatural horror-movie, but this one comes close to a good second place. I loved the balance between CGI and practical/live-action effects, every actor did their best job and the suspense was built up quite good.The story is updated real well and it never tries to copy the 1982- version. It's just the basic story in a modern day jacket. Normally I'm not a fan of horror-remakes, but considering I couldn't bear watching the 1982-version anymore, this is a nice way to honor what effect it had in the '80's.I enjoyed it very much, way more than 'The Possession', 'Insidious' and other recent haunted-themed flicks that I don't even remember names or titles from.Heavily underrated and deserves way more good reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie but not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original Poltergeist movie for the first time in the early 90's. I was only around 10 years old but found it pretty damn scary. As I grew up and watched it several more times it became less so and, having just watched it again last year, looked dated.So obviously I was happy that a remake had been announced but I was cautious because Hollywood has a knack for screwing it up. After eventually watching it earlier this year, I'm not sure what to think. People inevitably are going to compare it with the original. Others are going to try and forget about the original and watch it as a modern day movie which is what I did. I can honestly say that it did have its moments but I just couldn't help feeling as if it could've delivered more somehow. That's not to say that I'm disappointed or anything because it was a decent movie to watch. Would recommend watching it although people who liked the original may walk away a little disappointed. Definitely better than a lot of movies in this genre that get higher ratings for some strange reason when they're rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake, but not the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If POLTERGEIST (2015) had not used the title and declared itself a remake of POLTERGEIST (1982), I doubt that the people connected with the 1982 original could have successfully sued the people of the 2015 movie for plagiarism. Yes, it's the same basic story - but with so many new twists and innovations that it is also a new movie.It's a haunted house - but not a new house. There was a previous occupant (but this aspect is not further explored, unfortunately). There's a family moving in, named Bowen, not Freeling, with a little girl, named Madison, not Carolanne. The parents do not smoke marijuana. The haunting attracts the attention of a TV exorcist, not a magical munchkin. And this new narrative includes such modern contrivances as smart phones, cellphones, laptops, and flat screens. Just so you know.The Bowen family, dad (Sam Rockwell), mom (Rosemarie DeWitt, of Rachel Getting Married, and United States of Tara), and teen daughter Kendra ( Saxon Sharbino, of Touch, and I Spit On Your Grave), nervous young son Griffin (Kyle Catlett, of whom we can expect much), and little girl Maddy (Kennedi Clements) move into a housing development not far from Molene, Illinois. The move was begun when dad was hired by John Deere tractors but somehow he was laid off before he even arrived, so they arrive unemployed. The house, however, is very nice, the previous occupant made sure it was wired up for cable and internet.Near the house are high tension power lines and some anomalies hinting at static electricity are blamed on that. Then we are told that the housing development is on the site of a cemetery - and not so old that all the graves were long forgotten and neglected, no sir, families still visit the graves at their new location. Except, of course, ....Before long, there's serious Trouble, and a professor of the supernatural (Jane Adams) is called in to help with a small crew of high-tech assistants, and soon enough a cranky TV cleanser of cursed houses (Carrigan Burke, of Mad Men) shows up to lend his expertise.Now I would like to point out the obvious defect in both the 1982 original and this remake. Leaving the coffins in the ground and moving only the headstones is a scam so transparent that it's a wonder someone wasn't arrested the first day. Moreover these houses have basements - considerably deeper than a grave (and the 1982 movie included an outdoor swimming pool). And, finally, if building over a cemetery caused any sort of haunting, then Paris would be one big chamber of horrors.This 2015 version has new twists, surprises, and special effects. This makes the original seem a tad pale (although I miss the musical theme of the 1982 version).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regardless to the original - fun and impressive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To most people, Poltergeist is a remake of the 1982 Stephen Spielberg classic. Personally, I've never seen the original, as I became a Horror fan during my late teens and have never been able to connect to the classics (excluding Freddie and Jason). So to me, the 2015 version was the first ever encounter with the brand.Reading the plot synopsis would have you expecting a regular Ghost Story sub-genre film, with several jump-scares and terrifying ghosts (hopefully living up to Asian standards). However, Poltergeist's perhaps most impressive feature is that the "ghosts" (quite frightening as they might be, albeit mediocre and no more than some professional makeup work) receive very little screen time (perhaps 3 seconds altogether). The film is scary and disturbing due to the story and presented scenarios, without relying on scenes which appeal more to the human physiology than the human mind. In this day and age, succeeding in creating a film that is scary without using jump-scares or heavy makeup/CGI effects is quite an achievement, one that screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire and director Gil Kenan have definitely earnt.The story describes a family of 5 characters (two hardworking parents, one spoiled teenager, one anxious 8-9 year old and one adorable 5 year old) who move into a new house. Unbeknownst to them, the house is built on burial grounds, and the spirits aren't too happy about it. Corny as it may sound, bare in mind that this plot originated in the early 80's. At the time, electrical disturbances, moving objects and a young child communicating with ghosts were all fairly new ideas, and the 2015 version presents them beautifully. The characters are all very likable, excluding the annoying middle son whose anxieties simply feel exaggerated and over the top. The acting is not half bad (by the entire cast), especially Kennedi Clements as little Madison (young talent never seizes to impress me).All in all, Poltergeist 2015 is living proof that when done right - a good Horror film doesn't need to stoop down to using cheats and "boo!" moments. Most of the fear sensation is achieved by making the audience use their imagination, not unlike when reading a scary book. This is definitely not the scariest film to watch, as it's even suitable to certain children, but that's what I find to be so impressive about it. Fans of the original classic would probably hate it on account of it being "untrue to the source", but actual Horror fans would probably appreciate it for what it is: a scary film that is fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie works better if you watch it as drama rather than a horror movie. I know fans of the original will go/call sacrilege (but they'd do that anyway ... well mostly). But if you watch this as a family drama (and I'm certain this was intended, seeing Sam Rockwell and his interpretation of the role), you will get more out of it. It is fairly decent considering that.Of course that's only true for fans of the genre (Horror), others who are not used to Horror might not see it exactly the same way. There are frightening scenes in this don't get me wrong, but anyone with a little "experience" will see them coming and will not be entertained (or scared for that matter) by them. The acting though? Pretty solid by everyone involved - again not if seen as Horror. Can you dig that? If so watch, if not, you've been warned</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, and also not a good poltergeist movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I heard that a new Poltergeist movie was being made, I started to wonder how could someone try to remake such a wonderful classic, how could someone think they could make something better than that? When I read (here) that Sam Raimi was the producer, I was still skeptical, but created some hopes about this movie. Unfortunately, watching it, those hopes were shattered.The original movie is about 3 main things: Family, the poltergeist phenomena, and horror. This new version has almost none of that! In the original you have a family in perfect harmony, all loving each other, they have a prosper life, and all is well for years until the events start to happen. When they do, the entire family is involved, and all of them helps to find answers and rescue the missing family member, through the horror that is happening. Their love for each other is what protects them, and is their main weapon against the poltergeist. Important scenes, like Diana showing Steve the chair moving in the kitchen, or their kiss before she goes to "the other side", are all missing in this one. You have very little warning to what is to come, unlike the original one, and the mother and the father didn't saw anything unusual before their girl disappeared. I wonder how they found out that she went inside the closet, since nothing had happened there, except that they found her little "pigcorn" there. If I was the father, I would be terrified that my youngest was missing, and would call the police immediately, because the only "weird" thing I saw would be the voice on the TV, that could easily be my imagination (the only new TV the world that does no show "no signal" in a black screen, it still shows static like the 80's TVs). But not they, they almost didn't care that she was missing. Actually, in a scene, the father says that they have too many kids, and the mother says they should have stopped at 2. After a weird dialogue about not calling the police, they call paranormal researchers, and the movie gets a little better. Still, no good explanation about what a poltergeist is, about what is happening, and how to rescue the girl. And still, no horror, no family love.Besides that, I believe that the creators of this movie wanted to put some of the important scenes of the original one in it, but changing them so it don't look like a totally rip-off. They did that, but not catching the essence of those scenes. Examples: you have the clown, actually lots of weird clowns, but only for a few seconds in total, and it was very lame. The girl is not sucked into the closet trying to avoid it with all her strength, instead she walks into it willingly. The place was a cemetery, but only a secret to the family, everybody else knows it and is happy living there. Happy family having a breakfast together doesn't exist here, they prefer to fight over an iphone. Also, no spirits passing trough the living room. Moving objects by itself are very rare, only the clowns, a baseball, some comic books and a chair, nothing of that all-alive kids bedroom.So, to conclude, in the end we have a movie that does not explain the poltergeist phenomena, the family is totally dysfunctional (the only one who seems to care is the boy for his younger sister), and no horror at all, I was more scared watching Mama (2013) then this one. This movie looks more like a kids adventure (not my words), then a horror or paranormal movie. It is not a bad movie, the actors are OK (could have been better), there are some good scenes (like the drone going to the other side), and people who got scared watching those Paranormal Activity movies will be terrified watching this. My vote for it is a not solid 7, I was gonna give it a 6, but the closet scene with the power drill gave the extra point to it. So, if you want to watch a good movie about the poltergeist subject, go watch the original. If you need to kill time in a lazy afternoon, watch this one. If you want to get scared, the original one is the only movie that still does that for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist -2015-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Poltergeist is a 2015 American supernatural adventure horror film directed by Gil Kenan, written by David Lindsay-Abaire and produced by Sam Raimi. A reboot of the 1982 film of the same name, the film stars Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Jared Harris, and Jane Adams. It was released on May 22, 2015, by 20th Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film grossed over $95 million worldwide.--Critical reception:-On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 31%, based on 102 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads: "Paying competent homage without adding anything of real value to the original Poltergeist, this remake proves just as ephemeral (but half as haunting) as its titular spirit." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". -Writing for Variety, Andrew Barker called it "generally entertaining yet fundamentally unnecessary" and concluded: "Even when one is inclined to admire the cleverness with which the remake revisits and reincorporates Poltergeist 's themes, it's hard to pinpoint a single moment where it improves on them, and the aura of inessentiality hangs thick over the proceedings". Neil Genzlinger gave the film a positive review in The New York Times, writing: "The new Poltergeist might well be the scariest movie 13-or-unders have yet seen, just as the original was for their parents back in 1982. Those parents might find it an enjoyable trip down memory lane, even if they do now recognize it as largely a well-served collection of horror-movie tropes". Tirdad Derakhshani wrote in The Philadelphia Inquirer: "It's not exactly a scary film, but it does provide an enjoyable ride. It's good fun. But it left me befuddled", adding: "Why would anyone want to remake Poltergeist in the first place?". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mike McCahill called the film "an efficient scare-machine". Bilge Ebiri wrote in New York magazine: "This new Poltergeist isn't anything special... But it's not a travesty, and that feels like cause for brief celebration".-In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave Poltergeist an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I just watched the original and remake of Poltergeist back to back. 1982/2015.I prefer the original for a few reasons. The story telling is better, the remake relies to heavily on the original to tell key points of the movie for them. The original was more suspenseful and the acting was better.But on the other hand, the remake had some awesome affects and added a few twists of it's own to the story. They stayed very true to the original without feeling like a rerun.The remake was creepier and that was awesome but the original makes you feel more invested in the family. So both are great movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal but definitely an above-average horror remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is a horror remake of the 1982 original. I've heard a lot about the original and was quite surprised that many people hated the remake. This new remake got a 5.0 on IMDb which is comparably much worse than many horror flicks. However, after watching the new Poltergeist, I have to say that it definitely doesn't suck like other remakes and even though it has many places that could've been better, the 2015 Poltergeist is a slightly above-average horror flick (definitely worth more than a 5.0).One thing that I heard the most from the audience is that Poltergeist has nothing special. It didn't add many new ideas rather than turning it into a cash-grabber. In some ways I agree, but since this remake has already exists, I think that it still stands pretty well on its own. I'm gonna be honest that I didn't finish watching the original. What I remember is that there are many lines and scenes in the remake that are nearly 100 % same as the original, but still, if we set aside with the original, Poltergeist is actually pretty decent. I do like many ideas that are used in the remake, such as the shadow part which I found it refreshing, and also how the movie is presented. Poltergeist isn't like many failed-to-be-stylish horror flicks which tried too much on maintaining the atmosphere then ending up suck very bad, just like Annabelle. Though you can still find many reused concepts from other horror movies and yes, many jump scares, Poltergeist still has some pretty scary scenes, especially in the first half of the movie, which I thought that the director paved the direction real well. However, something that I felt really annoyed with this remake is the overuse of its CGI. This Poltergeist has some many CGI that it made it so unrealistic and unconvincing. Some of the CGI scenes look so unreal that it looks like a view from a video game. Horror movies should make the viewers get scared by its realism, however, Poltergeist failed. At first, I was pretty satisfied for the first half, then the second half ruined it with tons and tons of CGI. CGI shouldn't even exist in the horror genre, because it's really unnecessary. Except for Silent Hill which has a lot of CGI, but at least it's used in the right place. But Poltergeist can stand on its own without CGI.When I was watching the movie, I have mixed feelings. The movie is just unpredictable, and it's not in a good way. I really like how the director handles the part where Poltergeist could have ended but didn't, but then the real ending is just so abrupt and I thought it could have been better since the movie already wanted itself to have more. (It's really hard to describe without spoiling it out.)I found that the acting was decent and thought that the family is quite convincing and not overly clichéd. However, I didn't really like the little girl. Even though she's like 5 or 6, has reactions toward ghosts are just stupid. I like the boy the most because he, at least, feels real which he actually behave like most people would behave. So overall, I feel that the Poltergeist remake isn't as bad as many people thought, to me it could have a 6.1 on IMDb instead of a 5.0. It has what a horror movie should have, except for the CGI and I like the while tension throughout the movie. The movie could be better but I think the Poltergeist is still better than most horror movie remakes in history. I can still enjoy at least 60% of the movie if I'm going to re-watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Passable Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a reboot, this one isn't as bad as others I've seen. I definitely feel that this film lacked a lot of the story substance that the first film relied more heavily on because of it's restrictions involving visual effects. Where this film relies more heavily on stunning CGI for the latter half of the film to keep the viewers attention. Sam Rockwell delivers a pretty solid performance as the father, he brings subtle comedy to his character as well as some deep emotion at select points in the film. Out of of everyone I think he delivered the best performance alongside the new "Carol Anne" aka "Madison" played by Kennedi Clements. Who delivers a very good performance for someone of her age, however I still feel Heather O'Rourke was even more convincing in the original. I'm still not sure why they changed the last name of the family, there was really no need to change the character's names. All in all, not a terrible film. A good watch around Halloween, not one I'd see more than once though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist is not that scary or disturbing but it is a great family movie and good to watch when you're bored.The acting was OK but other horror movies have better acting like the Conjuring, Annabelle and many other movies.The storyline was good and the part that I liked the most was when Griffin got pulled out of the window by a tree.The sound effects were great.The thing they need to work on is to show more bad characters so we can be more scared.Overall, I would recommend this movie if you like horrors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but don't trust the tin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please let me begin by stating that I love the original movie; it is easily among my most favourite ever movies. For this reason, I decided to view this remake as it's own movie, trying not to compare it to the original. Being a fan of paranormal movies, and seeing the trailer for this movie, I had hoped that I was in store for a scarefest. By the time that the credits were rolling, I had realised that what I had seen was something quite different to what was advertised. The trailer shows that this is a very scary movie whereas, however desensitised I may be to the majority of scary movies, I feel that it is a lot less scary than it could have been. Please do not get me wrong, a good portion of the movie was scary, tension-building or/and interesting but then far too much of the movie was comical. For me, the movie felt almost like a ramped-up Ghostbusters.This doesn't mean to say that the movie was not entertaining, I was very entertained and I felt that the movie was good, just not necessarily what was advertised. I thought Sam Rockwell was largely mis- cast as the father of the family and felt that his role needed a much more commanding performance. It would have been interesting to see somebody like Christian Bale in that role. Rosemarie DeWitt did well as the mother of the family. Kennedi Clements performance was excellent and beyond her years as Madison and Kyle Catlett possibly shone as the star of the cast with his showing in the part of Griffin. Saxon Sharbino was just annoying and unnecessary as the elder daughter. I loved the effects that were used as nothing looked too unbelievable.Overall, this is a solid movie with a good script but expect to chuckle more than jump.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So first of all I didn't see the original one and I'm not that kind of person who can watch any horror saying oh it was nothing, I didn't get scared. But now I really have to say that the most of the movie was not scary at all.Instead of making long mysterious moments when you are starting to cover your eyes because you know that something really creepy will happen they just made big fancy moments. And no I'm not talking about jump scares even those jump scares had no effect. They were trying to make long scary moments too but it just failed (except only one scene). It was more about big fancy overdone scenes. Which is OK but not in a horror movie. So for me it was more like a kind of fantasy-scifi stuff, not a horror.The whole atmosphere of the movie was not what you expect from a good horror. Most of the times it was not creepy, not dark and the actors didn't really feel what is happening also it made some very unrealistic moments, sometimes I felt I'm in a comedy.Just the whole movie didn't take it seriously what happened...usually when a family finds out that something is not OK with their house or if something weird is happening to their kid they panic a bit more... (The little boy made the best, most realistic job at acting btw...)So after all for me it failed as a horror. BUT I still gave 7 stars because if I'm looking at it as a not too serious fantasy thing then it was quite entertaining. Not what I expected, but not bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist (2015) thankfully doesn't feel like your traditional reenactment of a classic horror film. It has the same concept but it had a different 21st century feel to it.Initially I found it hard to watch and some of the scenes were so terrible that they were comical but as the film progressed it began to actually get scary. The little girl was the one who sold it for me, she's terrifyingly sweet. It's just unfortunate that the rest of the cast were a bit lame in comparison.For a horror film...not bad. It had everything I was looking for and the special effects were actually pretty good. They were gruesome and quite different. It's not the best thing to come from the genre but it was scarier than some I've seen recently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it has been quite some time since I watched a horror movie that really frightened me. This movie is not the kind that will make you go crazy of fear but it's really cool. I really liked the storyline and the acting of the actors involved. I loved the little girl and I was really amazed by Sam Rockwell and did enjoy the fact that there were funny scenes within a thriller movie. Jared Harris was also brilliant and I really really liked his character. It was a fun Sunday afternoon in the movies with a movie that will hardly make you jump out of your seat, but it won't also keep you uninterested like others of the specific genre. One thing I did not like was that towards the end the director kind of took it too far at some point, making you think that "ok, this is too much" which is something that should not happen in this kind of movies when you're struggling to remain into the storyline, without thinking that in real life, these things would not be possible..Overall, don't spend money to go at the movies for this, if you have other options. Waiting out for a DVD rental is the best option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another unnecessary remake to a classic film of the past with varying degrees of success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POLTERGEIST (2015) **1/2 Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Saxon Sharbino, Kyle Catlett, Kennedi Clements, Jared Harris, Jane Adams, Susan Heyward, Nicholas Braun. Yet another unnecessary remake to a classic film of the past with varying degrees of success. To wit: pointless nearly sequence-to-sequence Xerox of the '80s spookfest unleashed by Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper about a family plagued by a pesky and deadly supernatural force upon moving into a new cul-de-sac that latches onto the youngest daughter (cute Clements who eerily echoes the original's late, Heather O'Rourke, only dark-haired), prompting a ghost hunter (Harris) and his ex, a researcher of the paranormal (Adams) enlisted to rescue the girl and 'clean house'. Director Gil Kenan is by-no-means a Spielberg (or a Hooper) but attempts to enliven the predictable proceedings at hand no thanks to the lackluster script by David Lindsay-Abaire. The CGI makes up for the poorly conceived reboot; better off renting (or even better off buying) the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK let's get this out of the way - it's a remake and the original film is a classic. That's not to say you shouldn't remake it. In fact I was looking forward to see how they would do it now technology has moved on in leaps and bounds. So here goes: The storyline is pretty faithful to the original. OK all of the characters are different and the strangely-voiced medium is now and Irish man (I think that was the accent - it varied a lot!). But, as another reviewer said, the original film sustained menace throughout whilst this one stops and starts a lot. That would be OK but the horror jolts aren't particularly scary. Yes the tree bit is done with CGI so it looks a lot better. The tearing-face scene is given a miss (shame - a favourite of mine - would have loved to have seen that CGI'd). The trip through the world behind the closet wasn't scary either. Lots of CGI that had no feeling of reality. And, at the end, the 'coming out of the ground' bodies bit was over in a flash and they didn't do anything! No coffins bursting out of the ground. No chasing people. Shame. They kept in the bit about the houses being built on a graveyard and then we find out (calmly) that the bodies weren't moved. The original made that scene really powerful with the father arguing with the developer over the fact that he saved money by simply moving the headstones, not the bodies. Again the suspense was lost in the new version. The actors did OK but no-one shone through. The little girl didn't have the screen presence needed for her brief times in the film. Even her delivery of the film's famous catchphrase: They're here! was muted. Somehow I got the feeling that it was all toned down - for a family audience? For a lower rating? Isn't it a horror film? Hmmmmm.... 35 minutes in before the first scary bit actually happened (the leg being pulled into the floor). It has been said that the original dove into the supernatural action too quickly and that may have been true, but this version left me wishing for a fast forward button at times. So now you're asking: did he like any of it? Well it was good to see a remake and the effects have certainly improved. I applaud that they stuck quite faithfully to the original plot line (with small exceptions). I think it is good that people should have a go at a new slant on an old film. Some can work very successfully (the latest Planet of the Apes films) while others can be awful (The Day The Earth Stood Still). But that's no reason not to try. I think this film falls in between the two examples given and was enjoyable but without the pace and the.....well.....horror....of the original. I'd catch it again on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly heavy on CGI, although it does present unusual viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to competitions that utilize atmosphere and thrill aspect better, this remake of Poltergeist would probably not be as memorable as the original. It also follows the premise rather rigidly, which by now is already outdated. However, it may just present a couple of horror gimmicks bizarre enough to at least entertain the new generation.Story is predictable, a family is haunted by an unknown entity and the daughter is in danger of being abducted. Usually audience would react unfavorably towards the stiff plot, but considering that the original sets up this theme for the genre, some degree of lenience is warranted. For the acting, this family doesn't really stand out from the rest of haunting victims, although the child actors perform pretty well since much of the movie invests on them.The original's creepy atmosphere is definitely superior. It has the luxury of being made in simpler time. The remake does try to produce the same effect, yet it feels lacking on a few notes. Movies like Insidious or Sinister arguably have better ambiance and set up, so it opts for a more literal modern touch.Instead of practical effects, Poltergeist uses plenty of CGI, especially towards the latter half. It has its pro and con, the first being it has more peculiar look, which might not be better than most horror flicks but it does stand out. The flaw is it takes much of the horror away. It dabbles more on shocking visual than instilling dread that culminate in fright, the effectiveness of such method hinges on one's taste.In a way Poltergeist tries to modernize itself, it doesn't reach the same air of its original, but the sense of uniqueness helps in presenting a decent eccentric spectacle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Poltergeist" (2015) is a poor remake of a good original movie, but it is not the worst flick on it's own. That said, "Poltergeist" (2015) is kinda nicely acted, although i didn't buy Sam Rockwell's performance - he was miscast or maybe he new this is going to be poor movie so acted just for fun, but it is clear that this wasn't his favorite job to say the least. Kinds did OK job, especially one who played Griffin, and Rosemarie DeWitt's performance was probably the best in this movie.As a horror movie, "Poltergeist" (2015) features tons of clichés, and there aren't true scary moments, you can see "jump scare" scenes from a mile. What i enjoyed about this movie was not the horror elements, but simply family scenes especially during first hour of this movie, but when so called "horror" starts, movie started to drag and by the end i was watching left time like each 5 min.Overall, "Poltergeist" (2015) isn't good, but it isn't particularly bad. If you loved the original, it is nice for seeing it once just for nostalgia, but if you are looking for a decent horror movie, this isn't the one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shot by shot remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand that the studio wanted to do a remake of Poltergeist (1982). It became famous due a few reasons, was it Spielberg or Hooper who directed this flick, the sad news was the fact that the film was cursed as they said back then, Carol Anne Freeling, the young focal point of the series, was played by Heather O'Rourke. Only six years old when the first Poltergeist film was released, O'Rourke captivated audiences with her stark blond hair, doll-like appearance, and big, inquisitive eyes. Sadly, however, she was misdiagnosed with Crohn's Disease in 1987. The following year, O'Rourke fell ill again, and her symptoms were casually attributed to the flu. A day later, she collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest. After being airlifted to a children's hospital in San Diego, O'Rourke died during an operation to correct a bowel obstruction, and it was later believed that she had been suffering from a congenital intestinal abnormality. She will be, and has been, missed by fans around the world.Even as it didn't make it into the classics of the horror buffs it was still worth seeing, no gore or whatsoever but it worked out fine for the family and it spawned a few sequels.This remake of course is literally remade shot by shot. Some will love it others will ask what's the point of doing so. For example the remake of Evil Dead didn't do that and look, it's loved by gorehounds. Still, you will recognise the trees haunting the house, the rope being thrown in the hole, the famous sentence, "they're here", the house falling in pieces. You know what I mean. It was fun to see it done today with CGI ghosts but a classic it never will become. Ideal to watch with your teenagers at home, nothing more, nothing less.The extended cut doesn't add anything towards the scary parts or characterization. The 3D does give it an extra touch towards the horror and the scary moments.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

The scares aren't the creepiest or enough to make my heart skip a beat but it has its moments that were genuinely creepy.

		<fullReview>When I first found out they were remaking Poltergeist I was horrified. This was the horror I grew up loving and basically compared any and all other horrors to. However, when I watched the trailer I was left thinking: "Okay - good trailer. Clown doll literally freaked me out. Maybe this is worth a try." Worth a try. That's what I'll say for this film. In no way do I think it is better than the original, however, I wasn't totally offended by it. To me, it was the same story just set in 2015, and completely made for a 2015 audience, if that makes sense? So incredibly tech-heavy, whether it was the products used in the film itself, or the CGI used to create the film. I was still entertained throughout, and creeped out by some things, so in its way it did its job. But, for now and forever I will always tell someone to watch the original over the remake. There is no contest in my eyes which one is the better Poltergeist film.</fullReview>

Don't you have enough imagination to make a similar story attractive? Because let's be honest, this movie is an exact copy of the first one, except that this one is boring and not scary at all. Sam Rockwell is bugging me through the whole movie. Most of the lines looked forced and aren't played good. I wished I would have watched the original again instead of this useless remake.

With this 2015 version I had a feeling of things being rushed. Most of the movie was true to the original but realizations had to be known right there, there was no discovery or acts lead up to it. The original was all about the emotion, the horror, grief and relief experienced by this family. Here I just didn't get that. The characters were wooden so I had no emotional investment in their plights. The visual effects were decent though. You got to see what was 'beyond' the closet.... were creepy.

		<fullReview>The original Poltergeist was a scary ride. I remember staying up late when I was not supposed to and being very freaked out by the original movie. I think that while this remake has improved on some areas, it lacked what the original had. While Kennedi Clements is a good actor, she just did not have the acting ability of Heather O'Rourke. Immediately I thought that they should have kept the character the platinum blonde, it makes the character more wholesome which in turn makes us the viewer feel more for her. I did like some of the characters in this new one, the clown scene and the scenes where the girl is inside the closet are great. But because of the overuse of CGI it really does take something away. Immediately though I was drawn into this movie. Perhaps this would have been a better sequel or prequel rather than a straight remake. Of course though the way they went with it in parts was very original and kudos for this, but it should have stuck to the original more. Another example being the psychic medium character played by Zelda Rubinstein in the original, in the remake they opt for someone less interesting and it really stands out. Maybe I am just nit picking *shrugs* but I saw the original and sequels a lot when I was a kid so they are important movies to me. Funnily enough I thought the changes with Kennedi in this one was actually a bit dis-respectful to the late Heather O'Rourke, the young girl was not meant to know this but the director should have thought about this. All in all a good movie, but not as good as the original. I will be interested to see if they make a remake of number 2 and 3. 6 out of 10 stars.Greg - Spiritual Counselling UK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted an Evil Dead calibre remake, I got ho-hum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not one of these people that is adamantly against remakes. They can be done properly and some of my favourite horror films are remakes. I love the original Poltergeist films (definitive classics!) and I had high hopes for this film that it would be a new generation of the classic scare-fest. The cast seemed good and the trailer certainly gave us something to look forward to. The delivery of this remake unfortunately is average in every way. It isn't bad, it isn't good and its mostly forgettable. They do try to capture some of the original scenes but they really leave a bad taste in the mouth as the new cast doesn't quite have the same level of pizazz that the original did. Scares feel few and far between and even stale in some instances. The new wave of Horror films all feel the same which is fine because it is a familiar genre but there really needs to be something that stands out to make a modern day horror film genuinely creepy like Insidious was or the oustandingly violent and twisted Evil Dead remake. The one thing I looked forward to in this remake was the infamous line "They're here," and it was delivered so poorly and so matter-of-factly that it almost dragged the movie down.The main cast are all talented people but somehow the script doesn't give them enough. Sam Rockwell is an excellent actor but this role wasn't right for him. He didn't have that everyone's Dad quality that Craig T Nelson had in the original. It felt as though he just wasn't sure what to do with the character. Rosemarie DeWitt fits the role well but isn't given enough to really make a difference in the film and her chemistry with Rockwell is average at best so she gets left behind. Saxon Sharbino, Kyle Catlett and Kennedi Clements play the children and unfortunately Sharbino and Catlett get very little development as characters and Clements who certainly looks the role doesn't get nearly enough development to her character and therefore doesn't even come close to that of Heather O'Rourke in the original film. The entire family should have been such a major focus and you should really feel their terror and you don't. Then you factor in the lack of "the expert." You know the person who comes in to rid the family of their terror whether it be The Exorcist or something of the like. Jared Harris is hardly a blip in the cast and is completely forgettable in a vital role.The problem with this remake and many of the same similar horror films is that it is aimed at late teen-early twenty audiences that just want a little chuckle and don't really want to be scared. I mean you look at director Gil Kenan who's major project prior to this was an animated scare flick and you wonder why Kenan would have been chosen to helm a project that was originally helmed by a master like Tobe Hooper and co-written by Steven Spielberg. I mean I can understand people's hesitation for remakes when the proper respect is not paid to the original source. Poltergeist unfortunately is a second-rate remake with very little care put into it. It is mildly entertaining at best but even worse when you try and hold it against the original. It really is average in every way. I wanted to really like it and instead its already forgotten. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A father at a low point in his life is forced to move to a new neighbourhood but their new house is riddled with angry unrested spirits. A remake of the 1982 film its difficult not to draw comparisons, it is generally entertaining yet fundamentally unnecessary. While the remake revisits and reincorporates 'Poltergeist's' themes, hitting the beats as if plotted on a graph throughout, an ominous tree, the supernatural stacking of objects, an eerie clown and investigator's visions it's hard to pin down a single moment where it does it better.Thanks to Sam Rockwell's Eric Bowen an everyday dad and Jared Harris in a celebrity medium role it does provide a fast paced ride, retaining the family humour of the 1982 version, however, it lacks that idealistic, innocence in contrast to the sinister side that the original Spielberg/Hooper combo provided. Writer David Lindsey's script is fine and the contemporary monitoring equipment, including GPS locators that the investigators use and the roles shuffled highlights that with all its updates, it becomes clinical losing the organic feeling of the original. Yes some effects out do some of the optical effects of its predecessor but not many. Even with a solid supporting cast and Sam Rami on board as producer with the likes of Sinister, Insidious, Conjuring to name a few doing the rounds it's odd why anyone would want to remake Poltergeist in the first place. Following the template of the first, with slight of hand, the ending dispiritingly borrows elements of the 1986 sequel for the 2015 closing. Gil Kenan's offering is by no means a travesty and it has some great acting talent on board but it's not enough to cause a remake celebration and maybe a re-imagining would have been a more fitting semi-original route to take.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'POLTERGEIST': Three Stars (Out of Five) Remake to the 1982 horror classic (which was written and produced by Steven Spielberg, and directed by Tobe Hooper); about a family terrorized by a poltergeist, in the new house they recently moved into. It was directed by Gil Kenan and written by David Lindsay- Abaire. The film stars Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt and Jared Harris. It has a few good scares, and some pretty cool visuals, but it's nowhere near as good as the original.The Bowens move into a new suburban house, after the father, Eric (Rockwell), recently lost his job. Eric and his wife, Amy (DeWitt), learn, at a dinner party, that their new home was built over the ground of a recently relocated cemetery. Their youngest daughter, Madison (Kennedi Clements), starts noticing a supernatural presence right away, and she's later pulled into a 'netherworld' with them. The family enlist the help of paranormal investigators, including a famous TV personality (Harris), to help get her back.The original 'POLTERGEIST' is one of my all-time favorite horror films, it's also one of my favorite Spielberg movies as well. The new writer and director don't seem nearly qualified enough, to do a just remake to it (Sam Raimi did produce it though). The cast is great (I love Rockwell and DeWitt) and it has some great scary scenes (with some awesome 3D visuals); but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing. 'INSIDIOUS' is a much better homage, to Spielberg and Hooper's classic!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/ItzCr1Etfyo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst horror film of the past 15 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is an unnecessary and insulting remaking of a horror classic that has no shame, it trades the films eery tension for cheap jump scares that are usually false and have nothing to with the actual poltergeist.The acting in this movie is sub-par at best, all the children are awful especially the teenage daughter named Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) every line of dialogue she delivers just fells forced and her character is annoying and poorly written. The son Griffin (Kyle Catlett) is really, really bad he has no emotion what so ever and does dumb horror cliché things though out the movie and becomes an annoyance towards the end of the film. The youngest daughter Madison (Kennidi Clements) while a surprising improvement over the previous two actors is still very sub-par, there have been many young actors to give great performances so her age will not sway me as an excuse. Sam Rockwell, Rosemary Dewitt and Jared Hines are the films saving graces as The parents (Rockwell and Dewitt) and a Ghost Hunter (Dines) while there performances are the best part of the movie, the writer and directors have been so lazy this film cant be saved. The plot is pretty much the same, Family moves to new house, Daughter makes friends with a ghost and gets sucked into a T.V and the family must band together to save her. Its just that there is no hart to this movie, The film is written by David Abaire who is the mastermind behind inkhart and Oz the great and powerful two equally dreadful movies with poor writing. he makes no effort to be original and Re-hashes classic lines and scenes that get ruined by the films Director Gil Kenan who decide CGI is what makes a scary movie, and the last act is a poorly filmed CGI extarangaza where the young brother enters the portal to save his sister, the tension is not there as you don't care about the safety of any chapters or the outcome of the movie as a whole because you clocked out of the movie about half an hour ago. The film is an insult the Tobe Hoopers original classic and the studio should be ashamed, this is a lazily written, boringly directed poorly acted (for the most part) and gerbil horror film that offers no real scares or tension, and is utterly forgettable. Seriously Hollywood stop remaking classics and be original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as the Original's Sequels?This Remake is Worth a Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unremarkable and Unnecessary Remake of the Very Popular Original, Directed by Tobe Hooper. Unremarkable Because it Doesn't Break Any New Ground and Unnecessary Because of That Fact.It is Tepid in its Familiarity, Looking Like and Feeling Like Another PG-13 Horror that Gets Released Non-Stop. The Story Still Intrigues and the Cast Headed by Sam Rockwell Does OK with the Suburban Family Thing.This is Not a Bad Movie as These Types Go, but it Really Has Nowhere to Go, Restrained by the Family Friendly Rating. There are a Few Eerie Scenes with a Goosebump or Two and the Overall Result is a Recommendation for Horror Completest and Those That Don't Think That the Original is Beyond Approach. The Tobe Hooper Film was Fresh When Released and was a Scary and a Fine Film. But it is Hardly a Masterpiece of Horror. So If You're Up for a Remake and Don't Expect it to be a Great Remake, This One is Worth a Watch. It's as Good as the Original Sequels (and of course that isn't great praise).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist (2015)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say it from the beginning: regarding remakes of classic films, Poltergeist didn't end up being as bad as I expected. This doesn't mean it's very good, or necessary, or much less that it surpasses the original film; I just found it a mediocre but moderately entertaining horror film with a correct style for the new generations which would find difficult taking a 1982 movie seriously, with all the cultural relics implied by that... not to mention special effects which wouldn't look as impressive nowadays as they were for those of us who watched it 33 years ago. The screenplay of Poltergeist (2015) adds elements which modernize the story and omits details to simplify it (this time, there isn't a dog in the family, there isn't a subtle critic against the proliferation of suburbs and we don't have the "product placement" which wasn't only innovative in 1982, but also genuinely contributed to the nature of the house and its inhabitants). Some of the additions moderately work, while other ones feel forced... simple whims to prove it isn't an exact copy, and that screenwriter David Lindsay- Abaire attempted to "improve" it (without achieving it, of course). Among the positive changes, I would mention the electric disturbances which announce the presence of spirits (or the "poltergeist"), evoking the graphic style of the original film and also thematically complementing the affair of the ghost TV ("They're here"). The negative changes would require a long list, so I will just mention the "medium" (played by Jared Harris) who comes to clean the house; and we know he's qualified to do it because he has a reality show in which he investigates haunted sites. Harris is a good actor, but the character and the creative decision are horrible. Speaking of which, Poltergeist (2015) includes some excellent actors who considerably elevate the dramatic credibility: Sam Rockwell perfectly transmits the frustration of a family man in a bad economical situation; Rosemarie DeWitt brings conviction and has a good chemistry with Rockwell; and Jane Adams is completely credible as a paranormal investigator who takes her work seriously while having some doubts about its scientific validity. The youngsters Kennedi Clements, Saxon Sharbino and Kyle Catlett also make a good work in their roles, and the special effects don't darken the narrative... even though I think they show more than they should during the ending, ruining the mystery and spirituality behind the paranormal events suffered by the Bowen family. In conclusion, Poltergeist (2015) isn't a very good film, but it was better than I expected, and because of that, I can give it a slight recommendation exclusively to the ones who have never seen the original movie. Needless to say, it would be better if they watched it, but I don't want to ask for miracles. We already have enough with the fact that Poltergeist (2015) didn't end up being a disaster; in the niche of remakes, that can be considered a victory. A mediocre compliment, but a compliment after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tearin' up my mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I've been out of the horror session for months, and last weekend I decided watching "Poltergeist" in the movie theater. In the first very ten minutes, for some reason I don't know, I felt agonized and in the necessity of leaving the cinema room. In fact, I may know the reason why I wanted to leave it: I was terrified. Not with the story, which is absurdly repetitive and unoriginal, telling the same old story that has been told a thousand times. The acting is, also, something very ordinary, with lack of skills to develop something new. However, what really scared me were the tense directing and the editing. The director, albeit utilizing the scary jumps that are common since the nineties, has the skills to make you tremble in almost every scene. Everything feels so dark, evil, cruel, that I realized I could be doing something better with my life than watching a classic ghost story that caused me only bad feelings. Maybe younger people than me are gonna enjoy it, but as a 23 year old guy, I feel like it's not for me anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing we haven't seen before, but it's decent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that the original is considered a classic, but I'm also of the mind that even the original is not without it's faults. I'm saying this because I think that what may have been lacking in the original is handled better with the remake. Conversely what this version lacks, the original provided.For starters, the original had absolutely no preamble. The first scenes of Carol Ann going to the flickering TV literally occurred within minutes of the film's opening. It always seemed rushed to me that there was no introduction of sorts. This film does better at providing a build up, if somewhat a small one. It doesn't just thrust you into the paranormal situation straight out of the gate.The thing is with remakes, people are already prepared to naysay, partly because the majority of naysayers are old enough to remember the original and will nearly always choose the "good ole days". We all do it, with movies, with music, what have you. Just as with newer generation music, those who can remember music from even 10-15 years ago will find that new music usually just plain sucks. It's the same for horror remakes unfortunately. With a film like Poltergeist, which is a staple of the paranormal subgenre, there is almost no winning. I've asked myself what could the writers/director have done differently that would appease those going into it having put the original on a pedestal. And frankly I can't think of too much that could have been changed that would somehow make these type of people happy.To start: The parents in this remake are more likable in my humble opinion. The father in particular has a great deal more personality than Craig T. Nelson had. I prefer them as a couple to Nelson and JoBeth Williams. The children here leaving something to be desired however. While they get the job done, the children of the original were far superior actors.I will grant the original had more atmosphere and understated tension than did this one. There was a general feeling of unease that held through the film even while nothing of consequence was occurring. The remake lacked this, and I believe this may be the major hang up of the film. There were many BOO! moments that were sometimes effective. However there was no ever coiling tension. It was more of a case of peaks and pits. The energy was released as soon as the BOO! moment occurred. Wash, rinse, repeat.On the other hand the remake benefits from advancements in special fx and technology. The writers obviously had more liberties with which to exploit the appearance of the supernatural presence. (Think cell phones, ipads, etc.) The tree, the spirits, etc naturally were far better looking in this remake than they were for the original, but clearly that's to be expected. My major beef with the original was that the final act turned too far away from horror into unscary sci-fi; particularly toward the end. That really puts me off from being a die hard "original" defender.I guess what I'm saying is this: I will be one of the few who can see the merits of both films. From what I've read thus far, most either really enjoyed it or can't get over the fact that it's not the original (which it could never be anyway so that's a fight this film will never win). This remake has some qualities I think serve the story better than the original even, while at the same time I don't think it surpassed the original in the most important aspects. Still, it was a FUN film. I came to be entertained, and I was entertained for 91 minutes. Maybe my expectations were too low? Perhaps, however my ultimate decision rests on whether or not a film entertained me.If you're going into it with a very high opinion of the original, I doubt that you will get much enjoyment from it. If you're the type to nitpick at small things, I doubt that you will get much enjoyment from it. If you just like to sit back and have a little excitement for a couple hours, you could do FAR worse than this film. It's decent enough that I don't regret shelling out the $$ to see it in theaters. Just don't expect anything groundbreaking. But then again you probably didn't because after all........it's the dreaded remake! My rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before going to watch the remake version of Poltergeist I decided to watch the originals which to this day remain all time greats.With the remake version of the movie I must admit that I was disappointed not with the special effects but with the plot of the whole movie. It was like they tried to merge all three films into one with a spot of the Amityville movies thrown in for good measure.Some of the movie was predictable (if you've watched the originals) you could easily guess what was going to happen next.With the story being confusing, good special effects and some upcoming stars. poltergeist is one of those movies that you'll either like or hate like depending on how big of a horror fan you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Has Drained The Cup Of Imagination And Creativity Dry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1982, an American supernatural-horror film created a storm at the Box Office. The film was Poltergeist and it was produced by Steven Spielberg(E.T., Duel, Jaws) and directed by Tobe Hooper. A great controversy ensued after the movie was released, as to who was the real director of the film. A lot of people thought that Spielberg had directed the film rather than Tobe Hooper, because of a rumor that Hooper was absent during filming sessions. Spielberg also had a clause in his contract to prevent him directing any other film while he made E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Poltergeist was followed by two sequels, Poltergeist II: The Other Side(1986) directed by Brian Gibson, and Poltergeist III(1988) by Gary Sherman. Poltergeist 2 was a commercial success, but the last film of the trilogy, Poltergeist 3 was a failure. I have seen Poltergeist 3, and believe me, it is a very good film starring veteran actors Tom Skerrit and Nancy Allen.However all of this is in the past now, onto the present. This remake of the original brings it up-to-date with modern C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery) that they didn't have back in 1982. The story is the same but has some minor changes. The cast is decent, with Sam Rockwell(Moon, The Green Mile) being the more prominent and established actor. The special-effects are what make this film work. Since those who have already seen the original film will find the film predictable, and the only bonus will be the never before seen effects present here.Verdict: This film can be considered a light add-on to the original three films. I don't consider this film a real serious piece of film-making. More Recommendations: The Legend of Hell House(1973), The Amityville Horror(1979), Burnt Offerings(1976), The Changeling(1980), The Shining (1980), Haunted(1995), Stir of Echoes(1999), What Lies Beneath(2000), Dark Water(2005), The Haunting in Connecticut(2009).Thanks for reading this review. May you live long and prosper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shoddy, by-the-numbers remake that favors quick scares over lasting dread.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this out of the way: Remakes never surpass the originals (aside from very rare cases like John Carpenter's The Thing). The premise is the same - a family moves into a house that's haunted with a poltergeist, their daughter gets trapped into the "spirit" realm and they hire an expert to help the family get her out. It's essentially a retelling of the original story with a few tweaks and a ton of CGI. So is Poltergeist one of the rare instances where the remake is as good or better than the original? F*ck no. But that doesn't mean it has no entertainment value as a standalone horror flick.Poltergeist is a popcorn movie more than anything. Everything about it, from the poor writing to the lukewarm thrills, only provide surface-level enjoyment. It never gets under your skin like a good horror film should. It's not scary or disturbing, and it definitely won't stick with you once the credits start to roll. The problem is that Poltergeist is extremely formulaic and predictable. They set up these creepy scenarios and build up suspense by making it really quiet for a few moments, and then a few seconds later... BAM, loud noise and creepy face jumps at you. I love me a good jump scare but the scares are cheap and you can see them coming from a mile away. It's a shame because there are moments where you can tell the director is trying to build tension and unease, but these easy scares ruin any momentum the atmosphere had going for it.Acting wise, Sam Rockwell is the obvious highlight. He's a very talented, likable actor and elevates any scene he's in just by his presence. He could have easily done this role in his sleep or on auto-pilot but Rockwell commits to the part and is by far the most watchable and relatable character in the movie. The family dynamic feels real solely because of him. Jared Harris gives a great performance as well considering the limited screen time he was given.Which brings me to the characters themselves, and this is where the movie fails. Hard. The only characters that feel "real" are the father, the son, and the younger daughter (who isn't used nearly as much as she was in the original). Everyone else is just... there. The mother and older daughter add literally nothing to the story, the paranormal team members are completely forgettable and are only there for exposition, hell even Jared Harris' character is a huge wasted opportunity. It's the fault of the writers really. I mean there is some truly *cringeworthy* dialogue that's so unbelievable that it looks as if the actors are just reading off cue cards. And then they throw in a really really dumb love subplot between Jared Harris and the lead investigator which was a waste of time and excruciatingly awkward to watch.This movie does polish some classic scenes from the original. The living tree, the clowns (yes, multiple), the subterranean graveyard, etc. It all looks sleek, smooth, and modern. But again, the novelty factor is gone so you pretty much know how everything is going to play out. There's one iconic scene that they butchered though, anyone who's seen the movie knows exactly what I'm talking about. It just felt half-assed and shoehorned in simply because it was such a powerful scene in the original and the filmmakers probably felt obligated to throw it in. The difference is that the original version was haunting and unexpected while this version lasts for like a split second and leaves you feeling absolutely nothing.Again, there's no point in comparing this to its original because it pales in comparison in every way. It's one of the better recent horror remakes sure but that isn't saying much. However, as a standalone B-horror midnight popcorn creepfest, Poltergeist can provide a modicum of entertainment.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see an original older film and enjoy it - and of course it is highly rated as this original. Then you need to ask, why did someone think it was a good ideal for a remake. Did this have something new to add to this story, and was it something different from the typically stated, wanting to bring it up to date with our current times.Well this film failed. And essentially is a pointless remake.One of the oddest thing I have to note, is casting evidently looked far and wide to find a little girl that had large eyes and similar facial structure to Heather O'Roarke.This remake consists of many similarities, even identical script in some areas to the original. So I guess that the writers,directors thought that this film lacked - the typical angst ridden teen with her face either in a cellphone or laptop, and to bring it current they put in the story-line of being out of work, money issues, foreclosed homes, and a father that is trying to connect to a son that just doesn't get him.This film also decides to use the extremely loud bangs and bumps throughout to try and give the viewer that jump scare.This movie really isn't worth the time out of your evening to watch. Well that is unless you want to spend the entire time watching each scene and script and comparing it do the great original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'In my last house the closet ate me.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't recall ever seeing the 1982 'Poltergeist' so I have no way to compare the two. Anyway this one is bound to be quite different to reflect modern times, like cell phones, flat screen TVs, remote controlled drones, and GPS tracking. As of this writing (Oct 2015) the movie has a 5.0 IMDb rating which seems a bit low to me. It is a very entertaining and funny movie, certainly not meant to be taken too seriously. Sam Rockwell is a good choice as the father, Eric Bowen, recently out of work. His wife is Rosemarie DeWitt as Amy Bowen. Their sassy teen daughter is Texan Saxon Sharbino (about 15) as Kendra Bowen. Their nice young son is Kyle Catlett as Griffin Bowen. And the movie really hinges on the performance of young Canadian actress Kennedi Clements as 6-yr-old Madison Bowen. It was her comment at the end, when they are looking for a new home, 'In my last house the closet ate me.' Her performance and reactions through the movie were essential and she did it very well.The basic story, they are moving to a new community in Illinois (actually filmed in Canada) and with Eric just out of work need a good bargain, but they are not told that it was built on the site of an old cemetery. Plus, locals were told that all the bodies had been moved but it seems only the headstones were moved. The spirits below need to go 'to the light' but need a guide. That is why the young daughter is kidnapped by the poltergeists, she disappears and they have to find a way to get her back.Not wanting to go to the police, who would believe them anyway, they enlist the help of some specialists in hunting this kind of phenomena. As a last resort they get a well-known ghost hunter and TV personality, Brit Jared Harris as Carrigan Burke, who explains how all this works and helps them accomplish their mission.You can't appreciate this movie unless you see it in a theater, even a home theater with surround sound and a subwoofer for the deep, picture-rattling bass. The visuals are very good and there are a few scary moments but I found more 'laugh out loud' moments. I was entertained!! I watched it on DVD in my well-equipped home theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure if any of my review contains any actual spoilers or plot details (i guess any review could be). My review is focusing on the general outline of the movie. I really liked this remake. I thought the acting was really good and the characters were really likable, the story basis and many of the events were pretty much the same as the original. There were plenty of suspenseful moments (had to close eyes at a few). The only reasons why i didn't give this movie a 10 was that the music score wasn't as creepy as the original, it was a little short on time and there didn't seem to be much of a battle with the spirits (as there was in the original). If you treat this as a separate movie completely then it is really good-there are plenty of jumps, the acting is great, special effects are great and there were plenty of nods to the original (for fans of the original). I thought this was a great movie -a worthy remake, and i hope they consider a sequel if it does well at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new in this unimpressive remake reminding you of the basic plot of Ramsay's HOTEL (1985)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A recently released English horror movie is normally expected to introduce some fresh element into the genre with the help of advanced technology capable of contributing a lot. But surprisingly as POLTERGEIST, we get to see a quiet unconvincing and under performing remake of the 1982 original film with the same title that was also co-written and produced by Steven Spielberg.Probably POLTERGEIST was remade since the older version is still very popular among the lovers of horror films in particular. However sadly it does no justice to its reputed legacy and turns out to be nothing more than a pointless remake bringing back the old memories without scaring you in any way in its 90 minutes of duration (shorter than the original). Moreover in these past decades, so many films have already exploited this clichéd idea of a family moving into a new house to meet some invisible power, that one doesn't feel any kind of excitement watching it once again without any fresh elements added into the old script (except the Drone!).Hence even though it follows the same (once) interesting sequences as it is, the excitement goes missing due to the repetitive or stale execution. And that remains applicable to both the section of viewers, one who have earlier seen the original long time back and the others who haven't or know nothing about the famous movie and its other different sequels released in the past decades. In fact the viewers already familiar with the 1982 version might feel more disappointed watching the remake due to its poor show of emotions and unimpressive interactions between the key characters (despite their kid girl being abducted by the evil spirits) making no impact whatsoever on the end user.For friends, who simply wish to know about the scary quotient of the film, there is nothing much to write about since it truly lacks the much expected shock value or intensity normally seen in such horror based movies. As a result, the new age POLTERGEIST simply fails to impress the audience with an outdated presentation offering nothing new and one might feel more entertained re-watching a hit Ramsay movie instead to give you a clear idea.Interestingly the basic plot of the film, revealing the existence of an old cemetery on the same plot used by the builders, also reminds you of a Ramsay brother's film titled HOTEL revolving around a similar theme released in 1985.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was the point of this movie? Simple : a slap in the face from the morons at Hollywood and beyond. The only reason I bothered with this remake is because I was under the false impression that it was another story in the saga, or rather, an updated version of the story with different plot, etc etc... Instead, a bland, rushed, completely POINTLESS piece of work, and an absolute waste of money. I won't bother with spoilers, if you can read between the lines and have been seeing the garbage released for the last 10 years (atleast), then you understand. A sign of the times indeed, and also a sign that Hollywood is bankrupt on ideas, as people have been wising up to the pirates in the industry stealing original story lines and selling them as their own. It that true Sam Raimi had something to do with? If so, shame shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Fantastic , Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Warning Spoilers Inside***Like anyone that approaches middle age I myself saw the Original Poltergeist in 1982 , in fact I am certain most of the adult actors did in this movie as well. Remakes of great film have been traditionally dice rolls in history. Sometimes you get Love Affair (1939) and then An Affair to Remember (1957) , or most often and most likely you just get the latest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles flick.Poltergeist (2015) is in my opinion an effective update , that is unapologetically loyal to the mood and expression of it's predecessor Poltergeist (1982). The elephant in the room with all remakes is that we have all seen it before. well most of us.So as before a suburban family down on it's luck is moving into a new suburban home at a "good" deal. It doesn't long as you can imagine for the family to discover what the catch is.The win in this film is the writing or re-writing if you wish. Incredibly respectful to the terms of the original , and carefully molded into a modern form with the use of technology and modern cultural behaviors as the shaping tools. This deft penning is again another good work added to the resume of David Lindsay-Abaire (Rabbit Hole).Even more enjoyable is the characters and scenarios provided by the actors at work. Of course , as I will always qualify films such as these as being of the horror vein , there were some really good exchanges in the film. The kitchen exchange between Eric Bowen (Sam Rockwell) and Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) exposed a script that allowed the actors to reach their characters core easily ,thus adding to the empathy of their plight.It is worth mentioning as well that in 1982 movie effects were way different. One of the gifts of this film is that the story can be more complete. The drone sequence and the execution of the rescue of Maddie would not have been possible in that year. this is a bonus for fans of the old and the newcomer as well.Yes , I will say it. Poltergeist (1982) was better in my Opinion. The Production team chose to face this monster when choosing to remake this film. One of the things to remember about storytelling is that sometimes the storyteller is worthy of telling the story in their way. This is the obvious truth here.This is not the movie of the century (Duh). But you won't waste an hour and a half either.Three Stars(of 5).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Re-Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I hadn't seen the original, I might have given this a 7. Nevertheless, it is better than most re-makes, and I wonder how many that view this film have seen the original anyway.All, in all, it is entertaining and has some decent shock moments. It stays fairly true to the first, but now with things we'd expect, like iPhones and drones, etc. However, we never really care much about any of the characters except possibly the 2 youngest children, but only because they are young innocents, not due to any real character development.Within the first 30 seconds of the movie, there is profanity muttered by the teenager and shouted by the pre-schooler. Why? After that I expected the dialogue to be filled with foul language, but surprisingly it didn't. Was that initial usage to be "cool?" I think the hoax and reality TV angles could have gotten more play, as that's what everyone seems to be interested in these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Back the Nostalgic Creeps, but Uncreatively Copies the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POLTERGEIST, the 2015 remake of the 1982 supernatural horror classic with the same title , haunts with the same hair-rising creeps that made the original Tom Hooper/Steven Spielberg film, a cultural phenomenon but it's utterly devoid of any inventiveness, nor of a sensibly-constructed narrative, to make itself a stand out among the string of horror movies that recently inundated the big screen.This haunted house-horror updates the set-up of its original source material. By "update", I mean it has literally filled the house with new gadgets (most strikingly recognizable, the flatscreen TV), and also takes CGI-generated effects to its service to deliver its dreadful scares. Now following the Bowen family, who have chosen to settle in a suburban home to mend their family's fiscal inadequacies, this remake seems to duplicate the proceedings of the classic from which it is based. Such attempt works with spine-creeping effects, but only for ephemeral period. It won't take too long before perplexing illogical events start to dangle from the central narrative, and they won't establish any connection from each other. It also doesn't help that most of the characters don't posses emotional depths. There's this baffling creepy feeling about the Bowen parents' laconic natures, and to their children's inexplicable behaviors, but the nonsensical turns and shifts deprive the stream of ominous events with logic and sense, rendering the entire proceeding vapid and forgettable.The ever imminent horror tactics work, but eventually pales in the wake of an inevitably distracting narrative incoherence.For all its frightening thrills and chills alone, POLTERGEIST, is undoubtedly a cinematic success, able to creep audience out and make them stick at the edge-of-their-seats. The effort to update the setting to contemporary feel, somewhat feels needlessly exaggerated, but nonetheless helps in magnifying the amount of scares to claustrophibic levels. This is where the movie it at its best. But at its worst is the feeling of its unnecessariness, a film bearing the same old overly familiar creeps of its predecessor but losing them swiftly as the end credits begin rolling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2015 Poltergeist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family suburban home is haunted by evil forces must come together to rescue their daughter after the apparitions take her captive. This film is a remake of the original Poltergeist which was directed by Tobe Hooper - but between you and me Steven Spielberg most likely directed it. This new film might be the scariest thing 13 and unders have yet seen, just as the original was, for our parents back in 1982. Who might as well find it an enjoyable trip down memory lane. I believe the reason to remake a movie is whether the idea was really cool and the movie may not be that good. This is the opportunity for a horror movie to eliminate the horror cliché of previous decade, such as this little girl who for I don't know what reason is not afraid of ghosts and demons. Because when you are 4 years old and your closet is filled with demons talking to you, you don't stay there waving at them. Ghosts and demons are not cool at all. I would be done and running to my parents peeing my pants if something similar happened to me; and I think that's how it should be. Sam Rockwell provides welcomed bits of comic relief and pairs nicely with Rosemarie DeWitt as the parents. The children are especially well cast as well as Jared Harris. Yes, they've been given trendier names (Dana, Carol Anne and Robbie in 1982) because this is clearly 2015 Poltergeist after all: pivotal TV becomes a big ol'flat screen, iphone, GPS devices and a drone camera come into play. Characters are all functional. Moreover, the best part of this movie definitely is Sam Rockwell. I've started to appreciate this guy very recently as before I couldn't pin-point exactly why I didn't like him; but he really is a fantastic actor. I believe Poltergeist was an original and unique thing when it came out in 1982 but now every horror movie pulled something out of it and all those bits and pieces have been seen many many many times. Finally, there's not much to complain about here. Except that, as with a lot of revisited classics, the story is definitely not as revolutionary as you remember it. For veterans it will be more like scary but pleasant nostalgia. Plus, at a certain point in the film I accepted the fact that it doesn't recapture the fright of the original. It over relies on cgi, there's so much of it and it's not that good. It doesn't look real which doesn't make it scary. Realism. This is what made Insidious and The Conjuring so frightening to me. The movie was entertaining but nothing really creeped me out. Even the clowns scene didn't scare me - and god knows that I hate clowns - because I saw the jump scares of it in the trailer. The end is really abrupt. I was disappointed because I obviously watched the original and most of the clever sequences and effective scares are all basically from a movie that already exists and is directed better so what is the purpose of this movie? Most likely the answer is: TO MAKE MONEY. Do we really needed this remake? Overall, do yourself a favour and check the original first. All I can give you is the best reason ever: Steven-freaking-Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PLEASE don't give anyone money for making this rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few bullet points I came up with within an hour of seeing it: 1. There's no likable characters. Not effort to establish them or reasons to sympathise with them. We get a few minutes of exposition about the schlub fathers bad career luck, that's it. "Hey, why bother writing a good story, everyone knows what Poltergeist is about already right?". The establishing scenes (moving in/seeing ghosts for first time/getting paranormal investigators in) is all done so quickly and uncreatively. 2. The dialogue is terrible, like the screenplay was scribbled down in half an hour after a quick viewing of the original.3. Did any of the writers actually bother to find out what G.P.S. even stands for? Or how it works? Let alone find out what cheap drones are really capable of. Apparently Bluetooth can travel between different dimensions, wonder what version they were on? 4. The parent's performances are perfunctory, the kids are all bad. The Irish ghost hunter is the only slightly-likable performance but that's barely enough and it's right at the end. 5. There's no attempt to put any interesting spins on the original story. Bolting on a (really bad) slightly alternative ending doesn't count. So damn lazy. 6. Absolutely none of the CG ghosts/effects are scary. The original succeeded in having effective scares when needed, but also effective humour too. This glaringly has neither. Hang on, i'm wrong....there were a couple of laughably-bad scenes, but not many of them either. 7. The whole thing has the cynical air of "Let's just get this over and done with as quickly and efficiently as possible so we can hopefully make a fair profit for minimal effort and expense". 8. Watch the excellent original and forget this rubbish ever existed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review is in the first place to those who has watched an original Poltergeist from 1982 and hope to watch some maybe better remake of great horror movie. But his remake is awful (in 95% remake are just that). Act,plot,story are pale copy of original movie.Don't watch this and waste your time. Go watch Poltergeist from 1982 if you didn't watch instead of this remake failure. It's full of great act,twist's and awesome special effect who is still awesome after 30+ year ago. This new Poltergeist dose not follow the old movie. It's look like they have budget of 35 dollars instead of 35.000.000 dollars. Only good thing in this "movie" is the actor Sam Rockwell. I'm disappointed with those big productions house what they do with great movie title. Like I was saying,don't watch this and waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Amazing But Doesn't Deserve All The Hate Either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to start off by saying that I honestly don't understand the hate this film has received from some people as it's nowhere near as bad as they are making it out to be. Whether it's because some are "fan boys" of the original and are p*ssed at the mere thought it was remade, I don't know, but after viewing it for myself, a lot of the hate is unjust in my opinion. I'm not saying other people aren't allowed to have different opinions. I'm just saying I don't understand where all the hate comes from.That being said, this version definitely isn't better than the original - far from it, and it's not one of the best horror films of this genre, but it IS a decent watch and as long as you don't watch it thinking "that never happened in the original!" you should be fine. It IS a remake after all.Aside from a couple of wee things here &amp; there (and some people being wrong), the basic premise here is the same as the original, which of course is a good thing because why tear apart something that was already good to begin with? Obviously, this version adds it's own ingredients into the mix, and in general they are decent additions with a couple of good creepy moments mixed in.One thing that was always going to differ from the original was the effects, and going against what some people have said, this isn't a CGI-fest. It's far from that in actual fact. Yes, CGI is obviously used, but it's nowhere near to being over-the-top and the scenes it's used in it's done well.The acting wasn't bad either and I thought the cast all done a fine job. However, I did think that the characters seemed a bit mismatched for some reason, like they were all out of place, and unlike the original, there wasn't that "wholesome" family feel. That was a minor irritant for me though, as I did enjoy the movie overall.Will this one stand the test of time like the original '82 version? Doubt it, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUCKED! That's the first thing you must know about this lame remake. Take everything that makes and works in the original and just make the most forced, fake family with the hokiest dialog. This movie goes from trying to be funny to serious with no real concept for building tension. There is nothing inspired, creepy and suspenseful here. The effects are lifeless and uninteresting CGI. The actors can clearly be seen "acting." The attempts to "modernize" this movie are the worst and absolutely date this thing. They bring in a drone and have a smart phone "issue" just seemingly for the sake of saying, "Oh, we're in 2015 now, so we've gotta show a drone, even if it makes no sense in this." The score for this is generic and has no distinction compared to the beautiful themes created by Jerry Goldsmith for the original. Why did this need to be made???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>faded copy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bowens move into the suburbs heavily hit by foreclosures. Eric (Sam Rockwell) lost his job and they have to downsize. His wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) and his kids try to adjust. They are utterly broke and discover the development was built on a former cemetery. The youngest Madison starts to play with an invisible presence. Griffin sees the weird happenings but his family is dismissive until the spirits grab Madison. They call on Dr. Brooke Powell (Jane Adams) and her team of students to help. Powell brings in psychic Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris).This is a remake of the classic 82 original. They have essentially taken the plot and the big scenes from the original. It's a faded copy without adding anything great. Everything feels like it's hitting at a lower level. I love Rockwell and DeWitt. Jane Adams is a step down and Jared Harris fails completely by comparison. It's not his fault but he's not capable of being an icon of horror like Zelda Rubinstein. Making them exes only reduce the potency. It's trying to add humor without success. The only real improvement is Griffin's character. I like his guilt and thereby explains his need to rescue his sister. I don't buy that the parents not going after him but I generally like the Griffin switcharoo. This may stand on its own some day but is inferior to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Massive fan of the original, but like the remake of Carpenter's The Fog, Poltergeist is utterly lacking in heart. Instead it's a series of almost disconnected, utterly illogical set pieces.The script is abysmal, and whereas the original was genuinely suspenseful and engrossing, this pallid remake substitutes bangs, loud noises and sudden camera moves for what the original had.The characters are all irrational within the bounds of normal human behaviour. For example:1. A little boy fearful of everything in a new neighbourhood is placed in the most remote and unwelcoming room in the house 2. Little boy freaks out over major supernatural trauma and is utterly ignored by family. 3. Little boy attacked by tree (and teen daughter attacked by hands through floor)is IMMEDIATELY abandoned whilst the family searches for missing girl. 4. Teenage girl attacked from the underworld then spends the rest of the movie casually and unconcernedly lounging around on the couch. 5. Paranormal researcher having seen chairs THAT HE IS ABOUT TO SIT ON hurled across the room yet is still sceptical that the whole thing is a hoax, then when a terrifying major paranormal event occurs to him, he tells no one.I could go on, but suffice it to say that this movie is such a pathetic piece of dross that the scriptwriter and directors should hang their heads in shame.</fullReview>

It did not look to different from the source material, but I must admit it was freighting.They used all the ghost tricks that have been exploited ever since Paranormal Activity to scare the crap right out of me. Than the movie takes the turn that makes it look like Insidious and other ghost movies that have been flooding the screen.But the big difference is that like the first the movie is scary yet humorous and suitable for the whole family.It's differently worth checking out, especially if you like the recent trend of Ghost movies coming out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd just like to strain this - anyone going into this movie expecting a horror film will be disappointed. It is NOT a horror movie. It might be scary to kids under 12, but to those of us who are older, it comes off as an edgy adventure movie. Now, onto the inevitable comparison - this remake, as is so often the case, can't hold a candle to the original. But that doesn't make it non-enjoyable. It's a fun, jump-scare-ridden afternoon at the matinée - which is all I'd advise to pay for this film (certainly not worth the up charge for the 3D).What stands out in this movie are the performances. The entire well- rounded cast gives a bravo-inducing performance. They are all so well-fit to their characters.So, yeah, go see this if you want a good action chilly adventure movie with an edge. The performances save it from shrinking into horror remake obscurity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable enough remake but has some flaws overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After moving to a new home, a family finds that the series of strange incidents around the house are the cause of a vicious, violent poltergeist living with them and must rely on a group of experts when they kidnap their daughter into another dimension.For the most part this was a fine if somewhat flawed remake. The biggest thing against this one is the fact that there's much more of an emphasis on speeding throughout everything that it tends to come off as quite rushed without any reason. This one starts in on the supernatural theme quite early on, merely minutes after the move-in with nothing that is worth getting upset over and yet the insistence on moving away is brought up which makes this feel so rushed. It gives off the idea of having missed a few steps in order to get to this spot in the film rather than simply going from the arrival to the initial claims of something happening in the house beyond the steps shown here. Even the other antics here, from the spirit attacks on the house to the random blurting out of the big twist here that starts the whole haunting being a throwaway line in the middle of the movie rather than gradually developing naturally in here since it has to rush through everything. Likewise, there's also the fact that being a remake it severely diminishes a lot of the surprise and shock from what happens here by pretty much running through the entire plot without much deviation which makes what happens in here not that shocking or original when it showcases the attacks in the bedroom or forces them to bring in the spiritual guides. Once it gets past all that and focuses on the two in the other dimension, the heavy-handed and obvious CGI environment leaves a lot to be desired with the rather lame look that's not at all realistic and likely to actually occur given the way it looks throughout the time in there as the bright flashes and obviously fake heads are just atrocious-looking to take them out of the moment. There's some damage done here because of that yet there's still a few rather enjoyable parts here. Despite the rushed nature of what's happening, the film isn't truly boring at all as there's plenty of build-up to the actual haunting where this one really gets a lot right. Those scenes are incredibly fun, with the family's supernatural- based attacks being quite impressive, the actual segment where the house comes alive and begins targeting them with far more intense abandon than expected. Even the action leading into the trip into the other dimension is a lot of fun with the ghosts becoming aggressive in a fun enough form that makes for a great sense of fun here, and leading into the great finale that's even bigger in terms of fun action. They make this one fun enough to be enjoyable.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

As seen in many other reviews I agree that this remake is unnecessary. Aside from the stunning visual affects which is more realistic than a majority of other movies filmed today, "Poltergeist", for lack of a better word, sucks. I found the acting flat and lacking any emotional connection to the story and the characters themselves. In addition, the movie itself is uncreative both visually and script-wise. There were many opportunities to display unique cinematography however after the first scene, I found myself categorizing the movie as just another a useless, cliché, horror story, that lowers the bar for the horror genre. Gil Kenan's "Monster House" was a terrific, original, and fresh masterpiece that added volume to the horror genre. However after watching "Poltergeist" I have lost faith in his directorial abilities. I usually enjoy most movies, however this one was truly unbearable to watch. I give it three stars for the foundation of the story and the excellent work of the visual effects team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't that I mind remakes. If a remake is better than the original, so be it. But there's a scene in this film where the boy keeps saying, "There's nothing to be afraid of", and he's absolutely right.Steven Spielberg wrote and produced the original. Note to directors -- don't remake Spielberg films...no matter who you are...you haven't got the talent to compete.The plots are very similar, so no surprises there.The "events" differ somewhat, but not for the better.Perhaps it comes down to cast. Sam Rockwell is a pretty decent actor, but I wasn't impressed with him here as the father. Rosemarie DeWitt -- the mother here -- is an actress????? Jared Harris as the occult specialist? Can't hold a candle to that spooky lady in the original. Jane Adams as an occult investigator -- sort of okay, certainly not memorable. Saxon Sharbino as the older daughter -- okay if you want another teenage zombie connected to her cell phone. Kyle Catlett as the son -- acting is not for him. Kennedi Clements as the younger daughter -- again can't hold a candle to the original. Nicholas Braun as another of the investigators -- please no. Of course, maybe these are all decent actors working under a lousy director.Pray to the poltergeists that there won't be any sequels to this awful slop. Buy the DVD of the original.</fullReview>

I can't think of a better way to describe it, and I'm not sure if the musical score had anything to do with it (the original music was so good and it help set the scene). I tried going into it not to compare it too much to the original, but one of the beautiful things about the original is when the supernatural started happening it was subtle and almost something funny. I won't spoil too much but when the tree started growling and the ground starting pushing a stick back when the little girl was playing I just got the impression that that was the part where as a viewer I was supposed to go "uh oh.

Carol Anne, Carol Anne, where are you? Who is Madison? None of the characters come close to having the performances portrayed in the original. The anger and frustration of Craig T. Nelson, the tears and sadness of JoBeth Williams, the worry you felt from the older sister and brother, and creepiness of Zelda Rubinstein. I did not feel the chemistry among this new cast and I did not feel the pain and agony a family would feel had their child really been taken/kidnap by poltergeist. However, not to say this movie did not have its spooky moments, but I feel it relied more on CGI and less on character development and its ability to bring more to the plot while at the same time staying on the same path of the original: For example Rob Zombie's Halloween. He gave us a back story and a new version of Laurie while still keeping the same elements. Overall for a movie that had three times the budget of the original, it was WEAK!</fullReview>

Something that's a success today will be a bargain basement DVD tomorrow. It's like tossing pennies at multi-million dollar projects that last for a brief time before falling into the hole of a "cheap" Walmart.This is obviously just a step-by-step path for the original and with less punch.

		<shortDescription>Mediocre expectations, barely mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*No spoilers* Being a big fan of the original but also understanding that there is a 30 year gap between the 2 films, I was hoping for a well done masterpiece to rival the original. However, what was met was a barely mediocre movie, with it all to blame on one thing. Terrible characters.The actors themselves did a great job of portraying the characters that were on screen, the scares were more jump than the originals creativity and terror but it worked in its own way. The digital effects were beautiful and well done and it was a interesting twist to have the movie focus equally on the son and the daughter instead of just the youngest daughter. What ruined the entire movie is how none of the characters acted appropriately. In the middle of the movie, after they had just spent 30 minutes building up fear to invoke terror and despair in the biggest event in the movie, it all of a sudden became comedic? Barely a tear was shed, barely a smart decision made and the characters that had led me to be scared in the first hour now made me wish that they were the ones with their lives in peril. The comedy was totally out of place, ruined the horror it had already invoked and the swapping of the creepy small psychic lady in the original for a brash, old, irritating Scottish man is unforgivable. The fear that the digital effects should have brought to the movie no longer had any effect on me because I no longer cared after the ridiculous behaviour of the characters.Whoever designed the characters and wrote the script should be shot. The actors did their best, the incorporation of new technology and new scares into the movie was well done, although they missed a few crucial aspects from the original, but the stupidity and inappropriate behaviour and feelings of the characters just made the movie utterly ridiculous.I made an account just to write this review, I was that appalled. Don't watch this, watch the original. And maybe in another 30 years they'll take another stab at this and get it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary remake that might be considered 'fine' if it weren't for the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist isn't half bad but it is as unnecessary as a cassette player in a 2015 Lamborghini.When it comes to the Poltergeist remake, we were hopeful and optimistic but unfortunately the final product for the 2015 film simply fails to deliver unless you have never seen the original 1982 film.The plot of the 2015 Poltergeist is virtually identical to the classic supernatural horror, with the exception of minute variances. A family, newly moved into a housing development affected by the foreclosure epidemic, experience odd disturbances which swiftly take on a malevolent tone. When the youngest daughter seemingly disappears, mother and father must unite with paranormal experts to save her and themselves.While horror fans won't be able to shake the eerie similarities between the two Poltergeist films, super fans of the original will find this year's version to be a sub-par replica, a near copy/paste of the 80s classic.When you look back at the talent involved with the 1982 film, you realize that creative juggernauts of their genres came together for a magical creation. Spielberg brought the carefully cultivated imagination in the form of a fresh and innovative story. Tobe Hooper brought the unshakeable terror through strong-minded vision through direction. The cast was brimming with underrated but well known actors and undiscovered young talents.Though the 2015 Poltergeist has talent in the form of Rosemarie DeWitt and Sam Rockwell, who both carry more than their own weight as the heads of the family experiencing the haunting, Sam Raimi's production falls horrendously short. Raimi has only himself to blame by green-lighting the tremendously successful and horrifying Evil Dead remake. And it is in the differences between the 2015 Poltergeist from the 2013 Evil Dead where the illuminating explanation resides.In short, Poltergeist adds nothing to the narrative of its predecessor nor does it act as a catalyst in showcasing a newcomers aptitude for the cinematic craft. Both director Gil Kenan and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire are odd choices for the horror film, both with a heavy family-friendly filmography.Neither have an affinity for horror, exemplified by their inability to satisfy horror genre fans. The scares are rudimentary at best, and at worst, showcased in their entirety in all marketing trailers for the film. And what they do accomplish in adding, is a subtractive addition, in showcasing what was originally unseen and off screen terror of the original.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad of a movie but another example as to why not every movie needs a remake. Especially if you can't make it better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They're here." Eric (Rockwell) and Amy (DeWitt) have just moved their family into a new neighborhood and a great new house. Soon after moving in strange things begin to happen to their youngest daughter. One night, while the parents are away the house comes alive, and when they get back they are horrified to find that their little girl is missing. The real terror occurs when they find out where she went to. When people ask me what the scariest movie I have ever seen is I always answer the same way, the original Poltergeist. I was about 10 when I saw it, and to this day I still get chills when I think of it. With that mind set, I was nervous to watch this movie. I finally got up the nerve and half way through I realized something, I was wrong to be worried. The movie wasn't that bad and they stayed pretty true to the original, but it was lacking the real horror aspect to it. The original just had some aspect to it that worked, this one was missing something to make it truly scary. Overall, not that bad of a movie but another example as to why not every movie needs a remake. Especially if you can't make it better than the original. I give this a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Typical Example of How Poor of Good and Creative Writers Hollywood Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unemployed Eric Bowen (Sam Rockwell) moves with his wife Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) and their children Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), Griffin (Kyle Catlett) and Madison (Kennedi Clements) to a house in the suburb. Soon strange events happen in the house and when Eric and Amy go to a dinner party, they learn that the house was built on an old cemetery but the bodies were moved to another cemetery. Meanwhile Kendra, Griffin and Madison are haunted by ghosts and the little girl vanishes. Eric and Amy do not go to the police since there is no feasible explanation for what has happened, but Amy goes to the Paranormal Research Department of the university. The team goes to the house and their leader Dr. Brooke Powell (Jane Adams) summons the specialist Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris). Will they be capable to rescue Madison?The 1982 "Poltergeist" is a classic in the horror genre and among the best of this genre. This remake is a typical example of how poor of good and creative writers Hollywood is; therefore the need of reusing successful story lines for the younger generations. The weak screenplay uses drone; the success of "Insidious" and the astral projection; a character, Carrigan Burke, who looks like an exorcist; an obnoxious character, the unemployed Eric Bowen. There are explosions, storm and a series of weird events and no neighbor goes to the street. The good point is the eight-year-old Kennedi Clements. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Poltergeist: O Fenômeno" ("Poltergeist: The Phenomenon")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One can hope a remake will be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty, the original "Poltergeist" was a bit of a let-down when considering that it was promoted as a "Spielberg" movie. That was a deceptive marketing ploy. I wouldn't have given the original a higher rating than this remake. Spielberg didn't direct the original. Tobe Hooper did. Spielberg only lent his name and production resources. So before everyone gets all sentimental over the original being so awesome, let the facts show that E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial released the weekend after Poltergeist, and while Poltergeist beat out E.T. in box office draw its first week out, E.T. took in 7 times the gross of Poltergeist over the course of its run. This remake wasn't bad. Decent enough CG. A-List quality acting talent (even if Rockwell has dropped a bit in popularity). I thought the drone was a nice touch. The otherworldly landscape of slimy writhing bodies was far more nightmare-worthy than the puppet-like creature in Tope Hooper's rendition. I also thought the little girl's closet portal was much better in this version. I remember making the comment while viewing the original, that Carol-Ann's closet needed some Vagisil®. Judging by the laughs I got from nearby viewers, I'd say my observation was accurate. People always defend the original when remakes emerge. But in my opinion, a movie has to be far more timeless and legendary to be worth leaving alone and not attempting to improve upon its perfection. Very few films qualify for that sort of honor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's See A Bit More Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you thought Hollywood had remade every single horror movie you've ever seen they shock you - by remaking a horror film you'd almost forgotten about . To be fair to the Studios they do occasionally remake a film that if not superior to the original at least can claim to be totally different to its source . Remember THE FLY and THE THING from the 1980s ? So a film remade over 30 years after the original movie should in theory be different from the original . Unfortunately with this remake of the fondly remembered POLTERGIEST originality isn't in abundance Eureka , I've got it ! Do you know the difference between a good remake and a bad remake ? With a good remake you've got something that shares the basic premise of something else but goes in a totally different direction . I'm thinking of the 1978 version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS which considering the subject matter gave me many sleepless nights . With a bad remake you've got something that constantly apes the original with very little embellishment and this would include ... well basically every single horror remake of the last few years With POLTERGIEST 2015 you can see the producers wanting to go their own way very slightly but thinking this might be a bad idea for some reason . This version isn't so much a shot for shot remake , but more of restructuring of the original . Most of what you remember from the Tobe Hooper/ Steven Spielberg 1982 movie takes place here , just not in the same running order as you remember . To be fair we do get a show stopping turn from Jared Harris as a Catholic priest with an impressive Irish accent but apart from that there's little beyond the rudimentary . It should also be remembered that the 1982 film was made before CGI was invented , in other words the special effects back then might not hold up all that well when viewed today but at least you could appreciate all the hard work the special effects crew put in to the production . Here however most of the effects will have been done with CGI , and slightly obvious CGI . I guess Hollywood has lost a lot of imagination over the decades ?</fullReview>

My entire office drove 30 minutes to the theatre and everyone felt it was worth the trip! The team sticks close to the original storyline... keeping true to the fans of the original and the actors do a great job bringing the characters to life.

		<shortDescription>Uninspired and unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to watch this film and avoid comparisons that put this remake in a very bad position compared to the original 1982 film. I watched the original when I was a little girl and some scenes terrified me. Watching this remake today makes sad in many, many ways. For starters, the original film is charming, scary and relied on great visual effects that made you believe in the paranormal. This one fails to be compelling or appealing in a way that it didn't even make me care for any of the characters.If you watch the original 1982 film, Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are truly phenomenal as the parents of the missing girl. See the anguish, the pain, and the hopelessness when they confront the supernatural. Heather O'Rourke was magnificent, innocent and vulnerable. But dear lord, Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt act more like they lost the keys to their car than their own daughter. I consider Rockwell a very talented actor, but this must have been the film that he made in order to pay for the pool in the backyard. Completely uninspired from beginning to end. And the kids were just not all that... just simply look at how O'Rourke delivers the line "they're here". It's way more haunting than the little girl's in the remake.As for the scares, they rely more in visual effects that in acting, climax, writing, or mise-en-sc?ne. It's good that the visual effects community can produce original effects which is why I'm giving it 2 stars (all going to the VFX team).Poltergeist 1982 has something else that this remake lacks: it truly depicts the lifestyle of a middle class family in the 80s, something that Spielberg nailed from the get-go. This remake just misses on that and many more areas, to the point that half way into it, I fell asleep. If you really want to watch good entertaining scares, watch the original. There's a reason why it is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This Movie Exclusively Made For Children?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry to say, but it looked like I was watching horror movie exclusively made for children. I wasn't scared at all. And I didn't get the idea why the ghosts here love playing around with electricity. They were farmers, right? Actually the part when Eric got choked is really scary. And also about the drill thing. Those were the only scenes I love. I want to see the first version of this movie. Maybe it is scary. Who knows? I've seen few American horror movies, and now I can see the pattern. A family move into a new house, they don't know the history of the house. Even though they know, they don't care because they get a good price for a big house. Then the ghost or anything like paranormal activity happens to them. And so with this Poltergeist movie as well as Insidious and The Conjuring.I wonder, who comes first with the Idea. But, whoever get the first idea, nothing can beat Insidious series and The Conjuring. The same theme with Poltergeist, but still the best story and they got me scared to death. I hope the first version of Poltergeist will do the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disgrace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking an already legendary horror film will always subject you, the filmmakers, to the inevitable comparisons to its original counterpart. As it should be. When it comes to horror films, the key is create an atmosphere that mimics, or at least mirrors, the original. Maybe even best it! How do you recreate an iconic, horror film written &amp; directed by an equally legendary writer, Steven Spielberg, and a legendary director, Tobe Hooper? Poltergeist 2015 did not even come close to recreating the terror, the horror, the emotion, or the personal connection most of us made to the original film. This is an embarrassment. The acting alone from Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Heather O'Rourke, Beatrice Straight, Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robbins and the rest of the cast was so on point, so perfect, for what was happening, that the first film made an emotional connection with us all. That was the most important part of the film. So, first, the whole concept of the original film was lost from scene one. To start, we had plenty of time to "fall in love" with and identify with, the sweet and lovely character of "Carol Anne". A very young girl, adorable, innocent and more importantly, completely lovable. We are connected to her from scene one and remain so all the way through. The set up and delivery was such that, we would do anything to get her back. In this remake, there is no connection whatsoever to this character. I couldn't care less if she never came back. There is NO emotional connection whatsoever. The filmmakers made sure of that. The buildup of paranormal events, in the original, was so intense and scary. However, in this version the "buildup" was so lacking, so boring. If anyone was afraid of this house from that opening, well, you don't know what true horror is. Sad. Secondly, the paranoid, frightful son. Yea we get it, he is overly emotional and very tense. We don't know why. We don't care why. However, when the tree comes to swallow him up in the original, we feel bad and hope he makes it out OK. In this remake the "tree" is a main character. Why the hell would you make the tree a "character"? The whole point was to make that be a surprise, a scare, for the viewer. By making the tree a villain the moment the film starts, it took away all of the surprise, all of the terror, that we were supposed to feel during that film. They did the same thing with the clown. Really? The clown was an afterthought, a child's toy, that freaked this kid out ONE night. In this remake, it was CLEAR the clown was going to wreak havoc. No surprise, No horror. No terror. The tree and the clown were sold out too early on in the film. Moving on, the "ghost hunters", in the original film were very likable. You rooted for them, you wanted them to be OK. They went through hell, some stayed, others did not. Casting Jared Harris as the "lead" ghost hunter, complete with his own "Ghost Reality Show", was great. But he never fully lives up the potential he has as an emotional, scary character like he did with the ruthless villain he played on JJ Abrams' TV series 'Fringe". Lastly, what a shame that the special effects used in the 1982 version were FAR scarier then the CGI crap this film employed. I mean, did they even try? This was a disconnected, disgrace of a remake. Everything about this film seems rushed. The original was slow paced, built us up, made us fall in love with the characters. Then when the crap hits the fan, we are totally invested in the family, the ghost hunters &amp; more importantly "Carol Anne". This did not happen in this remake. The "Evil Dead" series is like the holy grail of horror films for me. The fact that Sam Raimi was involved in this pile of crap is just embarrassing. There is a reason "Rotten Tomatoes" has an 82% approval rating on the original and only 30% on the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Am I Afraid Of? Not This Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No no no, this is not the Tobe Hooper classic from the 80's. This is the horror remake cash grab of the last decade genre. I'm not going to compare this film to the original. I feel like that would be a bit unfair. Instead, I'll simply judge it on its own merits. But first...why did I bother to watch this film?Poltergeist is a shallow remake with; no scares, tension, surprises or people that seem to give a damn. Rockwell in my opinion looks like he is literally sleepwalking through the role. The amount of "this is for a paycheque" written on his face is undeniable. Rosemarie Dewitt, who plays his wife, does seem like she cares though. She agreed to do this film because her husband was in The Conjuring and she witnessed first hand the type of fear it struck in the audience. She wanted to be apart of that experience....unfortunately she decided to star in Poltergeist. The film simply feels unnecessary. It brings absolutely nothing new to the table. Why am I paying to see this film? If I'm not paying, why am I dedicating two hours of my life to watching this? There is no answer because Kenan doesn't deliver anything of note here. We have a by the numbers PG-13 Horror flick shot in 3D. Yes, expect to see some "coming at the screen" moments, which make me cringe in embarrassment and a little bit of disappointment, considering Kenan also had a hand in the animated haunted house flick, Monster House.I can't stress this enough, Poltergeist is a failed attempt at remaking a horror classic. Why do they take good films and remake them? I do not know. Take bad ones and make them good. There's an idea!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unemployed couple with 3 kids moves into a new house for some reason. It's got a creepy tree in the front yard. The little girl starts talking to someone in the closet and on/in the TV. The little boy has his magazines magically turned into a tower and suddenly fly in his face. The parents aren't interested. One night they go to dinner with some friends. The teen daughter babysits. At night the boy is dragged out by the tree, the little girl vanishes in the closet, and the teen is nearly grabbed by some black slime seeping out of the ground.Finally the parents decide to seek help from some paranormal outfit. At this point they've learned that the house and the entire neighborhood were build on cemetery grounds, but no worries, all the graves were moved elsewhere. Wild stuff happens to the team as as well so they seek help from the foremost paranormal expert, some accented guy who has a TV show. On the ceiling of the living room a portal appears to the other world. They throw a rope through the closet and it ends up through the ceiling so they figure they can get to the girl. They fly a drone and see the girl among embodied tortured souls. So the boy decides to drag his sister out. He succeeds but by now the entire house is being torn to pieces by the deceased and the family and researchers will have to find a way to escape.With Poltergeist Sam Raimi again manages to find some foreign nobody to direct an important remake. But again, it shows that it doesn't matter all that much who's hired, anyone can direct a movie that works. It does show though that Americans who graduate filmschool are screwed, Hollywood isn't going to give them a chance. And Poltergeist works well enough for the first half or so, where it's somewhat creepy. But the irrational human behavior and the lack of any character to connect to gets to you eventually and you just stop caring. The incompetent casting directors managed to assemble a truly awful cast of C-listers, as unattractive as unremarkable, and doomed this movie. With that budget surely they could have found someone to inject some much needed personality into this movie.The souls don't pose that much a danger to the living and there are no serious scares here nor a sense of dread. For a movie that has little going for it, it takes itself way to seriously. There's no charm, humor, or gore as there was in the original. Poltergeist barely gets the job done but nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollow and Offensive to the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, before we get started here I want to make a couple of things clear. First off, I really do enjoy the original Poltergeist from 1982. I think that Spielberg is a pro, and made did a good job bringing horror to the masses with his ghost story, and Tobe Hooper did a fine job directing it. It's certainly not aged very well, but has some extremely delightful 80s stop motion effects and even has some frightening moments to it. That, and Zelda Rubinstein's (RIP) unforgettable (and weird as hell) performance, make it an early classic to be sure. That said, it's not the unflappable classic that people seem to make it, nor is it 100% perfect in every way.The other thing I want to be clear about is that I don't hate remakes at all. Do I wish there was more original content coming out for us horror fans? Of course I do. Do I think "classic" horror films are untouchable and see no benefit to a fresh pair of eyes and modern sensibilities? Hell. No. Some of my favourite horror movies took movies that I had already really enjoyed and applied a fresh twist to them, like Evil Dead, or even Fright Night (to a lesser degree). So, I don't get upset when horror movies (or any movies) get remade or rebooted. Even if the resulting film is terrible, there is still the original. No one is taking away your original copy of the Ninja Turtles or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just because there is a new one.So, with my position on the original and remakes in general made clear, let's talk about Poltergeist.A family whose suburban home is haunted by evil forces must come together to rescue their youngest daughter after the apparitions take her captive.So, this time around we've lost Spielberg, Hooper, Rubinstein, and Nelson, and replaced them with screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire (Robots, Oz The Great and Powerful), director Gil Kenan (Monster House, City of Embers), Jared Harris (The Quiet Ones, Mad Men) and Sam Rockwell (Moon, Seven Psychopaths), and these changes are kind of where it all starts to fall apart. We have a movie written and directed by people more familiar with working on children's films, albeit particularly creepy ones (like Monster House). Not to say that someone can't do both, but in this case it doesn't work.They've also replaced the mystic, psychic played by Rubinstein with Jared Harris doing a sort-of-British, sort-of-Irish sort-of-Scottish accent and he plays the host of a ghost-hunting reality show, which has the catch phrase "This House Is Clean" (Fucking. Groan.). Sam Rockwell is pretty bland in this movie, but he's doing about as much as he can be bothered to anyways. No one really seems like they wanted to be there, which is really the most disappointing part. You would hope that a movie held in such high regard, would have people working on the remake with the same level of regard for it. This is not the case.The flashy new CGI effects do create a few interesting visuals but overall it has a similar hollowness that I felt from that prequel to The Thing from a few years ago. Nothing really feels fresh or exciting about it, and even the visuals in the movie have the feeling of a "eh, whatever" attitude.Then there's the ending, now I can't prove this, and it might be wrong, but the family is shown looking at a new house with a realtor and the house immediately struck me as a bit "Amittyville"-esque, and that got my back up, the family decides the house has bad vibes and leaves, and no one ever explicitly says that it's that house, but somehow it felt like a cheeky little wink from the film makers that only irritated me more.Overall, the movie doesn't work as a movie on it's own, or as a remake of the original. Skip it, that's all, really. One final thing, the clown doll's laugh in the movie is so f**king sinister before it's even possessed that I wondered who in the actual f**k made that thing for children and not people who collect evil clowns.www.barleydoeshorror.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie blurb is written by some 20th Century Fox representative. I would guess that the person in question has not even watched the original movie. "Legendary film makers"? What a load of bull! These people have not produced anything really worth watching and this movie certainly do not improve on that score. I mean, how dumb are these people from 20th Century Fox? I certainly hope the audience are not dumb enough to fall for this obvious lie. Judging from the, well deserved mediocre score on IMDb I guess they did not.Anyway, as for the movie. It is a bleak (cheap) shadow of the original. It has absolutely zero of the charm that the original movie had and, most importantly, none of the characters had anything of the charisma that the original characters had. The father is a total dumbass and an irresponsible at that. The mother could by just any Hollywood style housewife.When you finally think that something interesting would happen, that is when the ghost hunter enters the scene, it just falls flat again. He is just totally lacking in appeal. He is neither a bad ass nor is he mysterious or anything else that makes him worth watching.There are just so much things wrong with the story as well. How can this guy afford and get a one for a house when he apparently do not seem to have a job? He even manages to go for another house in the end after his original one apparently got shredded. How bloody dumb is the script writer? In the original it was a new neighbourhood which explained the "troubles". In this one it is not which means that the script writer obviously had zero understanding of the original plot which brings us back to the same question again. What the f...? There are some half decent CGI scenes in this movie but the same can be said for a lot of things coming out of the movie industry nowadays (well with the exception of SyFy productions of course).I would say that as a TV-movie it would have been above average. As a remake of a classic it totally falls flat. I am happy that I watched it at home and did not spend time going to a theatre watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought it was going to be good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it started out I was like, "Oh I loved this movie when I was a kid." Well they ruined what could of been a great remake. Let me start with the terrible acting. Through the whole movie you would think they had 30 seconds to read the script and then made the rest up. The movie moves way to quick, and if you look away for a second, like in the opening scene with the movie title, you may miss something. Not that it would really matter. The movie just feels like anxiety, sounds crazy right? I had to check my glass and make sure I wasn't drinking liquor because it was moving faster than my brain could allow me to process what was actually going on. OK enough on that. Lets remake the remake and make it 30 minutes longer, change the actors because the mom totally sucks, the dad is constantly trying to be a comedian, and the 3 kids, well I guess 2 because the oldest isn't considered a kid even though she is like 14, but yeah. Get real actors, give them the script for more than 3 minutes and lets try this again. I actually had to quit watching the movie 3/4 of the way through and make an account on IMDb just to vent my frustrations out on you, the poor sap that is going to tragically sit through this piece of junk movie. And about 3/4 of the way through you are going to say, wow WTF is going on here. Why is this movie trying to jump to the end and hit the eject button. Unless the tree already hit it for you. Spoiler*** Big giant tree is alive!! So here is my closing statement. The movie blows. Could of been great with the right actors, cut the comedy: HELLO it's a thriller movie!!! And make it a full 2 hours and build up to the suspense. Nobody cares about an out of work John Deer Salesman or his, "Can't write a book wife." And don't start a haunted house before they sign the deed to the house. cmon people. And put some thought into making a really great movie remake great again. FYI If you are planting flowers in a newly built houses border, you are not going to find people bones 3 inches under the dirt. WTF. really. And wasn't the original movie house built on an old Indian burial ground? But in the movie at a dinner part some guy says, "at least your house wasn't built on an old Indian burial ground." WOW. Sorry I am so TO'd but I was really hoping for more. What a let down this was to poor old me. I guess I will go jump inside of my TV. Later Gator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Movie but feels rushed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original as a young boy with my father back in the early 90's. It was for me at the time, the scariest movie I had seen in my short life. I captured my attention and held if to the very end. It left an impression. So how does the remake stack up? Well it stays true to the original story. It has a few good scares and will provide good entertainment. But it left no impression. It doesn't let you look twice at the tree outside your window or makes you avoid static on your TV at all costs.It all feels a bit rushed. The family seems to accept the fact that there are bad entities in the house very quickly. The building of suspense is lacking and that is what made the original great. There was a lot left out. The dog sensing the energies, the family actually enjoying the strange events in the beginning(kitchen chairs being stacked, Diane being exited about sliding across the floor in the kitchen). The simple normal scenes(Steve and his neighbor fighting about the control of their TV sets, building of the swimming pool, Steve selling houses) are also lacking. The paranormal research teams part was especially rushed. The original had some terrific scenes before the specialist was called that added a real mysterious and terrifying atmosphere to the movie. The original was 120min(original cut) and the remake is only 101min for the extended cut.The cgi was good but it did not make up for lack of suspense and at times felt like a over compromise for an average screenplay. Taking into account what the original makers had to work with, the special effects in the original was amazing. They had to plan the scenes, build rotating stages, use the building of suspense to sell the effects not the other way around. Carol Anne calling out to her mommy from the other side was especially memorable and not fully appreciated by the remake. The cast for the remake was good, but to be fair, the little girl can't really compare to Heather O'Rouke, she was something very special and had a big part in the original films success. Carrigan Burke(the "specialist") was OK but did not really measure up to Tangina. The one highlight was Sam Rockwell he did a great job and I fear without him this remake would not have reached a 5 rating from me.In summary, if they took more time to tell the story and focused on building the suspense the remake could have been great. But now, at best, it is now a popcorn horror, worth seeing. I doubt it will ever have the following the original had and in my opinion doesn't measure up to the original. You can see Steven Spielberg did not write the screenplay for the remake, which is a real same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist (fantasy: supernatural, 3rd string, remake, 1:33, PG-13, 3-D)They changed the family name from Freeling to Bowen, and they threw in cell phones, wide-screen TV, and a commercial drone, but otherwise this is the same movie that, written by Steven Spielberg and directed by Tobe Hooper, scored a surprise hit in 1982.A young family beset with financial difficulties downsizes into a newish home in a newish suburban development, unaware that it was built atop an abandoned cemetery. Despite the fact that neither the realtor nor the previous tenants nor any of the nabors has ever had a whiff of difficulty, these poor saps start experiencing weird phenomena within 10 minutes of moving in, and it only gets worse over the next couple of days.When their cute little girl gets sucked into an adjacent dimension peopled by restless spirits seeking some kind of release, they're only able to talk to her thru their TV set. It was this fusion of bland suburbia and pristine, modern technology on the one hand with ancient dread, darkness, dirt, and death on the other that gave the original its unbalancing impact and led to 2 successful sequels.But what was novel then is pretty ho-hum 3 decades later, so even tho the film is well acted, it's hard to take it seriously. People go thru the motions, but there really isn't any suspense. And, despite the presence of actors you may have heard of before (Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie Dewitt, and Jared Harris), it's basically a low-budget, one-setting, paint-by-numbers effort with prosaic special effects.Now let me tell you a true sad story. You may remember the sweet little blond girl from the original 3 Poltergeist films, Heather Michele O'Rourke, the one who uttered the memorable line "They're baa-aack". I wondered what ever became of her and looked up her bio on IMDb.com. The stark prose at the end of it packed more of an emotional punch than this remake did, and I suggest you check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We must accept that it is the fate of all classics and faves to eventually get stabbed in the ass with a remake-dagger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, another movie classic has been remade to less than rave revues (Surprise!). One reviewer here called this remake "filth" which had me chuckling since as a movie-reference, the term is usually applied to unsavory violence, and/or sex, and/or language. None of which were in this movie. But I totally understand. Messing with someone's movie classic (or song) is almost like messing with their religion. They will go off-the-wall on your ass. I've had some of my own personal favorites re-tooled or re-told, whatever, and I was just as miffed as the reviewer I mentioned. And would myself not be aversed to using terms or language that did not logically apply. Here's one: "Shaft", remade with Samuel L. Jackson. (I forget the idiot who did it). You would not have wanted to be anywhere near me when that happened. Samuel L. Jackson is a fine actor, and a busy one, since he appears in every other movie. But Shaft?!!! No f!!cking way!!! Do I need to tell you what this movie is about? On the off chance you haven't seen the original Poltergeist then use the basic or generic model of most ghost horror movies "Family moves into a new home and sh!t happens". The interesting thing here is that this movie would have been received a little better without any association as a remake or "update" to the original Poltergeist. Thus, given a different title and some of the more obvious content similarities removed (like the little girl and the TV, for example) it could have -standing on it's own- done a little better (maybe 5.8, or so). So it's being punished somewhat by fans of the original thru association and comparison. They wanted it to be as good or better. Can't argue with that.In it's day Poltergeist introduced us to movie imagination and magic that we had not seen before; giving us a powerfully visual and frightening experience of certain aspects or areas of paranormal experience in the same way the original Exorcist did. Fans feel that this remake should have done the same thing instead of contenting itself with coasting along on the coat tails (name recognition) of it's parent. The producers should have accepted the challenge of doing as well if not better and blow us away a second time. Ah well, no point in crying over spilled milk or wasted opportunity.So how'd this happen? Well, I'm not sure how reliable my sources are, but one day, while golfing, fishing, or playing tennis, someone felt nostalgic. I dunno, maybe they were telling each other ghost stories on the course, on the lake, across the net, whatever, and someone said "Remember Poltergeist?" and the other responded, "Yeah, it scared the pants off me!" Then looking at each other thoughtfully, one said "Why not do an update?" And the other responded, "You mean a "remake"?" And the person with the brainstorm says, "An "update" showing off modern technology. You know, laptops, flat-screen-TVs, smart phones, black BFFs, drones...you know?" This got the other thinking, "You know, it could work. But aren't drones controversial?" And the brainstormer says, "You're right. Sh!t! I really wanted one of those things to fly over the house at the end of the movie and nuke it. The audience would go wild!" They later decided they would work out a compromise. Love, Boloxxxi.</fullReview>

The father gets laid off, the mother is a writer but they go house hunting &amp; buy a HUGE house.I don't know about you but that doesn't seem too smart to me.There's a few other things I could go on about but I guess I'm reading way too much into it &amp; it's only a movie.Anyways...... I enjoyed this movie way more than the original (Maybe I should watch the original again?) I hope there will be a part 2 because if they do bring back the reverend I'd like to see what he'll look like.I can't imagine he'll be as scary as the original.I've seen that this movie has gotten a ton of bad reviews but I don't understand why.Maybe everybody was expecting a version similar to the original? I liked that this movie was in some ways similar to the original but also stood on it's own.I'm looking forward to a sequel (If there is 1) &amp; seeing what will happen next</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifyingly Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strange thing happened to some of the stars and others behind the scenes of the original trilogy of Poltergeist films.Like Tutankhamun's alleged curse, quite a few of them ended up dying young in bizarre circumstances.Ooo, spooky.The individuals featured in this present day remake of the first movie, along with those working behind the camera, can breathe a sigh of relief though.Because the truth is, it's too dull to offend anyone, least of all vengeful spirits.After buying a house built on an ancient burial ground (an untrustworthy estate agent? REALLY?) a white-bread American family notices some strange goings on soon after relocating, involving hair standing on end and objects being mysteriously moved.It all culminates in a night of terror, when the parents are away... And at the end of it, their daughter is stuck in the television set. Yes, really.Who you gonna call? Not the Ghostbusters (and DEFINITELY not the new, all-female version) but a bunch of paranormal obsessed nerds, and a hammy Irish Derek Acorah-like spirit hunter.And, Unbelievably... This one ISN'T a phony. Gosh.So, what we get is lots and lots of talk about the supernatural, while the cast run around in the dark shouting out each other's names, as the ghouls wreck havoc.You'll see evil clown toys, tree monsters and oozing black slime. Not to mention a parallel universe, which seems entirely made up of lost souls.But is it scary? Nah, not really.It's all adequately done, and you may find a few shivers running down your spine, but don't bother having paramedics on stand-by to restart your heart.You won't even need a good, stiff drink afterwards.No, you'll just sigh, eject the DVD, and add it to your 'Forgettable Horror Movie' heap in the corner.Mine's getting pretty big.

They're good, but not great. The 80's practical effects of the original worked far better.I also wouldn't recommend seeing this movie because you're a Sam Rockwell fan. The guy is amazing, but the script here doesn't let him shine. He's miscast as a vaguely ineffectual and somewhat unlikable Dad.I just can't recommend paying the ticket price for this movie at all, if you've got the original lying around on DVD -- the first film offered far more charm and spooky fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remake a movie 10 into a 5 point something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't mind it and I didn't struggle to get through it, but I was hoping for so much more.The original in my opinion was a 10 and few films made are as good as this timeless 80's classic.The original is not Fellini, but you talk about entertainment. I have watched it a dozen times. Now that being said, the remake is a bland copy and more of a kids movie than a real thriller. I did like Sam Rockwell. I like him in almost anything. He is an actor. But the script should have broken new ground, giving us something unseen, but no, it played it safe and was not even as exciting or as risqué as the first. If you want bland and your not a person that uses anything more than salt and pepper and like your salsa from a jar, you may find this satisfying. But if you are a person that has a spice rack and likes their salsa fresh cut with a little kick, you will be so disappointed. Watch the original for a real treat and send a message to Hollywood: Remake films that could have been better, not ones that got it right the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To clarify, before I start ! I HAVE NOT seen the original.... The characters in this film (mostly the father and son), I felt, have very strong characters which I found handy when trying to really get into this film. This was successful upon the first 30 minutes of the film while things were shocking and kinda realistic. Then we get to the REST of the film. Things take a turn and the realism level drops, kind of meaning the build up character was unnecessary and it kinda made me lose interest, but not enough to be bored. Obviously this is a remake, so I guess the original follows a similar outline of events, but this change in the story really didn't appeal to me and although I enjoyed the film, I think it was a lot better while it was realistic. ONCE AGAIN, the trailer shows probably the biggest bit in the film, so try and stay away from that ! Left a massive event to be ruined, as I was waiting for it. And now I think of it, there is actually a couple of unexplained things in the film such as a scene based at a sink which doesn't actually relate at all to the story or anything, they are just simply put in there to try and make it more eery. I think nowadays I enjoy more a horror film that makes me jump, and sadly this didn't....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Remake a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that the original Poltergeist is a classic- it is one of the best horror movies of all time.This remake does the original no justice.The only upgrade is that there are better "effects", but the effects themselves take away from the magic that the original film possessed.The acting is poor, the plot is a watered down version of the original, and the remake lacks a lot of what made the original so memorable. The original had a slow progression of suspense into complete dread, and it caused the viewer to be attached to the story. The family in the original was perfectly set up and worth of being adored. The remake possessed none of this- it is not even scary. The scariest part of the movie involved a squirrel- there is nothing whatsoever memorable about this movie and it does nothing but take away from how incredible the 80's version is. Save your money and just watch the first version- trust me, this film is a joke, especially in comparison to the Poltergeist we all love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competent But Needless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time where Paranormal Activity or Insidious are the biggest hits of horror, Hollywood may think it's wise to relive the classic film, Poltergeist, and take it to the modern age. And the result is solid, but ridiculously unnecessary. If the film thinks it has something to improve, then its claimed improvement is rather an overkill. The added computer effects don't make for a compelling scare and the showcase of modern technology is just the typical distraction to remind us that this takes place in the present. It's not horrible by any means, the direction is stunning and the acting makes it quite entertaining. We just don't need an update of something that is already great.The film opens to the typical family-moves-in-a-new-home cliché, though the storyline does add some new character arc, specifically the son who is now given much of the attention in the plot which has this situation helping him conquer his phobia that his mother was worried about at the beginning. The little girl's characterization has been minimized and now defined nothing more than a plot device. Most of the film is just presenting us a number of horror set pieces, at the same time pays homage to the original; mostly nothing more and nothing less. The pacing is at least given the momentum that keeps the plot move consistently.While these horror scenes are decently put together, only few of them can be considered as actually scary. CGI, whether it's good or bad, isn't always an impacting use for horror, especially today where moviegoers would prefer anything that looks creaky. Director Gil Kennan could embrace the whimsy horror of the original since that is one of his trademarks, but there is one point in the film where it totally looks like a video game, which is a huge contrary to what they're supposed to be aiming for. The director's style works better in transition effects and staging. If a scene rarely involves CGI, it looks quite impressive. The acting is pretty good, with Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt doing what they do best. Jane Adams and Jared Harris get a fun turn as the paranormal experts of the film.Poltergeist, just like most remakes of classic films, is pretty needless. While the direction is more fascinatingly surreal than scary, it still captures the visual spirit of the original. The acting is mostly compelling once you get into the characters. The real problem is, there is hardly any reason for this movie to exist. And people could also argue that this doesn't have the same entertainment quality or the value of viewing as the original. In spite of having a solid craft and great actors involved, this version just doesn't have the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie? Maybe... Decent remake? Hell no...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this one with a question? Why the hell do you try to remake a 3 time Oscar nominated classic horror movie? These type of questions keep puzzling me every time I hear about another remake. I admit that some are worth seeing, but very few come close to the original. The 1982 version is something else. It's not just another horror movie. It's directed by Tobe Hooper ( The Texas chainsaw massacre, Salem's lot, ? ) and Steven Spielberg ( E.T., Schindler's list, Saving private Ryan, ? ) is one of the writers. So this raises the bar a little, don't you think? But the fact is also that, beyond the will of actors and crew or whatever, this movie had a weird atmosphere. Some people claim it's cursed because of the deaths of certain actors of the franchise following a few years after the release of the movie. For example, Heather O' Rourke, who played little girl Carol Ann Freeling died at the tender age of 12 because of intestinal problems. Dominique Dunne on the other hand, got beaten to death by her boyfriend at the age of 22. This is a bit freaky isn't it? Everything about this movie is by the way. Not that the remake sucks or anything. On it's own, it's kind of a decent movie. It gives a little more than all those wannabe horror movies that always seem to copy other movies in the genre. It has it's moments, but suddenly the movie is over. It's like they're short of 15 minutes of material or something. And thank God for the lovely appearance of Rosemarie DeWitt ( Cinderella man, The watch, ? ) and Saxon Sharbino ( Julia X, Touch, ? ). Kennedi Clements, who plays the little girl is cool too by the way, but a decent remake? Once again? No. Not by far. The original one just breathes weird s***. I have no clue why that is. If you see Zelda Rubenstein ( Tangina ) perform, you just feel that she means business. She carries a big part of the movie. But hell no, no Tangina in the new one. And in my opinion, that sucks balls. Jared Harris is cool in Fringe ( 2008 - 2012, one of the coolest series of all time ) and Sherlock Holmes ( 2011 ), but a true replacement for Tangina? f*** no? He's like "look at me, I'm a cool and famous ghost-hunter". Even Tom Cruise was considered to play the father. They must be joking, right? No, no, no, ? I can go on for a while, but what the f***?This is what it's all about. A family with three kids move to a new neighborhood. After a while, it seems that the house is haunted. Not by a ghost or whatever, but by a poltergeist. What's the difference? Well, it seems that a ghost is just present in the house, while a poltergeist is there to scare you to death and f*** things up. So it doesn't take long for things to go strange and scary. The entities inside the house feel that the little girl is special and trick her in to coming to the other side, so she can guide them into the light. Accompanied by a team, Tangina, who's known to have paranormal encounters, ( Carrigan Burke in the remake ) comes over to help them. The only thing is, that this is heavier then anything they've ever encountered before.If you want to see a cool horror movie that has more to offer than some of the crap that hits the movies these days, you'll have to go and see the original Poltergeist movie. I guarantee you it's way scarier than version 2k15. This is a true classic. Just seeing Carol Anne sitting on the floor, talking to her dead grandma on a toy playskool phone is epic. Again, nothing really seems to scare us any more these days. But imagine a movie like that hitting the theaters in 1982. You can be sure that a ****load of people had some sleepless nights after this one. There are so many cool and freaky scenes that don't seem to make it to the remake. I don't have a f***ing clue why. It surely would have made it more interesting. So skip that remake and watch the original. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with, I should say that I haven't seen the first 1982 movie, so I am strictly writing about this one. The plot is based on a huge number of clichés (which are a "standard" in the horror movies industry) and they don't even try to reinterpret them as they did in some other movies. The storyline is kind of predictable and very "straight", you can pretty much guess what the actors would do next and it feels like there is no suspense at all. Despite the fact that the effects are well done, the movie doesn't really place you in the true world of horror or terror, but it's rather your generic horror movie; also, even though it is a work of fiction, I felt that the director was trying to much to blend the paranormal with the everyday lives of ordinary people (maybe except the little girl's "ability" to talk to the dead). In conclusion, Poltergeist (2015) is just "yet another horror movie", which will try to impress you, but it has to try harder for that to happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minimized elegance, maximizes modern revisions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sheer elegance and the amalgamation of two very different styles of the horror genre were precisely what made the original "Poltergeist" so effective and memorable. It wasn't a choppy, vague exploration of the supernatural, offering a simple story and digestible explanations to the reoccurring paranormal activity without becoming too bogged down by exposition. In addition, we saw the blending of Tobe Hooper's campy, low-budget style with Steven Spielberg's Hollywood professionalism to great effect, as the project soon went from a questionably frightening horror film to a film that many could take seriously and believe.Fast-forward three decades later where films about the supernatural and reoccurring paranormal activity are a dime a dozen, with new films and attempts at franchises bombarding theaters every year, and it's no doubt that the original "Poltergeist" has diminished in impact and effectiveness in the public's eye, as well as the genre's overall reputation. With that being said, the "Poltergeist" remake isn't so much contemptible as it is unnecessary, despite doing a handful of things well in its attempt to not mimic the effect of the original film, but mimic the cash-flow it took in upon its release.The story is more-or-less the same as it was in 1982: a couple (Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt) move into a new suburban home with their three children (Saxon Sharbino, Kyle Catlett, and Kennedi Clements) only to find increasingly odd supernatural occurrences plaguing their house. The poltergeists, different from traditional ghosts in the way that they interact with humans in a more violent, persistent manner, wind up taking the couple's youngest child, who can communicate with the spirits due to her innocence, and withholding her from the family. Desperate, confused, and low on options, the couple wind up hiring a crew of reality TV paranormal investigators to try and extricate the house from the demons to get their daughter back.To accentuate the positives here, the film is remarkably light-hearted, throwing in a surprisingly large amount of cheeky humor, almost acting quietly meta in its surprise that this project is actually happening. Never does the film take itself too seriously but never does it become a laugh riot, distracting from more frightening sequences. On top of that, the film definitely wants to try and remain loyal to the events of the first film, going the extra mile to carefully try and update, replicate, and even expand upon the situations from the original film. It's a bold tactic that doesn't diverge into a complete bastardization of source material, as seen in the loathsome "Texas Chainsaw 3D."However, the film is robbed of a single likable character. The couple here are far more mean-spirited and smarmy than in the original, treading dangerously close to the line of downright poor, condescending parents to their children. This is especially upsetting, given the ground Rockwell ("The Green Mile," "Seven Psychopaths,") and DeWitt ("Margaret," "Your Sister's Sister") have covered before. Even the reality TV show characters are nothing but vague, uninteresting caricatures cloaked in contrived, ridiculous stereotypes.Then there's the fact that this film winds up being much more frantic and manic than the original film. Where the first film took a liberal two hours to cover its paranormal activity with a slowburn pace, the new "Poltergeist" races through plotpoints like it has a checklist and a stopwatch tethered to its script. There's little time for development, and the very first sign of the supernatural occurs within the first five minutes of the film.Yes, "Poltergeist" is not as deplorable as you might be expecting, but no, it's still not worth your time in the grand scheme of things. There's an interesting dichotomy occurring right now at your local theater; you could either go see a remake of a classic 1980's film and funnel money into Hollywood's uncreative idea fund, where remakes, ripoffs, and sequels are just waiting to be made, or you could support original, high-budget science-fiction/fantasy with the release of Disney's "Tomorrowland." Call my act at the local theater this weekend a wash, for I saw both, but you, dear reader, have a lofty decision to make at this moment in time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist... A classic of the horror genre and a film which any person in their right mind would stay clear of! But the original poltergeist film was released over 20 years ago so does that mean it is time for a remake?Poltergeist 2015, the new remake had a lot of high expectations! Most fans were expecting some what of an identical remake to the original!To start, me and my friends are all 15. We headed off today to go and watch it. After eating at Nandos we went in, the trailers passed, the tension rose! The film started to quite a fast start, throwing in a jump scare almost immediately! They did well to build tension and atmosphere and as the film progressed during the first 30 minutes I found myself jumping all over the place, edgy on my chair and my hand covering my face! It had a lot of elements of modern horror such as insidious and sinister! The second half of the film was however not as intense and more mellow than the first! There was very few jump scares and the CGI was poor to say the least! In fact the film ended very abruptly and I was a bit weary when contemplating my conclusion thoughts! Overall I think the film deserves a 6.5/10 and is potentially worth the watch if you are in need of some fast paced entertainment! However do NOT go in with high expectations as you will be shocked! I think the overall summery would say that the film was decent enough, there was a lot of flaws and corner cuts but due to a low budget compared to the required budget, they persevered with the budget set and made use of it! There was a lot of "buts" and "why's" but honestly that is what you expect from a film remake with a scale plan of such size compared to the budget and unnecessary CGI moments which left you wondering what was the point in that!Thank you!

		<shortDescription>CGI Heavy Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Poltergeist", starring Sam Rockwell-Seven Psychopaths, Iron Man 2; Rosemarie DeWitt-The Odd Life of Timothy Green, Mad Men_tv; Jared Harris- Pompeii, Mad Men_tv and Kennedi Clements-this is her film debut, although she has appeared in some straight to videos including Jingle All the Way 2 and Coming Home For Christmas.This is a remake of the 1982 Steven Spielberg &amp; Tobe Hooper classic by the same name-Poltergeist. This one is directed by Gil Kenan, who directed City of Ember &amp; Monster House and is produced by Sam Raimi. This version, as can be expected, is amped up with the CGI effects and contrary to the original, the little girl is not swallowed by the TV-she is taken through the closet. There is a TV and there is hands touching on the TV screen-and she does say the famous line, 'They're Here'- but she takes the disappearing trip through the closet, instead of the TV. Sam and Rosemarie play the parents of Kennedi, the young girl with the bad luck of being kidnapped by the evil poltergeists. It seems that Sam &amp; Rosemarie also have some bad luck; they just purchased a house that was built over a cemetery with some angry poltergeists wanting to extract some retribution. Jared plays a specialist called in to help remove the evil poltergeists and rescue little Kennedi. By the way, a poltergeist is just an angry spirit. There is not much new here, if you saw the original. If you have not seen it, then I guess it would be more interesting to you. It's rated "PG-13" for some intense frightening sequences and some language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 33 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It would be alright, as a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A huge steaming pile of garbage that can't hold a candle to the original film. Not scary, poorly acted, horrible script, and completely lame from minute one. I forced myself to sit through it to give it a chance to get better, but it never did. Characters were wooden, and I felt absolutely no empathy for them whatsoever. When you're clamouring for one/any of the characters to have at least the gravitas of Zelda Rubenstein, you know the movie is in trouble. The effects in the original were more realistic and much scarier than this crappy CGIfest. While it tried to pay homage to the original in many scenes, it felt extremely ham-fisted and failed on every attempt. Watch if you absolutely must, but my eyes haven't stopped rolling yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Tension, All FX and Jump Scares. Bitterly Disappointing,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the original Poltergeist and was very wary of this remake, but I decided to give it a chance after reading some of the reviews on here. The casting is great, Sam Rockwell is always on form, and the kids were cool and not annoying, which is always a big win. For the first half hour, this was a solid 'remake' in the truest sense of the work, staying faithful to the tone of the original whilst making it relevant for a modern audience. But it all completely fell apart with the spooky stuff, which was handled with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. There was very little build up at all, and then suddenly everything happens at once, completely spoiling the tone and bordering on the ridiculous. Take the classic tree scene for example. This worked so well in the first movie due to pacing and slow burning tension, that builds over time and unfolds later in the movie and allowing us to suspend our disbelief when it hits us. In this iteration, there is no such skill, instead we're almost immediately hit over the head with everything at once, too early in the movie and a scene that is more 'Whomping Willow' from Harry Potter than Poltergeist.Talk about shooting your load too soon, the makers of this film clearly don't understand what made the original so compelling. This would have been in much better hands had it been made by the team who brought us The Conjuring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the plus side, the decision to re-frame the upwardly mobile family of the 1982 classic into a recession-era, housing-bust gang down on their luck is a good idea, but the story never really delivers on that premise or explores its implications. The story doesn't do much of anything except offer a Cliff Notes version of the original, with a few "Paranormal Activity" and "Insidious" elements thrown in for good measure. The pacing is so off that not even the considerable charms and talents of Sam Rockwell can breathe life into the Dad -- the rest of the cast doesn't stand a chance. The deliberate call-backs to the original feel like pale imitations; the changes to the original, while not objectionable or ill-considered in and of themselves, don't add up to anything and don't give this film its own personality. This may well turn out to be the most inessential remake of the decade (though the "Point Break" remake could give it a run for its money).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist gets an awful lot right, but without one key ingredient it ends up being a flat and tame horror. The acting is superb, Sam Rockwell and Rosemary DeWitt genuinely convince with realistic and grounded performances that drive the film, even the young actors do a good job. The film is also beautifully shot, even in darker scenes their are shot compositions that interest. I didn't see this film in 3D but you can it would've definitely worked, as the 3D moments are built into the story and aren't thrown in, this has been thought out really well. The real issue with this horror is that there is absolutely zero atmosphere. A horror without an atmosphere is like being served at a restaurant and finding out your meal isn't up to scratch, in other words disappointing. Poltergeist had potential but it's left with only jump scares that aren't effective because of that lack of atmosphere. This is a crying shame, I was enjoying the first act of the film as it drew me in up until the darkness crept it. Damn I'm disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a way, this film exceeded my expectations...I expected it to be bad, and it was. While it's not as awful as I thought it would be, it's still quite bad.Not only does it fail as a remake, but also as a stand alone horror movie. It features cheap scares, bad acting, forgettable characters, and plot points borrowed from other horror movies from this decade ("Insidious" (2011), "The Conjuring" (2013) etc.).Also, it's so different from the original that it's not even a remake. It's just an average PG-13 supernatural fear fest with the same title. Not to mention that the girl isn't even Carol Anne from the original, but "Maddy", which was quite a stupid move on their part. The only parts that were like the original are the static TV, the clown, and another thing at the end, in which saying it would spoil it.Almost nothing happens, and a lot of the scares are pointless. The clown did absolutely nothing, and was just an obvious attempt at giving the film a similar feel to the original. There is a tree in one scene, which did something, but was of no significance to the story. It doesn't really get good until about the last 30 minutes or so.On a positive note, it features nice looking visuals, and a few cool scenes. But those things alone can't promise a good movie. It's better than the "Nightmare on Elm Street" 2010 remake, but that's not saying much.Overall, this was a pretty mediocre horror film/remake. I can't recommend this movie.If you're considering watching this, that's your business. But be advised that if you go into it expecting it to be as good or memorable as the original, you're going to be disappointed. In other words, you are probably better off seeking out the 1982 classic instead.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely an average remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder why they started to remake films that also came from the modern era-like Total Recall, Robocop and this one-Poltergeist. The originals are still around so wouldn't that mean its a case of 'intellectual property infringement' or something like that ? I would have thought so. Anyway-this remake is predictably predictable in all kinds of predictable ways. It is even less effective as a horror movie than the original film: as this one omits certain scenes in favor of a more 'politically correct version of events' i.e. the couple in this version of Poltergeist don't smoke a J in their bedroom together-even in a time when such stuff has become actually legal is states like Colorado. They had Robocop remembering his wife dancing to Frank Sinatra which is unlike the original Peter Weller Robocop character. It looks like someone has seized upon the opportunity to try and rewrite the history of modern cinema-maybe they should be called 'cinematic revisionists' or some such thing. I don't think their efforts are particularly welcome.The remakes contribute not to modern cinema but rather these films exist as a fine collection of fifth wheels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's so much wrong with this remake, I don't know where to begin. Nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, holds a candle to the original. The character development is terrible, the story development and pacing are terrible, and the way key and classic scenes are handled is just awful. The actors seem uninspired and just sort of stumble from one failed scene into the next... Sam Rockwell is pretty good, actually, and the priest dude isn't bad. God, there's so much lacking compared to the original that I could just ramble out a whole bullet point list, but I'll try to name a few so that it just doesn't look like I'm bitching for no reason. The way the "TV People" interact with Carole Ann (now Maddy for some reason) and their family to gain their trust? Mostly gone. The crazy insane manifestations in the house? Also mostly gone. The way the original made you feel bad for the spirits? Again, mostly gone. And Burke is a *terrible* replacement for Tangina for a variety of reasons. Really, the only good scene is when they fly the drone into the Other Side. That's it. They don't even introduce the creepy-as- hell theme song. If you want to watch a Poltergeist movie, stick to the original 1982 version and not this garbage. Poltergeist II is a pretty good scare as well. Hell, I might even pick Poltergeist III over this remake ha ha...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, oh why did they try?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the point of doing remakes? OK, basically there can be two reasons. One, you think you can actually do it better. That's rare, but i grant that there are remakes out there that are as good or even better than the original. Two, you are trying to make more money. The usual reason. In case of Poltergeist, it is one of the classics of horror movies. Some say it wasn't that scary, or that it became outdated today. But still it is a movie most people have seen at least ones, maybe no big masterpiece in the wake of The Godfather or, if you don't want to leave the realm of horror, The Exorcist. If you absolutely have to and have nothing better to do as a director or producer, it would have been OK with doing a version for modern audiences. This one just fails to deliver. In it's own right, it is an OK ghost movie. Nothing that special, OK acting but nothing to write home about. Just one more haunted house. But being a remake, you can't stop yourself comparing it to the movie from 1982. And the old one was just much better. It had a magic to it, that is completely missing in the new one. The 1982-scenes with the little girl sliding on the kitchen floor and the more harmless hauntings in the beginning weren't scary or anything. But it gave the whole movie a warmness that changes to just more generic scares in the new one. And those scares don't even work especially well.The best part may have been the casting, it worked well. Kennedi Clements as Madison could have been the most fitting they could get. Only problem is the character Jared Harris. Zelda Rubinstein played her character in Poltergeist (1982) in such a unique manner that you couldn't really hope to do it the same way with anyone else. So the movie doesn't try at all and makes it a TV-show ghost hunter. A good decision in itself, but this just takes away some more from the story-telling, otherworldly charm of the original.All in all, it's a movie you can watch if you find nothing else. One more generic haunted house, seen it all before dozens of times. It is watchable at least. But as soon as you think back to the old movie it can't compete with it in any meaningful way.</fullReview>

I am a horror-thriller fan. So when I went to see this movie, I expected it to be more than just a series of mini-scary moments sewn together. The direction is good, unfortunately, it could not make up for a not-so-good storyline. For all those who are scared of horror movies, this can be one of those you can start with if you'd like some mild-horror movies. But or all those who are constantly looking for the thrill and who expect a horror movie to scare creeps out of you and give you goosebumps, probably not the movie to go for. Some movies make it for you in terms of a few really scary scenes, and some movies have just fabulous finish to complement the complete story, but unfortunately this movie missed both of them. So in summary, go for it if you have time to kill, definitely does not deserve priority to go to cinema to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the infamous masterpiece Poltergeist (1982) is a tedious snooze fest for the majority of the runtime. From the producers of the grudge (2004) my expectations were high, boy was I in for a disappointment. It consists of terrible CGI and was pointlessly shot in 3D as a gimmick. If you've seen the trailer you've witnessed the highlights, and the highlights are the alterations of the originals highlights, but executed rather poorly. The lighting was epileptic and the cinematography was amateur, along with its fruitless screenplay. I wasn't invested in the majority of the characters as the film provided very limited emotional development. Sam Rockwell's performance was nothing more than satisfactory, as it felt he was desperate for a pay check. I don't think the unrealistic and lazy dialogue helped either. His oldest daughter was forgettable along with his wife even though decently acted by Rosemarie DeWitt her screen time was restricted.The film did not deliver any suspense due to its weak atmosphere. And if there was tension building up, it was quickly deflated with piercing music jolts supporting a cheap jump scare. The shallow narrative was rushed but still remained tiresome thanks to Gil Kenan's attempts. However there was one or two effective scenes I recall being genuinely scared, this was carried through the somewhat intense final act, the technically advanced adaptation of "the other side" was quite interesting. Along with Jared Harris' casting, although prolific in character, that's what he does best after all. Some creative updates were thrown in but for the most Poltergeist (2015) lacks intelligent scares, interesting characters and imagination. I strongly advise you to watch the original if you have not yet. Overall an insult to the original but mediocre in terms of remakes. 5.0/10 45% - Mouldy Milk</fullReview>

The "special effects" weren't all that special, just standard, and I should say, with todays computer graphics, they were pretty crap. I will not go into a lengthy discussion on the differences between the original and this attempt at a "Reboot" as they like to say in Hollywood. I will just say that I was sadly disappointed that they took a great movie that I loved in my younger days, and completely ruined it. But that's the way it goes in Hollywood these days. No original ideas, no original themes. They just re-use what has come before and hope they can make a quick buck from it.</fullReview>

Of course it wasn't the best cinematic experience I've ever had, but I thought it was a good remake. (Was it just me?) It kept the iconic scenes from the original and kept the awesome plot.

		<shortDescription>Decent remake to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I am a huge fan of the 1982 original and its sequels (though most are a fan of the original and can leave the sequels alone),and originally I would've preferred a third sequel to a remake or reboot,but I agree that the Carol Anne story-line died with Heather O'Rourke.In fact,if this had been a third sequel,instead of a remake,putting a new family like the Bowens in this would've been what I would've done.Now,getting to my take on the remake (hey it rhymes): Like most remakes the plot for this remains virtually intact from the 1982 original in that youngest child (Madison to 1982's Carol Anne),gets kidnapped by evil spirits and family has to go to "the Other Side",to bring her back but spirits aren't happy nor willing to let their victim go that easily.Now,while some lines of dialogue are clearly lifted from the original,not all are and some are rearranged to fit the reimagined scenes (you'll see what I mean those who have yet to see this).I do like how the writers and producers did this to add some freshness to this and make this somewhat different than the original. Some characters are used more in this than the original (Griffin to 1982's Robbie and Kendra to 1982's Dana),while others not so much (Amy to 1982's Diane and Eric to 1982's Steven),and some not at all (where's E-buzz and Tweety)? Now,for my criticisms I agree that many of the scenes seemed rushed and others that were good (no make that great), in the original seemed to be rushed,forced or cut-back from the 1982 original,none more so that the tree scene (the tree just willingly lets Griffin down onto the ground after leaving him dangling in it's branches for awhile compared to the tree trying to eat Robbie in the original and the clown-doll merely attacking Griffin versus strangling Robbie and dragging him under the bed in the 1982 original).I do however like the ending in that at least the family here is more logical than the freaky Freelings of the 1982 original,escaping (or trying to),immediately after getting Madison (and Griffin,versus just Carol Anne in the 1982 original),back from "the Other Side".Also about "the Other Side",I like that they let us see the remake's version of "the Other Side",but like some of the other scenes in this,the scene seems rushed or forced.I personally would've like to have seen more of it (there seems to be more that we could've seen,according to some stills of deleted scenes I've seen circulating around the Internet). Overall,I did enjoy this movie as far as remakes go and as a stand-alone horror movie or even as a Poltergeist IV (assuming there's not one coming out.How well the remake does at the box-office will depend on whether we get sequels to this or a possible third sequel to the original trilogy),but I agree with most people nothing beats the 1982 original but do admit,Madison is a good substitute for Carol Anne.She is just as cute and the young actress playing her really makes you care to see her family get her back safe-and-sound like Heather O'Rourke did for the original's Carol Anne.I would've actually rated this 6.5 out of 10 stars but IMDb doesn't have half-stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its OK but not really that good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over all the movie fell flat I went into with an open mind knowing that it would not be the same as the original, but it just did not hold up well. I am not sure why so many people are speaking so highly of this movie. To me it felt rushed and lacked any build up or chance for you to develop an emotional connection to any of the family. Also the way they treat the son bordered on emotional abuse. The actual paranormal events go straight to full blown event with very little build up but I find this systematic of most of this generations movies. Its as if people now lack the ability to sit through a movie unless its action from the start. Most people want the instant full blown action. I love a good slow burn movie that drawls you in and then hits you with some crazy action. Give me story and build up, make me feel something for the people. I want to have an emotional connection. I want to feel worried for them/ have hope that some how they might find a way to fix problems they are facing. This movie did not give me any of that. I felt no connection to any of them. I do not need blood, gore and sex to enjoy a good horror movie as one reviewer suggested as to the reason many people did not like this one. This is one of the reasons I love J horror movies, they rely on story and suspense rather than just jump scares or blood and gore. Like I said I went into this movie with an open mind and did not try to compare it to the original but by the end I could not help but do that. The original was an amazing movie from the cast to the story. It slowly built up the suspense and led you into a crazy freaky ride that left you scared and concerned for that family. This reboot just did not have that same build up and left you feeling as if some of the movie was missing. Over all I guess if you never saw the original and your a big fan of paranormal activity movies then you might enjoy this one. but if your a fan of the original this very likely with leave you feeling let down. This movie could have been great had they spent some time on building up the story and giving more of an emotional connection to the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 2015 remake of one of the finest moments in horror cinema - the original 1982 "Poltergeist" movie - is a prime example of why Hollywood should stop with the whole remaking movies thing that is going on.Compared to the original movie, this 2015 version is a pathetic, shallow and fully unnecessary movie. The attempt to amp the story up to a 2015 date was just not working. And at no point throughout the movie did the audience ever get the sensation of the Bowen family ever really being in a dire situation, and the poltergeist events were just far from being impressive or scary. There was no sense of dread or despair.And it didn't help that the actors and actresses were giving half-hearted performances, it didn't add anything useful to the story. The only one who put on a noteworthy performance was child actor Kyle Catlett (playing Griffin Bowen).Effects-wise "Poltergeist" was good. And the most impressive thing about the entire movie was how the visual department portrayed the spirit world. Now that impressed me a great deal, but it was nowhere near enough to make up for the train-wreck that is the 2015 "Poltergeist" movie.It was my undying love for the original movie that made me want to see the 2015 remake, and I knew it was going to either be an impressive display of ghostly effects or a real stinker. Sadly, it turned out to be the latter. But hey, can't claim that it was a surprise.If you, like me, love the 1982 "Poltergeist" movie, do yourself a huge favor and stay well clear of the 2015 version, because it is a blemish on the original movie. Director Gil Kenan's attempt at reinventing an already established horror masterpiece was like a slap in the face with a dead fish and followed by a bucket of ice water. It is something nobody really wants and could do without.</fullReview>

I was really excited to see this because of the original and because Sam Rockwell is in it. Can't say Sam's performance was bad, it just feels a bit empty. The teenage daughter's character was over the top, that little boy was boring, the best one was the girl if I may add. And she wasn't even in the movie that much. I got a feeling this project was forced and the movie was made in 2 weeks. I kept checking how long the movie is and how much more I hate to endure. Probably biggest let down since Carrie. The ending scene made me laugh though, but other than that a waste of time.</fullReview>

It was so unnecessary to do a remake of an in all points brilliant film in the first place (and yes, there are even some good remakes out there - did I just said that?). Remember how frightened we all were watching the 1982 Spielberg/Tobe Hooper Poltergeist back then? Well, stick to that one by all means as this new version is just not frightening at all. Plus it's poorly acted, looks cheap, has a lot of pretty stupid lines and they even had to tweak a great story and do it all wrong (oh, they had to change the names as well).

		<shortDescription>Another pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey guys don't look now but someone remade a classic and -- are you sitting down for this part -- it isn't as good as the original. You're no doubt shocked reading this. I know I was shocked to discover it myself. Poltergeist 2015 is pretty much your typical remake of a horror classic from decades past. TCM, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm St., etc. -- they all hit familiar beats and give everything a modern look with music video cinematography and glossy effects. But they fail to match the atmosphere or scares of the originals, let alone surpassing them in any way. There's nothing in this remake that is better than the original Poltergeist. Not one minor insignificant thing is an improvement. Which begs the question, of course, why even remake it to begin with? The answer to that is the same as always: dolla dolla bills, y'all.The characters are a mixed bag, with the husband and wife both unlikable jerks who shouldn't have kids. The teenage daughter is good for a laugh or two but, for the most part, is annoying teenage cliché character #14. The two little kids are the most likable members of the family. They, along with Jared Harris' ghost hunter, are the only enjoyable characters in this. The familiarity of the material hurts the film. Not just because it's a remake of a classic but for reminding one of many more recent Poltergeist-inspired movies, such as the Insidious series. So even if you find some young people who haven't seen the first Poltergeist, they are likely to still think this is derivative of the recent stuff they are familiar with. It's a watchable, albeit pedestrian, effort that has few good characters, no successful scares, and nothing added that improves upon the original in any way. In the end it's just another slick-looking but shallow remake of a far better film with lots of CGI cartoonery to compensate for the lack of ambiance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really lazy remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I indicated in my summary line, this 2015 remake of the 1982 horror movie "Poltergeist" is very unimaginative. Instead of taking the basic idea of the original movie and going its own (new) way with its own (new) ideas, this remake for the most part is content to simply follow what happened in the original movie. If you have seen the original movie, this remake has absolutely no surprises and becomes pointless to watch. To those who haven't seen the original (and you should - it's good), this remake still won't succeed in entertaining. It's very slow-moving, taking forever for it to start putting in the creep factor. And when it does, there is a "soft" feeling to the horror - it has a "been there done that" kind of tone. There's no grit - everything looks too polished. I think another reason why the movie fails to scare is due to the characters. The actors try, but their roles have been so blandly written and lack real personality that I didn't care what happened to the family. In conclusion, this remake doesn't bring in anything new, and with the original (and much superior) movie freely available, there's no reason to watch this remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do we need to seriously remake every good scary movie? The original Poltergeist was truly scary and haunting. This movie basically took parts from the original movie and toned it down to basically a contemporary style. Its like if you take Texas Chainsaw Massacre and do a remake with Nicholas Sparks as the writer. Do you catch the drift? I am a huge horror movie fan, and when me and my family watched it, by the end everyone was either sleeping or watching TV elsewhere. That's how bad it was. it was boring and just horrible. You really don't care what happens to the family to be honest.The movie was actually pretty interesting at the start, but whenever things got "scary" it took a turn for the WORST. No memorable moments or silver linings. Just a really repulsive movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist If the spirits of the dead reside inside of televisions then they'd better start paying half the cable bill.However, the flat-screen phantoms in this horror movie are more interested in watching you.Shortly after the Bowens (Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt) and their children move into their new home they each begin experiencing paranormal activity.When the ghosts coax their youngest child (Kennedi Clements) into an adjacent dimension, the Bowens seek the assistance of a paranormal research team and a television ghost-hunter (Jared Harris) to get her back.An abridged remake of the influential original, this non-frightening facsimile fits all the classic scenes into its limited run-time, but never develops the characters enough to have anyone care about their terror.In fact, aping its predecessor is a detriment to this mockery, reducing it to nothing but a boilerplate haunted house movie.Moreover, ghosts don't even believe those ghost-hunting shows are real.

		<fullReview>Having loved the original since I was very young (it was the first scary movie I ever saw, and boy did it scare me), I was really excited for this remake (with the added bonus of a solid cast, particularly Sam Rockwell and Rosemary DeWitt). Ultimately though, this is a sore disappointment. The script varies from formulaic to flat-out stupid, never developing the characters much beyond their actions or giving us a reason to care about them. The scare scenes are surprisingly boring and unimaginative, and with characters we don't particularly like there are no stakes at hand so ultimately the movie is dramatically inert. I don't like comparing remakes to originals because I try to take a remake on its own merits but this film often relies on the audience's familiarity with the original in order to achieve its purposes, and the updated touches it brings to the table are clever in concept but the movie makes nothing of them. Rockwell and DeWitt make a convincing couple but they're powerless over the trite screenplay.</fullReview>

You would think the little boy would be a bit more terrified after being hosted in the air by the tree, and the parents don't seem to give zero damns their little girl has "just" gone missing, not to mention, there seems to be little to no urgency to find her, guess what happens when you remake a movie, and already know the plot.And the acting, I mean the acting, if we could call it that, was a plain dud. The actors and actresses had NO personality what so ever, and that wig or Paul McCarthy Beetles mullet cut, wth was that? Like seriously. Only one slightly entertaining was the dad, and his humor missed the bull's eye more times than it hit. Being a big fan of the first, this one was a MAJOR disappointment, but so much potential, kudos to the writer, but NEVER hire this stale ass director again, and the producer, next time get a better cast smh</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unnecessary to compare this with the original and I tried, but impossible to avoid it since it's an official remake. Everything, from the house to frame by frame, all the scenes looked the same, except the cast and it's set in the present world with the daily life's modern gadgets. If you had not seen the 80s film, then there's a little chance you might like it. Though it was not a serious horror movie, or a scary movie to consider, still quite enjoyable like a dark comedy in parts. But I recommend the old one.Really? Sam Rockwell? He did not fit in the role, just okay though. And the kids, did not impress me as like the original movie. The only upgrade in this new version was the technology, CRT monitors to LED kind of stuffs. I expected a major, at least a bit alteration in the story or the screenplay that sets in a different circumstances and the location. That could have been a lot better. Disappoints for those who loved the first version. However, that movie deserved to be remade, and I did not think it would end like this. Hoping for a better sequel, but I'm already feeling that would end in the hands of the second string cast and crew which could be a cheap horror-thrill.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes are a farce. We're given a second, sometimes a third helping of the same film. Lucky us! Look at Spider-Man as an example. Three times in 15 years is disrespectful to the franchise. At least 33 years have passed since the original Poltergeist. MGM studios have ushered this film to a new generation of viewers, who perhaps aren't familiar with the 1982 classic. Unfortunately, 2015's new look isn't one to be excited, or even frightened about. Haunted houses are dull and an overused prop within the horror world. The Bowen family could leave the house at once if it weren't for their daughter's disappearance. Evil apparitions take her to a parallel universe. Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt seek the help of an expert (Jared Harris) to get her back. This composition has been rinsed and repeated many times before. The production levels are high, the dark lit interior, the creepy toys and the sound effects are astonishing, but struggle to conceive the one, desired reaction all horrors are built for. Sam Rockwell's a light in the darkness, providing a down-to-earth personality in a movie full of mundaneness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless remake fails to stand on its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have scored this movie on its own merits, however if the studios get to reboot our beloved classics, then we get to compare the new and the old versions. In this case, it is a good illustration of why this movie fails.The story behind both versions of "Poltergeist" is pretty weak even with suspended disbelief, but Hooper made a great movie out of it, and a few things came together really well: the cast, the score, the setting and atmosphere (this is one of those times where I did not mind Spielberg's influence). And the pacing worked just right.Pacing is the biggest fault of Raimi's new version of "Poltergeist". The old version starts just like a good disaster movie, slowly drawing us into the lives of a suburban family moving into a new neighborhood. The new version thrusts the characters upon us, and bad things start to happen before we even get to know or care about them.The movie seems to have been written in a hurry with little sense for a coherent story or meaningful events. Remember the scene in the old movie where the mother bends to get something from a kitchen cabinet, then stands up to find the chairs arranged in an impossible tower on the kitchen table? That was not scary except for the little squeak she utters, but other than that, it is just chilling. Bone-chilling, because in that simple scene the mother has no choice but to accept the fact that something very extraordinary is happening to her family. This scene makes an appearance in the remake, when the boy turns around and sees his comic books arranged in an impossible house of cards. But neither boy or audience is given the chance to shudder at the realization that something is seriously wrong, as one second later the house of cards is violently blown over, for a *jump scare*. Because the movie really needed one at that point, I guess.The trees, the thunderstorm, the clown doll, Hooper did not grab these off the shelf as staple horror scare devices for his version; they started out pretty ordinary but got creepier over time... they worked because they were recognizable to many of us, as Hooper made our childhood nightmares come alive. And then they went away, leaving the afflicted doubting whether they really saw what just happened. In the new "Poltergeist", there's no such subtlety, no room for doubt whether it was "just a tornado" when the tree chases the kid around the house.Even the cause of the hauntings, something that comes as a shocking, chilling realization in the old "Poltergeist", gets thrown in somewhere as an offhand remark. The whole thing feels hurried, cheap, and devoid of loving attention.On its own, it is still a somewhat decent horror movie, on par with many other recent movies in the genre. But that's not saying much. All in all a disappointing viewing.</fullReview>

Why make a remake if there is no attempt to scare the audience with a new twist or at least some new scenes that will add the scare factor. The possessed clown scene in the original made every young kid look under his bed before going to sleep, but the reboot doesn't even come close to using the same "what is behind my shoulder" scare tactic like the original to freak the audience out. Come on, you couldn't make the down scene better! Shame - Shame!The selection of actors were fine but no new ground broken here. I can honestly say I would rather watch the original to get me scared as the new version doesn't even come close. It's hard to believe with all the new cgi these days such a movie couldn't be redone without some new shine to it, don't waste your money and just watch the original on Netflix, you are better off.

They strayed so far from the original plot and it really didn't translate well. The only part about this movie that was remotely scary was when the clowns were moving about on their own in Griffin's room. Besides that is was a lot of special effects and no connection with the characters. They didn't bother to take the time to develop the characters enough to make me like them and even want them to succeed in the fight against evil. The only thing this movie had on the original were the special effects of the souls or bodies of the dead were much better than the original. I don't regret watching it but I most definitely would not watch it ever again. I'll stick to the classic version of this horror story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bowen family moves into a new house but soon realizes that their new dream house is haunted. This remake of the Hooper/Spielberg 1982 classic looses almost everything. Oh and this review contains SPOILERS! Well soon their little daughter is kidnapped to the other side by restless spirits. The Bowdens must take help from a ghost reality show to get her back.Now, first off all the family's reaction on their daughters abduction is mild to say the least. They aren't hardly showing sadness or concern. They pretty much joke and act normal! Second, remember Tangina and the eerie ghosts from the original? These are replaced with A funny jokester and samey looking CGI generated zombies/Ghosts which looks basically like Jack Skellington! The pool of corpses? Gone! The face ripping? Gone! And why exactly are these ghosts so evil? Sure, they talk about the cemetery on which the house was build early on but why isn't anyone else experiencing these activitys! And without "The Beast" from the original this seems even more silly! Nope, no Beast, just a bunch of angry Jack Skellingtons who seems stuck in some pile of purgatory-zombie- mass! So don't expect any "they don't know that they have passed on.." Are there other people in the neighbour hood? We never know.. We only see The Bowdens. Jerry Goldsmiths both eerie and beautiful score is replaced with something i don't even remember. Now, i Could rate this as a stand alone horror flick.. And then i would give it a 5. BUT it bears the poltergeist title and must be treated as a remake. And as such this movie actually is worthless! It does not improve anything, just cuts outs the good stuff! I pray Gil Keenan never touches horror again. And Raimi should prob stick to splatter comedys! The acting is okayish but a bit wooden. I do like Carrigan Burke (Harris) and Maddy.. But otherwise.. Nah! Keep with the original this is just plain bad!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am only going to give one spoiler and that happens right at the very beginning which for me then completely destroys the rest of the film. And to be honest, it is not really a spoiler because a picture of it is used to advertise the film.The Clown... who the hell buys a clown that looks like that for children. It was impossible for me to even attempt to enjoy this film after seeing the clown at the very start. All I could think about was the clown.There was another film recently about a possessed doll that the father had bought his soon to be born child... that too spoilt any enjoyment of the film because nobody in their right mind would buy their child a creepy looking doll... and the same can be said for the clown too.Had the clown been just an ordinary toy clown that then later developed some sinister facial expressions that were subtle changes and not major 'demon clown' changes... then it would've made a much creepier and scary film.As it is... the clown just destroys any pretence to a good horror film... an attempt to go for a cheap scare at the start that wrecks the whole film.Any director wanting to make a good horror film, needs to watch the Changeling and learn about subtle creepy and how sound plays a major role in horror. No film should contain more than one attempt at making you jump out of your seat and it should come two thirds of the way through the film when you least expect it. The art of producing good horror films appears to be have been lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst remake ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About all the scares were shown in the trailer, and there are some jump scares, but the cgi was awful. The pacing was lacking, and it wasn't scary at all.It really is a disgrace to the poltergeist name, the originals are SO much creepier and scarier.This is basically a rip off of paranormal activity. The little girl makes this whole movie worthwhile, her acting is awesome, but it cannot really help this movie at all.Expect to leave with a sour taste... the ending is so silly... This was basically a quick cash grab. Don't expect a sequel...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard this was coming out, like most people i was genuinely excited and couldn't wait for it. Sadly it didn't follow the other film, now whether it was supposed to be a new story or the original story tweaked. Don't know. There were many tbings from the original as the tree that comes alive, but it seemee to just have been copying the same crappy camcorder films out there. Admittedly some of the cgi quality was good but the film I was extremely disappointed in.Also they tried making the film jumoy like they do a lot of time with the low budget films. I personally wouldn't buy this film....wait for the TV showing I think if your going to remake a film you should do it properly,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I figured since many of the negative reviews were comparing the remake to the original, I might like this. Simply put, I didn't. The entire pathos of this movie felt disingenuous and scripted, much like the cookie cutter neighborhood featured in the film. The house itself screamed Lifetime TV, not "epic" horror remake. The Script: pedestrian; the Direction: lacking; the Cinematography: utterly banal. It seems this movie is more appropriate for a middle school date on Halloween weekend, not for a contemporary horror fan looking for a creepy thrill. This was not a movie worth paying for unless you want a collectors item or have some obsession with the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to like this version but couldn't. The storyline, the characters, and the acting is so bad. First off, why did they buy a house in an area/state where he had lost his job? If they would've bought the house &amp; he was laid off later I could understand. Otherwise, if you lost the job, why not move back to your old area? why buy a house that is below you &amp; in a bad area? The father is no Craig t.Nelson, he's a weenie &amp; not even likable. They chose the wrong actor to play the father. In the original movie, the father is a strong successful character &amp; is very likable. For a family where no one has a job, they lived pretty well. Stupid storyline.In the original movie they bought a brand new home in an upscale area.So the experiences to everyone in the neighborhood was new. in this version, it is a 20+ year old neighborhood &amp; it makes no sense that there wasn't a big problem before? No other family was terrorized? The acting of all the main characters is lame and not believable. The original was scarier &amp; much more believable. I'm glad I got it thru Netflix &amp; did not waste my my seeing it in a theatre.Some movies should never be remade.</fullReview>

I had told myself not to see it, I'd be disappointed. But I'm seriously disappointed in just HOW disappointed I am. If they were going to rework it and do a "scarier" version, where were the scare? Honestly, it didn't have the humor and charm of the original, it didn't have any real scares, and the family (which totally made the 1982 classic) just wasn't as likable. These parents seemed little more than upset that their daughter was missing...we saw none of the raw emotion that JoBeth Williams gave us. And without Tangina.....well, there is no substitute.

I was really wanting to enjoy this movie as the original was great however halfway through it was still struggling to spike my interest. Apart from Kennedi Clements the acting from the main protagonists including Sam Rockwell felt a little forced which made it hard to relate and feel for the characters. The movie lacked polish and seemed rushed. As far as being a Horror it lacked any punch and wouldn't even frighten a three year old. In this case the original is the stand out of the two, it had way more depth substance and was far more enjoyable then the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a kid, I would've rated this 10/10, but as an adult, I'm going to give it a 3/10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scenes were promising and I started to think this movie was going to be amazing, but when I found out that the main actors were five year old kids, the movie started to sound more and more like a Harry Potter movie. There's this particular scene in which the little boy is trying to tell his father that strange things have been happening and no one is listening to him. That scene was funny and reminded me of Harry Potter's first movie, so were many other scenes. The father in particular was hilarious, but wait, isn't this supposed to be a horror movie and not a comedy? Oh well. The crazy tree and the dead reminded me of the Whomping willow and the Dementors.The way they react to strange events is also hilarious.Normally, you'd expect to get this reaction from the parents in the face of bizarre and paranormal phenomena: Utter disbelief, but no, they take it in so well, and impulsively decide to go to the department of paranormal research instead of calling the police! And what happens in that department? The mother is like: "Oh, my daughter was stuck behind the TV screen. I know it sounds crazy." And the investigator is like "No, it's not. It's perfectly normal!!!" Since when do people or the police go for a supernatural explanation for someone who has gone missing "before" they consider the possibility that the parents are making up a story to cover up a possible murder or an actual case of kidnapping?! Who needs a ton of special effects and lots of lights flashing and going on and off and lots of laughs and hilarious performances to enjoy a movie? Easy, little kids. Who needs an atmospheric movie with special effects kept to a minimum, and serious performances to be scared? Adults. That being said, there is nothing wrong with this movie. It's just that it seems to have been directed primarily for children. In fact, this movie should have been categorized as "Family, Fantasy" rather than "Horror". In short, if Harry Potter movies scare you, this will scare you too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In our great era of remakes. I could not wish for a better remake than Poltergeist... i was wrong. They messed up everything that was good with the 1982 classic version that will never disappoint and still make you scared a little bit more than this 2015 version.I'm not a remake hater. In fact, i have a few films I like better than the originals... to quote: The Ring, The Hills Have Eyes, The Thing 82, War of the Worlds, Insomnia, Scarface... don't enter in the ''you hate remake'' before telling me i'm wrong and read this.Sam Rockwell is an awesome A list actor, his performances in Moon, Seven Psychopaths, Conviction are among the best i have ever seen from an actor. but not in this film ! feel like a B actor to me in this role, he deserved better... Tom Skerritt was the man to play the dad... that remake is horrible for one reason... no chemistry between actor... it could have work, but even the child's did not seem to care at all... oh a scary scene, go to the next one and try to be scarier... this is like a cheap Goosebumps episode. should not be seen at all of talk about in a near future. it is really a disappointing remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the worst films I've seen. Every single character in this movie is irritatingly dumb and/or annoying. We barely even get to know these dumb, annoying characters (not that we would want to) in the beginning of the film before things start getting out of whack in the house. I understand that Poltergeist (2015) is supposed to be a remake of the original from the 80's. I get that Hollywood feels the need to remake everything to vamp up the special effects and "update" it. But sometimes classics should not be touched. Sometimes they are best enjoyed in their original format.If you want a predictable, not-scary movie with some flashy CGI, stunts and characters that make you want to roll your eyes at their pure stupidity, this might be worth it for you. But otherwise, watch Insidious, The Exorcist or something that's actually scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I often enjoy watching remakes, especially when it's been over 30 years since the original. I try to appreciate them as new films in their own right. Unfortunately, whether looked at as a remake or as a new film entirely, this one fails tragically.There was simply no suspense at all, the lack of any build-up in tension leaving the "scary" scenes as anything but. The characters were also shallow and the acting lacked any conviction - the real horror that parents in this situation would feel simply wasn't conveyed at all. Much of the dialogue also felt forced. The special effects were so-so, with some wins and some fails but definitely not enough to prop up the rest.Overall rather a big disappointment. I don't think Gil Kenan is cut out for horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't help but wonder why they decided to make a remake of the original Poltergeist. If the idea was to make a better or more scary movie, they failed badly. If they wanted better special effects, they failed badly. If they wanted to show us better acting and more interesting characters, they failed badly. In total, this movie is a weak and washed out copy with absolutely nothing done better than it was in the original.A few things in the storyline were changed compared to the original, but it certainly didn't add anything to the overall story. Besides, some of the most memorable moments in the original, was barely touched in the copy and it left me very disappointed. Those moments could have been done so much better (or at the very least, lasted a few seconds longer)If I had seen this movie as an original, I would say that it was an OK movie, but not very scary or interesting. Seen as a remake, it simply fell flat. If you have never seen the original Poltergeist, go see that instead. It has all the character involvement, scariness and shock effects that the copy lacks.</fullReview>

You don't feel the warmth for the family that you're supposed to, it jut doesn't work as far as i'm concerned. The comedic moments are very out of place and not befitting with the tone of the film at all. It's not supposed to be a comedy!

		<shortDescription>A borefest with some familiar scenes thrown in there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the age of remakes and reboots comes the completely unnecessary and absolutely terrible remake of the much loved horror classic Poltergeist. If you go into this movie wanting to be terrified and on the edge of your seat as the tension builds for an hour and a half just like you loved in the original then knock those hopes right down because this film had none of that. I remember watching the original Poltergeist only around 5 years ago and it was the stuff of nightmares, the special effects may not hold up but the way it is shot and the music and directing just all worked together to create a very intense and freaky film. This movie just craps all over the original, there was literally no tension being built up at all to the final sequence, so you just sit there being bored out of your mind as nothing remotely scary happens, and anything that had the potential to scare me was in the trailer so i knew it was coming. For the first almost 30 minutes you have 25 minutes of shitty character backstories and only a few shots of mysterious sounds and moving objects. And just as the borefest starts to deplete and the horror we want begins, they completely stop to introduce a new group of characters and the movie slows right .......... down ........to.......... absolutely ............. nothing .............happening, until the last act. So when there were no scares it was boring, and when there were scares they weren't even that scary. The plot follows a similar path as the original but there are so many unexplained events and plot holes all over the place, mainly when the new characters are introduced and it really takes you out of it. The performances though, (only from the family) are all pretty good, the young girl especially was very convincing and freaky. The young boy annoyed me all throughout the film but i think that was more how they wrote the character than the actors performance. The homages to the original, some subtle and some necessarily obvious i quite liked, you could tell that nailing those scenes was a focus because they were handled very well compared to the rest of the movie. And the final act in the last 10 minutes i also liked because it was just as fast paced and chaotic as the original, and that made it pretty interesting to watch. So in the end this movie was just plain awful, no tension, barely any scares that were not already in the trailer, and almost a complete borefest. If it wasn't for the good acting, homages to the original and an entertaining finale this would be a complete F U to the original. - 4.1BUT, you may be able to appreciate this film more if you have not seen the original, or are not expecting something of that quality.</fullReview>

It all falls apart, no real character development or very little so much that you do not care what happens to any of the characters in the movie except for the little girl who is the only beacon of light during the movie. If I had left half way through this movie, I would have gone away pretty happy but by the end I mostly laughed at the poor dialogue, acting and general atmosphere.

		<fullReview>This is what I call a stock remake. Just another remake that doesn't hold a candle to the original. If you haven't seen the original, then this movie will be okay enough to watch, but not if you love the original.What's new to the story, isn't all that great. What they kept was done poorly. The oldest daughter in the original was a sarcastic/bratty teenager. In the remake, she is a total beech. The son in the original was a bit of a nervous Nelly. Now, they hit you over the head with it to the point they had to show he's not the type of boy to play catch. The youngest daughter, well, who could hold a candle to Heather O'Rourke. The original movie did a great job conveying this quaint family in a quaint neighbourhood, just like any other family, even when ominous stuff was happening near the beginning. When things started to get darker, there was a abrupt shift in the movie, from a nice, normal family, to a family being haunted. The remake sets the dark tone right away. It doesn't try to build suspense because they let you know scary stuff is about to happen. Every thing felt rushed. The movie was shorter and things happened too quickly. Overall, this is another one of those remakes that is okay. They took the heart and soul out of the original and replace it with all the new modern clichés. It couldn't be a modern horror movie if it didn't have something happening to the cell phone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I didn't have high expectations for this film as it only scored a 5.0 when I watched it today but I know horror films generally don't score very high on IMDb anyway so I thought I would give it a go.My main criticism of the film is that it has so few (hardly any at all) scary moments and there is a complete absence of any build up of dread or apprehension as the film develops. It is very rare to see a really good horror film but if you are a big fan of the genre like me then you will probably have seen many bad horror films but often even bad, low budget horror films will have some redeeming features and creep you out to a certain extent. Despite the large budget and the presence of Sam Rockwell (who I am a massive fan of) and although Kennedi Clements (the little girl) does carry the role well, this film fails on pretty much every level. The original film was good and manages to ramp up the tension well as the story develops, although I doubt it would be quite as watchable now, it compares well to other films of that era and there was plenty of memorable scary scenes. I had hoped the remake would come at the story from a different angle and be more original, unfortunately I was wrong. Apart from a few minor deviations this film follows the same storyline and even uses the same scare tactics as the original but in this film they just fall flat, at least when the original came out the special effects looked good and it was above par in that respect to other films of the time (1982), somehow even with CGI this film doesn't manage to achieve the scares that the original did.If you have seen the original and are tempted to watch this in the hope it compares with that you will be very disappointed, if you haven't seen the original watch that instead.</fullReview>

The characters don't listen to each other and conflict is created out of thin air. Worst part of the movie is definitely the child actors, the oldest of which comes off so annoying, I would rather listen to a lawn-mover being pressed on gravel, than one more scene with her. The middle child is just stupid, no more on that. The third, and youngest, Madison, is decent in her role, even though a living Cliché of a horror flick, she gets her part done without the audience hating her. Emphasis on "without hating her", meaning not good but not absolute garbage. This movie is nothing more than a horrendous failure of a remake on a classic horror movie that should have been left alone. The reason I give this movie four stars out of ten instead of two, is because the main clown doll present in a couple of scenes actually frightened me, which was it's purpose in the movie, MOST LIKELY.</fullReview>

The characters were written poorly and there is no character building that effectively contributes to the story. Special effects are over used and left nothing to the viewers imagination; sadly leaving no suspense for the audience. The plot felt rushed, alas there is not much to consider while watching.

His "I don't give a crap" blasé attitude and facial expression simply does not work for a horror movie. His usual blasé body language and stupid facial expression as if everything is a joke spoils the movie and is the polar opposite of the tense atmosphere needed of a horror movie - this leaves the audience confused if they should be laughing or scared.The special effects were not frightening and really not believable at all, almost laughable.

The ideal concept for remaking (or re-imagining) a film is to bring a classic story to a new generation. There are quite a few titles from the obscure to the mainstream that would fit nicely into that category. The original 1982 classic brought to life by writer/producer Steven Spielberg &amp; director Tobe Hooper is not one of the titles that comes to mind when I (or most people) consider films that need a reboot. This intuition became an all-to-accurate prediction of what the 2015 Sam Raimi-produced/Gil Kenan-directed product would be. NAY BELOW THE SURFACE STORYTELLING Being bombarded with loud noises, questionable-at-time-FX, generic lines, some bad acting, and wrap it up with talented cinematography, vivid imagery, &amp; maybe a good score, some might mistakenly-label a film "good". Comparing this version to the '82 campy classic proves the cliché that began this review because everything wrong with the remake was actually some of the better aspects of the original. Charming characters, an enchanting Goldsmith score that has you humming it even now, and the proper amount of humor, suspense, scares, and DEVELOPMENT was what the original had going for it in a BIG way. Was it particularly scary? Not so much, but it did have its moments. Regardless, it was enjoyable. Much like another Raimi-stained remake, "Evil Dead" (2013), "Poltergeist" lacked any heart, soul, or purpose, so therefore I didn't care about pretty much anyone. In the source, I knew &amp; cared about the Freelings, the paranormal crew, and even Tangina (Zelda Rubenstein). It was like they did not want to spend the scenes building the tension. Instead, it was quick, in your face, and utterly-disappointing. I try to be open-minded for a fresh approach for a tried concept, but like Gus Van Sant's tragic waste of celluloid, "Psycho" (1998), it all boils down to these 4 words: THIS WAS NOT NECESSARY. Hell, even the overly-gory Wes Craven reboot of "The Hills Have Eyes" (2005) gave time to engage the audience before bludgeoning them.MEET THE ONCE FREELINGS-TURNED-BOWEN FAMILY?&amp; THE REST Sam Rockwell, Eric the dad, did well enough for the material and always does well filling some tight jeans. I had not seen Rosemary DeWitt, the mother Amy, in a feature prior to this (although my favorite instructor during film school did direct an independent film with her as a cast member), but the lines that took me aback in delivery seemed poor in the editing process?not so much in DeWitt's acting ability because it felt as if she has potential. It was simply squandered in this popcorn mess. The very "Mean Girls"-era- Lohan-esque eldest daughter (the Dana character renamed Kendra &amp; played by Saxon Sharbino) was a spoiled brat that suddenly gave a crap. I actually did enjoy Griffin (Kyle Catlett) as Robbie's character? although a close friend commenting that (Catlett) reminded him of Bridget Fonda from "Single White Female" will forever taint my ability to view this young actor without a smirk. The qualities it seemed young Griffin's character was given took focus away from the star of the original series: Carol Ann (played by the late-too-soon Heather O'Rourke), but it was likely because "Maddy" (Kennedi Clements) came off as a tad autistic and I'm sad to say failed to fill her adorable predecessor's shoes?even a little bit. Yes, she has an adorable face. I wouldn't call O'Rourke at a mere 5 years of age a stellar actor, but she was just a kid pretending with a large number of people around her at all times?believably. Casting should have taken more time with the focal role. The expository ONE scene given to competent-but-unkempt Dr. Brooke Powell (Jane Adams) as Beatrice Straight's caring, resourceful character &amp; Jared Harris's tongue-in-cheek, reality-show-ham-turned-"the only one who can save us"-gave some of the only true resemblance of spirit in the entire runtime. Even that was not great. *INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK* Subtle-to-moderate plot holes left hanging in many spots prove either audiences are not capable of paying attention long enough to enjoy a 90-minute-to-2-hour-film &amp; have caused pacing elements in film to become ADD as well, or the ones making it think we would rather see the pretty pictures rather than know anything about them. Maybe Hollywood should simply consider the film industry may be going extinct due to the rapid-decline of cinema appreciation (&amp; audience I.Q.). We're not ALL morons. Sadly, with the distribution of so many TERRIBLE money-burners, we?AND I?should know better than to expect something good out of something that has ALREADY BEEN GOOD. Everything happened too quickly without enough support to sustain a respectable mental hook. Save your $10-20 &amp; buy the original for your collection. Trust me; you'll enjoy it a lot better. If you MUST know for yourself about this train wreck, just watch any of the trailers. Repeat for the "Evil Dead" remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could anyone possibly be scared by this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What exactly was this supposed to be? A feel-good horror? I can't remember ever being so bored and unfazed by a "horror" film in my life. Not a single death and it never even once felt like there was a chance of one happening. Are you kidding me? This felt like the safest family in America for the 90 (long) minutes the film ran for. Even the family themselves weren't worried when their daughter disappeared, joking around and refusing to call the police in case they were blamed. Are you kidding me? I've seen people in more life threatening danger in an episode of 'Barney'. Then the team that is hired to help them state that the craziest thing they've seen is a bottle taking seven hours to move across a room, and yet they have no trouble believing that this entity has taken this families daughter. Are you kidding me? As you can possibly tell I'm a little angry at how bad this was. The reason: remakes get a bad rap and films like this sure as hell don't help that. The original was slow and not overly frightening either, but at least it was original. Plus you could get away with that type of film in the 80's. What every other filmmaker who has rebooted a horror film in the modern age managed to work out though was that you have to evolve the story into what the people of today expect. The standard for modern day ghost films has been set incredibly high by the brilliant 'Paranormal Activity' series (particularly the original). The difference in intensity between that and this is nothing short of astonishing. I see that director Gil Kenan's only two previous films were both children's films. Obviously he didn't see any need to change a thing for this film. I've seen children terrified by the shark in 'Finding Nemo' but I can imagine every child in the world sitting through this quite comfortably without batting an eyelid. Hopefully his directing days are done (at least in the grownups film world).The only good thing I could say about this film was Sam Rockwell. Even though his character was pathetically out of place, his performance was still outstanding and a great reminder that that man needs more lead roles (just in better films of course). Other than that though this is nothing short of an absolute stinker. The dialogue is that bad at times that I found myself wondering if this was perhaps meant to be a parody of the original in some sense and was doing nothing more than making fun of itself. That's how bad it was. Sadly though I highly doubt that was the case. Please don't let the people that made this film touch anything with potential ever again. That's a personal plea from a lover of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought there was a lot missing to the story. It seemed to jump right into the middle of the original story. I liked the one from 1982 a lot better. I wouldn't waste money on seeing this at the theater. This is a red box rental night at best. In the original 1982 version the story was more fleshed out and you found yourself more interested in the family and what was going on to them. The story had a gradual build that led to a false climax and then the final conclusion. The problem with this one is that it all felted rushed and a lot of the story seemed to be lacking. The characters did not seem believable like in the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad...... not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK let's get this out of the way - it's a remake and the original film is a classic. That's not to say you shouldn't remake it. In fact I was looking forward to see how they would do it now technology has moved on in leaps and bounds. So here goes: The storyline is pretty faithful to the original. OK all of the characters are different and the strangely-voiced medium is now and Irish man (I think that was the accent - it varied a lot!). But, as another reviewer said, the original film sustained menace throughout whilst this one stops and starts a lot. That would be OK but the horror jolts aren't particularly scary. Yes the tree bit is done with CGI so it looks a lot better. The tearing-face scene is given a miss (shame - a favourite of mine - would have loved to have seen that CGI'd). The trip through the world behind the closet wasn't scary either. Lots of CGI that had no feeling of reality. And, at the end, the 'coming out of the ground' bodies bit was over in a flash and they didn't do anything! No coffins bursting out of the ground. No chasing people. Shame.They kept in the bit about the houses being built on a graveyard and then we find out (calmly) that the bodies weren't moved. The original made that scene really powerful with the father arguing with the developer over the fact that he saved money by simply moving the headstones, not the bodies. Again the suspense was lost in the new version.The actors did OK but no-one shone through. The little girl didn't have the screen presence needed for her brief times in the film. Even her delivery of the film's famous catchphrase: They're here! was muted. Somehow I got the feeling that it was all toned down - for a family audience? For a lower rating? Isn't it a horror film? Hmmmmm....35 minutes in before the first scary bit actually happened (the leg being pulled into the floor). It has been said that the original dove into the supernatural action too quickly and that may have been true, but this version left me wishing for a fast forward button at times.So now you're asking: did he like any of it? Well it was good to see a remake and the effects have certainly improved. I applaud that they stuck quite faithfully to the original plot line (with small exceptions). I think it is good that people should have a go at a new slant on an old film. Some can work very successfully (the latest Planet of the Apes films) while others can be awful (The Day The Earth Stood Still). But that's no reason not to try. I think this film falls in between the two examples given and was enjoyable but without the pace and the.....well.....horror....of the original. I'd catch it again on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood...stop...please?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to say this but we live in an era of movies that lack originality and Hollywood, in an attempt to make (even) more money, is remaking basically every movie we have ever come to love. Now Poltergeist gets the remake treatment...and surprise surprise, it's terrible.The original Poltergeist "directed" by Tobe Hooper and "produced" by Steven Spielberg is, simply put, one of the greatest horror movies ever made. It was original, smart and very well directed and inspired pretty much every copy cat haunted house movie after 1982. And although some were pretty good (Insidious), none really reached the heights of Poltergeist. And now we get this piece of crap. The Poltergeist remake is plot-wise the exact same movie the 1982 version was, but dumber, filled with stupid jump-scares and not one tiny bit of originality. The only thing that "saves" this movie from being total and complete garbage is Sam Rockwell, who is a great actor and the little girl who is very charismatic.The filmmakers clearly do not understand how to make good horror and do not know how to create tension. Because that is pretty much what this movie lacks, tension. Throughout the movie it's really just random annoying jump- scares that are always predictable and not earned in any way, they're just there. What many horror films during the 1980's got right were the awesome use of practical effects and the original Poltergeist really used those practical effects to the fullest (skeletons in the pool). This abomination uses only CGI and at certain points in the movie, it kinda feels like a video game, instead of a movie. This movie is cliché after cliché after cliché. You have the unoriginal idea of remaking a classic: the basic horror premise of the dysfunctional family: the troubled father, the little boy who's afraid of everything, the hot teenage daughter who bitches about everything...it's all been done so many times in the past and we're all just pretty much sick of the lack of originality. Then you have the stupid jump scares and the overuse of CGI, neither of which work in a horror movie.I hate Poltergeist, I hate everything that it stands for and this movie represents everything wrong with movie studios these days that clearly only want to make more money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm actually writing this as I'm watching it, it's jut not engaging in any way. Not good so far, no chemistry at all between the characters, unlike the original which I thought was great, the sort of people who you could imagine living next door. Also just not scary and not convincing in any way, just like everything else remade these days a huge disappointment.It really does sadden me that Hollywood, the greatest film making industry in the world seems to be of devoid of ideas that they have to resort to relying on remakes. I genuinely can't think of a decent remake from recent times.Now there's always the argument that comes around that they're bringing films to a newer audience, but I genuinely find that insulting. If people really want to watch a film that much (because they like the genre or sound of it) then they'll seek it out instead of being spooned this half arsed pointless crap we've got to endure these days.Hopefully the film industry will get its mojo back one day and we can all have a great film to talk about for years to come again. Can't see it happening though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK...this should be called National Lampoon's Poltergeist or Poltergeist: The satirical version.So, this family moves to a new house somewhere in suburban and there are some sinister spirits who want their youngest daughter because she is pure and innocent.There are many problems in this 2015's version but all converge to something that is more like tongue-in-cheek kind of thing. First of all the main actor, Sam Rockwell, doesn't take his character too seriously. I think it was a bad casting decision, not because I don't like him or anything, but because he portrays the father who just lost his youngest daughter with a smirk in his face and sarcastic comments. All the actors have a similar attitude and I wonder if that it was made on purpose.Anyway, you get the usual terror clichés about clowns, toys, closets, etc. and the usual ways to "frighten" you. But even that are like they was made for laughs and not for actual scares.Overall: Most of the remakes of a classic are destined to be doomed. So why bother with this one?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Contains spoilers***"They're here" not to scare you but make you wonder: "Why?" In the original 1982 horror film, it was enough to give you second thoughts what things may lurk in your typical neighborhood. A former burial site, haunted houses, and the terrors of witnessing a poltergeist. However, this remake makes you wonder: "Why am I seeing this movie? Why are these characters acting like this? Oh man, I want the ghosts to succeed. This simpleton family thinks this is all fun-and-games. The little boy tends to be more reasonable than his own parents. Now that's a scary thought."Examples of a few problems:In this movie, logic was sucked away to the Other Side. Several scenes explicitly said the father was out of a job. He tried to buy some cheap fencing at a hardware store, but most of his credit cards were all maxed out. Yet somehow, he was able to buy a home, have 50 inch TV in every room, have an expense remote control drone, and able to buy $2000 worth of gifts from the mall. Where did this money came from? Maybe, the father asked the ghosts to lend him a spare hand. Your guess is as good as mine.When the house was being torn apart, there was a spiritual nuclear explosion seen from miles around. But the whole time nobody came out of their homes and ask, "What the heck is going on?"--or--" Oh look, a house is being sucked away into another dimension? What shall I do now?" The neighbors must had been too busy watching the original Poltergeist, and not caring for this shoddy remake.If you can get over forgettable lead actors, semi-cool special effects, momentary lapses of yawning, horror-turned-family fun, then this movie might be for you. Otherwise, you should watch Steven Spielberg's original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are those who think that the original Poltergeist wasn't really scary enough, Steven Spielberg's family-friendly style taking precedence over Tobe Hooper's more visceral approach. Well, this 2015 remake waters down the horror even further?I imagine the conversation between MGM execs went something like this?1st Exec: You know what? we really should remake Poltergeist. After all, that's the movie that all those Paranormal Activity films are ripping off, and they're still raking in the cash.2nd Exec: Yeah, imagine what we could do with today's CGI and 3D technology. That scary tree scene could be totes amaze-balls.3rd Exec: Oooh, and that clown. Remember that? This time we could throw in lots of clowns. The more the scarier, right?1st Exec: And that bit where the guy rips off his face and drops bloody chunks of flesh into the sink? that could be awesome.3rd Exec: Are you out of your mind. If we did that, we wouldn't get a PG-13 rating.1st Exec: Oh, so I suppose the part where the girl falls in the swimming pool full of mouldy corpses would be out as well.2nd Exec: I'm afraid so, but hey, we could have someone throw up a few worms if it'll make you feel happy.Yup, this is yet another calculated cash-in on a classic chiller carefully crafted to appeal to the widest possible audience, with none of that nasty gore to offend the squeamish. Instead, we get extremely predictable jump scares and lots of slick CGI, none of which is very frightening. In fact, this film is so pedestrian that it actually makes me yearn for Zelda Rubinstein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even after thirty years of technological advancements in cinema, this remake isn't half as scary as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever been told that too much television can be bad for you? Such was the writing on the wall for kids of the 80s. Co-written and produced by Steven Spielberg, Poltergeist in 1982 drove that message right into the living room with a terrifying new twist to the horrors of home invasion. Now more than three decades on, the titular remake attempts a similar feat, albeit with the advantage of cinematic progression in as many years. Does it work? The answer to that question depends on your threshold for fear. Simply put, if you get a kick out of jump scares, there are plenty of hair-raising moments (excuse the pun). But if you are the type of horror fan who has seen it all, then this 2015 remake isn't for you, and neither does it offer anything to get your heartrate thumping. To be fair, new director Gil Kenan seems to have had his heart in the right place and with horror legend Sam Raimi as producer, Poltergeist, the remake, has all the tick marks of contemporary horror. The problem I see, are also those very tick marks, which as it turns out, appears to be a long checklist of clichés from previous horror films; A stock opening scene of a lovely family buying a new home in the suburbs ? check. The realtor makes an impression on the parents, but not the kids ? check. The house is below the market value and the realtor doesn't say why ? check. Kids are the first to sense something odd about the house but their parents think little of it ? check. Then all hell literally breaks loose, which is exactly what happens when the Bowens (led by Sam Rockwell) and their three kids move into their new suburban home. And before I say 'check' again, their youngest and cutest kid, Madison, is abducted by the titular entity, leaving the family to rely on paranormal psychologists to bring her back. Check. Of the various pitfalls in this remake, the most obvious is how similar this film is to the 1982 original, including but not limited to the way electrical appliances are used as a gateway between the living and the dead. So my biggest qualm is ? why remake a classic after thirty years if it doesn't offer anything new? Also bear in mind the aforementioned checklist when comparing this film to The Conjuring and Insidious, both films with an almost ditto plot line. But unlike those films, Poltergeist leaves more to be desired in its execution. Yes, it is well shot with cool special effects comprising of modern CGI and old fashioned light, shadow and puppeteering. Delivery from actors are acceptable, especially Rockwell (who can do no wrong in my books) and there are several junctures in the film that are actually amusing. So what went wrong? No heebie-jeebies, no build-up and absolutely no atmosphere of dread; this, over and above the paint-by-numbers predictability. All said, Poltergeist is neither a bad film, nor is it poorly crafted. It's just unfortunate that the mechanism applied to induce fright is severely underpowered. Perhaps the intensity of scares is limited only by its PG-13 classification. Perhaps the intention was homage to the original. We may never know. What's certain is for a big budget horror film, this remake is a mere average in the annals of horror cinema and nowhere near the highly effective and soon-to-be-classic, It Follows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, But Only If Not Compared to Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Poltergeist is one of the greatest movies ever made. Watching this movie reminded me of why the original was so great, and accordingly, why this one falters.What made the original Poltergeist work more than any other factor was the character development. JoBeth Williams was amazing. When Carol Anne went missing and they communicated with her from the beyond, you could palpably feel the mother's devastation and loss. The connection between the mother and the scientist in the first one was very touching. Craig T. Nelson's range of emotions (apprehension, then terror, then anger, then love) was a real journey. The result was a family that seemed to love each other tremendously and a family the viewer really cared for.The remake lacks any of that. The characters are pretty one-dimensional. Conversations between characters are not used to make us learn or care about the actors, but instead just to move the story along.The initial Poltergeist also had a handful of really amazing scenes that still stand out 30 years after first viewing it. I am thinking about the swimming pool scene with the bobbing-up corpses. Or how about all the coffins shooting up through the kitchen floor? Or the chairs in the kitchen stacking themselves up or Carol-Anne floating across the floor wearing a football helmet (when the Freelings still thought it was just silly fun).Other than perhaps the scene showing the little girl deep in the closet, there aren't any scenes that I expect to remember in a few days. Worse, the film took some of these classic scenes and redid them in a much less interesting way (e.g., stacking comic books, hand coming up from garage floor). Even the recycled jokes (e.g., caught piano moving 7 feet in 10 hours) aren't done as well.The one improvement in this remake is that it didn't send the family back in the house after it being declared "clean" for one last night's sleep while the father worked late. That always bugged me about the original.I don't want to be hard on this movie. When compared to the original, it is fairly lousy, but as a stand-alone horror movie, it's enjoyable. You just gotta wonder why it was remade. I figure if a movie is going to be remade (especially a classic), it is because the people making it have a pretty different direction to take it. I was very surprised at just how similar this movie was to the original, and how few improvements were made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very interesting pop up in the line of horror films in 2015, "Poltergeist" decides to remake one of the most memorable 1980's horror flick, taking old, to modern. The idea of the classic "Poltergeist" being remade, to me, seems like a pretty solid, and successful idea. The execution of this remake feels solid, for what it was as a remake, of course. The movie was what it was, giving twists, and new turns, cutting off from the original, and replacing it with new, modern ideas. With that being said, this may anger some viewers of the film as this remake takes some unique, neat plot ideas of the original out. Either way, the execution of this film was solid. It successfully delivered a flat out premise, along with a successfully creepy, and unsettling storyline, and environment; a win. Following the execution, the new plot of which needs to be told. The plot of the film dose, indeed switch up from the old one, but not MAJORLY, to the point where it'll seriously anger some; but just enough, of which keeps the original fans at a "Meh - like" level, in this case, huge fans of the original will be entertained, but not shocked at the edge of they're seat; terrified, or surprised out of they're mind. The switch ups were decent, they carried through the entire film, and stuck out, tying together with some well scares, and well, creepy, and scary - like atmosphere. Enjoyable for what it was, it was what it was. The acting in this movie carried out well. The characters played out well for what they stood for in the rolls they were in, for example the mother, and the little girl when scared. Point being, each character did a decent, solid job for what they were, they did good, and they pulled off believable acts. And for the characters, they are what they are. Decent, even along side the remake, the characters still stood out, sure, but in this case, the execution was, once again . . Solid, and decent, at the same time entertaining, and once again, believable. Finally, the CGI / visual effects of this film. I felt as if there was overly TOO much CGI, but for the visual / execution in this film, it was quite well. Some decisions involving such CGI actually leads to some well crafted, creepy, and unsettling atmosphere, which is quite well for the aspect of a horror movie. Some of the CGI effects also lead to be more cool, then scary. The visual effects, and CGI, overall succeed. They turn out to be; at points cool, as well as creepy, and unsettling. All crafted by well CGI, and thoughtful visual effects. In conclusion. This remake wasn't bad at all. It's a solid, entertaining remake. But one things for sure, this was switched, and rattled up from the original, dropping some unique aspects from the original. Either way, this 2015 remake wins, succeeding on multiple levels, from visual effects, to execution, all the way to characters. Finally, it wasn't the scariest film ever, not as much as the original, but it succeeds in giving the audience a feeling on unsettlement. I'd recommend audiences check this out, it's solid. And it is what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not overly fantastic, but far from awful. Just decent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a member of the current youth that plagues cinemas and laps up more crap from Hollywood than should legally be allowed, I can honestly say as a fan of the original that upon hearing the news that Poltergeist was getting a remake, it did little more than exude a beyond agitated eye roll of frustration. And the trailers did not raise my hopes in the slightest. But, very surprisingly, I easily put aside my differences and frustrations towards the remake, and purchased a ticket to go and see it.There were no hopes for this film. There really weren't. Cheap scares and a thinly structured narrative that's pretty much a by-the-numbers recreation of a film over thirty years old was what I was expecting, and it was what I got. In my eyes, it couldn't be any better than Poltergeist, but it couldn't be any worse than Poltergeist III. But I have to say, I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed watching this. Look, let's be honest, not only have we seen this film done before in the form of the original, but pretty much every horror film within the last five years. The Conjuring, Insidious, Sinister, Paranormal Activity - frankly, I'm at a loss at exactly what the hell there is left to cover. Poltergeist is pretty much a by the numbers film in that aspect: family home haunted by malevolent forces, cheap scares, standard acting. This was the biggest problem I had with the film: it just did not feel like it was trying hard enough. It was rushed and poorly paced, and often felt like it was living too much in the shadow of its predecessor.Now, onto a more positive look at the film. Despite my grievances, there were things in the film I did like. For one, I did like dynamics of the new family. I felt all the actors within the family all bounced off one another nicely, and there were some pretty touching moments that made me care about them. Two, there were moments where I did feel a sense of dread and horror. Granted, as stated above, the film is predominantly cheap scares and bad CGI, but for the moments that did scare me, a tough job to do with horror films, I was able to forgive them for the flaws. Three, Jared Harris. If it wasn't for his presence in the film, I probably wouldn't have liked it as much. Poltergeist will never best its predecessor. We all know that. However, I think it knows that. While the film may not have been mind blowing or groundbreaking, it's just decent entertainment. Just acknowledge that it has problems, and go with it. Try not to be so hard on it. It was going to be done sooner or later, and I think this is as good as we're ever going to get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terribly scary, but a fun experience. Dare I say: As good as the original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start off by saying that I'm not a die-hard fan of the original Poltergeist - I mean, I did enjoy the original, but I don't hold it in a beacon of light like some of the reviewers/critics seem to be doing. Believe it or not, the only thing I miss from the original is Tangina (the psychic medium). I mean, yeah, this version looks like a very typical modern horror movie - the style the cinematography is very similar to the likes of Insidious or Dark Skies, but I don't know how that is avoidable without going experimental? However, I think this version does as good of a job with the storytelling as the original... if not better. I found the only annoying part of the remake to be the mom character and the forced plot lines that surrounded her made no sense.Having said that, this movie was not scary for me at all (but neither was the original), but... I really did enjoy watching it. I found both the original and remake to be fairly comical, but the remake is comical to a point where it still can be taken seriously. However, I find that the original is comical to a point where it is kinda ridiculous (in a good way). I read a review on here saying how they love the original, but criticized the CGI in the remake... I mean, are you kidding me? I get that a lot of the audience/reviewers have a deep rooted nostalgia for the original, but come on. I also get that the original is a classic and I get that it was revolutionary in the horror genre. But for the modern viewers, the remake is good too. You can't expect a remake to also be revolutionary, can you?Sidenote: I found the vast amount of Star Wars memorabilia in the original movie really off-putting - yeah okay, we get it, Spielberg wrote it and produced it.I should say that, I get where all the negative reviews are coming from. If someone remade "The Shining" I would be raging my balls off. But "The Shining" doesn't have crappy 80s CGI and Jack Nicholson gave a performance of a lifetime. Also, who would dare to reach Kubrik's enigmatic legacy? "Poltergeist (1982)" had a lot of room for improvement from the storytelling to, the biggest one, the CGI.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 1982 film (which I haven't seen), I was excited at the central theme of the movie "Poltergeist" and was expecting some really nice violent ghostly action. But what did I get? Some jumbled mess of electronic ghosts capturing kids trying to find the "light".Not saying I didn't enjoy the movie, because I did as I was laughing from start till the end. But the plot made zero sense to me. Whoever thought of these electronic poltergeist activity should be given the award for most creative thinking, and I don't mean creative in a good way. Like seriously? Communicating from the other side through the television? If the original Poltergeist had a similar plot like this, then I'm truly glad that I didn't waste my time on a farce like that. The 4/10 rating is for the laugh this movie gave me, kept me entertained at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this knowing that it most likely wouldn't be anywhere near as good as the original. It definitely was not but even as a stand alone horror movie it was not good. There was bad acting all around and it really wasn't that scary. It seemed to try and push the story along way too fast as well. At least the original took time to build the story and characters and also had a creepy atmosphere all the way through. This re-imagination does not have a creepy atmosphere at all and only has a few scary moments. I gave it 4 stars since it did contain a few scary moments, but those were the only decent moments of the movie (which most were shown in the trailers)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a rating of five as I am writing this and I totally agree. It does not deserve more than five. Even, four can be considered.Though I think that the story with trapped souls and old cemetery with Aliens elements can be quite interesting, this movie is not. It is quite boring at times. The boy Griffin is just ... well, I found him annoying and totally non believable. I am not sure is it bad acting or the role was 'too eye popping' for him. Mothers reactions were also a second or two bit late in some situations, as someone forgot to tell her: Now, screeeem!The ghost hunters or whatever were totally ridiculous, especially the boy. Yeah, he almost got killed or pierced thru and he returns as if nothing happened? Really?Their house is falling apart, there is a real rumble and no people in the street!? They remembered to put police and fire fighters after some time, as well as people.Not to mention lame ending where they 'happily' escape new house that the girl is trying to sell.Very bad. But I will stick to 4 rating.As I remember, the original is not much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never written a review on IMDb before, but I felt obligated to do so just after watching this movie.Before we head straight into the actual review, I'd like to tell you a couple things. I've never seen the original poltergeist movies so this review won't be based on comparisons. Instead, I'll just be giving you some simple feedback and honest opinions solely based on the remake .I felt that some of the characters were a bit underdeveloped. I wanted to see more depth and character throughout some of their performances. Take the parents for instance, most of the time they either seemed; bored or disinterested, like they weren't fully engaged into the story line and their own characters as well. I think I enjoyed the little girl's performance better.I'd like to talk about the other people that lived in their area/neighbors. Where were they when all the bizarre paranormal stuff was going on. How could they not be aware. It was as if the Bowen family were the only ones living in that neighborhood, of "200 Acres".I just simply wanted to know what the neighbors reactions would be if they'd seen or heard the poltergeist. It sure made it's presence pretty obvious.Also, if there used to be a cemetery of 200 acres, then how come the poltergeist only attacked that house.I'm not a big fan of the ending. All in all, that just wasn't what I was expecting. It was just too vague. They definitely could have done much better with it. Although, I wasn't feeling much of the horror,I know that there's people out there who may think differently. I just wasn't that scared.If you're convinced that I'm being irrational, then think about just why this movie has a 5.1/10 rating. Some people like it, while some others don't. You might, and I'm not trying to persuade you not to watch it. I was just one of those people that weren't too impressed or wowed by the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the new age "horror" movies. So expect a lot of loud noises and beyond obvious jump "scares". Add to that, the same old terrible cliché-fest involving a child in the house speaking to the dead and the family bringing in the Ghostbusters to help them fight the evil spirits (on whose graves they were living on BTW, jerks).This movie, is awful.Just awful.I am still trying to figure out which scared me most. The awfully uninteresting characters (every single one of them), the generic screenplay or the lack of any actual horror.I usually say "watch it if you have nothing else to watch" but I now want to say, "if you have nothing else to watch, good, keep it that way".Awful, boring movie.

		<fullReview>Despite many friends telling me not to watch it, I went ahead and did anyway. So sad to see the likes of Sam Rockwell &amp; Jared Harris in a terrible rendition of a cult classic. There were a few moments worth the watch, but the movie started losing appeal when the poltergeist manifestation started to take hold. Some scenes looked like it was filmed ad hoc, and the "lighter, funny conversations" forced in between the horror scenes seemed to dilute the whole plot and urgency of saving their daughter, Madison. The acting and script made it look more like a "sleep over" with a few attempts of scaring the audience in between, before we lose interest and start taking our phones out to Google "Why am I doing this to myself?". I always watch a movie right through no matter how terrible it is, but this was one a the few I just could not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is why Remakes blow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake to the 1982 classic changes the family to the Bowen family and moves them into their new/old house because Dad Eric (Rockwell) has been out of work for a while and Mother Amy (Dewitt) wants to write a book and this is all they can afford. At a dinner party they are told by the neighbors that the entire Suburb was built over an old graveyard. The over sensitive son Griffin (Kyle Catlett) freaks out when he discovers a closet full of creepy clown dolls and a squirrel is found in his room. Griffin sees and experiences a few things in the house but is such a whiner he can't get anyone to listen to him and rightfully so. The spirits in this remake show up very early on, and put the family under siege until a group of investigators come to the house when the youngest daughter Madison (Kennedi Clements) is snatched up by the other side through the TV. Eventually, a reality TV star named Carrigan Burke (Harris) whose job is to clean houses of spirits gets pulled in to try and save Madison. This sorry remake is yet another example of why remakes suck. Taking none of the style, suspense or scares from the original, this modern version has unbelievable characters acting like idiots saying poor dialog that should have the original writers and Film makers shaking their heads. Director Gil Kenan panders to the ADHD generation by rushing the ghosts and cellar corpses to the forefront as quickly as possible leaving no mystery or wonderment to the story at all. What makes it even worse is none of it is scary outside of a few freaky moments with the multiple clowns in the kid's room. Sam Rockwell's portrayal of dad Eric Bowen as a smart-alike wise cracker is so obnoxious that it is impossible to believe the character when he is crying wanting his missing daughter back. I won't even bother to explain how anticlimactic the end scenes are and what a complete let down this entire movie ends up being. From the generic Musical score to the end credits this movie offers nothing and everything that is fun and scary in the original is missing in this one. Do yourself a favor, watch the original and bypass this overinflated junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst horror flick of the decade!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there are exceptional directors like David Robert Mitchell (It Follows), The Conjuring (James Wan) and Jennifer Kent (The Babadook) offering us out-of-the world horror movies in a platter of terror blended with high quality direction, there stands Gil Kenan crapping all over its concept, doing the exact opposite.If Poltergeist was supposed to be a reboot, then Gil missed the target by a light year. If not, he still failed to make a good movie by another light year. What is sad is the fact that its direction simply takes everything with it into the netherworld. Its stupidity swallows great actors like Sam Rockwell, Jared Harris and Rosemarie DeWitt, and makes them look mediocre.There are so many instances in the movie that would compel you to go, "Really?" and "Is this for real?" and sometimes "Where is everybody?" The horror isn't given enough time to sieve in and it keeps trudging on your head like a pointless parade with no direction or meaning.If I try really hard to look on the bright side, I could only remember the cute little Kennedi Clements who manages to melt you with her sweet voice and cute acts. She is downright adorable. Amongst other things, you could say the graphics and visuals looked rad particularly when the cast witnesses the creepy diabolical world that homes in their closet. Apart from that I think everything was sheer pathetic.One of the wisest decisions of your life would be to skip this one!</fullReview>

I'm not normally too picky, but this movie was so disappointing I had trouble sleeping. The special effects actually made the move less scary and more comical. It followed the story of the original so completely that nothing at all surprised me. Not to mention every single jump moment was in the trailer. The actress playing the little girl was very good, and the rest of the cast was average. If you want to be scared watch the original, much better. Unless you are just watching for the special effects with no context at all. This movie probably deserves 5 out of 10, but I'm giving it a 3 because it was so disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shitty remake of an amazing classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist. I have watched this movie no less than three days ago, hoping that it was going to be a better version of the classic Poltergeist, unfortunately I was wrong. Directed by Gil Kenan and written by David Lindsay-Abarie this movie is said to be a terrifying horror story ? in my personal opinion though, this is more of a sci-fi mixed in with comedy rather than something that is meant to be keeping me up at night. If it was labelled as that, I most likely would have given this movie at LEAST 3 stars but it is advertised to be something that it is not. Okay, so we begin with a family of five moving in to a new place. We have the overly caring mom, the trying-to-be-cool dad, the two small kids and the pretentious teenager, in other words, your typical family according to filmmakers. They're really happy with this house, unaware that their daughter is, surprise surprise!, talking to ghosts and their beautiful new house is placed on a ancient cemetery. Surprisingly, the acting was pretty good for a movie this bad ? I think that the child actor, Kennedi Clements, who played the little Madison Bowen and Kyle Catlett, who played Madison's brother, Griffin deserve my recognition for wonderful acting. I would have considered the special effects in this movie as pretty good BUT as I said, it made it look more like a sci-fi movie rather than a horror . I cannot say that I like much about this movie bar from Kennedi's and Kyle's acting, but there is plenty that I have disliked. First of all, this was meant to be a remake; the definition of remake according to google is ?a more recent version of an older film" not ?a completely different, like ten times worse version of an amazing classic". Second of all, to me, a horror is a movie that keeps you tense throughout it, interested in it and afraid to a certain extent with a few minor jumpscares. This, was nothing at all like that ? this kept you uninterested, it wasn't scary at all and apparently the director thought it was a good idea to shove jumpscares every five minutes for no reason. Third of all, and I have mentioned this more than once; this was a sci-fi not a horror. The only two lessons that I learned from this movie are; one, do not try to make a remake of a classic that everyone loves because you will screw it up and two, do not watch remakes of classic movies that everyone loves because it will most likely be shittier than I expect. Despite all my criticism, if you are into ?constant jumpscares, uninteresting and just generally bad" movies, go ahead , watch it and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard Sam Raimi was helping create a remake of 1982's cult classic, Poletergeist, my initial thought was: "That'll suck." Seriously, I'll never understand why Raimi has achieved the reputation of being a "good director;" every single movie he makes is awful. Evil Dead? Stupid. Drag Me To Hell? Awful. The Spider-Man trilogy...don't even get me started. This guy, at least in my opinion, shouldn't still be making movies, or even assisting with production; 2015's Poltergeist is more evidence to that claim.The original Poltergeist was ahead of its time; a story about a family who's home was haunted because it was (illegally) built upon a Native-American burial ground. Its eery score and frightening jumps were high-quality scares for an 80s film, but what makes this movie a classic was the inclusion of spirit-reader Tangina. It was the first scary movie I recall seeing that had a character who provided explanation to the haunting, turning random scares into reasonable tactics. This movie was a horror movie at heart, but a mystery story in theory. None of this originality is present this time around...Finish reading on my website: http://hemihardaway.com/movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I would have thrown my drink cup too, but I wanted to get a refill on my way out.Poor on all counts, in all regards, this has more poltergeist haunting a yuppie family in Suburbia. They're supposedly broke, so how do they afford a new home, with a couple of flatscreen televisions? Their HDtv is displaying static late one night (I thought that hasn't happened since the 1980s?) and a ghost gives their young daughter a high five, yanks her through the screen, and they spend the rest of the film trying to get her back.Mind-bogglingly stupid attempt at horror/ psychological thriller comes off as laughable more than anything, particularly when tree limbs come to life, smash through a skylight, reach in and grab their son and start flinging him about like a doll in the night sky, and the father seemed disinterested, and the mother appeared as though she didn't know what movie she was in. The clearly disinterested actors couldn't even be bothered to look concerned by any of this, or put forth any effort at all, just looking nonchalant, disinterest, and bored. Almost as bored as the audience was, in between bouts of laughably bad effects.Filmed in the Autumn of 2013, but not released until early summer 2015, and it's easy to see why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all if you have seen the original version of Poltergeist do not go to the theater to see this. Hold out till its on Netflix or in a bargain bin at Walmart. So many epic scenes were completely skipped with not much new content added. This movie lacked the little things that get you interested in the characters. So much of the detail &amp; build up is just missing from this movie, it's really a shame. This remake ended up feeling rushed and more like a cash grab than a true remake.The acting was mediocre at best. Sam Rockwell was a poor substitute for Craig T Nelson as the father.The girl that played Carol Anne seemed to have a kind of forced cuteness. Even the researchers which played the supporting characters were bland.If you haven't seen the original movie then this one may be more enjoyable. If you are going to spend the money on a Poltergeist movie Id recommend just buying a copy of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As remakes go, this is quite a good one - fresher and more inventive than the recyclings of THE OMEN and PSYCHO. The basic story is the same but with a few topical updates. The family are now relocating because of the recession (Dad's unemployed). Young son has security issues following a kidnap scare (lost in mall, but not abducted). Teenage daughter lives on Facebook. But it's still the apple-pie-cute youngest daughter who communicates with the spirits behind the TV screen and in the closet.As in 1982, there are no grandstanding parts for big-name stars, which helps make the family and their predicament believable. Sam Rockwell underplays Dad, Jared Harris slightly overplays the ghostbuster, Kennedi Clements is suitably apple-cheeked in the role of Madison.We're told quite early that the development is built on an old graveyard, but the disturbed spirits are much more aggressive than they were in 1982. This being a 3D movie the special effects are all hurled at the camera and the audience. And there's a lot more of them. This is both scarier and nastier than the Tobe Hooper version, although the rescue scene and the 'aftermath' seem a bit rushed this time. As we have come to expect from 21st-century haunted-house movies, the new Poltergeist is both Sinister and Insidious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The late Heather O'Rourke once gleefully and excitedly told audiences "they're here!" It's more than appropriate that when this rehash of Poltergeist tasks a new young girl with repeating that classic line, she is unable to muster nearly as much liveliness in her delivery. Her blank stare and monotone voice mirrors my enthusiasm for yet another instance of a film studio reaching into its back catalog and violently digging up a franchise... much like the horrific exhumation of those poor bastards buried under the Freeling household.There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea of a remake, as long as the filmmaker has something fresh to say and do with the intellectual property in question. Unfortunately, Gil Kenan's Poltergeist brings nothing new to the table. To be fair, Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper are a hard act to follow. This remake is very safe, without much discernible style beneath its slick, modern surface. This is a typical PG-13 horror film - disposable and forgettable.At the very least, you'd think the advances in special effects would afford a more thrilling, spectacular haunting, but the result is the opposite. If you watch this film and the original back to back like I did, you'll miss the beauty of the old school optical creature effects that make the 1982 version so special. In fact, this is a far tamer and subtler film, which is surprising considering remakes usually try their best to outdo the material they're derived from. There are a few fun gags here and there (particularly in 3d considering it was filmed natively in the format) but there's nothing that we haven't seen before, and done better in recent films like Insidious and The Conjuring.The performances are serviceable enough with Sam Rockwell being his usual likable self, and Jared Harris playing a strange replacement for Zelda Rubenstein's character, but the family at the center of the story never really gels together and only serves to make you appreciate the ensemble in the original film. It also brings home just how much of a talent Heather O'Rourke was, and how important her on screen personality was to making Poltergeist work.Also missing is Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful and creepy score. The music here is forgettable in comparison.The original film had something to say about the culture and politics of greed in the 1980's, where profit, progress and building a new housing development on the cheap was more of a priority than respecting the dead and their sacrifices that modern society was built upon. While this message is still just as relevant in 2015 as it was back then, it's a little lost in the remake due to the omission and reshuffling of certain characters. There seems to be more of a focus on the modern obsession with social media and digital devices, with the little girl being literally lost to her family inside a television screen. Obviously, this also happened in the original, but has taken on new meaning nowadays and is probably the most interesting aspect of the film. The new relevance of this story element is the best justification I can think of for the film being remade, but it's really not enough.It saddens me to see Sam Raimi's name on this thing. I actually liked the Evil Dead remake from a couple of years ago. While not quite reaching the creative height of Raimi's own Evil Dead films, it was brutal and off-the-wall enough to satisfy fans. In comparison, the nicest thing I can say about Poltergeist 2015 is that it's better than Poltergeist III. Anyone who's seen that film can tell you it's not much of a compliment, since Poltergeist III is a gigantic pile of brown, sloppy... uh... ectoplasm. We can only hope the Poltergeist curse will strike this film and turn it into a ghost at the box office, deterring future pointless horror remakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not like remakes, but Poltergeist is an exception. Well acted and direct Poltergeist remake crafts and entertaining story. If I compare Poltergeist to the original one notices how acting, and directing has improved over the years, but the original Poltergeist was and still is a great story. The director emulates an easy going dad, and scared little boy into likable characters which resonates with the viewers. The character development creates an empathy for the family's poltergeist problem. Poltergeist pays homage to the original and excellently executes the stall worth Doll clown, tree bedroom, and portal closet scenes. Poltergeist the remake pays enough homage to the original, but different enough to be it own movie. I like Poltergeist! Seven scares out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining remake, but not the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original movie when I was a small child (really bad idea). For years I had hoped this movie would be remade and I finally got my wish. If you have seen the original movie there are certain things you look to happen and in this case most do - although sometimes out of order or changed. I have mostly positive things to say about the remake. I intentionally skipped the 3D version as I was not interested in things flying at me and perhaps that meant I was not as prone to complain about jump scare tactics as those who saw the 3D film, although yes - unlike the original, this version does rely some on jump scare tactics that were incredibly predictable. I thought the changes to the overall story and plot worked out nice. Letting the audience see and experience the "other side" was an interesting addition since we never got to experience that in the original.What I really wished they would have done was made the movie a bit longer and allowed for more of the playful character development that we saw in the original. For instance the baseball that magically rolled across the floor - could dad have played batting practice since we know he was a washed out baseball player? Something along those lines like the "scoot across the floor" scene we saw in the original would have been nice. I was desperately wishing they would have used the original soundtrack or at least toyed with it some. The new soundtrack is very good, but to hear that iconic song just once would have been a very nice touch. The sound mixing was done very well. I often found myself looking over my shoulder to see what was going on behind me, so well done. In all it's a very watchable remake that leaves you feeling entertained, however I just wish they'd given it another 15 minutes. I'll watch again - probably after it is out on DVD. Unfortunately (or not) it will never be the iconic movie that is the original Poltergeist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'm a huge fan of the original. The original is scarier. The music in the original is awesome. I even wrote a college paper on the original. Does the remake have flaws? Yes, but even the original has flaws. There isn't a "beast" in the remake. Just a bunch of angry ghosts. The son has more of a role in this one as does the oldest daughter who wasn't seen much in the original. The clown attack in this one is more vicious! The tree scratching the glass was cool and a black puff of smoke called a tornado doesn't take the tree away. I loved the seeing the youngest daughter and the son in the "other world". All of the spirits around them pulling the rope was awesome to see. One thing the remake gets right that the original didn't is when the family saves the youngest daughter they tried to get the hell out of there! The original family puts the son and daughter back in the same room where the daughter was abducted?! Not smart! The ending is different too. The family van being thrown into the house when trying to escape was unexpected. Is the remake a classic? No. Because it didn't break ground like the original. Is it a movie that I will buy when it is released and recommend to my family and friends? A big yes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible remake! 2/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: What a terrible remake! It's definitely not in the same class as the original and I'm surprised that it made a profit at the box office. I'm usually a big fan of Sam Rockwell but his performance was pretty poor. Anyway, if you've seen the first movie, the concept is, more or less, the same. A family move into a new suburban home and the two younger kids, Madison (Kennedi Clements) and Griffin (Kyle Catlett), start to see some strange things happening around the house. There parents Eric (Sam Rockwell) and Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt), take no notice of there young son, because he has a history of seeing abnormal things. When they go out for a meal with there new friends, the Poltergeist starts to take over the house and it takes Maddy into its paranormal world. When Eric and Amy come home from there night out, they soon realise that some strange things have been happening in there house and when they realise that Maddy is missing, they hire a paranormal research team to investigate her disappearance. With the help of there elder daughter, Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), they set up some gadgets around the house to try and work out were Maddy has gone. The head of the research team Dr. Brooke Powell (Jane Adams), soon realises that she is going to need a specialist to go into the paranormal world, so she calls on her ex-husband, Carrigan (Jared Harris), to tackle the ghost. When he arrives, he soon gets spooked with the scale of the case but he uses his expert skills to get Maddy back into the normal world. The reason why I thought this movie was so bad was because none of the family looked that surprised about there house being taken over by a unknown powerful force. When there daughter gets taken, no one seemed to panic and with all of the noise going on in the house, no one was suspicious in there neighbourhood, especially when there car crashed through there garage or when the kid was shouting in the tree. The police were never called through the whole, noisy, episode and the idiot that nearly got a drill through his head, decided not to tell anyone, for some unknown reason. On the plus side, I did stick with the movie because I was wondering how they were going to get Maddy back but that also turned out to be very disappointing. The acting was poor from the whole cast, because they wasn't screaming or showing any intensity through the whole film but the graphics were OK. I wasn't that disappointed because a lot of my friends told me that it was rubbish, and now that I've watched it, I can understand why true Poltergeist fanatics were upset with this remake. If they decide to come out with a Poltergeist 2, which they might because this movie made a profit, they really need another script writer because there were to many holes in this storyline. Disappointing!Round-Up: A lot of people remember the first movie because of the little girl, Carol, and the weird psychic Tangina and the acting from the whole cast, especially the mother and father, played by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams, was brilliant. There's nothing that memorable in this movie and I wasn't left wanting to see a part 2. Anyway, a lot of people class Poltergeist as a Steven Spielberg classic but he actually didn't direct the movie. Spielberg did write the original story but it was directed by Tobe Hooper, who brought you the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise in 1974. This remake was directed by, London born, Gil Kenan, 39, who brought you City of Ember and the animation movie, Monster House. With only 2 movies to his name, I don't think that he was the perfect candidate to take on this all time classic and I don't think that he got the best out of Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt. There wasn't enough emotion from the characters, which I'll blame on the director because they are both known for there great performances. I think that it was the fact that this was called Poltergeist, why it made a profit at the box office and not because it was a good film. I just hope they give the next project to another director, if they make one.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $95.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/thrillers starring Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Jared Harris and Jane Adams. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a Stephen King's Sleepwalkers remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one of the silver screen's most iconic and scary scenes ? the clown attack from the original 1982 version ? is remade into an absolute laugh-out-loud riot, you know the movie's a dud.Oh, and I am not kidding: the updated clown attack nearly sent me to the floor in laughter.Remakes/reboots/retelling have been around probably since the beginning of time. Shakespeare, himself, wouldn't be as wildly known if they didn't continue doing his plays for centuries as well as all the film adaptions. While most of them suck and even more DON'T need to be reimagined, some are actually fantastic, like 1986's The Fly and 2001's Ocean's Eleven. This one falls in the former category. Not only was it useless to remake the eternal classic ghost/tongue-in-cheek film, but they didn't spend enough time to make it their own, nor any good.I hesitated on the one star rating, as I usually try and find one or more positive things in every movie, even the worst ones and while I wouldn't put this close to my 25 least favorite movies of all-time list, there was absolutely nothing good here. Everything fell apart?whether or not you compare it to the original.Funny, though. I've only seen the 1982 original twice; once about 10 years or so ago (or, 2006ish) and the second time on October 7th, 2015 and though it's not my favorite horror/adventure/ghost story, I really did enjoy it. I probably would've been more scared had I seen it as a kid?I KNOW that clown scene, along with the tree attack, would've scarred me for life ? in a good and scary fun way. I say all this to prove, I'm not the 100% defender of the first movie, but I can certainly appreciate it.And now?I appreciate it ALL THE MORE.In that one, the acting was fantastic, believable, deep, funny and real. The characters were completely iconic, memorable, delivered the right emphasis to their dialogue and made us root for them. If you take one thing from that movie, it's the characters and acting from everybody.One hundred percent opposite here. The family, sans only the brother, never once felt sad or even remotely concerned the daughter had been sucked into Neverland. The worst offender of the family was the dad, the sleepwalking, phoned-in performance from the usually great Sam Rockwell. He wasn't just bland and looked like he wanted to be somewhere else, but he genuinely looked like he couldn't give two sh|ts about getting his daughter back. Additionally, the dialogue, including repeated lines from the original, was flat and forced. "They're here" was both the original film's tagline and creepiest line from probably any child actor in horror. Here, this bored daughter just said it as a matter-of-factly. Shame.Beyond the family, they replaced the incredibly awesome Zelda Rubinstein with a hideous Fright Night rip-off that will surely never be remembered. His storyline, including awkward ex-spouse issues and Jaws scar stories, was not only irrelevant but a distraction. Not that there was anything else to cling to, mind you.Additionally, the plot-holes were mind-blowing. Now, I just watched this last night, and true, most of it is mercifully leaving my memory, but too many questions were asked and never answered. Such as:&gt; How could a broke couple made up of an unemployed mother and laid-off father buy a new and huge house? ?.and repeatedly?&gt; How could two credit cards be maxed or cancelled and a third one that could barely afford a cage suddenly buy hundreds of dollars of unneeded merchandise from a mall that according to the daughter had been boarded up?&gt; The dead in the cemetery below the house supposedly "suffered a terrible injustice" and that's why they're p|ssed off. Wait. All of them? All at the same time? Every former headstone ended with the same Day of Death Date? And what was that "terrible injustice?" Please, dear Lord?they won't be exploring that in a sequel, will they?&gt; Aside from the clichéd explanation of foreclosed homes, where the hell was anyone in town when the explosive climax happened?&gt; And how do they lose a character, *maybe* find him and then suddenly cut to another terrible scene without positive resolution? (Sure the end credit idiotic scene sums it up, but it was still unexplained, shallow and unfulfilling.)The special effects were okay, but didn't scare me whatsoever. In fact, there was nothing frightening in this "horror," even if you don't compare it to the original. The overall magic was gone and we were left with a "family" who didn't look like they wanted to be anywhere near each other when the director yelled "Cut!"The synopsis is pretty much the same. Family of five move into a new home built over an old cemetery and immediately, the youngest is used and kidnapped by spirits from the beyond. It's up to the left behind family to decide if it's even worth to save her since it'll probably free up some cash.There is no good reason to see this. See the original. Whether you like things updated or not, there's still?no good reason to see this.***Final thoughts: Notice how I didn't mention the original's sequels? Well, because I can barely remember part II ? I think there was a tequila worm attack and part III I actually saw first, as a double feature with Phantasm II back in 1988 and I only remember a skyscraper. So, those two follow-ups and this horrid remake?just skip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who are these people who seem to have a love for this crap? Some even claim to be fans of the original. This cannot even stand on it's own merit much less as a remake of a classic film. Polterghast 2015 is a fine example of why the classics should never be touched. This movie was emotionless, bland and very hard to make it through. Luckily it was only an hour and thirty minutes (or so). There is no build up, no character development, no storytelling. The audience is treated like children and spoon fed vital information, for example how the bodies were never relocated. You get one cliché jump scare after another. The hero roles (originally played by women) are replace by males. The family is as drab as as a Scy-Fy Channel film, and it doesn't help the acting is horrible. Wasn't sure it was just terrible writing, a poor budget or if the writers just were not fans of the original but this film fails in every way. Avoid at all costs and if you must watch a terrible movie maybe you should just watch Sharnado 3. At least it knows where it stands on the grand scale of things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polter Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the most horrifying thing in this movie is the acting. The second most horrifying thing was that I had to spend six dollars to see it. Unlike the original where the family was slowly exposed to the poltergeist, in this movie, absolutely nothing happens in the first 30 minutes, then the kids, while home alone are all terrorized by unknown and mostly unseen forces (The special effects were actually much better in the 33 year old original). When the parents come home, even though neither has experienced any phenomena yet, they immediately buy into the whole supernatural explanation. Instead of discovering why these events are happening, a tele-supernaturalist just blurts it out about 60 minutes in. And for some reason, the wimpy son has most of the ideas on how to solve the problem (not the army of experts parading through the house). I won't bother trying to compare this to the original, but just say the only reason I went to see this movie was because of the original. That mistake will haunt me forever.</fullReview>

Is it just for the money? Oops, I think I answered my own question. Well, obviously it worked as the film made a load of money out of people - like "flitz35-633-627650" - who thought it was good, or who were paid to say that they thought it was good.So here's the truth: it was rubbish compared to the original written by Spielberg.Shame on whoever sold the rights to this to Sam Raimi.Shame on Sam Raimi for getting involved in this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is "bad;" we've ALL seen that. Then there's REAL BAD, and that is the case for the remake of "Poltergeist." I will have no problem in listing this putrid turd in my Top 10 of "Worst Movies Ever Made." We are all familiar with the original. Everything that was in that picture--think acting, direction, humor, scares, great script, heart, and soul--is nowhere to be found in the remake. Everyone involved with this seemed as if they had something else they would rather being doing, i.e. rearranging their sock drawers, alphabetizing their spice racks, or watching paint dry. With Sam Raimi producing this, I expected much better. The first picture gave us a family that everybody could sympathize with. They were funny, vulnerable, but most of all believable. The script tried to explain what caused all their problems. And the psychic involved (Tangena) put it over the top. The remake gives us NOTHING. The story is literally shoved down the viewers' throats at break- neck speed. Carol Anne and her brother Robbie have now been replaced by Griffin and Madison. Griffin whines constantly; Madison just sorta' exists. The adults were so pitiful they do not deserve mentioning.I am not the only person who has stated Hollywood should leave its "classics" alone. Remakes DO NOT WORK. Think "Evil Dead;" "Carrie;" and this POS. I will say (again) that I am surprised Sam Raimi has his name associated in any way with this clunker. The remake is directed (nudge/nudge; wink/wink) by Gil Kenan and is Rated PG-13 for language and an ugly clown. Horrible; just absolutely horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad its scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure most would agree that no one was clambering for a remake of Tobe Hooper (or is it Steven Spielberg's?) beloved 1980's horror film Poltergeist, a film that gave don't sit too close to the TV a whole new meaning and clowns an even worse name, but as seems to be the case with modern day movie making studios, they don't seem to care to much for what we want and hence we now have 2015's Poltergeist.Directed by Gil Keenan, a man known only for the CGI film Monster House (his 2nd film City of Ember is virtually a forgotten entity) and a talent once heralded as the new Spielberg or Zemeckis, and produced by long serving horror master Sam Raimi, there was hope out there amongst the many naysayers that this modern take on the unfortunate real estate ventures of the Bowen family could be a surprise packet of horror goodies, but when the scariest thing in a "horror" film is a demented squirrel or an out of place looking Sam Rockwell, you know you're in for a terrible ride.One would suspect that the modus operandi of most horror films is to be scary but seemingly throwing out the rulebook here Keenan and his script written by David Lindsay-Abaire deliver a film so bereft of scares that you'd have to think maybe we are instead witnessing the Poltergeist reimagined as some type of comedy vehicle, as there really is no other logical explanation as to why this film stinks at the level that it does.It's hard to know where to start with everything that the Poltergeist does wrong, but the most telling aspect of the film other than not delivering one single scare (other than perhaps the film's mid end credits scene which is just so horribly done its scary) is the fact that a producer like Raimi should of known better and tried to rescue or even cull this film before it saw the light of day or an actor of the stature of Sam Rockwell even agreeing to take a pay check and run with his misguided appearance here. Really, everything you would've loved about the original film is missing here and no amount of violent trees, mud monsters or scary cupboards was ever going to make this film OK.With a bunch of unlikeable child actors, a seriously non-scary or even slightly creepy retelling of a story that deserves better, Poltergeist is a huge letdown even though most had written the film off beforehand suggesting that the scariest thing about this horror film is just how bad it ended up being, even though the bar had been set at an already precariously low level.? a menacing squirrel out of 5 P.S ? note to parents. If you come home and find your child quite literally being swung around by giant tree and go inside to find your daughter inside a TV with demonic spirits,please act a little bit more concerned than the parents found here.</fullReview>

The acting was unbelievably unbelievable. It felt rushed, and more like a university drama project than an actual high budget film. Poor effects didn't help either. Kennedi Clements is the best in it by far, and shouldn't become stereotyped for this poor film. The iconic scenes just aren't there but not even replaced by something bigger. Terrible acting, terrible scripting, no feelings portrayed of the situation that is happening to them. I cannot express the disappointment I have, However I do not agree with remakes.

		<shortDescription>Decent for a horror fan, for everyone else- eh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, yes, the original was a classic. The first Poltergeist was one of the reasons I am a horror movie fanatic. This remake/update is not a classic, and will likely be dismissed as another failed new vision of an older masterpiece. So don't expect any miracles here. However, if you are like me and would rather watch a horror movie over just about everything else, then watch this one, because there are a few high notes.Sam Rockwell is the movie. He gives a great performance, creating a very believable, struggling father in a film with a way too fast script and pace. The other actors are not bad, but they definitely don't capture your attention - or even emotion- like Rockwell does. You can have a rather high expectation of his performance... It will be met.There were a couple of modern updates that were very entertaining and lived up to potential. Those brief moments brought a little suspense into the film and made me wonder if the filmmakers had just chosen to loosely follow the original then maybe this one would have more merit.The pace of the film is too fast. Scares are packed in and quite predictable. I'm not certain the use of CGI really ruins anything, it seems to beat the whole "jerky crawling around on all fours" phantoms of the post-modern Japanese horror films. But the suspense seems to be lacking. I'm sure we would have a different film from 1982 if CGI were available. Spielberg and Hooper would go nuts with that stuff, but we all know they wouldn't skip out on making us sweat to see it.At the end of the film, I came to the realization that this is where we are with horror movies this day and age. I guess there are only so many ideas out there and instead of being accused of ripping off a classic, they just remake it. But, it's still a horror movie, and true horror fans will dutifully watch them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to see one of my favorite films remade in 2015, and to see how they change certain things or maybe leave other things the way they were in 1982. First of all, I did love every actors portrayal of their individual characters. I thought every actor was a great choice and really fit their roles well! This film did take some liberties from the original. One of those changes, is because of midterm technology. Yes, they use iPads, and computers during the movie to help find Madison. Also, the main paranormal investigator was short older woman in 1982, and this time around, it was a man. There wasn't any maggot infested meat crawling on the floor. The ending was a whole lot different from the original, the mom wasn't the one who went in to save Madison, it was someone else, and also because of modern technology, we were able to see inside where Madison was kidnapped and taken, unlike the original, I did like that, that was kinda cool and interesting to be able to see. Also, the family was backing out of the driveway when the ghosts started back up, that's a whole lot different from the original, those of you who have seen the original know what I'm taking about. Overall, loved the actors, loved seeing inside the realm, I thought the film was entertaining, although I DID NOT like the way they changed the ending, I thought the original had a much better ending! That was really the only part I REALLY didn't like! 6/10 overall</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this piece of cr#p about a week ago and I hardly remember anything about it. All I remember is it being boring as all hell and wishing it would end. I can't compare it to the original film of the same name that came out in the 80s because I haven't seen it but I'm sure it isn't anything like this. All I remember is Sam Rockwell digging? Or doing something. No, really, this movie is that forgettable. If anything scary happened, I would have remembered. Maybe I'll check out the original Poltergeist film if it ever comes out on AMC or something. I think the major issue with this film is the directing. I honestly can not blame any of the actors, or the budget. Easily one of the worst films of 2015.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist (2015): Dir: Gil Kenan / Cast: Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Saxon Sharbino, Kyle Catlett, Kennedi Clements: According to this lame remake, a poltergeist is a more violent form of ghost. Well, they will have much to get riled about when their reputations are tarnished by this crap. Remake of the far scarier Tobe Hooper film, the premise rushes a family into a house that was built upon a cemetery. Director Gil Kenan previously made two entertaining films. They are City of Ember and Monster House. Now he is accompanied by a screenplay that is about as scary as an episode of Fraggle Rock backed by special effects that conceal the screenplay as oppose to elevate it as in the original. We have a dimwitted family made totally of cardboard. Sam Rockwell as dad buys rodent traps because he blames them for the ominous noises at night. Rosemarie DeWitt as mom is ready to crack and needs him to hold strong. Saxon Sharbino as oldest daughter Kendra is nearly drown in floor cement in the laundry room. Kyle Catlett as son Griffin is scared of everything and will need to grow some nerves by film's end. Finally we have Madison, played by Kennedi Clements who talks to the television and ends up sucked into the closet through some weird portal. She will make viewers reflect on Heather O'Rourke who was much more enticing. Finally we have some moron TV star who checks out haunted houses and boots out spooks. This is a laughably bad film fuelled by special effects. If this crap is on this side of the television screen, then by all means, jump inside and see if something better is playing on the other side. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has everyone gone mad ? Possible spoilers ??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard there was to be a remake of what I consider To be one of the best movies of all time I thought oh dear this will be awful, and well I wasn't disappointed. This 'movie remake' is nothing of the sort, its a loosely based hash of a great movie. The acting was bad at best, the story was completely different and it wasn't even believable that they were an actual family. I couldn't relate to any of the character's. And how all of a sudden did they go from being destitute to being able to buy loads of new things, including the apple placementI phone? Seriously ?? just after they grounded the child for cursing at the parents?? The end was corny and predictable. I could say many more awful things about this film but I'll let it speak for itself. I'm not anti remake, some have been really good, but I'll say it again .. This disaster was not a remake, the only thing it had in common with the original was the title! I thought if I had seen this movie with a different title I would say that was crap and they stole a couple of ideas from poltergeist, please don't be like me, sad that that's 1 hour 33 minutes and 33 seconds of my life I won't get back. So whoever has rated this as great,seriously??? .. I really do not get it! Each to their own I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie EVER!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake was just awful, really awful. No story line, no scenario development. Just a myopic approach that drowned in its own embarrassment. If one hadn't seen the original, one would have no idea what the hell was going on. An unemployed family seem to be cashed up enough to buy a house (no matter how cheap the price). A husband who doesn't want his wife to work , even though he is unemployed, sorry not believable. The guy who played the father, just an incredibly bad performance, pity the producers didn't leave him unemployed and casted another. Now mix this with a dinner party that was a vignette to the husband and wife's background, and the history of the house built on a cemetery. From then on it was basically a cut paste of clichés best suited to a trailer. Not scary, especially the pathetic looking clown puppet. If you want to see a scary clown check out Twisty the Clown from "Freak Show" (American Horror Story) Stay well away from this remake, well away!!!! PS: the two actors from the Mad Men series should have stayed in Mad Men - this movie does nothing for their reputation</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Poltergeist Really Need to Be Remade?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I loved the original Poltergeist film. It was original, creepy and in some cases unsettling. I could understand remaking this film if the filmmakers wanted to try something new and make something scarier. But that didn't happen. This remake follows the same story, a family moves into a new house and they soon discover the house is being haunted by some spirits that want to take the family's youngest daughter. This film is not a good remake. It's the same basic story and the only thing that is really different is the upgrade of technology so it's just a modernized version which is completely unnecessary. The original version still holds up today despite being made in the early 80's. The scares in this film also do not work, they are all predictable and didn't even remotely disturb me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm, where to begin. I saw the original in the theater. I remember having a discussion with my dad beforehand, asking him if he thought the movie was too scary (I was 10 at the time), he didn't think so, and we proceeded to watch one of the best horror movies ever made, IMO. Since, I've probably seen it over 100 times, I lost count after 30.Now that I've established my affection for the original, I can tell you this remake was the most disappointing remake I've ever seen. I mean this was worse than The Fog remake, and that was bad.I'll start with the running time, which seemed pretty short. Why? Because this movie assumes you've seen the original, and rushes everything. For example, in the original, we don't discover the neighborhood is built on an old graveyard until about half-way through, after Carol-Anne was sucked into her closet. In the remake, we find out before really anything starts, other than some weird static electricity and objects being drawn to a closet door.The family chemistry, which was awesome in the original. The real and funny scenes with Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams in their bedroom, acting like real people who love each other and have fun together, who love and cherish their children, which makes the ensuing terror even more effective. There was none of this in the remake. They tried I think; was the scene where the mother is complaining she needs new underwear supposed to funny?The son, Griffin (Robbie in the original), played a bigger role in this movie, but that didn't add any originality. They establish he's kind of a scaredy-cat and then he's the one who goes into the closet to get Madison, because he feels guilty for leaving her in the room when she got sucked into the closet. Only thing is in this version she just walks into the damn closet, following a toy that's moving, by itself, into a pitch-black closet. What kid in their right mind would follow a toy moving by itself into a closet, at night, when mommy and daddy are not even home. Stupid.The paranormal researchers, holy hell they all were horrible. In the original they came first and explained what was happening to the family, clearing the way for Tangina to come in and clean the house. But here they show up, the son says they should tie a rope around someone to go get Madison, then the Irish guy shows up, and they proceed to do exactly that, like right away.The other side, which we never saw in the original, because that's scarier. In this version, we see it, in fact they send a drone in, yes, a drone. Was that some lame attempt at modernizing the movie? I guess so, that and some mildly interesting sequence with the older daughter and her cell phone. I say mildly because nothing much happens, except sludge, you'll have to see it to understand that.Then the finale, or can I even call it that? I kid you not, there's a scene where the family is trying to get out of the house and the Irish dude is OUTSIDE of the house, yelling at it, telling it to "release this family!". I was rolling my eyes.Don't even bother seeing this movie. If you haven't yet, see the original, it's infinitely better in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never expected much from it being a remake/reboot but I never expected it to be so bad. The script, the acting, the whole bag of mashings was just terrible from the get go.There is no comparison to the original which, to this day, is still a creepy film to watch even though I've seen it 100's of times in my life. This new one has none of the mystery, drama or suspense of the original. They move in and it all immediately kicks off and no one really batters an eyelid to any of it. They do some of the stuff from the original film and then it ends. Seriously, that's the film in a nutshell.I personally think Sam Rockwell is a fantastic actor but he needs to seriously question what the hell he thought he was doing here. His acting is atrocious. Kyle Catlett was the only person in the entire film to put a bit of effort in to it and he could've passed for Pinocchio. I can't believe for one minute that, when editing this film, the director didn't think to himself, hang on a minute, this film is trash. If he didn't, he needs words with himself as well.It was just a terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE film. On par with Stallone's Get Carter remake. Awful. I hope to god they don't make a sequel. Let this festering turd of a movie disappear into oblivion and let the original live on.1/10 - I'd give it a zero but that's not an option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insidious Wannabe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist (2015) * 1/2 (out of 4) A husband (Sam Rockwell) and wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) move their three children into a new home where it soon becomes clear that there's something else there with them. The youngest child (Kennedi Clements) eventually gets pulled into another world so a famed ghost hunter (Jared Harris) is called in.Those who hate remakes can take a deep breathe because this film has very little in common with the Tobe Hooper original. Whereas that film tried to be a serious, adult movie with horror elements, this one here is pretty much a remake of INSIDIOUS with a few classic moments from the original POLTERGEIST thrown in. Plus, whereas the original tried to be smart, this one here is pretty much one stupid jump scare after another and if you've ever seen a horror movie before then you're not going to fall for this fake scares.POLTERGEIST is a pretty disappointing movie because the filmmakers had a lot of good elements to work with but nothing original or refreshing are done with them. In fact, even though I'm not a major fan of the original movie I'd say this remake is even worse than the two sequels. So, what went so wrong? The majority of the blame can be placed at the screenplay and the direction. The story itself just isn't all that fresh and brings no new ideas to the table. In fact, this thing is pretty dated in regards to the current crop of haunted movies like the before mentioned INSIDIOUS. Throughout the entire running time of this thing I kept wondering if the screenwriter and director had seen the previous movie and why they weren't trying to do anything original.Even worse are the jump scares, which are all pretty predictable. We get countless lights flashing on and off, several wannabe scary voices and of course several things go flying towards the screen. As far as the 3D goes, it looks really, really cheap without any of the effects working all that well. In fact, there were several times that I forgot the movie was even in 3D.I'm one who likes remakes because more times than not they're actually more original or at least try something different. In fact, I've always said that sequels "remake" the original movie more than the actual remakes. Sadly, there are examples were the films are just downright lazy and that's the case here. This one here should certainly be skipped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad without even comparing it to the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I had set my expectations low enough that when it was over I'd be able to say, "Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be..."I was very wrong.Not only was this the worst remake ever, it was one of the worst movies ever. Period. There is no need to compare it to the original; this one sucks just fine all on its own.Apart from being all flash and no substance - which is what I expected - the flat out absurdities and dumbness-es are too countless to enumerate completely, so I'll just give a few examples: 1. This cinematic gem starts off with our hero family looking at a new house with their realtor. Wherever they lived previously must have been a mansion on millionaire's row because all they do is talk about what a dump the house and neighborhood are, while I'm thinking it's awful darn nice, and better than the houses of most of the people I know. Whatever. During the walk-through it's revealed that the wife is a stay-at-home mom and the husband has just lost his job. Please direct me towards that bank which would give two unemployed people with three kids a mortgage, please. The fact that weird things start happening right then does not deter them from buying the house, however.2. After moving in and lamenting the lack of money and job prospects, the dad goes to the hardware store to get a squirrel trap (don't even ask), and has not one, but two credit cards declined before lucking out with the third one. When he gets home, he has not only the squirrel trap, but a new cell phone for the older daughter, a radio controlled drone for the son, and shiny new earrings for the wife. I wonder just how many credit cards he had stuffed in his wallet. I guess this is why their dinners consist of pizzas and chicken nuggets.3. There is no build up for the poltergeist activity and crap literally starts hitting the wall instantly, which the parents are of course oblivious to.4. The son is a basket case before the events of the movie begin and is stated as being "afraid of everything", yet whenever something goes bump in the night he's the one prowling around the house looking for the source.5. Remember the very cool scene in the original with the tree "grabbing" the son through the window? Not to be outdone by a movie from the 1980s, our wonderful remake takes it a step (more like a mile) further. Not only does the tree branch break through the window, it also reaches across the room, into the hallway, down the stairs, and along another hallway to grab hold of him and drag him all the way back upstairs and outside. When the parents arrive home from wherever the hell they were, the kid's being whipped around at the top of the tree like the Whomping Willow from Harry Potter. At least the parents now know that something is afoot and run inside to find the daughter already yammering on the TV.6. Before you can say "boo!" the mom is calling in the paranormal investigators from the local university. At least in the original there was some pretense that they knew what they were doing, but here one is a boring woman with the personality of an eggplant, another who I honestly don't think had a line in the entire movie (she just fiddles with things in the background), and the third a complete buffoon. The buffoon paraphrases the line from the original where he brags about capturing with stop-motion photography a piano bench rolling across a floor during a 10-hour period. He then goes to sit down and in a millisecond ends up on the floor after the chair whips out from under him and shatters against the wall. The dad deadpans, "did you get that on your time-lapse camera?" (The only thing in the movie I truly enjoyed.) In the very next scene, though, the buffoon is speculating that the family is making everything up as a publicity stunt in order to cash in and get their own reality TV show. It ends up being the son who comes up with the idea of someone going into the closet to get the girl, not our crack team of paranormal investigators.7. Apparently our stellar writing team felt the need to include the Zelda Rubinstein character somehow, although why I have no idea since the cringe-inducing guy with an absurd Irish accent that replaces her - the star of a cheesy Ghost Hunters-like TV show - is useless and does nothing. While he, the father, and the mother are arguing about who's going to go into the closet to get the girl, the son has already gone upstairs and done so. While all this ghostly spookery is going on, the older daughter is too busy being gaga and starstruck over the star of her favorite TV show being in their house to be frightened, upset, or concerned about the supernatural shenanigans taking place. She was more upset when the ghosts made her new cell phone go all wonky.8. This movie marvel ends with our family out shopping for another house (that is one forgiving bank!) and apparently living out of someone's car. I'm not sure who's car it was since the last time we saw theirs it was upside down in the living room.Just in case you think I am exaggerating any of the above for comedic effect, rest assured that I am not. If anything I have undersold just how stupid and absurd this movie is.You have been warned!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad, but could have been much better. ((SPOILER!))</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so first off lets get this right out there, this is not the Freeling family, so if your looking to hear "Stay away from the light Carol Anne!" forget it, this movie is not for you. That being said they took the Basic plot, changed out a lot, kept a few crucial things and you can almost call it a whole new movie which rips off scenes from the original, not exactly a remake. It also has the distinct feel of a movie that was put out to make some new money off an old plot, I feel as though the producers and script writers didn't really have much love for the plot.That being said, it had a lot of potential that for reasons known only to the producers and writers, fell short of the mark in many regards. The most notable is that it has the feel of a very rushed movie! You have about a days worth of activity trying to get to know who these new people are, before all hell breaks loose there is no real slow suspenseful build up before "THEIR HERE!" and the only person who is even remotely skeptical that what is happening is real is only a skeptic for three minutes in the movie. That being said the cast did a very good job portraying their roles, the special effect were fairly well done, and there is still enough of a feel for the original that makes it entertaining. But scary, or suspenseful? I'm afraid not. With the most potent scenes being shown in the previews already, there's just no real "Edge of your seat" moment in it. It was not too bad but with a little more of a runtime, some thought, and just plain love of the original movie in mind, this movie could have been incredible. Instead.....It falls sadly, a bit short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In recent times there has been a surge of dark horror movies and to be a true horror movie fan, that is how we like to see our movies- Dark. This movie is not as dark as a lot of movies in the genre and in recent times. But it still serves the purpose of a moviegoer, to keep the entertained and deliver scares and is also not at all dumb. The plot is true to the original, the Bowen family who move into a new suburban home which is haunted by dark entities which enter because of the little girl. (I won't give away everything if you do decide to watch the movie) The movie uses heavy use of lights and scare tactics which are usually used in such movies, so there is nothing entirely new, but it is executed in such a way that it still makes you gulp. The premise and the atmosphere is scary in a few scenes but once the plot progresses, it turns interesting, which helps the movie and it uses ever opportunity in the movie to scare. however, creating more for the viewer would have worked better. All in all, this movie has good acting, good direction and good special effects, which make the horror feel real. So if you want to watch a horror movie, after a tiring day and not go over the top, then this decent movie is for you. It does it's job of entertainment and breaks into the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of a Classic falls flat and completely disappoints!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Poltergeist directed by Tobe Hooper and produced by Steven Spielberg already had an amazing caliber coming from these two film-makers and they created arguably one of the most disturbing, maybe not scary in the sense as compared with The Exorcist and the like, horror films of all time. It is over 30 years old and it has aged very well, although audiences these days would dismiss it as being dated and cheesy - tastes over the years inevitably change.The original film had great special effects for the time, prior to the invention of CGI which has overshadowed many big budget films these days at the expense of great storytelling. This is the reason people should go to the movies - to be drawn into a movie with a great storyline rather than be dazzled by CGI and soul-less celluloid vehicles. Stories that are intricately woven, characters that make you feel that going to the cinema is an emotional experience rather than a way to pass two hours!Well, the original Poltergeist succeeds brilliantly on this level. The relationship and dynamic between the parents and children, represent a typical suburban family who move into a neighbourhood that was built on a land that was previously a cemetery. The poltergeist centres on little Carol Ann, and the tension builds from the first paranormal experience, catapulting the viewer into the family's experience with the paranormal. There are few jump scenes but the disturbing element is created through tension and the presence of the beast being with Carol Ann. The characters are well developed and the interaction between the parents and paranormal investigators is fully engaging as is the role of Tangina. One really feels the anguish, despair, hurt and loss that the mother feels when Carol Ann has passed over to the other side. The explanation by Tangina that the love between the parents is the bond that is strong enough to withstand the hold of the beast is a wonderful theme of the how they triumph over the evil entities. The emotion of the family and story draws you in and you empathise with their plight.Now for the remake, which should or shouldn't have been done. Did the people who give this 10 stars see the same film as I did? Many films have been re-made and this is not the first one to fall flat, and won't be the last. Hollywood seems to be running out of original ideas, depending on sequels and remakes rather than original films with great story lines. This film should have been written with more substance rather than cheap scares and CGI. The two younger children, Griffin and Madison play their roles very well and are highly engaging. Sam Rockwell does a pretty good job but the mother and sister are just there as little more than family members. The Catholic priest pitches up and never really seems to engage with the family - he just explains what to do and then it happens. The paranormal investigators meet with the family and within the next scene, they've already set up in the house. There is no interaction between the lead investigator and the family of any interest. The movie is far too short, there is no character development and the mentioning of the house built on a cemetery was just mentioned as an after-thought at a dinner party. The original film has an unforgettable scene where Craig T. Nelson's character screams at his boss about the cemetery being moved but not the bodies. In this remake, nothing of the sort.It seems like films are made nowadays to please the masses that have become accustomed to CGI-driven films at the expense of story lines which is sad after so many classic movies were made in the 1970s and 1980s.I would recommend this film as an average horror film that produces a few jump-scares, but no edge-of-your-seat terrifying or disturbing moments. This film was forgotten the moment I left the cinema. True classics stay with you - as the original Poltergeist has. As a remake, I would throw the new film into that closet in the house!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless and unnecessary remake which adds nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Budget and unemployment issue mean that the Bowen family ? Dad Eric, Mom Amy, and kids Kendra, Griffin and Madison ? have to downsize to what appeared to me to be a fairly sizeable house, albeit rather marred by the supernatural manifestations. Things go bump in the night, terrifying already timid son Griffin, and centring on Madison, the youngest. After she is kidnapped by her closet and held prisoner in the TV, the family calls in specialist help.A friend of mine wondered why they only remake successful films ? surely unsuccessful films merit remaking more? And here comes a perfect example to illustrate the folly of remaking successful movies. The 1982 Poltergiest, directed by Tobe Hooper and produced by Steven Spielberg, was an excellent movie. It didn't need remaking. And now along comes a remake. Had the original version never existed, this would have been a perfectly acceptable horror movie. But the original does exist, and this remake brings little new to the table. The main story beats are the same, some of the manifestations are different, but it is essentially the same movie, and not done as well ? despite the best efforts of the cast, it lacks heart.You might enjoy it if you've never seen the original ? heck, you might enjoy it even if you have ? but it's all a bit pointless.And if you're not actually going to do anything worthwhile with the 3D, why bother?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This version of Poltergeist was pretty effective in its way not unlike the original for what it's worth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I review this remake, let me make a few remarks about the original: I was a young teen in '82 when Steven Spielberg had two hit movies out that summer, E.T. and the original Poltergeist. I saw it at a mall theater with my brother and his friend. The screen was not very big so that may partly explain why I remember not being too scared by what was happening on screen. Still, it looked quite effective and was funny as hell part of the time. I saw it three more times on TV and liked it a little more with each showing while recognizing where the real effectiveness was-during scenes where the family were really concerned about little Carol Anne's safety. Anyway, the remake changes much of the structure such as the family just moving in as opposed to the one in the previous movie having already settled in, the teen daughter having more of a participation in the proceedings this time around, and a much different ending. There seem to be a bit more scares with the way things come more quicker at you (perhaps also due to both the 3D images and a much larger screen this time around) and things are explained sooner rather than later as in the original. In summary, this version of Poltergeist was effective in its own way as the original was in its way then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd have to say I wasn't a big fan of this franchise, though I do remember watching the Poltergeist films the 3rd one especially. The film begins with a family who move into a new house in the neighbourhood. Aside from the typical cliché's ranging from the eldest daughter being bitter &amp; the daughter seeing &amp; hearing things along with other cliché's here &amp; there, it was decent enough film. The jump scares was decent enough, though few &amp; far between. But got my friend a good couple of times!The bit I liked the most was the toy clown lunging onto Griffon, that was pretty intense &amp; scary! Unlike other horrors this actually didn't shy away &amp; don't show you what happens this film actually did &amp; it was ace, just like the scene where the father drinks whisky &amp; spits out (what he is manipulated into thinking) is worms &amp; mud! Disgusting but ace! Along with the scene with the drill &amp; the wardrobe that was amazingly done!I thought the ending was abit too far fetched &amp; Sci-Fi like, especially the part where the youngest daughter gets caught into the spirit world &amp; lost &amp; one of the family members has to go in &amp; save her! This was more or less a bit of a rip off of the Insidious films abit but OK for a film that is remaking an original with better effects &amp; editing!It was overall a decent film which I'm giving 8/10 stars for as it was decent &amp; far better than it's original which old people are so fixated on! Though it's usual clichés here &amp; there it was a great film with great effects &amp; scenes which made it a great horror film it was a pretty good remake as a whole &amp; hope for sequels to follow! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the age of 10, I saw the original Poltergeist as a double feature with a James Bond film. Thankfully, 007 helped me forget the terror. This remake is pathetic. I rented it last night hoping for the same. There is no suspense. The story line is the same...sort of. The acting is fair. The effects are Hollywood. At times, I thought this could have been produced as a made for TV scary movie like that on the SyFy channel. It tries to relive the original but loses on many attempts. The tree, they're here, etc. The ending has a weird twist to the original. This is another attempt to cash in on previous successful horror movies by Hollywood. Skip this version and watch the masterpiece from 1982.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Creepy But Just-Decent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've never seen the original 1982 Poltergeist, then this movie may be absolutely freaky for newcomers, but for those who have seen the '82 classic, this remake is both fantastic and awful at the same time. Produced by Sam Raimi and Robert G. Tapert, who gave us The Evil Dead films, this reboot and remake is a lot of the same with a couple new twists. When the Bowen family moves into a new home, they discover that their house is atop a burial ground, and is a sort-of conductor for spirits, and in this case, a poltergeist. From here, they're tormented by evil spirits, and it turns into a devilish battle that Eric (Sam Rockwell), the father, must fight to save his family.The film is largely saved by Rockwell's touching and incredible performance, but there was so much that went wrong. Many of the scares were overplayed or just wanted to be jump-scares, and moments that replicated the original (the infamous bathroom scene) were extremely tame and unimaginative. The visual effects for the most part were believable, and Marc Streitenfeld's score was incredibly haunting and truly brilliant, especially when living up to the masterpiece that Jerry Goldsmith created. Gil Kenan's direction is solid, but the script blows through the material so fast that his vision just doesn't stick.Poltergeist is certainly an admirable effort, but it needed to embrace the original's roots, scare tactics and slow build instead of sticking with recent horror movie "tropes" like jump-scares and minimal story-telling. If the film were fifteen-twenty minutes longer and had a script rewrite, it could have lived up to the original. But it didn't. See this for $5 if you want a theater experience, but don't expect something mind-blowing. Certainly worth a watch, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film had it moments, but was unjustified in its reason to be made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is a remake of the 1982 horror classic. A family moves into a newly developed neighborhood and begins to witness paranormal activity in their home. This family has three children, so I was a little nervous as to how the two youngest ones would perform on screen. In the end the acting is only okay? Sam Rockwell gave my favorite performance, but the little girl was just inconsistent. The little boy had some really good scenes and development, though. There are a couple of really scary moments that tensed me up, but in general I saw most of the scares coming. There are some well shot moments that brought the tension up, but most scares were predictable to the point of boredom. There is also an over-reliance on C.G.I. which always brings the scare factor down. Some of the C.G.I is actually quite poor for a film that was released in 2015. There are even moments of forced humor near the end that deflate almost all the tension that the film was building up. For all remakes I have a small list of reasons that I find are necessary to justify the existence of the films themselves: the film must be a second attempt at a poorly made film, the film must take the original concept and point it in a new direction, or the film must introduce an old idea to a new audience. Let's find out how this film handles these. The original was not poorly made, so number one is invalid. While the original had its problems, it did so much right that most of the flaws can be overlooked. To this day I still remember almost every paranormal scene in the original. This new film also fails at taking the film in a new direction. Almost EVERY SINGLE aspect of the original appears in this one. While there are a few changes that I do think made the plot slightly better and somewhat more believable, there are just as many changes that I feel bring it down. One of these problems with the plot involves how quickly many of the plot points are covered and massive jumps on reasoning are made and never confirmed to progress the plot. It feels like a cliff notes plot of the original so that more time can be spent on the paranormal. This gives me the feeling that writers felt like the audience already knows the plot, so flying through the plot points would prevent the audience from ignoring the it; if that is the case, the film fails number three as well. Therefore I decree (because I have that kind of power) that this film had no reason to be remade other than to make money. Remaking movies is always a gamble, but remaking what is considered by many to be a classic is practically suicide. Every moment that was recreated from the original was not nearly as good or memorable. That is why the original is a classic. If you have not seen the original, watch it instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like remakes, but not this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously? Some people rated it 10 stars? I guess there are "plants" for all movies to get the ratings up.I really enjoy attempted remakes, especially if they were good movies that could be enhanced with more modern technology, CGI and what not. But the plot and the acting have to be there. During much of the movie the actors seemed to be phoning in their lines. Sam Rockwell (the dad of the family), for me, is a hard sell for a caring dad role. His personality exudes pompousness. I will admit Rockwell did have some moments in the movie he almost sold as the character, but doesn't that defeat the purpose of an actor in a movie? If I'm thinking this in a movie that ,"Wow, the actor almost has me sold." I have lost the concept of being in the movie and now am looking at it technically. (A side note: Sam Rockwell was fantastic in The Green Mile) The other actors similarly go through the motions to play their characters except for Jared Harris. Harris is the only actor during the whole movie that subtly stayed completely involved in his character the whole movie.Honestly, the movie was much better at comedic moments than it was at creating suspense or horror. I would even say Poltergeist is worth watching for the comedy than anything else. There are some truly funny moments.Not a good remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another pointless remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is easily comparable to the movie "Quarantine" in the regard that it is a remake that brings nothing new or original to the table. The whole point of a remake is to take a different approach to the same idea. The idea of remaking something is not a horrible one; there are plenty of great remakes out there that either improve upon the original or differ enough to stand on their own. The key to a good remake is diversity. Poltergeist follows the same clichéd template of storytelling that the original film did. The whole film felt tremendously uninspired. The majority of the scares in the movie were jump-scares; there was no build-up and no sense of dread and suspense. The jump-scares were predictable and the addition of so called "scare music" made it even worse. There was nothing unexpected or frightening about the scares. I won't say that the movie was terrible; there were definitely some elements I likes about it and the visual effects weren't bad, but I can never see myself watching it again nor do I recommend it due to the lack of originality, lack of dramatic tension, and overall predictability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst remake ever,watch the Original instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead.Sam Raimi strikes again ruining another classic horror this time not his own. The most terrifying thing about this movie was Jared Harris trying to put a Irish accent on,it was like he was auditioning for Darby o'Gill and the little people. The 2nd most terrifying thing about this movie was Rosemarie DeWitt's hairy pits in the bedroom scene but this could have been down to a lack of money from no one having a job in the family. I mean they looked like they were really struggling,they only had 40+inch hd TV in every one of the rooms in the house except the son's room (because they really don't like him very much),they just bought a pretty big house,have a pretty big car,tablets and of course where would a struggling family be without there iPhones.They possibly could only afford all this by living on chicken nuggets and not buying clothes hence the empty closets. This movie was so bad on so many levels,from Cgi to the story to the acting.You could see Sam Rockwell's pain in making this movie,felt like he didn't want to be in it and who could blame him the characters had no chemistry,they were cold and didn't feel like they cared for one another and didn't seem all that devastated when Madison gets taken,when in the original the first five minutes you can feel how close the family are. I haven't seen this in 3D and glad I didn't as I feel they missed some great opportunities to redo scenes from the original when they show the paranormal investigators the daughters room for the first time and all the toys are floating and spinning in the air,in this one we get a baseball rolling down the hall and comics been built like a house of cards wow. I was shocked to see it cost 66 million to make this for it looked like it was made from a smaller budget then Paranormal Activity. The Cgi effects looked like something from playstation 1 which ruined one of the most memorable scenes from the original,The tree scene looked so cheap and didn't have the intense build up to it,also if you have seen the original you will remember the famous clown scene that was terrifying,well guess what they messed that up too.I knew it could never be as good as the original and did not see the point in remaking it for the original still looks amazing today. But saying that I did not think it would be this bad,it is not just the worst remake ever made but possibly one of the worst movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They knew the notes, but sadly not the music . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very likely that the remake of Poltergeist may be impossible to enjoy on any level. If, like me, you're a connoisseur of the original and look on it with fond memories, this retread will come off as a soulless carbon copy. If you've never seen Steven Spielberg's film, then this will come off as bland and colorless and rather indistinguishable from any other CGI horror movie made these days. In its intent, it sparks all manner of questions of necessity. Why remake good movies? Why not instead ? as the late Gene Siskel once remarked ? remake bad movies and make them better? As with the flat remake of Carrie a few years ago, you get the sense that the filmmakers know the notes but not the music.The original worked because of our investment in the characters. The Freelings felt like a real family, nestled in their suburban cocoon in the midst of the 1980s Reagan-era economic boom. We felt their security and the reality of their comfortable situation, and that made it much more palatable when they found their sanctuary invaded by forces they couldn't explain. The movie took the time to get to know them, we got invested in the housekeeping details and the daily (and nightly) rituals.In the remake, we meet the Bowen family; father Eric (Sam Rockwell), mother Amy (Rosemary DeWitt) and their three kids: Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), a sullen teen who is forever glued to her tablet; middle child Griffin (Kyle Catlett) who is terrified of just about everything; and cherubic six-year old Madison (Kennedi Clements) who makes a habit of talking to things that aren't there. We don't see these people as a family so much as a troupe of actors grouped together to play one. Their lives are spelled out in very sparse details. Eric just lost his job with John Deere, and Amy is a failed writer who wants make time to write her book. That's it. That's all we know about them. They're a family struggling in the midst of Obama-era recession. So, how they're able to afford a new house is a question no one can be bothered to answer. The fact that they are struggling in tough economic times makes their ghost problem feel like insult to injury.It takes less than 20 minutes of screen time before the terrors begin (in the original it took an hour). With the parents out of the house having dinner with friends, Kendra finds corpses popping out of the basement floor while Griffin is whipped around the house by an angry weeping willow, and Madison is lured into a bedroom closet that, up to this point, no one has been able to open. She disappears into the netherworld and Eric and Amy, at a loss for what to do, get help from a rather bland quartet of paranormal investigators, headed by a reality show psychic named Carrigan (Jared Harris, son of Richard). He takes up the role occupied previously by the diminutive spiritualist Tangina Barrons. Where Tangina exuded comfort with a hint of huckstering, Carrigan is a jokey old croke who is forever telling stories about the scares that adorn his body. You know he can get Madison back, but you never feel that tender assurance that Tangina gave to Diane that she could get Carol Ann back. The motivations are gone, and even the mother's heroism is replaced. Rosemary DeWitt does a serviceable job but the mother role in this film has been diminished ? she's not the one who brings the daughter back! The remake feels like a rush through paces we've been over before brought to you by filmmakers who never bothered to understand why they worked in the first place. Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper worked to create a sense of magic and life and energy. That movie was also fun. This one, directed by Gil Keanan (Monster House), feels like a checklist. There's no time for anything, no time for characters, no time to establish tension or mood.The better images of the original are glossed over or thrown out completely. The eerie snowy screen of that old TV set in the original felt like a quiet window into another dimension. Here it has been replaced by a rather bland malfunctioning flatscreen. The clown attack that came in the original's third act comes very early in this one so there's no buildup of tension or terror. Even the house seems dry and dull. The only addition to the remake is that we get to see where the youngest daughter went, but it's not a place of wonder so much as a fake CG zombie nightmare that looks like something George Romero would dream up. Even the ending seems like a misstep. Where the original ended with sadness and loss, this one ends with a punchline.If there's a single word that sums up the remake of Poltergeist it is "banal." This is a dull film, devoid of life or energy. The actors go through the motions of a story that really doesn't merit being repeated. There's nothing to improve upon. Even the special effects feel artificial. There's no wonder or spectacle or magic. Again, why remake his movie? Why not update it. Tell us what is happening to Carol Ann now as she enters her 40s? You know what? Go back and watch the original again. It's probably been a while since you've seen it. This weekend, instead of going to see this chunk of indifference, stay home and watch the original film and get caught up in its spell all over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Poltergeist is a classic.Compared, this "film" bears little to no resemblance to it and everything that made it great, despite trying to.There is a charm about the original. The music is great and is as important to the film as the story. It's also acted well and is believable and you want to invest your time into the characters.This "film" feels hollow... everything from the skimmed over story and the bland flat characters. I left the cinema baffled as to who in the hell decided that this was a good idea and actually decided that once it was shot and edited together that it was a good idea to release it. It's a horror it should have at least left me feeling scared or freaked out instead it left me feeling embarrassed that someone had even tried to remake Poltergeist let alone do it so very very badly. I can honestly say that when you leave the cinema after watching a horror film and the scariest part about it was a f**king squirrel you know that they should have stopped before they started. I for one am sick to death of unoriginal, unimaginative, money grabbing remakes. By remaking poltergeist they were setting themselves up to fail. Why not take inspiration from Poltergeist and do something new. Do not waste your money. Wait for the DVD for 99p on Amazon, if even that. Failing that get the original it's cheaper on Amazon at the minute than the price of a cinema ticket it might be slightly dated but it's a million miles better than this rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although impactful in 1982, the story of an angry poltergeist is now a pretty typical haunted house scenario.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening shot, involving an iPad and a video game, immediately suggests that the now classic 1982 version is getting an update ? at least in technology. And with the subsequent appearances of cell phones, GPS trackers, and a drone, it's evident that advanced technology plays a part in retrofitting this archetypal haunted house flick. But, outside of a few modernized visuals (including flashier computer graphics), there's really nothing new or fresh or even frightening about this tragically familiar ghost movie.Amy Bowen (Rosemarie DeWitt), a writer, and her husband Eric (Sam Rockwell), a John Deere corporate offices employee, relocate to a pleasant little suburban home to start a new chapter in their life. Their three children - teenaged Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), middle child Griffin (Kyle Catlett), and tiny young Maddy (Kennedi Clements) - aren't enthusiastic about the move, but they're resigned to its inevitability. After some brief pleasantries with the real estate agent, Maddy kicks things off by eerily talking to something ? or someone ? in her tightly shut closet.Griffin is the most uncertain about his new environment, especially since he's relegated to the attic, where an enormous tree's branches dangle ominously over a skylight. It doesn't help that he's afraid of just about everything ("Some kids are just nervous"), from the creeks of the old house settling to a mild rainstorm. But his fears become all too relevant when enraged ghosts begin creating electric shocks, flickering lights, and static interference on the television set? as well as controlling the movements of creepy clown dolls that were stashed away in an upstairs nook."There's nothing to be afraid of." Although impactful in 1982, the story of an angry poltergeist is now a pretty typical haunted house scenario. The slow build to greater acts of paranormal disorder, the nerve-jangling music, the loud noises, and the leisurely walks down empty hallways by isolated individuals have all become standard elements of such projects. And the jump scares, always arriving in the most predictable manner (just after a second or two of total calm), further cheapen the potential for genuinely skin-crawling notions. Here, the dialogue ? while comparatively generic and expected as a horror movie trope ? is noticeably sillier, as writer David Lindsay-Abaire and director Gil Kenan attempt to pay homage to the somewhat family-friendly tone of Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper's original (one of those older PG films that would have been PG-13 if the rating existed). It's particularly troubling that believable, or at least sincere, exchanges couldn't be crafted, especially since innovation in the storyline never seems like a concern.Setting the perspective from that of children makes the happenings slightly more frightening (or so Spielberg believed from his numerous attempts at the gimmick), coupled with the adults' natural reluctance to listen to youngsters' wild ramblings about extrasensory occurrences. But since this remake feels designed for juvenile audiences, chiefly with its avoidance of bloodshed, its frequent humor (provided even by the Department of Paranormal Research members, who should be taking this material more seriously than anyone else), and its sporadic sense of adventure, there's very little scariness (or true thrills) to be found. When Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris), the reality TV star of "Haunted House Cleaners," arrives like Father Merrin (from "The Exorcist") for a showdown with an accustomed enemy, he instead has more in common with John Goodman's plucky exterminator from "Arachnophobia," who was entirely comic relief.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist, the original, is one of my favourite films of all time but now is not the time to wax lyrical about that great piece of cinema creativity. So onto the remake, I hoped I would be pleasantly surprised but sadly no pleasant surprised followed, more twitches of annoyance tailed by the urge to hit the "off" switch and drop kick the person who OK'd this remake.The remake essentially comes without any soul, which may be apt considering the storyline but is a major issue and consequently results in a failure to draw in the viewer. I like Sam Rockwell but his performance in this film is best forgotten. The script is weak which clearly didn't help the actors and the pacing adds to a whole feeling of ? rush it out and make some quick returns before anyone realises the car crash unfolding.There is nothing to gain by watching this remake only 93 minutes lost.Put bluntly ? Poltergeist (2015) is a comedy compared to the original and not a very funny comedy at that.</fullReview>

The ghosts kidnapped the younger daughter, Madison, and took her to the other side, leaving the family scrambling desperately to find ways to get her back.As a remake, this movie doesn't hold a flicker of light to the original. Other than the mildly creepy clown scenes, much of the ghost elements were un-scary - they were just "thrown in" and appeared almost all at once, not leaving any room for build-up suspense or tension.The acting was absolutely atrocious: Sam Rockwell (Eric Bowen) appeared so emotionless he looked like he doesn't have a clue what's going on; Saxon Sharbino portrayed like the typical spoiled and disrespectful teenage-girl whom you wish you could just smack around for her annoying behavior; and Kennedi Clements as the ghost-kidnapped Madison is not way near as good as the late Heather O'Rourke as Carol Anne (what's up with her copying her sister's swear words every time she says it?). Also, those ghost-catchers couldn't act to save their lives - Jane Adams looked like a deer in the headlights all the time; Nicholas Braun tried too hard to be funny (failed) in his supposedly electronics-geek, nerd-type role; and Jared Harris, in Zelda Rubinstein's Tangina role in the original, acted abnormal himself and didn't have that "ghostbusting" instinct. Only Kyle Catlett as the brother had displayed any sort of connection with his character.The plot itself was boring, executed poorly with no intrigue, suspense and drama and consumed by the cast who had no emotion connection and no chemistry. There was no display of concern, fear or anxiety over the ghost situation. Above all, it's one of the worst remakes I have ever seen.Grade F</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raimi is slowly tarnishing a wonderful career.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All seems well for Eric Bowen, wife Amy, and their three children as they move into their new house in the suburbs of Illinois. But soon after settling into there new home, youngest daughter Maddy begins talking to an imaginary friend, or so the family thinks. It's not long before sinister spirits wreak havoc in the home, holding Maddy captive and forcing the parents to consult a team of parapsychologists who engage the supernatural entities in a battle for the girl's freedom, and to make the 3D surcharge see worth it......The law of averages should teach us now that remakes, especially ones of much loved horror movies, rarely work, and once again this is no exception.The first movie was groundbreaking for many a reason. In the US, it was a PG, and it had the inclusion of sniping at the Reagan era, and the fact that TV and home entertainment was taking over the nuclear family household, hence Carol-Ann literally being taken over by the TV.The remake has nothing like that in its narrative to offer, other than a nod to gadgets and reality TV, it's just another cash in on a well known name with very little character development, favouring the effects heavy final act.If it wasn't for Rockwells performance, this would be unwatchable, his recently unemployed Eric is the soul of the film, and he's as good as ever, a performance that doesn't belong in hokey rubbish like this.Jared Harris provides the High Concept element of the film, and the 3D is basically ripping off Joe Dantes The Hole from 2010.With remakes like this, Raimi is continuing to detach himself from the exciting auteur that he was in the eighties and nineties, and slowly becoming just another greedy cog in the Hollywood cash machine.One to avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Went Wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I'm one of those who totally loved the original Poltereist. I saw it when I was 6-7 years old, and it both scared me to pieces and stuck with me ever since. However, I don't think it's my attachment to the original that made me feel as though this bland remake was... Lackluster. The 80's film simply had more heart. More care went into the performances. The buildup and anticipation of Carol Ann's disappearance was prominent. And of course, that little score (still gets stuck in my head. Creepy)! But while sitting through the 2015 version, I just felt nothing; not scared, not intrigued, not really into it, and hardly rooting for the characters I rooted for during the original. I mean, it wasn't an AWFUL movie. It just lacked feeling, and was very anticlimactic. But unnecessarily remaking something so classic and barely putting any love into it? Not worth the time. I can name several aspects of the original that left me scared: The tree. The clown. The chairs. The burial ground. The realness of the actor's "fear" portrayed on screen. With this new Poltergeist, everything just seemed to fall short. Not memorable or life-changing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atrocious!! SPOILERS..if you can call it that!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been born in 1975, my childhood was aglow with the abundance of creativity that was the 80's. Ever since I could remember, the local video store was an Aladdin's Cave of artwork plastered on every wall with movie posters and titles stacked neatly along the shelves. Every Thursday my mother would take me there after school and treat me to a movie night. I recall clearly the first time I opened the case and saw the label POLTERGEIST on the tape. I was eight years old. "What's a Poltergeist?" I asked. From that night Poltergeist has remained one of my favorites. I think I've owned it in one form or another from adolescence. Fast forward to last night. Not expecting much, I sat in the cinema as the credits rolled on the remake, the first gimmicky credit sequence with the title sprawled in CGI over a grassy field. Not impressed. What happened to the all-American suburbia, the sense of belonging, what happened to the glorious musical queues from Jerry Goldsmith's score, it wasn't there. This I knew was going to be very by the numbers. A quick bums on seats revival of a film that got it right first time. Before I get into how poor the acting and the script were, let me assure anyone that is still itching to see this, don't waste your hard-earned money. You're better than this! A film that is remade purely to raise a few bucks for the studio and does little to update the story serves only one purpose and that is to evoke comparisons. We're currently frozen in a stale era of cheaply produced everything where no-one is putting a fingerprint of the evolution of both music and movies. The music industry to me is dead. My beloved CD collection hails back to a time where artist were worshiped like idols, could play any instrument, and held their mystique. Movies now are no different, with the exception of ever popular franchises like Bond and Star Wars. Very few of the truly great directors remain. Where would we be without Ridley Scott, David Fincher, James Cameron and the likes? The new Terminator movie looks interesting but would Arnie believe thirty years ago that he'd still be a Terminator? Most likely he'd scoff at the idea. Yet here we are, still trying to squeeze the paste from the tube as if the last creative juices have dried up. As for our film, it seems the screenwriter has just highlighted some of the key elements form the first film, particularly the dialogue, regurgitated it and the director has spent the production saying, "yeah, that'll do!" Anyone who dares to take on a remake of a Spielberg movie, beware, you'll fail. When Maddie disappears, how on earth did the parents, who let's not forget had no concept of the ghosts in their house at this point deduce that their solution was in the hands of ghost hunters? The actress who played the mother barely shed a tear the whole film. Jobeth Williams anyone??? The ghost hunter chap arrives and spews the same lines as Zelda Rubenstein for a few minutes and TEN minutes later the girl is saved. His final line in the film capped it for me. As he's being pulled into the ghost world, he turns to his ex and shouts "I have a job to do!" I laughed uncontrollably. Sam Rockwell clearly isn't interested and this is a real low for a guy who is a superb actor. I felt embarrassed for him actually.Oh I could go on but if you have any standards at all and are not easily impressed by the churn of rehashes, remakes and Melissa McCarthy movies, you'll understand what I'm talking about!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I haven't seen the original Poltergeist, to my understanding it was a landmark horror movie, a movie that was revolutionary at the time. Unfortunately, the 2015 remake is anything but that. 2015 Poltergeist uses a collection of generic and cliché scares and feels content relying on lazy, overdone techniques, such as jump scares. The movie has almost no tension at all and the pacing is fairly awful. In terms of writing and acting, the actors are functional at best and the dialogue is often very boring. For those who have seen the original and are fans of it, there might be some nostalgic value to be found here, but otherwise I'd recommend skipping this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know a lot of people will be trashing this film because it's not as good as the original. But the simple fact is, it's bad all on it's own, regardless of the fact that it's a remake. The scares are cheap. A lot of the plot doesn't make sense. For example, we learn early on that both parents are unemployed. Yet somehow, they can still purchase a four bedroom home. Really? Clearly, the filmmakers were trying to take the film away from the original housing boom of the first Poltergeist and into our current post-recession world. This is not done in an effective way. I think you could also argue that certain aspects of post 9/11 culture are present. For example, the spirit world is saved by a small drone like toy. The family used it to see into the spirit world. There was also a much larger presence of technology used to monitor the dead. It all seemed a bit militant to me. Some sort of commentary on the current military industrial complex? Another huge flaw is the constant use of CGI. The first film is so terrifying because the audience can't see the world that the dead inhabit. The family is terrified, because they don't know where their little girl is. But we see the computer rendered version here, completely eliminating any chance of suspense. I wish that Hollywood would figure out that the audience cares about more than graphics. The film also took a weird turn with the young son. Somehow, it became a coming of age story for him. The parents are strangely absent in some scenes.I gave this a 4/10, and in some ways I think I'm being a bit generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Hollywood,Stop with the disappointing remakes to make a quick buck. Be original and use your own imagination. Geesh! Enough is enough. This film was disappointing and continues to support the idea that Hollywood is scrounging for business. What happened to the good ole days with original ideas and never before seen scenes on the big screen? This movie was predictable, unoriginal and definitely PG-13 worthy....maybe even PG. My advice: rent the original. I fell asleep for about 15 minutes of the movie. Maybe I missed the 3 out of 5 stars for that period of time. The acting was mediocre and the skull faced ghosts were rip offs from The Mummy. The Mummy graphics were actually better. Please do us all a favor....recapture your imagination and do some real writing and directing for your next horror flick.Sincerely, Mr. Might-never-pay-for-a movie-again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should say right off that I was never a fan of the original Poltergeist. It's got an inconsistent mood and pacing that annoyed me even as a kid. The potential was there but Spielberg just couldn't keep his schmaltzy paws off of it. The effects are way too cute and charming, the music too 'epic'. This new one doesn't make it all better. If anything I think it adheres far to closely to the original for its own good. What it DOES improve on is that it gets right to the point and takes a stance that doesn't waver. This haunting is never cute or fun or any of the other false notes the original plucked at... the core story is about a child in danger from supernatural forces and what is done to save her. As expected there are plenty of nods to the original. Similar events come in different order. I MUCH preferred the 'scary clown' and 'scary tree' sequences this time around. All in all this version felt more focused... more consistent. It's still not very scary, it's a spooky movie for kids, but it does create some atmosphere and stray to far from its intended purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Memorial Day weekend gang and you know what that means. Right, a horror movie?or maybe you weren't thinking that at all. Well while most of the public is out celebrating by grilling and toasting those they remember, this reviewer is hitting the theater for more reviews. This review we take a stroll down remake lane as we hit Poltergeist, the first scare movie of the summer. Can the remake live up to the classic? Let's find out. From the trailers, Poltergeist promises some terrifying moments in the dark that hold promise for making you fear what bumps in the night. This movie will not disappoint, as it provides a setting that indeed can bring some tingles to your spine. At first the setting of the house offers little threat, a few incidents happening in the day time might make you jump, but for the most part offer a safe relief from the terrors at hand. Once night hits and the power conveniently goes out, that is where the audience begins to jump. Poltergeist plays off one's fear of the dark, using the shadows to build anticipation, suspense, and terror at what our invisible "friends" have in store. It's creepy, the camera work and sound editing making you feel abandoned in the house aside from kids who aren't necessarily equipped to bust ghosts. Aside from the dark, the design team has crafted some haunting dolls that are perhaps the scariest part with their soulless eyes and smiles. The creeps aren't the only ploy they have in their bag though. Poltergeist also has plenty jump at you moments, where things suddenly jump out at you after the predictable build up. . The story of this movie is also not too bad, essentially being the same movie with up to date graphics and a slight "romantic" twist. Is there anything new? One is some new scare ploy, primarily the clowns that were not in the 80's version, that kind of work. Second is the integrating modern technology as a media for the ghosts to use such as iphones and ipads that are generation is accustomed too. Third is the increase in special effects that help bring the horror to life, though sometimes the effects are cheesy and overflashy. Unfortunately these things aren't the most realistic looking and the 3-D perspective is really unnecessary and added very little to the tale. So let's talk negatives of this Poltergeist. For one thing there isn't a lot of originality to this film. It's always great in theory to retell a classic tale, but some unique twists are often required to make the film worthwhile. This installment didn't have much of that, and while the graphics were more impressive, it really didn't add the edge I was hoping to see. The modern technology was cool, and the clowns were scary, but HBO could do the same thing and saved us the trouble of stale popcorn. In addition the scares weren't as terrifying as I had hoped. Yes I like creepy, but the cheesiness of some of the scares offset that factor and actually made it more a loud, light show than actual terror. In terms of acting, it wasn't half bad, but wasn't connected to the characters in this film. The mom and dad were okay in this film, a little too depressed and inconsistent for my tastes, and the oldest daughter was just annoying to me. Looking at the paranormal team, they were okay as well, but I held no loyalty to most of them, and found them rather unnecessary for most of the movie. Even the ghosts lost the edge they held in the first rendition, becoming nothing more than a collection of CGI sprites, instead of being lead by the entity known as the Beast. The exception to the lackluster characters might be the two youngest kids, the boy in particular being the person I took the most interest in. He kept the group together and kept the plot going for most of the movie as he tried to uncover the terror within. Without the tie to the family in this film, I wasn't quite at the edge of my seat as I had hoped to be. Poltergeist is certainly a decent remake that sticks to the original plot and scare tactics that you remember. Despite the superficial scare factor of this movie, I can't really recommend a trip to theater for this one. After all with little originality, some overdone special effects, and a lack of suspense there isn't much to lure you into the theater on this one. Overall my scores are:Horror: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember when audiences were satiated with the foreplay of story telling? Audiences today want all the action right up front, with no substance what so ever, or at least that's what the studios would have you believe.This remake is awful in every sense of the word. No drama, no tension, no emotion, no story telling. This throws everything worthy from the original movie into the trash, and goes right for the 'jump scare'... Bad acting, bad soundtrack, and really bad CGI make this movie a complete waste of good popcorn.I'm sure the teens of the new MTV generation will love it, and THIS will be the version that every one will refer to for eons to come, which is too bad, because the original will always be the better version by far.Avoid this movie like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nope. Not even close. The characters are pale colorless versions of the originals lacking any depth or spark and screaming, bratty children are not entertaining on either side of the screen. The story line is watered down and lacks the nuances that made the original a great movie. The suspense was nonexistent; the few scares there were relied on cheesy shock scenes rather than good film making. The few plot points that weren't watered down or eliminated entirely were exaggerated to ludicrous levels. The music was utterly forgettable and the obvious attempts to update the setting for 21st century viewers were trite and cliché. If you want to see this movie the way it was meant to be seen, rent the original. This one doesn't hold a candle to it. Don't waste your time or money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist plays it's remake so safe, there's barely a point in making this. Just watch the 1982 classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's great about the movies is that every genre can be cross generational. With every Matrix movie for the adults, there is a Lego Movie that kids and families can enjoy together. There's plenty of options; for fantasy, there's Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, for westerns, there's True Grit and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West and even for the romance, there's Love Story and Little Manhattan. There's no reason for the kids to get left out of a fantastic story without feeling like you simply talking down on them. The one genre that seems to have more trouble is the horror genre. What funny is that with horror, movies like Monster House and The Witches are not just good, but are even scarier then most horror movies reserved for adults. These prove that you can work in the little ones into the horror genre without giving them something too grotesque or over the line. The best example is the 1982 classic, Poltergeist. Produced by Steven Spielberg, it centered around a family buying a house that was intruded by an evil entity that could communicate with a girl through the TV. It was scary, entertaining, and was a constant repeat at the slumber parties I attended in elementary school. So why remake Poltergeist?Eric (played by Sam Rockwell) and Amy Bowen (played by Rosemarie DeWitt) move to find more opportunities after their laid off from their jobs. They manage to find an older home within their price range and immediately move in with their three children, teenager Kendra, middle boy Griffin, and their youngest daughter, Madison. The two younger ones sense another force in the home when they discover that their hair sticks up when they touch a closet doorknob. Madison gets an invisible friend that communicates with her through the families LED television. Eric later discovers that tract of homes was built on an old graveyard. Like most horror movies, the adults don't sense anything wrong and play off their kid's fears as having a wild imagination. During a ghost experience when Kendra's phone acts up and Griffins clown toy attacks him, Madison is taken away via closet to the spirit world. The parents decide to get in contact with officials at a local university to study the phenomenon. The crew is spooked, but do everything they can to get Madison back, even calling in Carrigan Burke, a ghost specialist who has his own reality show. The purpose of a remake is to take the problems of the previous film and fix them to make the product even better. And there's the immediate problem with Poltergeist; the original film was fantastic enough that there is nothing to improve on. This 2015 update seems to know this and sticks close, playing the same story and the same spooks. Taking the original out of the picture, Poltergeist doesn't even manage to stick out enough to take itself away from some of the other recent ghost movies like The Conjuring and Insidious. The best thing I can say about this is that the acting's good. Sam Rockwell is always fun to watch and he seems to be having fun with this ghost story. Even some of the scares got a jolt out of me (the new ones at least), but when you see past scares like the clown and trees, your only saying, "we know it's coming. Just happen already!".While it is a close remake, the film does try to change it up (letting some other family members go through the paranormal events and a different ending), but the changes fail to justify the need to make something that can acquired on Netflix. I'll give this four ghost detection kits out of ten. The biggest crime this movie pulls is going for a PG-13 rating. The previous PG rating allowed kids to feel like they were getting a genuine scary movie without going against their parents. The PG-13 pretty much tells families that the kids should probably stay home. Maybe you should avoid this ghost and stay home as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A completely copy cat remake, but adds absolutely nothing new.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Poltergeist' is a remake of the 1982 possession/horror movie directed by Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre). It stars Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Rosemarie DeWitt (Cinderella Man), Jarred Harris (Lincoln) and Jane Adams (Eternal Sunshine) and is directed by Gil Kenan (City of Ember).The problem with most remakes these days, especially those of the horror genre, is that they try to stick as close to the original source material as they possibly can. The 1996 Psycho remake starring Vince Vaughn is a great example of this. A movie that is a shot for shot, word for word remake of a classic adds absolutely nothing new to the viewing experience. You're essentially just watching the same movie but not as well shot and terrible performances around the board. It adds no originality whatsoever, and the worst thing about it is that it makes it really boring.Poltergeist is kind of the same thing. It isn't a shot for shot, word for word remake, but it is essentially the same movie. The director did absolutely nothing to make it any different from the original. The same types of scenes happen to the children while the parents are out of the house. The story unfolds exactly as it does in the original. I mean sure he slightly tweaks a few things visually with the advances SFX of modern cinema. Plus adding a few new scenes and leaving some of the older ones out, but that's about it. Everything else story wise is exactly the same thing. Similar to the 'Carrie' remake. If you've seen that you probably understand what i'm talking about.The Evil dead as another example, is a remake that acknowledges the original but adds its own flavor to it. The style of that movie was vastly different to the original. It's story is similar as you expect, but nothing happens in this movie the way it does in the 1981 original. The director understood the movie but made it a different way. Which is, n my opinion, a more respectable way. You're probably thinking, "It's good that it sticks to the original, that way it doesn't ruin it". No. That's exactly what DOES ruin it. You literally might as well stay at home and watch the original. You'd save yourself a fair amount of money, and you'd basically be watching the new one anyway.Another thing about copying the movie to an exact, is that what this movie is, is basically just makes the whole film one giant horror movie cliché. It's almost just a parody of itself in that it doesn't realize that to succeed it must be different. Surprisingly enough, while littered with clichés, there aren't THAT many jump scares which is always nice to see in a modern horror movie. Pretty much every jump scare from this film is what you see in the trailer. Which is always a thumbs up.It's nice to see that Sam Rockwell was at least great in the movie, his acting ability is always a driving force for his lesser quality movies. There was also some jokes threw in there from time to time, none of which were funny like. Always a reflection of terrible writing, which is disappointing as David Lindsay-Abaire has shown himself in the past to be a pretty competent writer.Overall. If I was you I would just stay home and watch the original. It's scarier, less boring and stale and adds more chills to ones viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure what I have to say could be considered spoilers but I've marked it as such anyway.I have to say that this film was a bit of a let down. Why I had greater hopes I'm not sure but I did. Anyway, this remake doesn't have any of the depth, charm or creepiness of the original and feels very rushed. As seems to be the case with all 'horror' films these days, the characters are hollow and act in ways which real people just wouldn't. Even the way the children are portrayed is not realistic (or maybe it is for American children). The children end up being complete liabilities and by the end of the movie I was on the side of the 'poltergeists' and was thinking 'just kill them all for goodness sake!'. The adults are two dimensional.Case in point. I know for a fact that if my children heard voices coming from the closet or the TV they would tell me immediately. If my children found creepy clown dolls and were frightened of them then I would simply dispose of them that very day at the local tip. I could go on and on.For once I'd like a horror movie where the adults act like real people would and the children as children would. Of course this would make for a much darker movie but one that is much more enjoyable. It is obvious the writers were clueless and did zero research into how people actually behave in moments of extreme fear and stress.If you are a fan of the original then my advise is to give this one a wide berth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap "Scares" and No Feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 99.9% sure I wouldn't have liked this movie even if I had never seen the original. The original Poltergeist may have been an 80's movie with 80's special effects, but it had something this movie TOTALLY lacked - feeling.Darn it, I wanted so badly to review this movie on it's own merits but unfortunately it HAS none. I suppose that if I had been going in blind, I would have to say that the special effects were adequate and that the movie provided a couple of creepy moments. But nothing that would have kept me up at night, unlike the original. And I would never want to see it again, unlike the original.Since I have seen the original, it is impossible to review the new one without comparisons. The original movie scares and moves me to this day. The reason: I actually cared about the Freeling family. The characters are developed well, and genuinely likable. No matter how many times I watch it, I always tear up with JoBeth Williams in the living room scene where Carol Anne passes through her. The Bowens, on the other hand, ugh. What can I say. At most, I was indifferent to them. There's a scene where Sam Rockwell tears up and I burst out laughing. It was so INCREDIBLY cheesy. They tried so hard with the clowns, and don't get me started on the demonic squirrel (yes, I am not making this up, there was actually a demonic squirrel - a Sam Raimi touch I'm sure).Honestly, this movie was barely scary, poorly acted, and unevocative. Even compared to other contemporary horror offerings it would have sucked. It pains me to hate it so much, because I hoped for something a little more from Sam Raimi (Evil Dead), Steven Spielberg (I don't even have to point out what he's come out with in the past), and Sam Rockwell. Bottom line: BLEAHHH! I want the last couple of hours of my life back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dismal failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have never seen the 1982 gem, this movie will be just another ghost story laden with cheap CGI effects. For those who have seen, or grew up with the original movie, this will be a major disappointment. I don't get why they had to take a movie that was ahead of its time and ruin it.OK, first the similarities, well there's the title and the scary tree that comes to life, the toy clown, the closet, the old graves, but sadly not much else, and I felt bored through most of this. Maybe movie goers are just used to seeing this sort of thing and are too desensitized for a movie like this to have any shock value any more. Since 1982 there have been a million ghost and haunted house movies and then there's the advent of the Paranormal Activity movies, so haunted houses just don't shock or wow audiences like they used to.The special effects in the original were ground breaking for their day and still hold up even today. Special effects wizards had to practically develop new technologies as they went, to try and create what was in the script and make it believable on screen. Now all you need is a few computer techs and you can make anything look cheap and nasty and this remake or re-imagining has that in spades.The premise is almost the same, father, mother and 3 kids, (although no dog, no canary and no gold fish), and for some reason, all of their names are different, (I couldn't understand that at all). The house is just a bland 2 story, nondescript suburban home and the 2 youngest kids are just precocious little brats in my opinion. The way the youngest girl starts communicating with the spirits, gets taken and then speaks through the TV has none of the creepiness of the original. There's no swimming pool full of skeletons, no freaky dining room chairs, and what was great about the original is that the movie was virtually in 2 parts; the abduction, the rescue and then a kind of anti- climax premature "this house is clean" hubris, before the spirits really let fly and set about getting their revenge and swallowing the house. This new version had none of that, there was no real build up, no tension, no interesting strange happenings that all seem so innocent at first yet gradually turn malevolent, no panache, no atmosphere and no real sense of what it was trying to achieve. The whole movie just seemed rushed as if all the actors, and I use that term loosely, just wanted this stupidity to be over. There is the same storyline that the whole area is built over an old cemetery, but the way it was revealed in the original was well after the youngest daughter had been abducted and the family had already endured a nightmare time. In this version the cemetery reference is revealed during a dinner party and it's spoken about as if it's common knowledge, and not the cost-cutting bureaucratic cover-up of the original. The ending of the original confirmed that only the headstones were removed when the old graves erupted out of the ground; we aren't so lucky for such awesome scenes in this load of crap. Even the now classic original movie quote such as "there here" is spoken without any soul or any real feeling of foreboding. The discussion of the cemetery removal is not delivered with the same sense and feeling of dread as in the original but more like a humorous anecdote. Even the toy clown in this was just done so poorly. This clown already looked evil and it didn't belong to the kids, it was found in the house. In the original it was made scary due to the lightning effects and it's constant comical grin and wild hair, but then it actually turned evil looking and freaked out audiences for real. And it wasn't really used to full effect anyway, no sooner had it made its appearance and did its thing, it was over without too much fuss.So what can one really take from this? As I said, if you've never seen the original, and I strongly suggest that you do, this won't mean anything to anyone; It'll be just another ghost story, but if you grew up in the eighties and heard all about the poltergeist curse that allegedly plagued the original actors, crew and the set, then this latest offering will come as a huge disappointment. It's a shame too as modern effects shouldn't detract the essence from a movie but these days they quite often do. The main thing that made the original work so well was that the family were successful, relatively happy and stable. But that all changed as they were gradually being ripped apart by an evil force. This version has this modern stereotypical struggling family that have moved into a new home, the father has been laid off, the mother is a struggling yet allegedly brilliant writer and the kids are dysfunctional. So why am I supposed to care about these characters?There is no real reason to sit through this version and waste 90 or so minutes of your life only to feel disappointed at the end. This is just plain bad in every sense and they dared call it Poltergeist?! Go and watch the 1982 version, be entertained by a proper ghost story and see how real special effects are supposed to be done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so this is my first review. just saw the new poltergeist movie yesterday. i am a huge fan of the original so i was kind of excited for this one. this new film did 'some' of the same things as the original except the emotion between parents and their children. it lacked heart. it was far too humorous for me as well. it was entertaining but nothing i would watch again. i just couldn't believe the acting, it was too phony for me. i find myself not liking remakes, but for some reason i always end up seeing them. after this film however....i might just have to change that. one thing i will say is that i liked the son in this film a lot more than the other. he (for me) made the film and he was the only character i found myself rooting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the original classic from 1982 &amp; you like light hearted family entertainment, then you might enjoy this movie. However I highly recommend not bothering with this crappy so called remake, &amp; finding a copy of the classic.Honestly, I was looking forward to seeing what they would do with this movie with today's technology, but was left so disappointed by the lack-lustre attempt at horror.It seemed very fast paced &amp; a lot of the great scenes from the original were missing from this rehash of the movie. Yes the storyline was similar &amp; they tried to stay true but I don't feel that the scenes of the inner dark space where the little girl was left waiting, trying to get out which seemed to be the most cgi part of the movie was worthy of me wasting 100 minutes of my time watching it.As an avid fan of the original, this movie left me feeling totally disappointed.The usual father who seemed uninterested is getting old &amp; what happened to all the fun Poltergeist activity that the original movie had??? What happened to the scenes that made kids want to look under their beds before they went to sleep? Totally boring &amp; disappointing. If they can't be bothered improving or trying when doing a remake, they should simply leave the classics alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this horror or comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of late I have found I am beginning to understand what true horror is. It inspires, invokes and makes us feel fear naturally. Not through the use of cliché jump scares. So of course this film gives us the worst of horror. This film is a hot mess of clichés, and idiotic parents. Even the female little girl was bland and had no real character of her own. If this was a Netflix horror I would give this pass, but since it is a theatrical horror it should be judged like that. You can tell this film didn't even try I have never watched the original film, but I know Steven Spielberg did way better than this. And yes maybe it wasn't going to be as good, but it at least could have tried. This was just lazy. It was lazy acting, lazy performance, and a lazy story muddled together by a bunch of bad cgi effects. Don't SEE THIS FILM!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's here... and it sucksThe story is about a contemporary re-imagination of a suburban family dealing with a series of unexplained phenomena revolving around their youngest daughter. When the restless spirits get more and more violent, they call on outside help, not knowing just how dangerous things are going to get.I still have no idea why they did a remake on Poltergeist and why Hollywood keeps making remakes in the first place. These just no point and it anyone's me that these people think they can top the original but always fail because you can't top the original unless your John Carpenter and you made The Thing then yeah good job you somehow top the original. But I also curious of how this was going to turn, I mean Hollywood must have learned from they mistakes by now by not adding any stupid CG monsters or loud jump scares. After seeing the movie I'm still not impressed.The only good thing in this movie was Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt and Jared Harris. Those three were the only good actors in the movie and at least they tried to give a some what of a good performance, they tried they best and I can give them that. But I still have no idea why they here in the first place, maybe it's money or they got force to do it, I don't know maybe it's just the money and if that's the case these three acted they ass off to get that paycheck.The movie itself has some creative scares or creepy moments I like to call it. When I mean some I really do mean some of the scares in the movie, which is kind of surprising that must remakes normally just suck all the way. Gil Kenan directed this movie and he's also the same guy who did Monster House and that movie itself had it's creepy moments and it also involves a possessed house and I think some of the creativity that Gil Kenan had went into this movie.I've seen many horror remakes that are much much worse then this. At least this one tried a little hard from most remakes, because a lot of horror remakes today are just so freaking lazy and they don't put any effort at all in they movies and it just comes off as crapping on the original.Now for the problems and these a lot to bring up: There is way way too much cgi in the movie I mean Hollywood horror movie cliché bad. These a scene in this movie where a cg squirrel jumps out the wardrobe (like a jump scare) and the way it ran around and how it looked just made me put my hands smack down on my face with pure disappointment of what I just saw. And that's not all, these other scenes where it involves CG with the demon ghost and other object's trying to kill them. People in Hollywood if you see this review (Somehow) stop making scary things into cgi crap, it's not scary it just make you look cheap. Go back to old school practical effect's with make-up and hairstyle in horror movies, at least it's actually there and it doesn't look like a crappy looking computer bug.Every advertisement for this movie has been for the f**king clown. It doesn't really scare me anymore because everywhere I go I see a billboard advertisement and you know what's on there? this movie with the clown facing us, I mean everywhere I go I see the damn thing and it's not even creepy anymore, it's just annoying how it's everywhere and how they showing the clown too much. I mean is that the way the film makers behind this movie think that the clown is going to make me run out of my way to see this movie, thank god we got online piracy because I'm paying to this a horror remake and that clown isn't going to fool me, I watched it for free so ha. Yeah you can saw it worked as I have seen the movie and reviewing it as I speak, but let's not forget I sawed it online for FREE and didn't pay to see it, that's why it's number 4 on this week box office.The child actors in the movie are not very good. I know it may seem a bit mean for me saying that the kids in the movie are poor actors but again let's not forget here that we have seen great performance from child actors in past horror movies so that proves that some children can act in horror movies, but here it seems like the producer's wanted they kids in the movie to make money and get to they children famous = more money. The little girl in the movie of course plays with the ghost demons and here's the thing in these kind of movies, what's up with these kids not once getting a bit freaked out over this I mean kids will cry or get scared over anything that's not human. The two movies that I think of that did it realistically was in The Babadook and The Conjuring were the kids got pure scared of this thing and not once played with it.The movie overall doesn't do anything new with it's character's, it's story or anything really. I bet this remake will be forgotten at the end of the year, unless they do a squeal (which I hope doesn't happening).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was anticipating a scary movie that rivaled the original, but I was extremely disappointed. I didn't know whether it was meant to be a comedy, a low-budget horror movie or both. It failed by all accounts. Quality was greatly lacking in every aspect of this movie. The acting was absolutely terrible, the old and badly redone storyline was lame, and with the exception of a few scenes that were supposed to make viewers jump, it wasn't scary. I'm glad that I didn't spring for the extra $8 (for two tickets) to see it in 3-D. I was happy when it was over! I wish that I had checked ratings first. If you want to be scared, this won't do it. However, I did find myself chuckling a few times at the ridiculousness of supposedly frightening scenes. The two-out-of-ten rating that I gave this movie was generous. I would recommend seeing something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I liked about the original, directed by Spielberg, was the way he makes you connect to all the characters in a short amount of time. You find yourself very involved in the story...This version did not do that. I felt it was very rushed from the beginning, and it continually fell flat. It was not the actors, because they did great with what they were given...which was a rushed story that had no character introduction...The original actually scared me for SEVERAL years after the movie. I would have to run and jump into my bed in fear of a clown being under there...I also used to get scared when a storm was coming and I counted the distance between the lightening and thunder...However, this movie was not scary at all. I walked away with a disappointed feeling of MEH when I wanted to leave checking under my bed again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2015's "Poltergeist" is a remake with nothing new to offer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason movies are remade is the same reason that most movies of any kind are made ? for the money. There's nothing wrong with that, as long the filmmakers give moviegoers the entertaining experience that they paid for. It's also nice when there are remake motivations besides money, like, for example, updating the story for a new generation, using advances in technology to make the movie more enjoyable, or even reinterpreting the story and injecting new ideas. If no motivations besides the profit motive are present, it'll show on the screen and, ultimately, at the box office. And, whether the filmmakers like it or not, the remake will inevitably be compared to the original, for better or worse. The comparison will likely be positive if the writer and/or director have something new to say. If not, you get "Poltergeist" (PG-13, 1:33).Before I get to my criticisms, here's a spoiler-free summary of the "Poltergeist" story, version 2015: The Bowen Family is downsizing into a new/old home. The father, Eric (Sam Rockwell), is laid off and the mother, Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt), has left her job in order to write a book. Kendra is a teenage girl who complains about almost everything ? except when she's on her cell phone or Skyping on her tablet. Griffin (Kyle Catlett) is a nervous young boy who is afraid of everything and Madison (Kennedi Clements) is a little girl who isn't afraid of anything, even voices coming from her bedroom closet or human hands pressing up against hers ? from inside the living room TV set. When Griffin tries to tell his parents about objects in the house moving around on their own and Maddie is seen talking to "imaginary friends", well, they're just typical kids, right? Maybe not.Amy keeps telling Griffin that there's greatness inside him and Maddie is so innocent and pure, that she's the kind of person who just might be able to lead tormented souls from their current purgatory into the light. When the elder Bowens realize that there is indeed something kind of weird about their house and see that their kids are in danger, they ask for help from the paranormal research department at the local college. Dr. Brooke Powell (Jane Adams) and her assistants, Boyd (Nicholas Braun) and Sophie (Susan Heyward) set up all their fancy monitoring equipment at the house, but soon understand that they're in over their heads. Powell calls in TV's most famous paranormal researcher, Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris), but what's going on in the Bowen family home might even be too much for Burke to handle.The remake of "Poltergeist" isn't a terrible movie, but it doesn't do the horror genre or the original version any favors either. To the movie's credit, it gets to the creepy happenings quicker than most horror movies do, but all the scares are decidedly low-tech. Besides that, the modern devices in the family's home (e.g. cell phones) allowed for moments that could have been both fresh and frightening, but those opportunities were either underutilized or missed completely. The script follows the plot of the original pretty closely, but the changes it made range from inconsequential to self-destructive. Changing the family from financially stable to financially struggling did nothing for character development or for the film's plot. Then the script robbed the first film's most famous line of its impact. Same with the big reveal at the end of the original. That's fine if the filmmakers replaced those elements with something more powerful. They didn't. Even the characters have been watered down. The oldest daughter is just a selfish and annoying teenager whose character serves no real purpose in the story and the head ghost buster is a bland replacement for the very compelling actress who fulfilled that role in the first film. Other characters behave inconsistently within the story and do things that don't make sense.The problems with this movie go beyond an unfavorable comparison with its cinematic ancestor. The new version just isn't that interesting. Someone who hasn't seen the original may find 2015's "Poltergeist" to be a half-way decent horror flick, but probably wouldn't be overly enthused. Someone who has seen the original is most likely to be outright disappointed. It's almost as if writer David Lindsay-Abaire and director Gil Kenan were embarrassed that they were remaking a horror classic, so they made some superficial changes and took out some of that version's most critical elements, but rather than putting something more captivating into their remake, they were content with simply robbing the story of most of its excitement. The 1982 original spawned two sequels and a TV show. This remake doesn't look like it has a ghost of a chance of repeating those accomplishments ? unless it somehow makes more money than it deserves.

The wife and kids thanked me for two hours wasted.The director had no idea how to build any type of suspense. The tree scene? How do you manage to make that scene boring? The original film was handled by pros. You could feel the anxiety and fear coming from the boy as he counts off the thunderclaps. The clown? Another wasted effort. The original clown scene was one of the scariest ever. This one, not so much. There was no emotion from anyone! Was mom on Prozac? Flatlined and dreadful. Please no more remakes!</fullReview>

Me and my son went to the 2D version of this movie and decided to go to see the 3D version later this week after this movie. I thought the actors did their best with the script they were given, especially the young ones after all they are what they are children they were great.

		<fullReview>I believe the original Poltergeist is one of the best movies to come out of the 70's-80's. Original story, great casting, chemistry found in the actors. You find unexpected frills and chills, it's unpredictable and it makes you feel, happy, sad, outraged and scared. I was very excited when I saw the trailer for the 2015 version, I thought that with all the technology available to movie makers now a days it would make a jump that would be visually stunning. But it did not. It's like they threw the original script up in the air, it got shuffled, they picked it up and then made a movie out of those shuffled, discombobulated pages, couple that with poor acting and casting and you have a FLOP. What a shame. I look forward to the time when someone picks up this story and injects it with some true originality and talent. Until then, keep your money in your pocket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEFORE I GO ON, I WILL RE-ITERATE HAT THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU WISH TO SEE THE MOVIE OR DO NOT WANT TO KNOW A LOT OF THE STORY!This remake of the 1982 hit movie poltergeist is a step up in the horror industry. I am so glad that they managed to pull this off. The movie is a story about a family who move to a house, encounter a poltergeist, which take there daughter and they have to get her back. The movie haves you on the each of your seat 90% of the time and in other points the movie it shows slight comedy.There are particular parts of the movie which are not really necessary (Such as the point where Eric is drinking whiskey and has a hallucination that he is spewing maggots and that blood is pouring out his eyes). However this movie did manage to scare me when it needed to.The beginning of the movie is really slow and takes a little time for something to actually happen however that is common in recent horror movies.There is one particular part which was scarier than what it should've been, especially for a 15 rated movie. This features the ghost of the daughter hiding in the closet and suddenly turns around to see it has a mangled face and throws her father across the room. Me, my friend and half of the cinema flew 8 feet in the air at this part as it was so frightening.Although I am not the biggest fan when it comes to horror movies, I absolutely loved this movie and strongly suggest EVERYONE to go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist minus fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine going to the theater to see a production of a spectacular Broadway musical you've been waiting to see for years, and getting there to realize it's not the musical, but the much less interesting play that the musical was based on, minus the orchestra, minus spectacle, with the second string understudies playing the main parts made famous by the original actors. There's one stripped-down creaky set that fits in a truck, and a couple of amended lines that sort of remind you of the set-piece scenes you're expecting. It's not what you wanted, and was essentially set up to capitalize upon the success on the larger, more elaborate production.This is the feeling I had watching POLTERGEIST 2015. The epic original was a phantasmagorical Spelbergian adventure which walked the line of fun AND scary with a lush and terrifyingly memorable orchestral score, elaborate and iconic effects sequences, unforgettable performances, and characters we cared about. I can only imagine someone somewhere went "Let's do it again, only smaller, shorter, and with less music, character development and special effects..."The major failing that really causes the whole house of cards to crumble in this new retelling is I hate the Bowens. All unnecessary extra roles are cut, so there are no neighbors there for them to interact with. Oh, there is a dinner party sequence is there primarily for the sole purpose of spoiling the wham-line of the original, and the rest you glimpse at the end are probably CGI Titanic passengers. The movie opens with the youngest daughter calling her dad a dumb-ass, and this is essentially one of two cut down "family interaction" scenes which replace the first half hour of character development that was cut so this runs 90 minutes instead of two hours - we got to see that the Freelings have a regular life outside of the horror movie they're headed for. Scenes of idyllic suburban life are replaced by arguing in the car about the GPS. The parents are awful. Instead of the wonderful lightning countdown from the original, the dad cracks "Whattya afraid of, Son?" When the boy replies "Everything," he's basically just ordered to get over it. The mother is a block of wood, standing around as if there's nothing more worrisome going on than leaky pipes and a carpeting job taking too long in her new house. The older daughter manages to ape Dominique Dunne's freak outs in the original, and the son picks up most of the slack and takes the mom's role in the penultimate finale. No false ending here; barely is the family out of the driveway when we get the finale ultimo: One CGI skeleton representing hundreds, and the Bowens drive off in their clean clothes, barely the worse for wear. There's no "Beast", no whispered monologues in the dark, no Industrial Light and Magic. The music score threatens a leitmotif on one or two occasions, but then just gives up since there's no rise-and-fall drama to accent when all we're bothering to build to is one standard jump scare at a time.At least in the first movie, the characters got wet, muddy, slimy, injured, bloody. I guess CGI doesn't really muss the actors too much. Even the damn clown is relegated to a guest role - you've seen his whole segment in the trailers, and he's just the warm up for the flaccid tree abduction segment, never to be seen again.Buy the original on Blu-Ray and watch it with your family on a big TV with surround sound. You might have to explain how TV used to not broadcast 24 hours a day, but it will ultimately be more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't even feel like bothering to review this film. It was that bad. Not a trash B flick, but bottom of the barrel. Worse than most remakes, and they had 33 years since the first one came out with various sequels to that one to improve on the idea. Instead they copied so many elements from the original I guess figuring we'd forget or kids haven't seen it.Okay, so it's not original. We know that going in, but starting with the little child talking to a closet as soon as they move in, and then to the TV with the same classic line. Ugh. And clowns in the attic, plus the same burial ground routine. I came on to warn folks. Save your money in the theaters. This is DVD or online material at best. What miffs me with this is what I started out saying, they had an opportunity to make this really good. Who doesn't like ghosts, and they had huge name recognition. I understand that films cost a lot, and they don't want to risk much. The old formula worked, so why not again. They must think moviegoers are idiots. This film didn't even update the narrative they had in the bag. Not to mention no one is working with maxed out credit cards, but they bought a house.</fullReview>

I came to see a movie without cardboard characters. Special effects are all well and good. But if everything else makes you want to go to sleep (or leave the theater as I did), what's the point?Bottom line?Bad remake.Save your money and see if you can find the 1982 "original" at a video store.

		<fullReview>Quickie Review:A family looking for a new beginning moves into a suburban home. Evil forces take control of the house, threatening the lives of the inhabitants. When the youngest daughter is abducted by evil spirits, the family must come together to find a way to rescue her. The Poltergeist is the least scary movie in recent times. This remake offers nothing new and repeats the clichés originally set by the 1980s Poltergeist. The acting overall is decent, and Sam Rockwell did liven up the movie with his charm. Yet performances alone could not save this disaster of a horror film, bursting at the seams with mediocre CGI. Skip this one.Full Review:As a horror fan, I am ever hopeful to find a good scare once in a while to get my heart pumping. I guess I like being kept awake at night fearing things that don't exist. Well The Poltergeist, got me to do the exact opposite, go to bed like little baby and enjoy a long hibernation.Before I get all ranty, I should mention the good aspect of the movie, the performances. The parents played by Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt had believable chemistry with each other and the children. Sam Rockwell is awesome as always, bringing in his own personality to the character. That helped with bringing some levity into the movie so we aren't drowning in over-dramatic tension. Even the child actors were decent. Sure one of them was the clichéd child talking to ghosts, but there was also another kid who reacted to anomalies like a real human pre-teen would react: scared out of his freaking mind! So at least the characters were mostly relatable.If you want the definition of a bad horror movie, actually even worse, a bad horror remake then look no further. Remakes should be made to capture the spirit (pun intended) of the original while trying to do something new. This movie is exactly the same as the original. Moreover, the original is a classic because it did something new for that time. It did it so well that other horror movies started to copy the 80s Poltergeist. So when you film a remake without making any significant changes, not only is it bland because it is a copy of the original, it's boring because it's rehashes all the horror clichés that have propagated since the 80s. So much so that I knew exactly when and where the next scare was coming from. The only thing new about the movie is the use of computer generated ghouls, and they couldn't even get that right. The quality of the CGI was poor to begin with, but there is such over-reliance on them that it progressively gets worse. Eventually they are all an amalgamation of random mediocre video game creatures that you don't care about because nothing feels real. So the one new thing they tried drained all the horror out of the movie.Fans of the original classic will hate this movie, horror fans will hate this movie, so I don't who they are trying to target this movie towards. Sure the performance of the actors were good, but the overflow of horror clichés and crappy CGI is too much to bear. Worst of all, it was not scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a debacle. When I saw the original many years ago I was just a 12 year old kid, and I was mesmerized by the entire movie. The setting was absolutely perfect from the subdivision to the actual house. Just everything about it was right, the casting was incredible Craig T. Neslson knocked it out of the park. I have watched the original every few years, and I find the movie still holds up as an 80's horror masterpiece. The famous line "their here" gives me chills even. I just really don't know why Hollywood has to try to improve upon such an iconic movie. I mean are they really out of ideas already?? So the new version is just crap I mean it really is...the house is wrong the casting is wrong the script is wrong...its just a wonderment how some studio exec thought this could actually be a good idea. It really is just an identical reboot of the original and it fails miserably...with the tech advances I would have thought that would be the strong suit is all the amazing things they could implement with the modern CGI, but the original puts this to absolute shame...in the original you actually feel some compassion for the dead, in this one they are just the dead and they don't play on the possibilities inherint.Bottom line is it just really kinda sucked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better FX than original, everything else worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You wouldn't think any filmmaker would even consider remaking such an iconic film unless they had some great ideas for what they'd do differently - and yet that clearly was not the case here. There's some pretty well-done CGI to be enjoyed but very little else. The tricks the original film used to make us jump have been done a million times since then and couldn't possibly work again without a twist, yet these filmmakers seem content to attempt all the same beats. Really wonder why the studio made the decision to go with this screenwriter and director. Nothing on their resume seems to suggest that they'd be able to handle this. Seems more like yet another reason to believe the studio just wanted a reboot, produced on the cheap, and wasn't all that concerned with who was behind the camera. Several times I thought back not to the original Poltergeist but rather to the Paranormal Activity films. Those movies were doing pretty much the same thing, a contained haunted house story that depends on building suspense - but they did it much better. If you want to see a new take on the original Poltergeist, I think you'd be better served just watching the first Paranormal Activity.This just didn't seem like the work of filmmakers who loved the original and wanted to pay tribute to it with their own take - more like a studio who thought a reboot would sell tickets and didn't care about much else beyond getting a film in theaters with the right name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't do the original justice by any means. The movie in general was rather predictable and not scary in the slightest bit. The clown scene probably would've made me jump had it not been exposed so often on the teaser trailers for this movie. They attempted to change the original character names and plot for reasons I don't understand because the original plot was a little more creepy. The acting was rather bland with the exception of the father who was rather humorous at times. I watched the premiere for this movie with my easily startled girl friend. I approximated that there was only about 3 scenes throughout the entire movie that made her jump and that's saying something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Poltergeist" Terrible remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever go into a movie with low standards from hearing people say how bad the movie is just to have it go even farther, farther to the point you didn't even know existed? Well Poltergeist is for you! It put me to sleep, didn't even scare, and they call it horror. I usually tell people to wait for it on DVD, don't even bother your time with this movie. A horrible, god awful remake that shouldn't even been called Poltergeist. I can go into such detail on why not to see it, but I rather not live through that again. The theater surprised me when I noticed it was in 3D, 17 dollars to see it. Man oh man, I wish I didn't make that choice. Hopefully I made a point, I don't mean to be so harsh on a movie, but I couldn't help myself. A true awful remake, and we are in the ages of sequels and remakes, and when they can't get that right, you know we are doomed!!(Lets make a movie, call it a classic remake and take their money!) Have to also point out quickly, that for the effects in this 2015 movie, are blah, boring, and you think why didn't they add more. For the original Poltergeist(1982), for that time with the effects, was amazing, today cheesy, but amazing. I cried. Leaving the theater would have been an option for me if it wasn't for paying so much, and its also why I gave it a two star. I normally only give movies 1 star if I can't finish it. If you want horror, find another movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected soooo much more from this movie. To me it was like watching Scary movie but just the same storyline as sooo many other horror movies. The movie was too predictable. The only thing unpredictable was no one die.It started of OK building the storyline but when it supposed to get better it went down hill from there, and fast. I really expected it to be scary and nail biting like paranormal activity, insidious or even annabelle but it was not to be. I was left disappointed.The idea of the movie was good but it needed a lot more creativity and different ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well,they had 33 years to remake this and they completely rushed it.At a paltry 93 minutes nothing fitted.Everybody seemed to just be going through the motions and couldn't wait for the director to shout "CUT"!The thing about modern horror movies is that theyr'e not,,yes ,,a few shocks but it's the equivalent of someone following you around all day shouting "Boo"!Gets a bit tedious at time.I got the impression that the actors were trying to tell us word for word the plot but we need to try and work things out for ourselves. There's far too much dialogue here compared to the magnificent "Babadook" which let us make our own way with little dialogue and quiet' brooding scenes.Okay if you want to take your girlfriend to make her hold onto you all night but as scary as a bad case of vomiting.Please Please Please ,,no Number 2!See you again in 2048 to see if they can do better.

		<fullReview>When I go to the movies for a film like this, I expect to be scared. And while this film had a few suspenseful moments, I didn't jump out of my seat once. Unlike the original that built up to being scary, this is so fast paced that you don't get to enjoy any buildup of fear. The actress who donned the role of Heather O'Rourke's scary little girl was too adorable for the role. And this fact, along with the house being warm and inviting the whole time, never changed. I think they spent too much of the budget on special effects, and not enough on the changing atmosphere of the storyline. If you're going to see it, I'd wait for Redbox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stinker of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this because a 13-year-old who had not seen the original wanted to go. I've seen a spate of these bad horror movies lately, and Poltergeist 2015 is no exception.By-the-numbers horror movies have always focused on being "cool," which nowadays means the stock teen girl character -- here a dour Lindsay Lohan wannabe interchangeable with the dour young woman from Occulus -- has a product placed iPhone, uses Skype and watches reality TV. Remember when the teens in this genre had wild parties and made out? Not so for this generation. For all their Millennial hipness, however, the filmmakers stuck with the notion of a Paranormal Studies department existing at a university in the year 2015.Perhaps Poltergeist considers itself a psychological thriller rather than a lowly slasher flick, but it lacks the character development, emotional range, and exploration of broader themes required in that category. (A muddled backstory about unemployment and greedy developers feels like six rewrites were cut and pasted together with little concern for the plot holes.)The family has a sourpuss attitude from the start, making it difficult to root for them. In fact you're actually hoping the poltergeists win a few rounds. Contrast with the family from the real Poltergeist in 1982.The art of suspense is completely lost here, as too much is given away early on. The would-be gotcha moments exist purely to pay off the 3-D effects. At no point was I scared, or even startled.They had the sense not to even try going in a Zelda Rubenstein direction, and the actor in that role comes off as almost human. The little boy gets some sympathy, if only for having the most heartless parents ever, though he's less a person than a tool for more product placement.Consider this movie a shoo-in for the Golden Raspberry Awards this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything thats wrong with remakes was in this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Been a fan of the original classic I was in two minds about going to see this. When IMDb announced that it was going to get a remake I instantly thought of scenes from the original movie and just how could they better them now we are 33 years into the future. New tech and by many means a new way we live as families.First off to make a good movie is like baking a cake in a sense. You weigh up your carefully selected ingredients (Actors/Actresses/settings/music/story/crew/effects) and you make them work well with care and timing. The Freeling family in the 82' version had it all. They looked convincing and they had a great on screen chemistry which make the audience relate to and feel for them. Not just the Freeling's but their neighbours the Tuthill's and the Parapsychology crew who came to their aid supported the story and suspense well. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams made Poltergeist successful because of the way they were together and with the kids. For the first 30 minutes they are all happy and going about their lives happily, the soft music sets the sense of calm and you feel at ease with them. Then when all hell breaks loose, you see the main characters slowly crumble into depression and by the time the ending comes there isn't any smiles and a 'Oh well that was fun while it lasted' attitude to the Freeling's, they are broken and exhausted which in the real world would be totally understandable.Now for the 'Remake'.In a nutshell the remake was totally the opposite. The new Bowen family do not share that same chemistry. They don't seem to be close to each other and the story progresses too quickly to even care for them, not to mention no signs of any neighbours and the Parapsychology crew don't offer any support either. Even Jared Harris (Carrigan Burke) wasn't reassuring or convincing as Zelda Rubinstein (Tangina) as the family's saviour. Watching the remake was like watching a new generation mocking an older one by trying to impersonate and quote scenes from the original with a cocky attitude. The new age CGI effects were as usual rubbish, I have never been a fan of them for horror movies and for all the millions they spent on them to try and give this film some sort of edge over the original, they should have invested in something more real and organic (Latex never hurt nor failed in any of the classic horror movies). One of the quotes that struck me was that the mother Amy Bowen destroyed any connection with the audience was when she said she wished they had stopped at just two kids, so basically the special child of the family was a mistake and she spends most of her time giving all her love and attention to their son Griffin.To save yourself a bit of money watch the trailer, it gives away the plot before you even buy a ticket to see it, all the jump scares are in it and saves any disappointment for the viewers who already appreciated the original classic. Everything felt just so rushed and fake it was appalling, if this is the future for horror movies its going to die out very quickly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly solid remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist seemed like the last iconic 1980s horror film that hadn't been remade. In the past decade, every 1980s horror flick that was even slightly successful got the remake treatment, so it wasn't exactly a big surprise when it was announced that Poltergeist would be remade. The big surprise for me was that I ended up enjoying this one as much as I did.Despite being unoriginal, the really great thing about the new Poltergeist is that it's a lot of fun, something I haven't been able to say about a horror movie in a long time. While there may be an overabundance of jump scares and CGI at times, director Gil Kenan is clearly trying at every turn to let the audience have a good time. Unlike most recent Hollywood remakes, this wasn't designed to be dark and gritty. The casting of Sam Rockwell helps set the fun tone quite nicely. Rockwell brings his trademark brand of humor to what could have easily been the boring, typical dad role. Rockwell has terrific chemistry with Rosemary DeWitt, who does a great job filling in for the JoBeth Williams role of the original. Best of all is the casting of the three children. It's very easy to make kids in movies, especially horror movies, be super annoying. Here, all three of the kids are well cast, and are not only likable but also feel like real kids. They aren't too precocious or too bratty. They seem like everyday children, and react like kids stuck in horrific scenarios would.Although much of Poltergeist revolves around the three children, it wouldn't be fair to categorize the picture as a kiddie horror movie. This isn't hardcore horror, though it's not lame stuff either. This new Poltergeist is the equivalent of a haunted house attraction: the scares may be obvious at times, but they are still are effective and genuinely creepy. The best scene in the whole movie involves a drill, and it is probably the most well shot and perfectly timed moment of any movie I've seen in the past year. Some horror fans may say that the fact that there is no blood in the movie makes it ineffective, though in my mind this reiterates the fact that buckets of blood are not always necessary to craft suspense. This isn't one of the all time best horror movies I've ever seen, but it's certainly at the top of the list of strongest PG-13 horror films.Poltergeist is bound to get tons of hate just for being a remake of a beloved horror favorite, and I understand the frustration of there not being enough original horror movies out there. However, feelings on the original film aside, I can't deny that I had a really great time watching this new version, and would like to see a sequel, provided it has some of the same key cast members or filmmakers behind it. This movie is the surprise of the year for movie, so I give it a solid 8/10. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely HORRIBLE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me state that I think Sam Rockwell is an amazing actor. Thus, part of my desire to see this movie, or rather, what won over my skepticism, was his inclusion.Secondly, I absolutely loved the original Poltergeist, so, there was some hope that this movie would be decent, given the advancements in technology in the intervening years.What I encountered though was one of the most disappointing 1 and a half hours of any movie going experience I've ever had. And yes, at a nifty 1.5 hours, the movie HUMMED along.By hummed, I mean RUSHED. The movie went from point A to B with electrifying speed and in between, nothing connected.In this retelling of the tale, a nice, modern family moves into a new house and almost IMMEDIATELY the full on "scares" (yawn) begin. There was none of the buildup that the original so deftly crafted. The sense of awe and wonder at the outset of the original, when things began to happen (i.e., chairs moving of their own accord) was noticeably absent. Instead I was thrust into all of the shocks and frights headfirst, without really even beginning to care about the characters.And speaking of the characters, they were almost hollow to the point of being totally empty. Whereas I watched with dread as Carole-Anne first talked to the TV people in the original and felt the impending sense of fear as events escalated, there was none of that here. Events happened and they happened to people that I couldn't even remotely care about.The worst part may have been the new "Medium" employed (ostensibly in the Zelda Rubenstein role). He was so utterly forgettable and pointless that I haven't even bothered to remember his name.OK, so maybe comparing it to the original is unfair, it IS a retelling after all. Having said that, it would seem to me that by naming it POLTERGEIST, that the comparisons would be inevitable. If they wanted it to be a stand alone movie on it's own merit, then they should have called it "Generic Un-scary Horror Movie" - which, would have been an extremely fitting title for this piece of garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely terrible and unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why oh why do they persist in remaking classic movies, and then destroying them. This awful remake takes 30 minutes to actually get going, and considering it is only 90 minutes long in the first place, the director then tries to fit the story into the remaining 60 minutes using CGI and a rushed storyline. The suspense from the original is gone, as is a believable cast. Poor dialogue and script, like when the little girl is being dragged into the closet for the second time, and the Dad, who is desperately hanging onto her says "Hold On!" Gone is the very believable medium from the original Zelda Rubinstein, to be replaced with a 'Ghosthunter' whose actual role no one is quite sure why he is in the film, because Maddie's brother becomes the actual hero. A very poor quality remake from the Ghost House Pictures studio. Sam Raimi put his name to it and should be ashamed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another movie that has been remade to squeeze a few extra dollars out of the pockets of the unfortunate public. This movie is the pits. This movie is like they didn't even try to do a good remake. You've got all your boring, predictable, modern family in there... i'm just surprised there wasn't a gay one or a transvestite or whatever, but let's add them up for good measure.Heroic father who is down on his luck or something. Check Wife who is a brilliant genius in some way and also attractive and thin, but also unbelievably loving and caring about the kids. Check. Nerdy little glasses kid who saves the day like always. Check Sassy teenage b*tch who is just full of attitude. Check Cute little girl as the object of the fetch quest. Check Narly old experienced ghost hunter that everyone still thinks is a bit cooky, despite all the ridiculous things going on in their house. Check.So, that's the roll call of predictable characters out of the way, but who really cares about any of them? not me. I wanted them all to get sucked into CG world just so the movie could end quicker.This is join the dots the same as the original, almost no innovations at all, apart from the drone that apparently can send video feeds across dimensional boundaries. Except there is one thing that is different.... the back-story and characters and exposition is unbelievably boring. And there is no villain either, just a boring space vortex thing. or whatever it is, in fact nobody really bothers to ask what the hell is that in the closet, and why don't we call the government to investigate.I got to about 20 minutes before the end and couldn't be bothered to see the ending after the woman started hysterically over-acting when she got the smaller kid back from the space vortex. I don't need to watch it. I already know what happens. The house blows up or vanishes, they discover some human bones, give them all a proper burial and the subsequently the family is all still alive and happy and well and singing kumbaya round the camp fire as though nothing ever happened, instead of being all separated and half of them institutionalised, as would more likely be the case.</fullReview>

The characters in this film were written to be a lot more depressing and far more stupid. Not to mention not relatable. Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt had zero chemistry. A lot of what made the original film exciting and fun was completely lost in this version. The tree wasn't that scary and neither was the clown. The kids were horribly annoying and the parents were two depressing, unemployed saps. If I didn't know better, I would've assumed Tyler Perry wrote the script. I thought the decision to have the annoying son take on some of the mom's responsibilities from the original film was the final straw for me.

It doesn't even come close to being as scary as the original. I'm surprised that Sam Raimi would put his money in this crap. Poltergeist feels like a collage of horror movie clichés - so much so that it at times verges on parody. 33 years ago, many of these weren't as ingrained in our collective psyche as they are today, so they felt fresh. Now, however, they're tired. We've been overexposed and Kenan fails to find a way to make them new or interesting. So we end up with a haunted house, animated toys, and a wise ghost expert who arrives to exorcise/clean the spirits.

		<shortDescription>An experience that left us confused; was this horror or bad comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the Poltergeist poster on the streets of New York City, I felt that it was going to be a frightening yet exciting experience. So, we waited anxiously until the moment came, May the 22nd, the Poltergeist premiere. It was that fine day that we gathered our nearest and dearest friends and family and purchased what we thought were golden tickets of horror.We arrived to the cinema to find a filled room... So, we thought to ourselves YES. This movie will exceed our greatest expectations. I knew as I sat in my cinema chair that this movie would be amazing.After five minutes, it became apparent that this movie lacked any kind of worthwhile introduction in the horror or acting aspects.I turned my head to my right and whispered to my mom "Wow mom, this is going to be bad." Some noises came from the row behind me and someone said "is this a joke?"; turns out... it was. After one hour of the movie, we were seriously unsure if this was a comedy or horror film. We wondered..."should we leave or stay?".. I looked to my left "let's at least finish the movie; we already paid" said my brother.Well, I wish I had left because walking on the street would have been more productive and worthwhile, even though I had paid.This is my first review in IMDb, and TRUST ME, I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't want to save you from getting ripped off financially and intellectually. Worst of all, there wasn't one moment I even flinched in this movie.In conclusion, this film was a complete disaster. I wanted to give this movie a zero, but since that is not possible, I am forced to give this movie a one. I sit here disgusted with myself for praising this movie with a rate much higher than it deserves.</fullReview>

Very weak acting , weak story line , poor effects ( not even scary), nor funny , it falls somewhere in between worlds , child like predictive dialog , all in all looks like an amateur project ! Some Hollywood remakes are excellent , some are fine .. but this was a joke people !! I WANT MY MONEY BACK .. yeah right !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was going to be a superior remake, but I was so disappointed. They wanted this new generation to go see this movie, so of course they would capitalize on it, just like they produce remakes of other classics, and a lot of the time they don't do the original justice. The 1982 version had an eerie supernatural feeling to it, which this one totally lacked. Zelda Rubinstein who played the Medium on the 1982 version is a classic all on its own. I am sure a lot youth of today all have seen the original, who would miss it? I enjoy a good supernatural movie, but when it comes to a remake of a classic, they better get it right. Poltergeist 2 was also a classic. If they plan on doing a remake of that, I hope the get it right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the new Poltergeist movie not expecting great things - the original is a classic for many reasons - but there wasn't anything else worth watching other than Mad Max: Fury Road, and I haven't seen the other Mad Max movies yet, so Poltergeist it was. I'm a horror movie fan at heart, so I figured... why not? It can't be that bad, can it?Yes, it can. It really can.The characters are all dreadful: the parents do nothing but bitch and complain about their children. The children are brats (except for the youngest, the completely adorable Kennedi Clements playing the part made famous by Heather O'Rourke, god rest her.) who spend the movie doing nothing much at all. Honestly. It's been less than 24 hours, and I really can't recall anything of any importance that the eldest child did - when I tried to, I got the memory mixed up with the trailer for the next chapter of Insidious that was shown prior to the movie...The entire film is shockingly bad. The plot is a weakly updated version of the '80s classic. The way that it's been brought into the 21st century has left it entirely devoid of any tension whatsoever, and any scares that I got were from coulrophobia (fear of clowns) that I already had, and the few stupid jump scares they gave us. And while I myself didn't find them scary, the girl in the row in front of me certainly did: she was buried against her boyfriend for most of the movie.All in all, the movie can be described in one word: awful. Save your money for when an actually decent horror movie comes out. You'll be able to buy yourself a nice house by then, I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much potential for greatness...so much disappointment :( The writing was lazy and the special effects were sub-par...With names like Raimi and Rockwell attached I went into the theater with the highest of hopes. I wasn't expecting anything close to the original Tobe Hooper/Steven Spielberg masterpiece but at the very least a few chills. What I got was pure, unadulterated BOREDOM. If it were not for Sam Rockwell being in the picture I would have walked out. The acting was embarrassing and the dialogue so ridiculous I found myself laughing out loud. The coffins under the Freelings front lawn must be rollings over. Cross over children, All are welcome. All welcome. Go into the Light....but don't go see this flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist - Complete dump except 2 scares in 90 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Horror movie that I watched in theater and I have to say this was way worse than what I used to see it on my TV. Its not the sound effects with the theater but with the movie itself. Totally Awful. I haven't seen the original movie so I can't compare it with the original. This remake or whatever play this is, isn't worth your time and money. I spent 2$ for this movie and I regret that I wasted my 2$. I am unsure how much they charge you in U.S but wait for Blu ray and watch it. My point is, it isn't even worth a Bluray disc. There were 2 scares though that I didn't expect it. My English might not be meaningful but don't watch this one. I don't know what else to say to cover this 10 line review.</fullReview>
