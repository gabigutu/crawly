		<shortDescription>Better than a 7.1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films often do not get their do, and the 7.1 rating for Poltergeist shows that this trend will most likely continue. Clearly an influential film by Chainsaw director Tobe Hooper, Poltergeist reached for, and achieved, everything that the earlier Amityville Horror failed to be; namely, scary, credible, and well acted.Poltergeist, in a nutshell, is a story of suburban California family that discovers the darker side of the American Dream when their youngest daughter, Carol Ann, makes contact with evil spirits through the family television set. "They're here", never fails to send chills down my spine as I recall seeing this film for the first time as a teenager.Perhaps 10 to 15 more years will finally lend the credibility to this film to finally place it among the classics in modern horror cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you put Steven Spielberg, Tobe Hooper, Jerry Goldsmith, and Beatrice Straight in a big budget MGM motion picture about a haunted house? You get "Poltergeist" a top of the pick, no holds barred, roller coaster ride through the supernatural world and back to ours. "Poltergeist" explores the side affects of a haunted house and it's effects on a normal suburban family who inhabits the house. Steve Freeling is a successful realestate agent who has a nice house and a loving wife, with a family to die for. There is the spunky, rebellious eldest daughter, as portrayed gloriously by the late Dominique Dunne, may she rest in peace. The sporty young son, and the cute, innocent youngest daughter, Carol Ann, of whom the story is based around. The Freelings' are a happy American family whose lives are turned upside down when they realize their house in 'haunted' and the 'poltergeists' kidnap the youngest member of the family. In the film that pursues, Steve and his wife Diane do everything in their power to get her back, with the aid of Dr. Lesh, played out Oscar worthy by Beatrice Straight, and her assistants. Horrors and traumas ensue.Enough power to knock you out of your dreams for long time, this film, was said to be directed by Tobe Hooper, whom had previous fame with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But when one watches this film, it is anything but Hooper. Hooper's trademarks include hysteria and screaming by a young female in the finale of his films(remember 'Eaten Alive?') and have no real substance or depth in their plots, what you see is what you get. Whereas this film, said to be produced by Spielberg, was so obviously directed(on the side anyway)by also, as his trade marks include psychological P.O.V. shots(Diane Freeling in the hallway scene) and wide range of character development(all characters except for Dana are developed to fruition, but Dunne does such a great job as Dana that you can't really tell.)There was even controversy over who directed the film, and still stands so today, although Spielberg came forward a little after the film was released, and exposed himself as only producer and assistant to the director, still, rumor is still hovering over the memory of the production.The music to the film is superb, with Goldsmith clearly at one of his best moments, nominated but did not win, although he should have. His theme for the Freelings' is a calm, gentle one that compliments his theme for Carol Ann, which is quite possibly one of the prettiest themes he ever concocted. His score for the ghosts consists of structured, spiritual themes and rough orchestral brass woodwind, accompanied by a grand chorus. All other themes he came up with were just as stand out-ish as the above mentioned.The acting is top notch, by conflicted Steve Freeling, who is so confused he self destructs into a pale maelstrom in his mind, and Diane, the mother and star of the film, Jobeth Williams is at her finest as she deals with the stress of trying to find her daughter, and keeping her family afloat amidst the chaos. The children are all really good under Hooper's(Spielberg's?) direction, particularly Dominique Dunne, who shines through in all scenes she is in, even though her character has got to be the most underdeveloped! Robbie is fun to watch, as all little boys will be boys. And who could forget the cute Carol-Ann...They're Heeeeere! Enough said. But my personal favorite was the late Beatrice Straight, as the sympathetic Dr. Lesh, who with every facial expression, the audience can see what exactly she is thinking, about to say, and still manages to surprise the audience with her spontaneous acting skill. The supporting cast are just as great.Special effects make this even more of a thrill ride of the ages, as Industrial Light and Magic was first starting out, and makes this one of the biggest special effects fest of cinema. Nominations for those also.So in full circle, this family, this film, the most extraordinary horror film of the eighties, still has the power to ring every chill out of it's script, while still managing to keep the audience calm with it's realism, and relief.And about the curse that is said to follow the series' past, all just tragedies and coincidence.May Dominique Dunne, Beatrice Straight, Heather O' Rourke, Jerry Goldsmith, all rest in peace.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is a horror movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two types of "horror" films:There are the scary ones, which is what the word "horror" means in the first place,and then there is the bloody,gory kind.Perhaps the latter kind should be categorized under another name.At any rate,Poltergeist is a good horror film.It goes beyond the idea of typical ghosts in sheets jumping out of nowhere and saying "boo!".Most of the adventure takes place in their world rather than ours,although we cannot see what is going on there.This is a very thrilling movie.It has great special effects and all of the scare elements that make a horror film what it is supposed to be.The clown in the chair at the foot of the boy's bed was a particularly tense moment for me.This is the only movie I went to see 4 times at the theater,partly to watch others' reactions.I have often heard that the film,and it's two sequels,were the victim of some type of curse,as after each film was released,a member of the cast passed away,including Heather O'Rourke,who played Carol Anne, after the 3rd film.She was only 10.Curse? Coincidence? Who knows? I guess anything is possible.All in all,this is one of the best films ever for the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noticed that IMDb lists the release dates for films, and laughed here because I could never forget Friday, June 4, 1982, my last day in tenth grade, and about my tenth date with the exceptionally pretty and wonderful young lady I dated throughout most of high school. The weather was perfect, and I took my ladyfriend out for a nice lunch and a walk down Broadway in search of a movie. ET had been the hyped Spielberg film of that summer, but this one was already out, and the thought of a horrified hottie clinging to me for dear life (or vice versa) was irresistible. Poltergeist it was.Like all Spielberg films, one will not find many weaknesses. The plot will be engaging, the visuals stunning, the acting excellent, and the overall experience first-class. This film did not disappoint.The restrospectively amusing casting of Craig T. Nelson in the lead. Notable supporting cast include the late Dominique Dunne and the late Healther O'Rourke, both of whom would die tragically in 1988 and 1982, respectively, the earlier by domestic violence and the latter by illness. The loss to Hollywood is still felt to this day as each would likely have Oscars by now. The cast of competent, moderately known talents provided a strong yet muted substance to the special-effects stylings for which Spielberg became so famous.As I settled in with my date to watch the film, I was equally enthralled both by her touch and the screen. From the moment O'Rourke uttered the to-this-day-chilling "They're here!!," through the amusing plot twist that explains the hauntings (a certain home developer forgot to do something with the gravesite that had previously existed on the land and apparently ticked off some spirits), though the death, destruction, and absolute terror experienced by the hapless protagonist family.I will never again be fifteen, never again experience the deep cuts to the heart that come with teenage desire, never again wonder if maybe those horror movies could happen in real life, never again will experience the thrill of not having school or any other responsibilities for the next three months, and will never again be as vital or physically capable as I was so effortlessly back then, but to have had that even once, all at the same time, in the greatest city in the world, was absolutely awesome.Whatever might have been wrong with my life at that age simply did not exist in that theater, during that film, with that date. Anything less than a perfect film would have spoiled what was literally a perfect day. It didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror/thrillers of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1982, Steven Spielberg pulled off an incredible feat. In June of that year, Spielberg released two films only weeks apart that were both highly successful yet diversely different in both subject matter and their target audiences. One went on to become the highest grossing film of all-time (E.T.), the other spawned a franchise (Poltergeist). Poltergeist had a screen credit of being directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), but history has revealed that it was Spielberg's vision, editing and overall command of the shooting that was really behind the making of this extraordinary film. Poltergeist brought back the traditional haunted house genre that lay dormant and restless since The Amityville Horror in 1979. The story surrounds a family's house that has been punctured by the spirit world that seem keen on the youngest daughter of the clan ? Carol Ann Freeling, played by newcomer Heather O'Rourke. At first, the family meets the strange happenings in the home with playful pleasure, but in an instant the poltergeists intentions turn against the Freelings, and their daughter is captured and taken back to the supernatural world where communication is possible only through the bedroom television.The Freelings waste little time and soon contact a paranormal group, well over their heads, to help them rescue their daughter from the unseen captures. It becomes clearly evident however, that the group is over matched, and they call in a poltergeist expert, Tangina Barrons (played with relative enthusiasm and wit by Zelda Rubinstein) to assist with the phenomena. Tangina then leads the Freelings through the unknown, both calming their fears and eventually finding a portal that may be the key to retrieving their daughter.Poltergeist works as both a horror and a thriller. The cast, lead by O'Rourke, Jo-Beth Williams, Craig T. Nelson and Oliver Robins have real chemistry and are believable as a family unit, and unlike most horror films, they make sound judgments and know their limitations. When Carol Ann's bedroom becomes overtaken by the ghostly spirits, they lock the room and keep away rather than trying to fight something they cannot contain. And when things begin to look bleak, they call for help and look for experts in the field. This is an intelligent horror that doesn't have people running up the stairs when they should be running out the door.Put together with a modest budget of less than $12 million, Poltergeist stretched it's dollars to provide us with an incredible array of special effects that still hold up well after 20 years of viewing. Sure, the scene where a scientist literally pulls his face off or when the bedroom is opened and we see items flying at random as if in a ghostly tornado, might be better served with CGI if made today, the effects still keep the story progressing with a sense of credibility. Probably what keeps things so rooted in acceptability is how simplistic some of the special effects were in the larger scenes. A closet full of strobe lights are all that is required to convince us that it is a portal to another world and a fan gently blowing the hair of mother Williams' is believable as the spirit of her child flying past her. Simple plausible.Whatever the reasons, Poltergeist works. One of the few screenplays written by Spielberg from one of his own stories, Poltergeist has all the elements that we now associate with the master director. There is a strong family unit, a child as the central character, above average production values and most notably, not one fatality in the entire film despite all the jilts and jolts. The closing scenes of chaos including a pool of skeletons (later revealed to be authentic), is pure movie magic with frantic pacing and edge of your seat suspense. Since it's release, a lot has been made of the back stories and the curse surrounding the production of the franchise. Heather O'Rourke tragically died at a young age due to an internal infection and Dominique Dunne (who played a smaller role as her sister) was murdered the same year as the films release. The subsequent sequels have also included characters that died shortly after their films completion. Truth or fiction, lore or legend, these stories add to the mystique and mystery surrounding the film. Having knowledge of the ?curse' makes it even scarier and gives it kind of a feeling like Naomi Watts' character must have experienced in The Ring, as if just by watching, you are contributing to the ongoing haunting.Like most movies successful in the late 70's early 80's, there were sequels that were made with considerably higher budgets but less than stellar results (Superman III anyone?). Neither of the Poltergeist sequels or subsequent television programming could come close to capturing the essence of the original. Besides, how can you top what is now one of the most famous movie tag-lines of all time `They'rrreeee Here'?Strong recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Scary Fun!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to go into all the controversy surrounding this movie...everybody knows about the various deaths of cast members, as well as questions over who actually directed "Poltergeist". What I will decribe in this review are my feelings concerning the movie. "Poltergeist" is a good scary picture which will not only entertain you, but will make you wonder what originally occupied the land where your home is currently standing. This movie makes good use of foreshadowing and building of tensions to move a viewer to believe what they are actually seeing is really happening. While giving the "funeral" for the pet bird, Robbie asks if they can later dig it up so they can "see the bones". At the end of the film he is indeed treated to seeing "dug up bones", only they were not ones he had in mind.  Great movie, great acting, great scary fun! A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg's ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Poltergeist" is Steven Spielberg's vision of a ghost story, and a great one at that. This is an outstanding movie in every way possible. It has terrific acting, a good story to tell, a nice sense of humor, and astonishing special effects. Plus when I first saw this film, it was pretty scary."Poltergeist" tells the story of a suburban family living in a small town in California who's home is abruptly invaded by supernatural forces who are anything but friendly, and proceed to terrorize the entire clan. This is a movie that plays like a roller-coaster ride, and once it gets going it never stops. Tobe Hooper, who directed the original 1974 cult classic "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", was picked by Spielberg to direct "Poltergeist". He does a fine job of creating scares and tension, even though rumors were floating around that writer/producer Spielberg actually stepped in and directed some of the film (Spielberg went on to say that Hooper was the director of "Poltergeist" even though Spielberg was very much involved with this film from start to finish). To me, it doesn't matter who directed it. This is still an excellent horror movie. Spielberg did a great job as writer/producer, and even if he had directed the whole movie it would still be as good. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are wonderful as the head of the Freeling family, with Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins, and Heather O'Rourke equally good as their kids. The late Oscar-winning actress Beatrice Straight ("Network") scores points as a parapsycologist investigating the hauntings, and Zelda Rubinstein steals scenes as the mysterious clairvoyant brought in to "clean house". The acting is great, but it's the Oscar-nominated special effects that dominate. Wow! This horror film is a must-see!***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is a tremendously overrated movie. I watched it again the other day for the first time in 20 years and had the exact same reaction as the first time. The plot simply doesn't hold together.There are too many elements introduced in the story, or hinted at, and many of them are never explained properly or "paid off" later. It's classic mediocre scriptwriting. Steven Spielberg is a terrific director, but a middling writer. He wrote this story, about some of his childhood fears and recollections, and the movie plays like a disjointed series of set pieces, which are only partially related by a poorly thought-out framing story.First it's about unsettled ghosts. Then it's hinted in one scene that Satan is involved somehow. This, and how it relates to the ghosts, is never explained. Then corpses start breaking through the ground. So why now, some 6-7 years after the house was built over the graves? Where have all these spirits been for 7 years?? Again, this is never explained. And why only in this one house, if the whole subdivision was built over the graves? And what's the deal with the tree that grabs the son and tries to devour him? Can anyone tell me what the hell this has to do with the rest of the story as it plays out, because I sure can't! Just another action set piece.And in classic bad script fashion, the characters suddenly start acting clueless in order to further the action. After all that's just happened, the family decides to spend one more night in the house and the mother lets her children sleep in the same room which was the center of all the evil?? OH, PLEASE! Even Tobe Hooper's direction is slow and plodding, and many of the scenes just don't pack the wallop they should. IMDb states that Spielberg held Hooper back, so this may not have been his fault, but it's still a problem with this movie.I'm sorry if these complaints seem nit-picky, but I don't think they are. Any good movie, including a good horror one, needs to be coherent and have things make sense and be understandable. Poltergeist simply has too many irons in the fire and it comes off as disjointed and unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly spooky and disturbing horror film from the early-1980s that will make you jump from your seat. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams seem to lead a normal life. He is a successful real estate agent and she is a loving housewife. They have three beautiful children, but one night all that slowly changes. The youngest child (Heather O'Rourke) starts talking to unseen spirits through a scrambled television station. The parents don't think much of it, until furniture starts to move on its own. However, the real terror does not start until O'Rourke is taken to another dimension by "the TV people". Now paranormalists led by Beatrice Straight must come in and try to get O'Rourke back to her family. Tobe Hooper, who is best known for the highly over-rated "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", does an admirable job here with the film's direction. However, it is rumored that Steven Spielberg came in during his "E.T" days and did the bulk of the work. This makes more sense as the film is really frightening and disturbing. The special effects are also impressive and "Poltergeist" ends up being one of those films that just sticks with you for a long time after you first see it. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing piece of work!!! Horror at it's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been one of my all time favorites for more than ten years. Like many other people in the '80s, the first time I saw this movie it scared the hell out of me.I compliment on the fact that there is no bloodspilling or graphic violence or even a single killing in the movie to make this movie sensationally scary. It relies on those trendy '80s special effects to make the movie truly frightening.I still think this movie is scary, because I have always found supernatural forces and things that are out of the ordinary in this world to be more frightening than some idiotic blond woman being chased by an ax-wielding maniac. The script is so well written, the acting heartfelt and wonderful, and the direction and production techniques are top-notch. I have never seen horror movies embody all those elements since "The Exorcist."For those of you who have not seen this movie, SEE IT! It may not scare you like today's modern horror flicks, but it will sure entertain and enlighten you. Has a horror movie ever done that????????????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to Twilight Zone Episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic movie. One thing I want to point out is that the disappearance of the little girl into another dimension was the premise of a classic Twilight Zone episode aired in 1962 entitled "Little Girl Lost". If you come across it in reruns, check it out. Many of JoBeth Williams' reactions are seemingly taken from this Twilight Zone episode about a little girl who disappears into another dimension during the night. Poltergeist has many more elements to it( the poltergeist, of course, the monster, the tree outside, and the appearance of the Indian burial ground), but the initial disappearance of the little girl is straight from this Twilight Zone episode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Cuesta Verde suburb, in California, the real state agent Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) lives a comfortable life with his wife Diane (Jobeth Williams) and their children Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins) and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). Now Steve has decided to build a swimming pool for the family. One night, the Freelings witness Carol Anne talking to the static in their television set and telling that they are here. On the following days, the family witnesses weird events in their house and Carol Anne vanishes. Steve and Diane visit the parapsychologist Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight) from the university and she goes with her team to the Freelings' house. Soon she realizes that the family is living a poltergeist phenomenon. Further, Steve has a conversation with his chief Mr. Teague (James Karen) and learns that the community was built on a former cemetery. Will they be capable to retrieve Carol Anne from the demon that is holding the little girl?"Poltergeist" is a horror movie written and produced by Steven Spielberg but directed by Tobe Hooper due to the contract of Spielberg of exclusivity while making "E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial" film. "Poltergeist" can be considered a classic of the horror genre, with an original story of haunted house. There are two sequels and one remake of this movie but none of them comparable to the original film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Poltergeist: O Fenômeno" ("Poltergeist: The Phenomenon")</fullReview>

A family of 5 is tormented by paranormal forces in their house, and they employ paranormal investigators to help them.The film is good for the acting, the special effects and make up work especially in the end, and all this 30 years ago in cinema is noteworthy. But it's hardly scary?with luck, maybe some kids will get scared nowadays. the film is slow paced for the first quarter and then picks up speed. It's more of an investigation thriller film initially, and then changes it's theme. But it's definitely better and not even comparable to Friday the 13th films, which are just nonsense.5 stars...lemme see how part 2 is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to the likes of horror flicks, Poltergeist has got to be one of the all-time, most over-rated pieces of movie-junk that I have ever seen. There's no ifs, ands, or buts, about it.From start to finish, Poltergeist is nothing but an over-blown, thoroughly obnoxious mess of a horror movie. Its story escalates (at break-neck speed) into one of the stupidest 'hauntings' imaginable.There's absolutely no subtlety, or artistic restraint in evidence anywhere in this flick. We, the viewer, are literally bulldozed to death, and then buried alive by an onslaught of preposterous special effects that are only there to distract us from the plain, simple truth that - "THIS FLICK REALLY SUCKS!!" Just like The Shining - I cannot figure out, for the frickin' life of me, why so many people continue (32 years later) to still make such a ridiculous fuss over this one. Let's face it - Poltergeist isn't that good. It isn't! For one thing - Not only are all of the kids in Poltergeist totally revolting and worthy of being slaughtered within the first half hour of this flick, but the adults are definitely in need of a good decapitation, too. It's true. One can't help but loathe every last one of them.And on top of all of that - Would someone please tell me - What sort of a Property Development Company builds a subdivision of homes right on top of a goddamn graveyard, and only moves the frickin' headstones to another location, and leaves the actual coffins still buried there in the ground? Eh? Who?? Like, am I expected to accept, without question, that during the initial excavation of all of this property (laying sewer pipes, creating basements, building swimming pools, etc., etc.) that not a single, solitary coffin was ever dug up at this point? And - Am I also supposed to believe the the entire construction crew working on this project were actually all in on this conspiracy not to move any of the graves, and so they just built everything around them? C'mon, now! That's just plain preposterous and idiotic.When you seriously consider the illogical aspect of it all - Poltergeist simply comes out as being just a really dumb horror movie. Its story is an absolute insult to the intelligence of even the most average-thinking person.So, there! As some sort of compensation for my attitude towards this flick - It gives me the greatest of pleasure to know that behind the scenes of this flick's production, Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper were at each other's throats constantly over the direction of Poltergeist. Things got so nasty between these 2 that Hooper was eventually removed from his directorial duties, and Spielberg, himself, took over the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not without merits - but it certainly is no classic. It's aged badly, the characterisation is poor, and there are at least a dozen things about it that really grate, e.g.; the fact that the whole film is an excuse to use special effects; the fact that everyone blindly accepts the existence of ghosts and attributes any strange happenings to them without considering any other explanation; the cheesy horror clichés; the annoyingly sickly suburban family; the odd moral of the tale (treat those corpses with respect or else!); the American-dream-gone-wrong theme which doesn't quite work (given the fact that this is a 10 on the daft scale); and, last but not least, the fact that one of the paranormal investigators is scared half to death by the crawling meat scene; and yet ten minutes ago, he was happily documenting dozens of levitating objects flying around a bedroom.That said, the special effects are quite good for the time, and the acting does it's best with such a daft story. At this point, you may be thinking; "this guy just doesn't like the genre". Not true; but in my opinion, effective, truly scary horror is created by the maxim "less is more" - not the more is more approach that Spielberg has employed successfully in other films, and less well here. A disappointment; go watch Ring instead for truly creepy television antics.One last thing; it's appalling this got a PG in the US. One particularly disgusting scene involving peeling flesh is clearly unsuitable for kids, and I can imagine this giving young children nightmares, as hokey as it is. I suggest your kids should be at least twelve before you watch this with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magic carpet ride for the senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films really take you on a ghost train ride and this film does it with style. This is obviously the main reason for watching it. The other reason for watching is that it so much more than just a ghost train ride. This film is actually beautiful. From Jerry Goldsmiths wonderful score, I.L.M's SFX still looking good after thirty years and still better than some things out now. Mathew F Leonetti's photography and last but not least, the cast; especially JoBeth Williams, Craig T Nelson and Beatrice Straight. These actors prove themselves as dramatists and make us believe what we see.In my humble opinion they all do a great job of bringing the drama. For me, these are the reasons to watch this film again and again. This film brings to life the horror comic book story's I loved as a kid like Tales from the Grave and The Nightcomers. Unlike a lot of tales of the supernatural on film lately,it is not spending an hour watching a door open slightly due to perhaps an unseen presence or maybe subsidence. This is seeing the door being ripped off its hinges by a force that has dropped the veil and allowed us to glimpse the howling twisted monster that awaits us on the other side and all in Metrocolor. Rather than a remote old mansion in an over gloomy setting, we are placed within the sun-kissed California hills, in a valley under a cobalt blue sky with an ordinary family whose youngest child Carol Anne becomes the conduit for the souls of the dead propelled by a terrible evil enabling them to escape the world of the dead and break through roaring, laughing and screaming into the world of the living with CarolAnne exclaiming Their heeeeeere!!!. Craig T Nelson is just superb as Steven Freeling being the man-in-the-sketch and JoBeth Williams as the enthusiastic mother and brave matriarch is just fantastic. The whole movie has a Steven King quality and style to it with the slow build reaching to a draw dropping finale.All of it laced with humor and some scenes played for laughs which are very funny. I do believe that this is a classic film and a must see. For me,the film delivered everything I ever wanted from a story of the supernatural.If you haven't seen it yet, then get it! Then get the beers in,the chips n dips, turn down the lights and enjoy. Rob H</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I obsessed with this film when I was a kid. I didn't own a VCR and all I knew was the video box cover which fascinated me with its eerie photo and strange word that I didn't know what meant back then but felt it was creepy. So I finally watched it as a teenager and absolutely loved it! I've seen it many times and although it has some flaws, it is still a film filled with very creative and imaginative sequences that will entertain you like nothing else. The acting is phenomenal, the story is unique, the special effects are still amazing and the soundtrack is heaven! I don't see it as much of a horror film, but a very intense fairy tale where the parents have to do go to incredible lengths to get their daughter back. Brilliant film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is there so much misinterpretation over this film's story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read several reviews of Poltergeist and most people (including Siskel &amp; Ebert)don't seem to have seen the same film as i did! All the criticism surrounding the storyline as how ridiculous and unbelievable it is. Well it's a ghost story, although i've always felt it was closer to a modern day fable in which the parents have to prove their love for their daughter going so far as to having to go to another dimension to retrieve her (well, the mother does that). People keep saying that the ghosts are in the TV and that Carol Anne was sucked into the TV, for Christ's sake, have these people actually watched the film? Another thing is that some critics complain that after the film was over they still didn't get what the spirits wanted and why they targeted the little girl. What about the sequence between Steve Freeling and his boss and the monologue delivered by Tangina where she EXPLAINS what is going on?! Sure, the film is not perfect, there's that infamous edit jump, too much cutesy with the burial of the bird and the lack of complaint from the neighbours about the thundering, thumping, screaming sounds that go on in the house, but it is a fable people! The acting is great, we really care about the characters, and because of some great dramatic sequences with Diane Freeling (brilliantly portrayed by JoBeth Williams)we realize that (SURPRISE!) the film isn't so much about the ghosts and (iconic) special effects, as it is about the drama of parents thrown into a supernatural situation they never saw coming and having to bring their daughter, that they hear THROUGH the TV (she's NOT IN the TV), back into our world. The action sequences are greatly imaginative and entertaining, Jerry Goldsmith's score is his best, being horrific, tense, spectral, childlike and such a masterpiece. I do love this film and wish that people would actually see it instead of making erroneous assumptions about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS POSSIBLE**What is a poltergeist? It is a ghost, which announces its presence with loud noises and the creation of disorder. But the poltergeists in this movie go far beyond that. Directed by Tobe Hooper and produced by Steven Speilberg, "Poltergeist" is (in my opinion) one of the scariest movies of all time. The plotline is very original (written by Speilberg), on how nasty ghosts invade a family home, kidnap the 5-year-old daughter and bring her to the other side, and her parents must battle the ghosts to get her back. Although filmed in 1982, the special effects in "Poltergeist" are very astounding and are done very well (my favorite being the beast esophagus, which manifests grusomely in the children's bedroom closet). Some people who have seen the movie still have nightmares about it two decades later, esspecially the incidents with the malevolent clown doll, and the swimming pool. "Poltergeist" is definately worth watching, for those in neat of excitement.10 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give it a three just because it gave me side-stitches from laughing at its sheer awful-itity. It's downright corny!Good job, Steven Spielberg! You FINALLY managed to produce a horror film that was not horrifying, but left me laughing myself to tears at the dumb characters and the corny effects!I loved the scene with the Corpses in the swimming pool, as it was so hilariously absurd and "just what the woman deserved!" As my mom said, "revenge of the bulldozed corpses!" OH YEAH!I found the movie to be pretty horrible, and the parents exceedingly annoying. This is what the parents did in basic:Carol Anne: "Mommy! Help me, Mommy!" Mom: "Carol Anne? Is-is that you, baby?" *slowly approaches* "Are-are you okay?" Then later: Mom: "Oh, Steve, look at that shiny door." Dad: "Oh, I think our kids are behind that door." Mom: "Do you think they're okay?" Dad: "Mmm...no, probably not." Mom: "Oh. Okay. Let's make out." Dad: "I'm game."MY GOD!I think that if I were them, I would grab Carol Anne and R-U-N. I mean, put those kids back in the room where Carol Anne was sucked in? Oh, yes, and let's have the mother take a bath. And dry her hair so she can't hear her kids' desperate cries for help! Yeah! That's perfect!Good job, Steve. You finally managed to produce a movie that matches "War of the Worlds," your other terrible movie, in its own horror. I'm not sure which I'd rather watch, "War of the Worlds" and puke because of the images or "Poltergeist" and yank my hair out while writhing on the floor and screaming at the TV. Really, if the first "Poltergeist" was this bad, I'm scared of what the next two are like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this short and sweet... This film uses special effects that mimmicks that of Ghost Buster's. If cartoon finger's coming out the TV, Oak tree's coming alive and vacuum cleaner closets scare you, this is definitely the movie for you. If you enjoy a lot of corny, over the top acting and a lot of screaming, this is the movie for you. Grossly overrated but pretty funny in most "scary" parts. This movie didn't age well. Probably a good movie for a teen girl pyjamas party.. If you want a good horror experience that'll scar you for life I suggest The Exorcist, Babadook or Frontier instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And don't forget the tree...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iconic '80s horror movie that eschews the traditional spooky tropes in favor of bringing avenging spirits to a contemporary California housing development. Without putting too fine a point on it or preaching, "Poltergeist" critiques relentless, consequence-free Reagan-era American optimism, in which past sins and omissions can be ignored and replicated because Profit!!, until the overlooked decide they've had enough. The movie only leaves the ticky-tacky, sunny and stormy suburban setting for two brief scenes, which helps it build a blandly claustrophobic atmosphere. "Cuesta Verde" is a place where, as one minor character observes, the houses all look alike, where people are so packed in that your neighbor's remote can change your TV channel, and where the phased planning aims to corral past, present and future residents in a manner that extracts maximum value. A lot of factors have helped enshrine "Poltergeist" as a modern classic, from the back-and-forth exhortations about going into the light (or not!) to Zelda Rubenstein's memorable turn as a psychic to the sad tale of Heather O'Rourke (who utters the film's most famous line, "They're here..."), but beyond all that it remains as gripping, entertaining and watchable as it was when it debuted. And for those of us of a certain age, it provides a reminder that networks used to go off the air and that sometimes the best idea is to turn off the TV.</fullReview>

I vaguely remember seeing Poltergeist as a kid, my main memory of Poltergeist is where the boy get's dragged under the bed by the evil clown at the bottom of his bed, it always scared me back then, especially knowing we had a very similar clown down in the cellar.I recently watched Poltergeist again with my girlfriend, although this time i was not scared by any particular scene in the movie, it still has an eerie dark feel to it. I also noticed a lot of cheesy effects and some pretty poor acting to be honest but that all that being said, i think Poltergeist was always meant to be sort of a kid's horror film,and a great one at that.Although personally my favourite film directed by Tobe Hooper is the cult classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Poltergeist is firmly ranked in second.Overall Poltergeist is a movie definitely worth watching. If you can overlook a few cheesy effects with a tad bit of bad acting here and there then Poltergeist is a must see. Much to love, little to hate.7 out of 10Mr. Massacre</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "classic"??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist (1982) Is a huge Spielberg "classic" or "masterpiece", or at least it is supposed to be. I will say this to start off with, the special effects in poltergeist are actually very cool and entertaining, especially for 1982. So that is one positive, impressive creative special effects and visuals! Also, the cast did well with their source material. But the big issue I took with the movie, was the bad script and boring pacing and how terribly non scary this is. It's so true that this movie has no scared at all, I did not jump once or feel scared or tense. Also, I just became bored many times throughout the movie, I was catching myself checking the time, and wishing it would hurry the heck up! Just goes to show you that good acting and special effects cannot be the only good things in a film, it must have a well put together script and the pace must be timed correctly. And if you are creating a horror film, here's a little hint, actually make it scary! 4/10 for Poltergeist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of the movie is somewhat inaccurate, because what is happening in Poltergeist is a full-fledged supernatural manifestation involving kidnapping children into nether realms, and a gateway to hell in the closet. This is not a mischievous manifestation knocking pictures off the wall.Tobe Hooper, Spielberg's director of choice, does an excellent job in keeping the pace going. Events are exciting, exhilarating, and scary (though never too scary), and the special effects are top notch.The cast are all excellent, and Jerry Goldsmith's music is terrific, too.It is terribly sad to note the tragically early deaths of the girls playing the two daughters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made me afraid to enter a kitchen after dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie premiered on HBO in June 1983, I was almost 14, and it scared the living beJesus out of me. A pivotal scene in the movie left a lasting impression so that 24 years later, if I hear a noise in the kitchen, I turn the light on first. The special effects were the talk of the town in 83. Now they were so cheesy. Could you imagine the film if it was made with today's technology? Still, it has managed to with stand the test of time, not many horror films can claim that one.The one thing that gets on my nerve is the talk of a "curse". I did some research on another movie classic, GWTW, and this is what I found:Poltergeist I (1982) Dominique Dunn (homicide)1982 Beatrice Straight (pnuemonia) 2001Poltergeist II (1986) Julian Beck (stomach cancer)1985 Will Sampson (heart/lung surgery complications)1987 Geraldine Fitzgerald (alzheimers)2005 Susan Peretz (breast cancer)1995Poltergeist III (1988) Heather O'Rourke (cardiopulmonary arrest) 1988GWTW (1939) Clark Gable (cardiac arrest)1960 Vivien Leigh (TB)1967 Leslie Howard (Murdered by Nazis)1943 Thomas Mitchell (cancer)1962 Barbara O'Neill (cancer)1952 Hattie McDaniel (breast cancer)1952 Butterfly McQueen (3rd degree burns)1995 George Reeves (gunshot to head)1959 Oscar Polk (undetermined)1949TWO main actors died and FIVE supporting actors died in relation to Poltergeist. GWTW had SEVEN main actors and TWO supporting die. Plus many of GWTW stars were divorced numerous times. Is there a curse? I don't know. Heck, we all die. Are we all "CURSED"? I watch movies for entertainment, not to keep a scorecard. Also, Heather O'Rourke and Julian Beck were the only two to die DURING filming. And Heather was 12, not 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic 80's horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: A sometimes confusing yet wonderfully-told ghost story.I was warned before that this was too scary for me. While it wasn't that scary the way it was when it was released in 1982, "Poltergeist" is a must-see horror flick. It still keeps the interesting story, neat special-effects, colorful script and maybe even some scenes that would give you the creeps. This film is tells the story of a family forced to fight evil forces from beyond the grave when they invade they're subtle home. Steven Spielberg wrote the story, so expect it to be as good as it can get. Tobe Hooper directs, so expect it to have classical touches of horror and some mixes of humor. And, as written by Steven Spielberg (who was, at the time, also working on the similarly Suburban-set E.T.), the movie follows the exploits of some very interesting characters. Think of it as CLONE ENCOUNTERS with supernatural forces. While there is not much gruesomeness in this horror film, it tends to give you the creeps in a different, but effective way. Instead, Spielberg makes us care for some colorful characters in plight of some imaginative, often mind-boggling, horrors. The result is another classic that brings to mind the cliché "they don't make 'em like this anymore". Still a must-see. Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film back in 1990 and have loved it ever since. "Steven Spielberg's" story about a family haunted by ghosts in their suburban home is a very thought out and chilling tale of the family's fight to save their daughter "Carol Anne" who has been taken to the other side by the paranormal forces at work."Heather O'Rourke" was the perfect choice to play "Carol Anne" and was an absolute sweetheart (she died sadly in 1988). "JoBeth Williams" and "Craig T. Nelson" play the lead roles of the parents (reprised in "II") and are very convincing, you could really relate to the family and believe what was happening to them. I always thought "Zelda Rubinstein" was the perfect choice when I first saw her appear as "Tangina" and she always managed to keep you hooked with her spooky theories about what is actually happening to young Carol Anne trapped on the other side. Jerry Goldsmith's music score for this film is also just fantastic and really adds dimension to the surroundings, along with a terrific lullaby theme for Carol Anne. He later scored the 1986 sequel which is also highly remembered amongst film score listeners.This picture definitely has its classic moments, the tree, the clown, the closet and cute little Heather O'Rourke saying the classic tag-line, "They're here!". If you are into ghost stories? Then you must see the grand daddy of them all, if you have not already managed to. It's right up there with my other three favorite ghost stories "Lady in White", "The Sixth Sense" and "The Others". Be sure to catch "Poltergeist II: The Other Side" as well.... but you would do very well to steer clear of the shockingly bad "Poltergeist III".Poltergeist is to this day still one of the best ghost stories around and is a classic tale worthy of its hugely successful impact during the 1980s.</fullReview>

How wrong was I, this was one of the only film's that truly frighted me and prevented me sleeping that night after viewing (all i could think of was a toy clown doll hiding under my bed). After meeting what seem like friendly ghosts (moving chairs and stuff), the family take a turn for the worst when the youngest daughter is taken away. Violent while still being atmospheric and greatly frightening, this is a true horror film in every sense of the word. The clown on the chair in the kids bedroom was built up so much, constantly worrying us throughout the film. The best thing was the "they think it's all over" ending.

		<fullReview>I do remember seeing this at the age of maybe 6 or 7 but of course I could not remember it entirely clearly. I managed to see it later when I was about 13 and it to me will always be a classic horror.Yes, the effects may be a little outdated but this film does not rely on effects to make it good. The acting is particuarly good my favourite being Carol Anne Freeling played very well by Heather O'Rourke (R.I.P).Basic story: The Freeling family - The husband and father Steve, the wife and mother Diane, the only son Robbie, the eldest daughter Dana and the youngest child Carol Anne live in a fairly big house in a fairly quiet place. But they are not alone in the house spirits roam the house terrorising the people in it and the youngest daughter Carol Anne who the spirits seem to centre around is taken through way of pulling her through the TV.Poltergeist is creepy and quite touching in parts and I really like the song with the children singing that plays through the end credits.If you want a real classic horror, this is the one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic horror show about things that go bump in the night, Poltergeist promises to scare you: and it does! When Poltergeist first begins, it seems as though it will just be another spooky movie. However, once the first half concludes, the movie shows you one scare after another. The swimming pool scene may make you jump out of your skin! (Literally!) Craig T. Nelson is just fine as the concerned father and JoBeth Williams is stunning as the intrigued mother. However, it is Zelda Rubenstein who steals the show as the zany medium. As an added plus, the phenomenal music sets the perfect mood for the film and the movie ends leaving you feeling very unsettled, just as a good horror movie should. So if you are looking for a well-written, stylish ghost story, Poltergeist is just that. But there is plenty of gore, too. Enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not really into horror movies, but Poltergeist is in a class by itself. Yea, it's a horror flick, however it's also hysterically funny in parts, and very moving in others. Poltergeist was released about the same time as ET, and I think the phenomenal success of that film took away a lot of much-deserved attention and praise for Poltergeist. This is a brilliant film. A great story, stunning special effects and fine performances by all of the actors. Most notably JoBeth Williams as the loving and caring mother. It's amazing to me that she was not nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe. Her performance is riveting, and she is pivotal in making an incredible story believable. If you want to have a really enjoyable time being scared, don't miss seeing Poltergeist. Even the term "Modern Day Horror Classic" doesn't do it justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching this movie as a child and it terrified me that I wouldn't go to sleep and I would have terrible nightmares of these ghosts frightening me and my family.Now that I'm older, I can actually watch it and say 'Hey! It's not scary!!' but deep down it's terrifying.The best 80's horror flick ever released still terrifies audiences even today. The reason it does so well is because it doesn't rely on blood, gore or an axe murder chasing you. It's based on ghosts simply frightening you to death.Lots of awesome special effects and stunning performances, especially by the star of show Heather O'Rourke, who plays Carol Ann Freeling. She did an amazing job for a young child actress. The rest of cast was very good too and Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson who play Carol Ann's parents also did a good job.The real thing about the movie is that stories about haunting's and Poltergeist intrusions are very common these days. I doubt that any child would be sucked into a closet and kept hidden from her family by these ghosts, that would take a lot of proof. I do believe things like this happen to many families and there should be more movies like Poltergeist released.It just does prove that what you can't see will hurt you!I give it 9/10!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films.. not only is it scary but the story is held together from beginning to end. It also has the same stigma as "Rebel Without a Cause" believing to have been cursed since 2 of its stars, Dominique Dunne and Heather O'Rourke died young. JoBeth Williams is excellent in this as the mother who notices the strange going-ons in the house- this is not your typical ghost spook. It involves every element of scare possible and it goes into full detail about the supernatural and doesn't leave anything unexplained. Very satisfying and it is no surprise that Steven Spielberg helped make this movie. Too bad the sequels don't live up to this one though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated; one of my all-time favorite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a species, we odd beings known as humans mark the passage of time in a variety of odd ways. Some keep pictures, whereas others may travel to specific locations on an anniversary. Me? I watch certain films each year at particular times, for they either remind me of that time of year, were released at that time originally, or give me a general 'feeling' that can only come from being wrapped up in them. The original Poltergeist belongs in that category. It puts me in the mindset of a fall evening, when the howling, cool wind carries a bite that only a thin-skinned child can feel. It also calls back to a time when the nuances of a house frightened me, when I assumed that things going bump in the night were after me, and when the fear of being lost was tantamount to death itself. Directed by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre veteran Tobe Hooper, but crafted by Steven Spielberg (we can argue about that later), Poltergeist is a film that has affected me deeply in different ways at different points in my life. It remains one of the best films of the genre, darned near a masterpiece of spiritual and familial terror.I was near the tender age of 5 when I first saw the film, as it aired on broadcast TV for the first time. For some unknown reason, my parents felt I was up for the experience. After all, it was rated PG; a rating that was clearly inaccurate for the terrors and occasional gore on-screen. However, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and the furor surrounding its' gore was still two years away, and thus the MPAA had yet to develop the PG-13 rating. I remember feigning my bravest face after it was over, wanting my parents to continue bestowing those special privileges upon me. Inside, my stomach churned. Like any child that dealt with a menacing-looking tree, static on an analog television, or a creepy stuffed animal their family thrust upon them, it was clear that Poltergeist spoke directly to me.As I learned later in life, that may have been close to Spielberg's intention. Like E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, released a week later in 1982, he framed this story through the lens of a child's experience. Children can be easily frightened by stuffed animals, or thunderstorms, dark closets, or even a misshapen tree. Parents generally try to assuage them, and over time they overcome those irrational fears. Poltergeist is intimately aware of those fears, and they're all systematically brought to life in the film. The scary tree will eat you, clowns are evil, and the closet literally will come after you. In this film, the cozy comforts of a friendly neighborhood and a cookie-cutter home cannot save you. From a parent's perspective, all the safeguards we build up around our children, all the rules about talking to strangers, the fears we allay in our kids- this film boots them to the side, praying on our "parent" brain as well. The film begins with that innocent, sweet tone, slowly lurking in the shadows to take everything precious and stomp on it.Spielberg and crew made a smart, timely film that tore into the very fabric of baby boomers' suburban dreams. Representing the now aging demographic is Steven Freeling (Nelson). He's the consummate post- hippie salesman father, passively parenting his children, selling carbon copy real estate like an old pro, escaping in aggressive Sunday football parties and beers with the exuberance of a frat boy. His wife Diane (Williams), still riding that wave of hippie bliss, has yet to encounter her primal, maternal self at the beginning of the film. Perhaps it's the pot residue, but the most trying thing she seems to encounter are misplaced clothes and the death of the family bird. They're living the dream, or at least the Reaganomics version of the dream. Even their kids are cute and relatively well- behaved, if not also blissfully unaware. The dynamic can be summed up in a scene where Carol Anne (O'Rourke) is gently chided for staring at static on the screen for it will "hurt her eyes"; Diane changes the channel, apparently fine with the war film now on the tube instead. Oh, the irony!Then it starts to happen. Carol Anne is caught talking to the 'TV people' in the dead of the night, the house appears to quake, and household objects move themselves. At first, Steven and Diane think it neat, like a trippy magic trick; then comes the menace of the trippy magic trick, the snatching of the 'WASP' dream. Carol Anne is taken somewhere, Robbie (Robins) is nearly devoured, and Dana (Dunne) is hysterical. Steven, against his beliefs, consults a parapsychology team at the local college. This motley crew, led by Dr. Lesh (Straight) and the odd, diminutive Tangina (Rubenstein), quickly learn that the Freeling's predicament far exceeds the excitement of a time-lapse video. In the span of fifteen minutes in the film, we go from seeing this relatively normal family deal with a standard, nighttime thunderstorm to being completely strung out in immeasurable grief, pleading with pseudo-science for assistance. This paranormal spirit that envelops the Freeling house succeeds in luring the family into a false sense of security, then it viscerally "breaks on through to the other side". What follows is a series of unexpected, thrilling, deeply moving scenes that play with the notions of life, death, instinct, and fear.Read the full review here: http://filmfanperspective.com/2015/05/20/classic-film-review- poltergeist-1982/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking horror film that builds up suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I greatly enjoyed this movie. I saw it today on DVD and I was absolutely thrilled during most of the movie (although the first 20 minutes or so don't quite manage to grab you that well, it makes up for it with the last hour and a half). The movie is about a family: The parents, their son and two daughters (plus one SUPER CUTE adult golden retriever). When the daughter, Carol Anne, starts communicating with some strange entities through the family television set, the house becomes haunted, and the family enlists a group of paranormal investigators (ala ''Insidious'', which copies LOTS of elements from this film.).The film is perfectly cast, each actor delivering its respective roll in a n almost perfect manner, which adds to the suspense and atmosphere of the film. It's so sad that two members of the cast horribly died some months after the film's release, leading to many people foolishly thinking the film was CURSED.The special effects are great for its time. For example, the part when one of the investigators hallucinates himself ripping its face off looks stunning, and due to how real it may look for some people, may have to be fast forwarded for younger audiences. The scare and tension level is pretty high during the last half hour, and scared the crap outta me.The music is awesome, and helps create the haunting atmosphere for the movie. Although, the soundtrack alone wouldn't be much fun, so I wouldn't encourage you to buy the soundtrack. Overall, I loved the film. Go see it, you'll have a lot of fun. And like Steven at the end of the movie at the motel, you might be compelled to kick your TV set out the door/window before you go to sleep ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghost train ride put on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Spielberg-produced haunted house horror POLTERGEIST is one of those perennial favourites, one of those classic 1980s films that survives down the years, my appreciation growing as each decade passes. It's one of those films I saw and loved as a kid, although I found it very frightening; THAT bathroom scene has to go down in history as one of the most purely disgusting ever put on screen. It's highly stylised, and Hollywoodised with it; if you're looking for something more realistic and disturbing, go check out THE ENTITY instead. This one's all about the spectacle, a fairground ghost train ride put on film.Elsewise, POLTERGEIST works very efficiency. There's the slow, creepy build-up, kept realistic and almost-believable, especially the effective stuff with the sliding chairs; intrigue builds upon intrigue, with some nice comic relief inbetween, and then everything lets rip for the pyrotechnic shriek-show in the second half. This latter stage is a masterwork of special effects technology, from miniatures to superimposed imagery and prosthetic effects work; I don't usually care for films that rely on FX too heavily but I'll make an exception for this one.And what a cast, too! Heather O'Rourke must be the epitome of the innocent young American girl caught up in a world of evil, and both Nelson and Williams excel as the exasperated parents who gradually become more deranged as the tale progresses. Of course, Zela Rubenstein's scene-stealing medium is remembered for a reason, and there's a nice little cameo for RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD's James Karen, too. Come the ending, with those graves popping out of the ground, well just wow: this truly is a great little film, that stands proud among the rest of the classics of the '80s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This known story deals about the suburban Freeling family(Craig T Nelson,JoBeth Williams,Heather O'Rourque and Dominique Dunne,Griffin Dunne's sister) that encounter its house invaded by weird ghosts who abduct their six years old little girl named Carol Anne(Heather O'Rourke). The parents hire a psychics(Beatrice Straight, Richard Lawson and Zelda Rubinstein) to resolve it.Excellent terror story plenty of screams,chills,thrills and a little bit of humor. God and dazzling though primitive special effects by Richard Edlund. Suspenseful, frightening musical score by the master Jerry Goldsmith. Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti.This hight budgeted movie is surprisingly written and well produced by Steven Spielberg. Director Tobe Hooper puts accent on suspense and atmosphere as in terror happenings. What transpires in the two hours longtime is a thriller that will leave you physically and emotionally drained. Horror fans should be entertained.Followed by two inferior sequels with little common sense and coherence, as Poltergeist II(1986) by Brian Gibson with similar casting and Poltergeist III(1988) by Gary Sherman with Tom Skerrit, Nancy Allen, Lara Flynn Boyle and Heather O'Rourke who died after the movie's release at 12 age, while his sister Dominique Dunne died at 22 years old killed by her boyfriend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist is a creative piece of Hollywood gold. To say that this movie is good is an understatement; it is a wild ride through the world of the supernatural. I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good scare on a Saturday night. After literally hundreds of views, i still find this movie to be an exciting adventure for anybody who is looking for a creep-fest. The part with the steak and the maggots is sheer genius. It is very unfortunate that a couple of the cast members died, and they will be missed; especially Heather O'Rourke, who died (matter subject to debate) either after or during the shooting of the third and final Poltergeist.Veya Con Dios, Heather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best acted movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that a good portion of the film "Poltergeist" was acted out by children, 5-year old Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) and 8-year old Robbie (Oliver Robins) and still say that it was a great acted movie might sound strange. But it was. In my opinion, O'Rourke was the best child actress of the 80s, if not in history. Robins, although he never became largely-known, did a surprisingly fantastic job in "Poltergeist." Also, 18-year old Dana (Dominique Dunne), the parents (JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson), and the psychics were also just as good. (Considering that none of the actors in this movie ever became large stars with the possible exception of Nelson)Also, the rest of the movie was great. The special F/X were adequate for 1982, the plot was interesting, and "Poltergeist," unlike "Nightmare on Elm Street," "Friday the Thirteenth," et cetera, did not rely on blood and gore. In fact, those stupid slasher movies will never have the same singular effect as did "Poltergeist." And, if anything, it was underrated. Have you ever seen "Poltergeist" on any 'top 100' movies or referred to very often? Poltergeist should get the respect it deserves, like "The Exorcist." It should be rereleased into theatres in 2002, the 20-year anniversary.I shall not give away the storyline for those of you who have not seen the movie, but if you haven't, rent it. It is simply wonderful. It is "the first (and only) real ghost story."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely Creepy Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very popular film amongst myself and my peers when it came out in the early 1980s . One major reason for its success is melding the mundane setting of middle class middle America with a supernatural premise similar to THE EXORCIST from ten years earlier . This is summed up with the scene as Steven and Diane Freeling knock on their neighbours door and as they are bitten by mosquitoes they ask if their neighbours know of any supernatural occurrences at their house . We can all relate to our homes and our homes becoming resident to evil spirits is a bit too scary to contemplate . It also touches on child abduction which is a parents worst nightmare The director probably doesn't have too work too hard in scaring the audience with this movie . All he has to do to keep the camera still cut the sound then when he's safe in the knowledge that the audience are settled he turns up the sound full volume and shows a scary image . It's a cheap trick but done perfectly with POLTERGEIST and I would have liked to have seen this on its initial release in the cinema where the audiences popcorn would be hitting the roof There is some debate as to who the real director of the film with many people stating that they believe Spielberg is the true creative force behind the movie . This seems slightly disingenuous to credited director Tobe Hooper and the scene where the man looks in to the mirror , about the only scene where there is genuine gore in the movie , does have the Tobe Hooper trademark as does the use of sound mix and swirling which he used to very great effect in LIFEFORCE three years later Some people might think POLTERGEIST has a rather dated tame look but this is to miss the point as to how films were made 30 years ago . Nowadays everything is a CGI carnival where every film you've seen just looks exactly like the last film you've seen where film makers think creative sequences involve sitting in front of a computer screen . Some of us the good old days whenever that was and POLTERGEIST reminds us of the good old days</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An astounding 114 minutes of entertainment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is without a doubt one of the most astounding cinematic features of all time, both visually and conceptually. Brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg and horror veteran Tobe Hooper ("The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"), this classic ghost story will long be remembered in the film community for its unique and entertaining blend of humor, drama, and raw horror. It is a true masterpiece in its own right, and I urge all interested in the art of cinema to view it at least once. Though once the center of much controversy (many believe Spielberg to be the creative force behind it, as opposed to the credited Hooper) this film combines (at the time of 1982) state-of-the-art special FX from the wizardry of "Industrial Light And Magic," humor and warmth from producer Steven Spielberg, and pure terror from horror master Tobe Hooper.The story concerns the Freeling family. Living in a tract home in the fictional California town of Cuesta Verde, the Freelings are a happy, close-knit family. But when they begin to experience psychic disturbances (furniture moving by themselves, forks bending mysteriously) their lives change forever. It appears that a group of ghosts called "poltergeists" have moved into their home, and although the poltergeists at first seem friendly, they soon become evil. 5 year old Carol Anne Freeling is abducted by the ghosts and taken to an other-worldly dimension, and the Freelings desperately hire 4 psychic investigators to exorcise the house of the evil spirits and bring back the innocent Carol Anne. When Carol Anne is finally rescued in a visually stunning sequence, the Freelings are ready to pack up their belongings and move out--but will the ghosts let them??This film is a must-see for horror fans alike. It features wonderful editing by Michael Khan, beautiful acting, electric photography by Matthew Leonetti, and a breathtaking original score by Jerry Goldsmith (the classic sound track has evolved into an international hit).More importantly, this film is a solid reminder of the fine acting talents of the late Heather O'Rookey and Dominique Dunne, who both died at an early age.If you're looking for a genuinely "good" horror film that doesn't simply rely on gore and bloody make-up, than rent "Poltergeist"--you won't forget it!10/10 **********</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Haunted House Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides The Shining of course. Poltergeist however is a visually stunning ghost story made by Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper.The film centers around a middle class family of 5. They live comfortably in their suburban development, until one night they discover unseen evil under their house. The evil spirits gradually progress until they've literally kidnapped the family's youngest daughter. Now, the Freeling family must find a way to get her back. May seem a bit silly/cliché but is still a scary knockout in every sense.Some of the effects have dated a bit but that's not the point. The acting is great, especially the always entertaining Zelda Rubenstein as the lead paranormal expert. The atmosphere is creepy and there are plenty of great scenes along the way. And the fact that the story could go with almost every American middle class family, and the feeling that this sort of thing could happen to you, is great. If you come across this in the video store, then see it!BTW, please dismiss the sequels and countless ripoffs. This is much better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'To her it is simply another child. To us it is the Beast.'The legacy of this film can be witnessed by the multitude of derivative productions it has left in its wake, yet its reputation and iconic status has also suffered in the same regard. It also bears the unmistakable influence of its writer and producer, who despite not helming this landmark supernatural tale, ensured it was imbibed with his trademark mix of suspense and humour, and furnished with state-of-the-art visual effects. It is just a reflection of the great strides such technical expertise has undergone that some of these now appear slightly dated. Whatever the truth behind the extent to which Spielberg assumed direction of the project from Tobe Hooper, the reality is that the finished product enjoyed far greater box office success than anything the latter directed since. Contractual obligations in helming 'ET' ensured Spielberg could not direct this feature, but delays in the shooting of his other project, shot just a block away from where this one is set, meant that his presence was nigh constant. What is abundantly clear is the film's success is largely due to focusing the audience's attention on the family undergoing these paranormal events rather than the events themselves. This is pure Spielberg fare, as we share the Freelings' disbelief, fascination, and ultimate terror at the abnormal occurrences which infest their home. The depth of characterisation Spielberg brought to the project provided the vehicle to ignite the acting careers of relative unknowns Craig T Nelson and JoBeth Williams. Indeed, the emotional charge with which the latter portrayed the devotion and protective instincts of a mother to her missing child moves her performance to a calibre far higher than normally adorns this genre of movie-making. In addition, there are superior performances from Beatrice Straight as lead scientist on the team attempting to assist the parents, and Zelda Rubinstein as the diminutive but highly enigmatic medium with greater understanding of the paranormal. Yet, the most noteworthy contribution to the film's ongoing appeal is that from the youngest cast member, Heather O'Rourke, whose short-lived career would become the main talking point behind this franchise. Not all is accounted for by Spielberg's genius , as the focal point of the screenplay - parents' desperate attempts to rescue a child who has slipped through a portal into another dimension - replicates those of a much vaunted episode of the 'Twilight Zone' entitled 'Little Girl Lost'. This is itself adapted from a short story by Richard Matheson, another of whose short stories, 'Duel', marked Spielberg's debut as director. Although criticised by some reviewers for not epitomising true horror, the originality of the screenplay, and ultimately chilling premise for audiences, lay in uprooting a 'haunted house' storyline from the habitual dilapidated ruin on the outskirts, and replanting it right in the heart of modern suburbia. A further inspired touch was the use of 'static' on the TV as the medium through which the abducted child can communicate, thereby transforming this everyday means of entertainment into an object of fear - Spielberg dubbed this production his 'revenge on 'tv'. Moreover, the disembodied, distorted, voice emanating behind the static heightens the tension throughout the rescue attempts. The film's tagline, 'It knows what scares you', serves to reflect the inspiration for many of the film's standout frights, being based largely on the childhood fears of the film's writer and producer. One such scare nearly resulted in real tragedy on set as young Oliver Robbins nearly asphyxiated in his character's life or death struggle with the demonic clown doll, until Spielberg realised the child actor's predicament and stepped in to save him. Another fascinating piece of film trivia concerns the film's barnstorming finale, in that the skeletons used were real, working out cheaper in production costs, and that this fact was deliberately kept from JoBeth Williams. There are obvious holes in the plot, and a glaring piece of atrocious editing. However, the laudable work by the special effects teams would unjustifiably in this reviewer's opinion lose out at the Academy Awards to those working on Spielberg's other project of that year. Likewise, the classy soundtrack provided by Jerry Goldsmith would miss out, but in this case to one of the most emblematic pieces of film score in cinematic history: John William's musical accompaniment to 'ET'. Much wasted attention has been paid to the supposed curse surrounding the production, but suffice to note the tragic irony that the actress portraying the eldest Freeling sibling, spared from sharing the full trauma of the horrors unleashed within the family home, would just three months after the film's release fall victim to domestic abuse, strangled on her doorstep by an estranged former boyfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still relevant after 32 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very mild spoilers.I am slowly introducing my thirteen year old daughter to the (mostly horror) films of my youth. She scares easily so it took a few weeks to talk her into watching this one. Tonight we shared the experience. It was about my tenth time seeing it. "A Steven Spielberg Production" is what the opening and closing credits promise, and this is exactly what we get. In actuality, it's more of a Spielberg/Tobe Hooper hybrid. Anyone familiar with Spielberg's work of the late 70s/early eighties will see the similarities. Kids riding bikes and playing with remote control cars around sprawling residential cul-de-sacs. Period cultural references abound. The kids' room is covered in Star Wars, from the sheets on the bed to the little R2-D2 toys and Chewbacca jacket, as well as the poster on the wall. A Rubix Cube sits on the shelf in the background and by far coolest of all, AN ALIEN POSTER IS PROUDLY DISPLAYED ON THE WALL!!! (see my avatar for significance). Pizza Hut is of course mentioned also (see E.T.). This is not your average Spielberg fare though. There is some weird stuff here. An 8 year old boy is almost eaten by a tree. A woman flounders in a swimming pool full of rotted corpses and skeletons. A man literally rips his own face off. These two latter scenes are where the film becomes more "Hooperesque." Where the film really succeeds is in playing off on our childhood fears. Ghosts of course are the main focus here. Who as a child didn't harbour some sort of fear of ghosts or monsters in the closet? And while we didn't all have one, that damn demonic clown doll is enough to scare the hell out of any child. Even for adults, the memories of those fears are enough to put a few scares into you while watching this movie. Add to that the fear of losing a small child and you up the scare factor a few notches. Zelda Rubinstein is usually mentioned as a standout here, and she does a great job as Tangina, but her part is very small and it is O'Rourke as Carol Anne and Williams as Diane who are the real standouts here. It is really very sad that O'Rourke's life and career were cut short at such a young age. Another thing that needs mentioning is Jerry Goldsmith's score. It evokes emotion in all the right places, and dread very effectively. It is very haunting and melodic. I'd also like to add that jump scares are used here. There are only two or three, but they work, and they work well. For those of you who think that they are just some new plot device improperly and over used in recent film, give this one a re-watch. The only regret I have is that I couldn't take my daughter to the theatre to see this, as I did as a thirteen year old boy almost 32 years ago to this day. Those are my thoughts on Poltergeist. Now with all that said, I can't imagine this remake coming out next year capturing any of the above qualities.</fullReview>

There's creepy things everywhere. The CLOWN is the scariest. Sort of like the Conjuring, but still scary.The family searches for the girl and would probably leave, but there daughter is still missing. So they bring in supernatural type people to help them.There's some funny spots and some gross parts.

		<fullReview>As soon as i'm writing this review, I just finished watching it and I have to say, it was awesome. I have always been a fan of Spielberg's work and seeing Spielberg and Tobe Hopper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre)work together, is kinda cool. I liked the ideas the movie had, i think it might have been inspired by the Twilight Zone episode, Little Girl Lost. Where a little girl gets sucked into a portal and the parents have to get her out. The premise came from that, but with the always awesome 80's effects, good story and entertainment. It makes for a fun time. Two sequels were mad, but sadly most of the cast members died during the making, even Heather O'Rourke died at the age of 12. Many people consider this the Poltergeist curse and also apparently owning all the movies is a bad omen because of it. (I find that kinda ridiculous.)I defiantly recommend seeing this movie, its a must. oh and there is a remake coming in 2014. I might check it out, my only problem already, all the effects are gonna be CGI. I can tell ya that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the big events of my childhood was seeing Poltergeist for the first time at seven years old. I saw it on a 4:3 set on a by-now very old DVD in my parents' bedroom, after my mom had recently come home from the hospital after surgery. One night, my dad came home from the library with some DVDs, and one of them was Poltergeist. I popped it into the DVD player without hesitation because I'd wanted to see it since I was five. I knew from the moment it started, Poltergeist was going to be a great movie, but little did I know it would become my favorite movie of all time, and I'd want to experience it again and again.Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams star in this classic as Steve and Diane Freeling, who live with their three children, sixteen-year-old Dana (Dominique Dunne), eight-year-old Robbie (Oliver Robins), and five-year-old Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) in Cuesta Verde, CA, soon learn that their home is haunted, and also that the spirits talk to Carol Anne through their television. Everything seems normal at first. Dana gives construction workers the finger and talks on the phone later than she's supposed to, Robbie is a huge Star Wars fan, and Carol Anne feeds her goldfish an entire tube of food. One night, a tree tries to eat Robbie, but Steve quickly saves him. When the ghosts kidnap Carol Anne through the closet, they are forced to fight the evil spirit that holds their daughter if they ever want to see her again. Well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, with great special effects, Poltergeist is the greatest ghost story put on film. Let's start with the acting. The performances are top-notch. The way lines are said, the facial expressions, body language, everything about the characters feels real. Craig T. Nelson plays Steve, a husband and father who's willing to do anything to save his family, so believably, nothing about it feels fake. JoBeth Williams plays Diane, a distraught mother, so believably, you'll believe what's happening on screen is hurting her. Heather O'Rourke gives the best performance by a five-year-old ever. Zelda Rubinstein is also great. It doesn't even seem like they're acting. The special effects still hold up, because they still look real. The plot is still very original, because it's set in modern suburban America, and it's about a normal family that loves each other, rather than an abusive husband and father. Poltergeist is so well-written that nobody has to die, nor does it have to be gory to keep us on the edge of our seats. Spielberg and Hooper keep it subtle by hardly showing the ghosts. Poltergeist features a great plot, great acting, great directing, and great writing. I can't recommend Poltergeist enough. Poltergeist is a kid's movie, so it's not all that scary, though there are scenes that may scare you or creep you out, but you won't be scarred for life. In the end it really is a fun thrill ride. Poltergeist is a movie every kid must see by the time they're eight years old. For some reason, I find myself trying to hold back tears every time I see it.Poltergeist is my favorite movie of all time, it is a timeless classic, and it still holds up after over thirty years because it remains a thrilling, warmhearted, and poignant movie experience. Poltergeist tells the story of a family nothing can tear apart. It's a classic good versus evil story, a story of perseverance in spite of your worst fears coming to light, and holding it together in spite of everything seeming to fall apart. It's about never giving up hope. When I watched Craig T. Nelson, I saw my dad on that screen, and I see him on that screen even more now. When I watched JoBeth Williams, I saw my mom on that screen, and I see her on that screen even more now. I know you're probably worried because of things you've read online about it being scary, gory, or boring, but don't be. Gory? Never. Scary? Not at all. Boring? Don't make me laugh. Despite everything that happens, there's a sense of hope, a warmth, that stays the entire movie, and honestly, I think that's what keeps us coming back. Poltergeist has a heart, and that's why it still holds up all these years after its release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The starting set for the movie Poltergeist shows a middle class family living in a regular suburban community, sociologically showing a normal typically American Family that runs into abnormal situations, which eases the audience to identify with what unfolds. Cameras techniques are used to portray the importance of the TV set will have in the film. The scene where images flash on the screen and the camera show Steven Freeling asleep on the couch, are coded masculine. When Carol Anne walks down stairs and talks to the television set it's easy to see the separation of genders when everybody is watching her. Her father (the masculine figure) sits close to her while the feminine figures stand by the stairs watching Carol Anne's "relationship" with the television. We watch television for something; Carol Anne stares at the static images as if there is a meaning in that, creating some tension. After Carol Anne is taken to "the other side", which is where the ghosts are, her voice is heard through the static of the television, what highlights the fact that Carol Anne is by herself in a scary and different place. The "other side" suggests that Carol Anne is in a place considered to be either limbo or purgatory. When the house is declared clean by Tangina it's easy to conclude that her mediumistic capacities are at stake for it's very noticeable that the house is not clean. Family is portrayed as a viable institution (rarely seen in Hollywood) in Poltergeist, even in the context of temporary troubles. Diane Freeling is shown as the moral center of the film. The time frame the movie takes place in refers to a an era where unemployment was rising so the fear of losing your materials can be experienced when the house and its objects are being broken what later leads to the total destruction of the house. Aiming to save money and time the real estate development company built the house on top of a cemetery and just removed the headstones, leaving the corpses buried, what can be the answer to why paranormal activities are happening at the house. When the family faces their last attack they go to a motel and push the TV set out of the room. Suggesting that the TV is a portal to the ghostly world the family just faced. This analysis focus on the elements that bring the audience closer to what characters are experiencing. Many details and techniques used by the producer highlight the important use of camera angles and music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about this movie is that it has a horrifying background for me. When I was about 4 or something young my "wonderful" babysitter invited me into the family room because she wanted to show me something. What she showed to me was the core of my childish nightmares, Poltergeist. Now, I recently watched this movie again to realize it's corny to me now with bad props and awkward acting but back when i was young it scared me to death. I admit, this shouldn't really be rated PG for adult language, blood, and disturbing images to children but whatever the directors and people think i suppose. I just thought this movie was scary back then but now it's just another one of those "horror" movies from the 80's everyone makes such a big deal about. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, just pouring out my thoughts randomly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few aspects of "Poltergeist" have become iconic by now, but one thing's for certain: it gave new meaning to TV snow.And talk about snaring your audience with a false sense of security, this movie opens with that classic Spielberg suburbia - nice family, great neighborhood, somewhat idealized life - and then stuff quickly takes a turn for the dark. Possessed trees, swimming pool skeletons, free-roaming kitchen chairs . . . and those Goldsmith strings aren't doing anybody any favors. There's surprising emotional weight to this movie, and save for the face scene, it plays the psychological horror to tremendous effect.This is beyond spooky.

		<shortDescription>Cheesy as an Adult, But Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first "scary movie" I ever saw, roughly around the time I was six years old. At the time it scared me to death! I remember so many of the scenes being just terrifying--the tree, the eerie slime, the closet portal, etc.Today I watched this movie for the first time since I was a kid, and I was stunned by how different it is as an adult. I had remembered this movie being a Stephen King book turned film, as so many of King's works received such treatment in the 1980's. To my surprise, this film is actually a Steven Spielberg movie--he wrote the screenplay and produced it, while handing the directing role off to the guy who did Texas Chainsaw Massacre. As such, Spielberg's influence is evident throughout the film. As an adult, it's now impossible for me to see "Poltergeist" without thinking of "E.T." or "The Goonies", as the characterization and the style of the film is very similar.Ultimately, it's this same style that makes the movie not all that dramatically scary. It's certainly eerie at certain points, but there's nothing here that makes me look over my shoulder on my way off to bed. Indeed, it's as much fantasy driven as it is horror inclined.All that said, I'm giving the movie 7/10 stars. It kept my attention and I found it to be fun overall, despite the fact that it's not worthy of a greater score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite movie by Tobe Hooper is "The Funhouse." Now that is a sensational movie! So good! I was hooked in the first few minutes of the movie and it just kept getting better and better and then the final scene tops it all off. Wonderful movie.By contrast, I didn't really get into "Poltergeist." I actually just watched this for the first time and I thought, "Eh." One thing I thought that was odd was that they didn't call the police after their child had been missing for a few days. Can you imagine that!? They kinda "know" where the child is, but not really. And also, after the child goes missing, there are lighthearted moments in which people smile, offer comforting, uplifting words of encouragement, and I think someone might have even laughed at some point.Can you imagine that!? Think if your small child was missing - could you smile about anything? I don't think so, I don't think that that's possible. You'd be overwhelmed by anxiety, fear, doubt, and worry.I guess there was just something that didn't add up psychologically. And the son didn't say, "Hey, the tree broke through the window, grabbed me, and threw me out of the house." Nope! Doesn't say a word about it!!! And this is AFTER he mentions that he doesn't like the tree to his father earlier! Ahh, come on.I think this is a really overrated movie. I gave it a 5, and that's just because I like Tobe Hooper. It's probably around a 4 if I'm being honest, but what's the difference anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I take great pleasure in watching some of the classic horror movies like The Omen and The Exorcist from the 70s and 80s. But this just is not one of them. It feels like more of a sci-fi than a scary movie. Pass on this if you like a truly spine-chilling scary movie.The actual plot of the movie makes sense once you get to the end, but the execution just does not. While it was the 80s, the special effects are still a little way over the top and more comical then building to the "fear factor". The movie also meanders a little before finally getting to the supposedly scary stuff. The cast of characters includes your usual ghost busters that come in to save the day...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on Twilight episode?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember this movie, I watched in suspense, definitely a good movie, suspense, drama, scary. But is really a Steven Spielberg original idea? I am a big fan of Twilight zone original series. There is an episode from Mar 9, 1962 with the title "Little Lost Girl". The plot is about a father who woke up in the middle of the night hearing his daughter crying for help, but he can find her. The parents call an expert and he find out she is in another dimension. They actually find a port in a wall of the house, where they can throw things and even enter. Her father enter and look for her and when he rescued her, they came our from the ceiling of the house, just like Poltergeist. Is just pure coincidence that Steven wrote this movie with the same plot as "Little Girl Lost" from 1962?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reel Look: 'Poltergeist'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They're here!" After his success with the low budget but high grossing 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' in 1974, Tobe Hooper would then later go on to collaborate with Steven Spielberg to create another horror cash-in with the 1982 supernatural thriller 'Poltergeist'. But did this 80's film truly define the horror genre altogether? Let's take a look. Set in a California suburb, the plot focuses on the Freeling family whose home is invaded at first by ghosts who seem harmful at first of which would later on become malevolent and abduct the family's youngest daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke), befriending her first via communicating through TV static. At first the evens within the Freeling home are bizarre yet harmless: silverware bends, chairs stack themselves on the kitchen table and furniture moves on its own accord thanks to the "TV people". Dismissing the phenomena as benign, the specters declare their presence known even more so as time goes on, as the son Robbie is nearly swallowed by a gnarly demon tree in a thunderstorm whilst Carol Anne is sucked through a glowing, unearthly portal that emanates from her bedroom closet. As if an evil clown doll, a parapsychologist tearing off his own face and even the petite Zelda Rubinstein herself as a medium who professionally exorcises residences were not enough, Hooper quickly pulls the stops on the treats and the tricks especially at the end that really launches the film into a full-scare frenzy. Why the family doesn't just pack up and leave already is anyone's guess, as the scares intensify and the dread slowly builds set to Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score until the final showdown between the Freelings and "the Beast". Followed by two forgettable sequels, the original is regarded to be the best of the trilogy franchise, grossing $76 million plus in 1982, making it the eighth overall highest gross for a horror film for the year. Frightening, tense and loaded with spooky yet visually creative special effects, Hooper has a ball releasing his thrills and chills on us as Spielberg reveals the darker side of suburbia that indeed defined the horror generation. And yes, I already snub the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror with a plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am usually not bothered by horror films and perhaps it was aided by first watching this at 5 years old - but this film is by far the scariest horror film I have ever seen. I believe this is because unlike most horror films it establishes a plot and also connects with the average person during its time. It is a bit dated now, however I think everyone can still connect with it in some way. Although TV's no longer turn to "snow" we can all still respect storms. We have also all lost pets at some point. Whatever the case this movie grabs at every child's worst nightmare - and brings it alive. Good luck watching this and sleeping well if you are below 50 years old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Horror Film You Can't Go Wrong With</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The week before E.T came out, a little film called Poltergeist was released. Well, the commercials seemed tame enough, the PG rating meant it couldn't be too scary. And especially after seeing E.T on June 11, there was no way that Poltergeist could be anything more than family friendly fun.You see Spielberg was the director of E.T but produced this flick and a lot of people took their kids to see Poltergeist not knowing that it would be...well, what it is.And what is it? It's well-directed, well-shot, and really creepy. It's not a horror movie in the sense of a single entity presiding over the scares. It's not that gory either. It's actually pretty tame considering the time period (the slasher flick genre was picking up steam).That said, the movie is really freaky and maintains the weird from beginning to end. It has a few bumps here and there (the psychics slowed the movie down immensely) but you get a ton of pay off. The effects, for the time, were amazing and many of them are still really good even by today's standards. The story itself is cliché but done so well you won't care.This will scare the crap out of your kids. I wouldn't suggest you show it to them. But it's a truly fantastic piece of cinema and one of my favorite horror films of all time.</fullReview>

You'll be enjoying the ride too much! It's nearly two hours of wonderful, jolting, exciting, 'frightening' fun... and at the end, you're pretty much left with a smile on your face -albeit a 'wind-blown', awkward and slightly relieved one.This film's a blast.If you've not yet seen it, do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're Here... and they're still just as scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is one of those scarier cult movies that you might stumble upon late at night and end up watching the whole thing. Do it. Because it's one of the better 80s horror's that you'll find.We open on a television set, as the American national anthem plays and we see out the end of the broadcast day. Already it's a weirdly creepy film, and the national anthem hasn't been as haunting as this since Hendrix. Set in a quaint little American neighbourhood, kids play, guys drink beer and watch football. With a hand from Spielberg, the town looks like a carbon copy of E.T., but instead of a misguided little alien (the two films were released within weeks of one another) there's something much worse coming for our suburban American family as their house is taken over by ghosts.With a good cast, including JoBeth Williams in a Sigourney Weaver/Carrie Fisher-esque mother/wife role and Heather O'Rourke as the horror-trope creepy/cute child it's decent stuff. But it is Craig T. Nelson who heads the family and leads the cast as the spot-on average man. He's not particularly smart, or even attractive (joking about his gut in the mirror at one point), but here he is perfect as the hauntings worsen, staying strong and believable as the loving father and husband throughout. With some fantastic effects, Poltergeist harnesses both practical (One scene involving a reflection in a mirror is a Scanners-rewind-as-many- times-as-possible-type moment) and digital effects (many scenes remind us of the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, another Spielberg classic) to really get the fear in to us and which, for the most part, still look excellent today.The one noticeable downside is the pacing. I'm not usually a stickler for this, but just after the sixty minute mark that the film seems to sag: While more (arguably interesting) characters are introduced, it slows the pace down to a crawl and leaves the film bland and - worst of all - not that scary. It's not really until the last twenty-five or so that the film starts running again, perhaps even saving the whole picture.Poltergeist is one of those kind of movies that you'll watch, then realise that this is the film that you've been quoting all those times without knowing. Paving the way for (much lesser) scary pics, and referenced time and time again in the likes of the earlier Treehouse of Horrors, Poltergeist is like an art-house Paranormal Activity, a true gem which should be viewed (and enjoyed) as many times as possible before the inevitably terrible remake arrives...Twitter: @JonnyJonJon1</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist (1982)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie poltergeist is a movie about a family living in a nice house which is built over a cemetery. It's a horror movie with some imagination with the inclusion of the dead and a house with spirits. Unlike most horror movies, this movie has lots of bright colors and family togetherness. It is a horror movie without gory scenes.The definition of "Poltergeist" is a ghost or spirit which makes noises and in this movie, the spirits of the dead in the house were making noises. We get straight into action with a TV left on and the little girl talks with it. Although we go through an introduction after that scene, we know that the TV will play a big part throughout. It's further symbolized by the father removing the TV from the motel room. The TV is symbolic as it starts the trouble in the house. The TV keeps getting focused on ? firstly the channel with no images then the men watching football. However, the interesting part is that the channel with no images is the origin of the spirits. The author uses that as if it was an area where those spirits could settle. Since the family members left the TV on, it was an invitation for those spirits to come into the house. An anthem is very symbolic but I think that it is used to symbolize danger. Grown-ups pay their respects to the anthem but here it is a call to the little girl that the "TV people" are coming.The two young kids notice the danger. Carol-Ann is the lead to the strange actions behind the TV then Robbie declares his fear for the tree which eventually attacks him. The children represent the force behind both the family's fight against the spirits as well as they are the start of the troubles. The little girl however is the innocent hero. Despite her lack of knowledge, everything revolves around her. She talks to the TV, always wants the closet light left on, then she gets sucked into the closet. When she gets rescued, she does not remember anything. This was taking away from the cliché of horror movies where the heroes are the older ones.There aren't powerful, sinister sounds in the movie. There's a mix of soft sinister sounds and peaceful sounds. However, there is a major use of shadows. We were shown the shadow of the door knob when they were finally about to open the door to get the girl. The shadows were a different way to create shadiness. Also, the lightning creates shadows. Normally, the storms signify an attack from someone and you will have the girl running from the danger. Instead, the characters embrace the effect of the storms and Robbie is even told to count the time between the roars of the thunder. The roars seem to hear him count and keep going a second later than the last one. Finally, to create more fear, they used the little girl screaming in the background. This is not the ideal method but it is disturbing when there is a little girl in the back screaming for her mother. This gets the viewers emotionally involved because they feel sorry for the helpless/defenseless girl. As mentioned, the youngest seem to be the main characters and since it is unusual for children to be attacked and to be directly involved with the horror, it gets us emotionally involved in the movie and we feel sorry and worried for the kids.Despite the mother being able to communicate with her daughter at night and the storms only taking place at night, there is a lot of white in the movie. The closet light is white, the ghosts show up in white when they leave the room, they attach themselves to the white walls. The bright color is a sign of innocence. It shows the little girls' innocence in the movie as she has no idea what is happening. I believe that the family is extremely innocent and clueless about the house being built over a cemetery. However, the man who knew about the cemetery being moved is shown only twice and he is not dressed in any bright colors. The ladies who come and try to help out with rescuing Carol-Ann are not dressed in white either.The movie is very systematic and well built. Firstly there is the TV and the strange movements of the furniture in the house. Then the girl disappears. When we are all trying to figure out why these things are happening to the house we find out that it was built over a cemetery. Towards the end when we think that Carol-Ann has been rescued and nothing else could go wrong, the house ends up vanishing. Everything built from one thing to another so there were smooth transitions. The movie started off with normal talking then when the spirits settle in, they started whispering to communicate. When the daughter is about to get saved, the characters are yelling at the top of their voices to communicate between each other. In the end it gets back to normal talking. This is different because with the whispers, anything sudden could happen but when they are yelling to communicate then they are almost ready for the final showdown and ready for battle.Normally, you would expect the mother to be worried over her lost child but instead she is relaxed and it's the father suffering the most from losing his daughter. Bravery is a theme of the movie. They stick together to pull through the tough times. Towards the end, the father is not at home and they suffer one more attack, the mother grabs Robbie who grabs Carol Ann, this chain shows the family strength.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Ghost Story That At Times Goes A Bit Too Overboard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Poltergeist" is surely one of the best ghost movies ever made. It's suspenseful most of the way through, and at times (and I'll say several times) it's downright frightening. It introduced into the lingo one of the greatest and most memorable lines ever - the two simple words "they're here" (spoken by Heather O'Rourke as she stared at the white TV screen) and the performances throughout are excellent. The only thing that really detracted from this, at least in my opinion, was a decision to at times take the whole thing a little bit too far. Sometimes (not often, but enough that I felt it anyway) this seemed to delve into the realm of silly fantasy rather than frightening ghost story, when it really needed to keep the focus on the latter, which was its great strength. In particular, I thought that the last 20 minutes or so really went way too far. I would have been quite happy and finished the movie completely satisfied if this had ended with Tangina (played by the diminutive Zelda Rubinstein, who really worked in the role, if only because of the contrast of this very tiny woman taking on this horrible presence) simply declaring the house to be "clean." That last 20 minutes offered an explanation for what had been happening - although we had already been given enough information to be able to guess at what was happening. In some ways it seemed like a fast forward replay of everything we had already seen (the strange force coming from the children's closet, etc.) and it just added things that to be seemed ridiculous and unnecessary, such as the pool full of skeletons and coffins popping up all over the place with the house eventually being swallowed up. That ending didn't become the climax of the movie for me; it was anti-climactic and I spent most of that time wondering "why add this on?"Still, if at times a bit too much, this was - I say again - a really good ghost story. You can't speak about this movie without mentioning Heather O'Rourke. She was brilliant. For such a young actress (I guess she would have been 5 or 6 when this was made) she made the part of Carol Ann her own. Her terror was absolutely believable. Her story (she died suddenly at the age of 12 soon after filming "Poltergeist 3") must surely be one of the great tragedies in Hollywood history. Based on what I saw in this movie, it's so sad to think of the acting career she might have developed, because she didn't seem like a typical child actor who'd never be able to break out of that image. I think she'd have gone far in the business. Such a tragedy, which has led to all sorts of silly stories about the 3-movie Poltergeist series, with some people speaking of a curse on the project. There was no curse - just a very sad tale that attached itself to the series; a series that began with a very good opener. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist: Terrifying 80s Ghostly Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot: Enter the nice, suburban town of Cuesta Verde, and the home of the Freeling family: Diane, her husband Steven, their son Robbie, their oldest daughter Dana, and their cute-as-a-button little girl Carol-Anne. The Freelings live a normal everyday life, until strange disturbances occur and Carol-Anne begins to make contact with eerie voices in their TV set. Then things get scary when Diane and Steven discover that Carol-Anne has been whisked into another dimension, one of terror, pain, and fear. The Freelings are being terrorized by ghosts, and extremely ferocious ones at that."Poltergeist" is one of the most perfect haunted house movies ever made. It's filled with scares, a witty sense of humor, and enough goo for the fans. It gives you a few chances to breath, but when the horror begins, there's no stopping it. And all of this came out of the mind of Steven Spielberg, director of "Jaws." One of the reasons "Poltergeist" works so well is the setting. This family is living in a normal home, lending the viewer the idea that this can happen to anybody. Not until "Paranormal Activity" have I seen such terrifying supernatural events in a horror film.The movie is plenty creepy. Sometimes, there won't be anything happening during a scene, then Diane will turn around and all the table chairs are stacked up. The movie psychologically plays with you, and only throws in special effects when they're most needed.The acting is stellar. The entire cast comes off as pure and real, especially the Freeling family. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson have wonderful chemistry as the parents, Beatrice Straight creates a great parapsychologist who is not the only one who is stunned by this ghostly activity, and Heather O' Rourke is to die for as Carol-Anne. And don't miss out on an awesome performance by Zelda Rubinstein as psychic Tangina.Nobody quite knows who directed "Poltergeist" the most: Steven Spielberg himself or his partner Tobe Hooper, the dude who brought us the classic "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." Most of the movie comes off as Spielberg's, and I think the scenes of the special effects are probably Hooper's material. Until we hear it from Spielberg and Hooper, we won't know.It's been nearly 30 years, and "Poltergeist" still has the ability to scare you, to make you jump, to amaze you, and to make you laugh. This is one 80s haunted house movie that everyone remembers, and we still love Carol-Anne's classic line: "They're heeeere." P.S. If you're horrified of clowns, this movie will traumatize you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is a very good movie. It is entertaining, interesting, original, and terrifying. However, most of the movie does not feel like your watching a horror movie. Some of it actually seems like a kids movie. Poltergeist is not a kids movie! I'm 16 and it really scared meme! I'd hate to imagine the reaction of a child to this movie. There are mostly two terrifying scenes, and they both involve a clown. There are a few ominous, creepy scenes. There is also one startling scene.Most of the movie, looked like it could have been straight out of a fantasy movie, not intended to cause terror. These scenes were extremely mild for a horror movie. Very very mild. But the clown will terrify children. Clowns are already really creepy, but when a life-sized inanimate clown springs to life, its even scarier. This scene was really good though. It was truly a classic horror scene. Poltergeist is a movie about a young family living in an urban subdivision. The parents have a young daughter, a slightly older son, and a teenage daughter. The two youngest children are still frightened of seemingly irrational things, like life-sized clowns, and funny-shaped trees. The older girl, and parents are not scared of these things though. The young girl finds that there is a voice that talks through her television to her. She talks to this voice occasionally. One day though, she is captured by this TV. She is captured by a Poltergeist. This Poltergeist proceeds to place a haunting on the house. This includes objects moving themselves around, objects coming to life, and earthquakes within the house.These quakes are spawned by ribbons of green light that erupt from the TV. The parents then hire three of four professional Poltergeist busters to get their daughter back. The main problem I had with it was it didn't really have much of an intended audience. I say this because it seems to be a kids movie. A lot of the movie is lighthearted and intended to be touching, like a kids movie. But the clown excludes the audience of children because its so scary. Despite this, I was fairly impressed with Poltergeist. Its worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great psychodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am most impressed by Steven Spielberg when he arranges his films to serve his neuroses. Now, I haven't attended to Mr. Spielberg on the psychiatrist's couch, but we know the recurring elements: single moms, preteen boys, orphans, nuclear families under threat, the American dream, California suburbs. I just watched Poltergeist after not seeing it for a bunch of years (I was twelve when it came out) and I really enjoyed the depiction of the parents, their embrace/rejection of their dream home, their hippie pothead moments, the way the mother is wearing white when she goes into the closet to rescue her little girl and get reborn from a sac of amniotic fluid in a bathtub, awoken by her husband... as for the horror elements, it's not very scary, more of a funhouse ride. That's okay with me. I just kept shouting at the movie that the nuclear family is under threat from nasty ghosts, corpses and giant vaginas, and that it must protect itself at all costs. Great fun. Although given the awful things that happened to some of the film's cast and crew, perhaps I shouldn't be saying that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happens When All That Scares Children is Put into a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist has almost every child nightmare imaginable. The creepy tree outside, the clown, the closet, something under the bed, loud thunder, you name it it's here. And what's Wonderful about it is that each fear is almost universal to every person who watches this movie, making it a much more scary experience.It starts with a normal family. As always. One night, the youngest child (a girl) gets up from her sleep, goes downstairs and starts talking to the TV. Her family sees this and are a little worried but brush it off as a 'child thing'. Then weird things start to go on all over the house. Chairs start pushing themselves out from the table, before stacking themselves on top of it. Then that night during a thunderstorm, one of the kids (the only boy) is grabbed by a tree from his window and then is almost devoured by the tree. While the rest of the family tries to save him, the little girl is (as most of the object in her room) is sucked into her sucked into her closet. The rest of the movie revolves around the family trying the get the young girl back from the house spirits.What makes the movie work most is that fact that is more about the family more than the scariness of the ghosts. The characters are real and believable so you care for them and are scared for them. Whats wrong with the movie is the disjointment of scares. Most of what is truly terrifying about this movie happens during the last ten minutes, of we do get a couple of scares before then (ex. the tree) but for the most part they're at the end. But this aspect lets us learn about the characters more and making the movie better than it would have been.I think if i had seen 'Poltergeist' when i was a kid I still wouldn't have been able to sleep (I know some people who did and still can't) but that only shows how much of a good scary movie this is and it also makes you sad that there aren't much like it anymore.Star Review: ***1/2/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in this movie a group of seemingly benign ghosts begin communicating with five-year-old Carol Anne Freeling in her parents' suburban California home via static on the television. Eventually they use the TV as their path into the house itself. They kidnap Carol Anne, and most of the film involves the family's efforts to rescue her. Eventually they do, but then the spirits, led by a demon known only as The Beast, go on a total rampage. Michael Grais and Mark Victor co-wrote with Spielberg and the movie starred Craig T.

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant film, not too scary but has enough suspense to keep you interested. When the family move into the house, their daughter Carol Anne can sense an evil presence and strange things start to happen. They first realise something supernatural is happening when the poltergeist starts moving the furniture about. As the film progresses more and more spooky things occur... It is set in a typical large house with a few trees to add to the spooky effect. I would recommend this to anyone who likes horror films. I liked this movie because it is full of suspense and has a few twists. I personally don't think there is anything that they need to do to improve it. Anyone who is interested in watching it should go ahead-they wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

I must admit I wasn't expecting much out of a PG rated horror film, but I have to say that this film is wonderful. The acting is great; you can tell that they are really truly scared. The special effects look good, unlike those of the sequel "Poltergeist 2", where the effects seemed somewhat cheap. I was sort of grossed out by a few of the scenes, but "Poltergeist" is not overly violent or gory. "Poltergeist" is one of my personal favorites, and it makes an effective horror movie with some good shocks and surprises. I would recommend it to everyone looking for a good horror flick that isn't filled with pounds of blood and gore. "Poltergeist" rocks! A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... alongside The Shining and Alien, I never needed a cushion so much. I know, I know, wuss.The ideas are good, editing fine-tuned to the timing of the director, whoever that was, and it's beautifully shot - it's supernatural, even without the sfx (early Industrial Light &amp; Magic, no less).But I'm amazed by the acting. The characters and their interaction are just outstanding. There are multiple grades of crying, and nuanced weariness. The children are as good as the adults (respect to the director in this instance). It's not 16th century revenge drama or morality play but it's no pantomime either.Occasionally storyboarding is stretched to accommodate ideas (the swimming pool is over-featured) and shots&amp;shocks have priority over dialogue, but that's the film it is. Don't over-eat directly before viewing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT! Technically breathtaking, scary as hell. But shamelessly manipulative, more in the vein of Spielberg's work than Hooper's. The sob-inducing hunt-for-Carol Anne stuff made me choke back tears too, but left a bad taste in my mouth later. The musical score is likewise and even cloying, especially that overplayed lullaby theme which is done to death on XM-radio every Halloween till I'm ready to gag. However, I'm not saying this isn't a great film, it most definitely is. The special effects crew earned their keep on this one. You've got everything from a sluglike piece of meat sliming its way across a kitchen counter to a parade of luminous ghosts, cadavers erupting from the ground and "The Beast," the monstrous hell-spawned visage causing all the otherworldly goings-on. A must-have addition to your Halloween collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather good ghost story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a rather good horror ghost story from 1982. In fact, it was a pretty good horror movie considering it was rated PG. The story has a family who experience some strange going on's in their house. It starts off small enough with little things happening like chairs being rearranged and objects sliding across the floor. Unfortunately, these seemingly harmless happenings turn more horrific as a tree tries to eat their son, but this is just a distraction as the ghosts take the couples daughter to the spirit world. The couple has to turn to experts to help them get their daughter back. For some reason the daughter can be heard through the TV, especially on channels with static. This movie is good and fun to watch. Sure, none of the things depicted here are probably possible, but it is a movie. The finale is a bit over the top, but like I said...it is a movie, just have fun with it. The first part of the movie has rather good comedy as well and there are some more laughs scattered here and there through the movie. There is also a rather cool scene of a guy tearing off his face. What gets me though is the people who say this movie and its sequels is cursed. This is because four of the stars in the movie died. In the end though the gal who played the daughter was murdered, the Indian and the really old man were, well old, and the little girl died of complications of some illness. All these was just coincidences. If either Craig T Wilson or JoBeth Williams had died during these years instead of any one of the others you may have had a point.</fullReview>

Even the outdated special effects still looks creative and modern and bring us such terrific and scaring childish visions of how a ghost should look like. For those who follows the director, note how he entertains himself by making women getting surrounded by corpses and skeletons, the same way he did in "The Legend of the Lost Ark".</fullReview>

This made it to one of the most violent movies ever! My favorite violent movies are: Black Hawk Down (2001), Saving Private Ryan (1998), and Its A Wonderful Life (1946). My favorite part of Poltergeist (1982) was when that guy was in the bathroom dreaming that he was ripping his face apart.

		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie? Practically everything else has been said about it, but I'll go into the details about the acting. This is a cast of mostly unknowns, which, to me, is a good thing. Heather O'Rourke is amazing as Carol Anne. She's only in the movie for about an hour [in between the beginning and the end], but she is the focus of the whole story. She's also a stunning-looking, platinum blonde child. JoBeth Williams is equally good as the mother, Diane. The rest of the cast performs well, with Zelda Rubenstein as the midget psychic Tangina a real highlight. There are some moments of humor in the film as well. Take a look at the scene with Steve [Craig T. Nelson] and the neighbor are switching the channels on their TVs. That's funny. I love horror films that start with introducing the characters so you can care about them later on as the horror begins. "Poltergeist" does this. Also, the concept of a child being taken into another dimension is scarier than that of teenagers being slashed by a masked killer. This alone is what makes "Poltergeist" stand out from today's horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the horror/sci-fi movies I've seen, only "Poltergeist" manages to scare me every time. I can't watch it in the dark, and it's hard to watch it alone. I happened to see the infamous clown scene when I was a little kid, and I still fear clown dolls to this day. The movie is about a very typical suburban family whose world is turned upside-down after digging a pool in the backyard. Strange things start happening, furniture begins moving on its own and the worst of all, the youngest daughter is sucked into another dimension - a spirit world. The family finds a way to contact this other dimension through a dead signal on their television set. Hearing little Carol Anne crying out for 'mommy' is so chilling, it gives me goosebumps. Word of advice, if you have young children, don't let them watch this movie! I spent too many nights in fear as a child after I saw this (at 6 years old). Even though it's rated PG, it would have been given a PG-13, except that rating didn't exist in 1982. I would love this movie to be reissued in 2002 for its anniversary. I'd love to see it on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some time in the mid 80's I purchased my first big-screen TV and laser disc player and wired it all up to my home stereo system. The first stereo movie I bought was Poltergeist. My kids were too young and my wife would have no part of watching this movie, so one night after they were asleep, I broke the shrink wrap on Poltergeist and watched it with the sound blasting through a pair of headphones. It was the first time I ever gave thought to the impact of sound effects and the score on a movie. Poltergeist is one of the best horror flicks ever made. It's not really a special effects movie... In fact the tornado sequence was double-cheesy. The twister in Oz 43 years earlier still gives me cold chills but this one looked like it was from a Warner Brothers cartoon. What makes this movie great is that you believe that this is the family next door. And whatever happens to them could happen to you. Parents relate to the horror of a missing child, and the fear of thunderstorms. And as an aging boomer, that clown still gives me he creeps. The casting was excellent, the acting great, the plot good, the score fantastic and the FX decent for the time (except the twister). And just when you think this movie is over, strap yourself in for more. At some point while I was watching the movie, my wife slipped into the room and startled me, and it took 3 Die Hard batteries and a set of industrial jumper cables to get my heart started again. The current widescreen DVD with 5.1 Dolby Digital makes up for the fact that I never got to see this one the big screen. I would also love to see theatrical reissue next year on it's 20th anniversary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies ive ever seen. Everything about it is perfection. A masterpiece must, first of all, have a masterpiece of a score, and Jerry Goldsmith has done it. The special effects( by George Lucas' ILM) are perfect, but are no way the best part of this epic. The acting is at its best at all times(no big names then, just super talent).The Story(by steven Speilburg) is extremely original, imaginative, and extremely well done. Although everyone says how scary this movie is(which it is, i guess, but its a million times more than a "ghost story" or "horror movie"), but the great part of this movie is how flawlessly made and presented it is. Be prepared to be entertained, scared, and ENTERTAINED AGAIN!!!One of the greatest feats of this movie is the Sound Effects. If u don't believe me, just crank up the volume when the skeletons come out of the water in the pool scene....AWESOME. This film is Fun as hell and will have u glued to your seat the entire time. Plus, when u think the movie is over and ur about to give it a 3 and a half star rating, it takes you on an unforgettable **** journey of perfection the rest of the way. And to add genius to greatness, the final scene (i will not give it away) as the camera pans out and the great theme starts playing leaves u with a "can a movie really be this perfect" feeling. If u havent seen it, its probably Steven's best, at least technically. this is a MUST SEE-MUST SEE-MUST SEE-MUST SEE type of film. i have no more words to praise it. Congratulations Steven, youve proven your my favorite filmmaker of all time all over again!!! GO SEE IT ON DVD!!!1000000000000 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Scariest Flicks Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie still rocks! Saw it when I was a kid and nightmares for weeks. Rented it recently and was surprised to discover that it still holds its weight. The special effects don't seem cheesy at all, almost 20 years later. And if you can make it through the clown scene without jumping out of your chair, you've got more nerve than I...The movie succeeds in scaring you because the first half hour is little more than a comedy about suburban life. You find yourself laughing at the common denominator of suburban life -- football parties, the remote control, etc. Then -- WHAM -- out of nowhere, it's a full-tilt horror flick. Finally, I won't reveal too much, but beware of false endings. Just when you think it's over and you're safe, it ain't over. You've still got 20 minutes of screaming left to do. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper and Steven Speilberg together! A great start and from there it just gets better. This movie is very entertaining for fans of all ages and genres. It contains ghostly images with great creative detailing and doesn't try to fall back with an overuse gore and violence. The story is told with an even distribution of character development and mind boggling action sequences. Definitely (if you haven't already) check this one out and don't be too afraid to watch it with the kids!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scared me insane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when I was 14 or so, which would be a couple years after it came out, by myself, at midnight, uncut on HBO. Other than The Fog it was the first real uncut horror that I think I ever saw.It scared me so badly that I couldn't open my closet for a whole summer, and my sleep was disturbed for probably three months. Ever since that movie, literally no movies scare me. That movie terrified me so bad that my willingness to suspend disbelief in horror movies was permanently burned out of me. Now I find them either boring or hysterical but never frightening. But this one movie scared me half to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two hours of film replete with entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has all the hallmarks of the Spielberg blockbuster production - a small-town suburban family setting, fantastic special effects, fast-paced action and a liberal smattering of Spielberg's own brand of natural humour. It falls short of his other fantasy adventures, probably because the rumours that he wrested the direction away from credited director Tobe Hooper are unfounded. The influence and style of Hooper (director of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", amongst others) are evident and, rather than detracting from the considerable input of Spielberg, complement it in a way which results in a picture of subtle originality. The combination of the genuinely frightening nature of some of the scenes with Spielberg's eye for spontaneous comedy is remarkably effective throughout the film, and Spielberg's penchant for setting his films in an easily-recognisable family environment somehow helps to bring a sense of reality to the otherwise absurdly unbelievable premise on which the story is founded. All this contributes to nearly two hours of film replete with entertainment in which the special effects, good as they are, do not usurp the other fine qualities of the production - and, again, Spielberg and his team achieve all this without the employment of big-name stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergiest is a wonderful ghost story with amazing special effects, great characterization and a musical score that brings out all the elements of the movie. I saw this movie when I was about seven years old and it is one of the first horror movies I ever saw. The scene that scared me the most at the time was the tree coming into the window and that pink form coming out of the closet door. What is so exceptional is it is scary from every point of view. Now I find it a terrifying concept to have your little girl disappear into a place you can't protect her. From a child's eye to an adults this film is an exceptional piece of work and I gave it a 10.</fullReview>

Its pretty good, even though some of the effects were fake, like the guy ripping his face off in bathroom. I never seen the other sequels, someday I will. But 1 problem, this is PG! It got quite scary in the end, way to scary for PG. It should have been rated R, since the tree comes aive(which is some kick-a$$ effects) for 1982, the guy ripping face off in bathroom(got way 2 bloody for PG) &amp; then alot of skeleton corpses. Well, just goes to show you how stupid the MPAA can be when it comes to rating films. Anyway, this is a very good movie &amp; if u havent seen it, go rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just sitting here thinking about that demonic clown gives me the creeps! POLTERGEIST is a true classic, I feel, for many reasons: the perfect way it balances humor, horror, and emotion; its well-constructed script-- 3rd act nonwithstanding; its vivid recreation of suburban life in the early 80s; all of its memorable set-pieces. I was around the age of Robbie (the kid) when this movie came out, and I saw the movie through his eyes. (I had nightmares about trees grabbing me for months afterward.) Who can forget: the tennis balls covered with red jello; Tangina intoning: "It lies to her. It tells her things only a CHILD can understand!"; Jobeth Williams sprinting down that seemingly endless hallway, and doing flips ON THE CEILING? And that moment with Mrs. Freeling and Robbie in front of the tv when they first hear Carol Anne calling to them-- man, that gets me every time! This is an emotional, entertaining movie that scares me and makes me laugh every time. Kudos to everyone involved!</fullReview>

This movie has a great cast and my favorite cast member in this movie is Dominique Dunne who also played as "Dana Freeling". She acted her part out well in the movie but it's sad that she died in real life. Dominique Dunne could have been one of the best actresses if all time if she were alive now. Also another comment onabout her is that she is a fine looking actress and I feel in love in her acting.

But this is one movie where it shows a great expression how poltergeist scare the heck out of you when you live in a suburb where it has been built over an ancient Indian burial ground along with other people who have passed on. I love this movie so much that i watch it once a day to scare my self. This movie has a great cast of actors and actresses, especially Dominique Dunne. Now I have to give her props to her as a great actress. But everyone knows her tragic death in '82. If she were alive today, she would have been one of the greatest actresses. My other comment about Dunne is that she is a very beautiful actress and that she doesn't deserve to pass on in life. Even though I'm only 17 and since I first saw Poltergeist, I fell in love with Dunne's acting and her other roles. Welp if you are in for a good scare, PLEASE WATCH POLTERGEIST........"THERE HERE!!!"hehehehehe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist is one of those movies you hear about. Maybe not current and coming generations so much, but my generation. It is supposed to be one of the horror classics.Now, I like Poltergeist. I have seen it at least a couple of times, but I have to say, I'm not totally convinced. I don't find it scary. I find that the pacing is a little off, also the cool/not cool balance of the spooky haunted-stuff that happens, is a little on the not-that-cool side.When it comes to ghost horror, I think the actual "haunty" things that happen makes or breaks the movie. In this they didn't quite make it for me.By all means, it is rather effective and absolutely entertaining, but I don't think it is as great as a lot of people are saying. Maybe my expectations were too high when I saw it the first time, and maybe I'll see it again and like it better, if so, I will delete this review and write another. But this is my current thoughts on it.I do like the sequels rather well, and I actually like the third one the best. (I'll probably get some down-votes for that!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate in scary realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could say that I have an unhealthy fascination with Poltergeist. I saw it when I was very young and it has stuck with me throughout the years. It was my first introduction to Steven Spielberg, along with E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial that same year. This movie reminds me of all the things I loved about my childhood...the location being Southern California were I grew up, the suburban neighborhoods...the house could very easily have been the one I grew up in. So it does have a special place in my memory. But nostalgia aside, how does this movie stack up to more modern horror films? Some would say that it has lost it's horror appeal due to it being dated, but I think that it has not lost any of its appeal. In fact, for those of my generation, it may be more pertinent then we know. This movie hits home, literally, in that a husband and wife are doing everything they can to keep their family and home intact despite being overwhelmed by outside forces they can't control. When we were children, this movie would have been a good scary movie, but as adults with children of our own now, it reminds us that our family bonds can be fragile and strong at the same time. It shows us that love for your family can be your greatest strength and that we shouldn't let anything, natural or supernatural, get in the way of that. This story is very much film-making at it's best. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it, or to those who may have seen it long ago and need to be reminded what a good horror story really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparisons to "Jaws"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In producing the movie "Poltergeist," Steven Spielberg employed the structure that worked for him in "Jaws." In the latter movie, there is an Everyman, Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider), and his family, corresponding to Diane Freeling and her family in the former. The shark is a monstrous creature terrorizing Amity Island just as the demons terrorize the Freeling household. In "Jaws," we have the mayor who lets the expected revenue from tourism jeopardize the safety of those who plan to swim in the ocean, while in "Poltergeist," Steve Freeling's boss jeopardizes the safety of the Freeling house and the entire neighborhood in an effort to save money by not moving the bodies of a cemetery before building houses on top of them.Once the shark proves to be too menacing to ignore, a scientist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), is called in from the Oceanographic Institute, just as three parapsychologists are called in to investigate the weird happenings in the Freeling house (one gets the feeling they inspired the movie "Ghostbusters" (1984)). But science alone cannot do the job. Therefore, someone with personal, practical experience is needed. In "Jaws," this takes the form of Quint (Robert Shaw), an old salt who has been a sailor all his life and has dealt with sharks many times. In "Poltergeist," we have Tangina, a woman with psychic powers, who knows how the other world operates.Ultimately, however, it is Everyman Brody who kills the shark, when science and practical experience fail, just as Diane must save her children herself after the parapsychologist and the psychic have failed to completely do the job.Unfortunately, the final attack by the demons after everyone thinks it is safe is a little too much. It would be like having the shark make one more attack after Brody thought he had finally killed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror films often do not get their do, and the 7.1 rating for Poltergeist shows that this trend will most likely continue. Clearly an influential film by Chainsaw director Tobe Hooper, Poltergeist reached for, and achieved, everything that the earlier Amityville Horror failed to be; namely, scary, credible, and well acted.Poltergeist, in a nutshell, is a story of suburban California family that discovers the darker side of the American Dream when their youngest daughter, Carol Ann, makes contact with evil spirits through the family television set. "They're here", never fails to send chills down my spine as I recall seeing this film for the first time as a teenager.Perhaps 10 to 15 more years will finally lend the credibility to this film to finally place it among the classics in modern horror cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Poltergeist" is one of the great horror films. It's the kind of movie that makes the genre respectable. But when i read posts praising Tobe Hooper's accomplishment's, I have to take issue.By nearly all accounts, Steven Spielberg was the creative force behind this film. We are talking about accounts from Producer Frank Marshall, and nearly all of the major actors, some of whom imply that Hooper barely said a word to them onset and was "chemically enhanced" most of the time. "Poltergeist" bares the unmistakable touch of the master, who not only storyboarded, wrote and produced the film, but, most agree, was the de facto director. Look at the shot selection, cinematography, etc. It SCREAMS Spielberg.So, I agree that 'Poltergeist" ranks as one of the great horror films. It has always been my standard by which GOOD horror is judged. But credit Spielberg more than Hooper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Terrifying, Jaw-Droppingly Spectacular Haunted House Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Freeling family live in the pleasant neighbourhood of Cuesta Verde. All is well until their young daughter, Carol Anne, starts hearing voices coming from the TV static and strange ghostly episodes begin to occur. Are they living in a haunted house ?Poltergeist is probably the best example of the contemporary ghost story movie - it's fun, extremely well-made, and is packed full of terrific scares. It takes the opposite approach from normal; there's no big old spooky house or gruesome back-story of some patriarch walling people up in the tower. By contrast, the Freelings are the most normal family you could imagine and Cuesta Verde could be any middle-class suburb anywhere. The movie uses this backdrop of ordinariness to really bring the hauntings and monstrous visions to life; they seem somehow more real and shocking because these people and this place seem real. The movie perhaps segues a little too fast from the minor phenomena to Carol Anne's disappearance into the spirit world, but Williams and Nelson are so good that they make it work. Here are two actors who are asked to react to the most insane and bizarre situations but they jump right in, play it straight, keep their characters grounded, and both deliver sensational performances. Both Rubinstein (who is four-foot-three) and five-year-old O'Rourke are truly iconic; Rubinstein's hair-raising whispered speech about the evil spirit is a highlight - "It keeps Carol Anne very close to it and away from the spectral light. It lies to her. It says things only a child can understand ... ", and O'Rourke is sweet, haunted, funny and touching, one of the most memorable child performances. Paramount as ever in a good horror movie are the fabulous tracking-in photography of Matthew F. Leonetti and a super-creepy score by Jerry Goldsmith which alternates the numerous nail-biting sequences with unsettlingly pleasant nursery-rhyme lullabies. It also has some of the most startling effects in any ghost movie - both Richard Edlund's amazing spirit-light creatures and some sensational floor effects (a set of chairs that stack in an uncut shot, a dizzying elongating corridor effect done in the camera, a scene where Williams is thrown up a wall and across the roof) contribute greatly to the scares and the atmosphere. Too often nowadays filmmakers just get lazy with CGI (see the remake of The Haunting), but this has original and imaginative effects which really work. There is some controversy over the authorship of this film; Steven Spielberg wrote the original story, co-scripted and co-produced it, and is rumoured to have supervised the direction, whatever that means. All I know is that it's beautifully made and Hooper (the auteur of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and several other great but critically lambasted films) is the credited director so he's the guy I tip my hat to. He's made a classic ghost movie which is scary as hell despite the fact that it takes place in the here and now and nobody even gets killed. Tragically, both young actresses in this film died far too young; Dunne (the sister of Griffin Dunne) was murdered in 1982, aged 22, and O'Rourke died of complications from Crohn's Disease in 1988, aged 12. Followed by two sequels, which, as usual, are not much of a patch on the original. A fabulously enjoyable horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and enjoyable horror movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, i've never really been into horror movies but I decided to give this one a shot. Turns out, I thought it was great! The theme is great, the acting is great. Absolutely no flaws to the movie. Even though the movie was made a little while ago it still is a good horror movie to enjoy today. Most horror movies you'll find today are too much of gore, gruesome, and just plain out nasty like Saw or something like that. Now this movie wasn't to disturbing but it might be a little scary for anyone under the age of 13. It's scary but not gruesome, bloody scary. Just suspenseful on the edge of your seat scary. If you know what I mean. I definitely recommend this to all horror movie lovers. This movie gave me a shock because I thought it wasn't going to be that good. But like I said, it's great! However if you love blood and gore, you won't find much of it in this movie. I heard Poltergeist 2 wasn't that good but i'm going to go rent it anyway! my overall rating: 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry Goldsmith's finest music on film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to pick out one reason this movie was successful, a good reason would be Jerry Goldsmith's disturbing yet beautiful soundtrack. He was at his best during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Even though film music buffs know that during the "ghost scene" Spielberg cut out a lot of the music that Jerry had written, still, the film stands well even though it is now over 20 years old. The music is stunning and beautiful.This was the era when Spielberg did serious movies that were much more enjoyable than he does now. He remembered that audiences want to be entertained and horrified but not be overwhelmed by special effects and nothing else. True, the special effects in the film were great, but they did not overshadow the storyline like War of the Worlds or Majority Report, Spielberg's modern BOMBS.Everyone can relate to the simple ghost story presented here. At least Spielberg seemed to know how to direct children in this movie. I don't know why he has failed in so many recent movies. Maybe someone else has an opinion about this.I really enjoyed this movie in the theater. It is not nearly as good on television -- it seems rather cheesy when not on the big screen. Highly recommended movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Haunted House Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Poltergeist" is a film about a normal American family, The Freelings, who live in a normal suburb, who live normal lives. But everything that is normal begins to change. Their youngest daughter, Carol Anne, comes downstairs one night, and puts her hands on the TV, watching the television fizz, and seems to be communicating with something. The second time this happens, strange events begin to occur. Storms build outside their house, chairs stack up themselves in a matter of seconds, and strange lights come from Carol Anne's closet. One night, Carol Anne is sucked into her closet by a forceful wind, and is taken to another dimension. Not knowing what to do about their daughter's disappearance, the parents hire a team of parapsychologists, and they begin hearing Carol Anne's voice speaking around the home, coming from the television set. The parapsychologists believe it is the work of a "poltergeist", and explain the difference between a ghost and a poltergeist. The family then begins a battle between two worlds to save their innocent daughter.This movie really isn't perfect, it has some cheesy special effects and isn't particularly scary by today's standards. I would say it's a little bit light for a Tobe Hooper film, but it has it's moments and I enjoyed it. It's PG, so there isn't a lot of intense violence or anything, the movie is probably appropriate for pre-teenagers (although there is one scene where a man tears his face off). The acting here was great, JoBeth Williams was the most convincing house-mom I've seen in a movie, and young Heather O'Rourke was a living doll. The story was unique, and was much different from your normal haunted house film. There have been numerous legends about a curse surrounding the movie, as there have been a number of cast and crew members who died after the making of the film. Heather O'Rourke, who played Carol Anne, died at the tender age of 12 from a cardiopulmonary arrest after suffering an intestinal problem during the filming of "Poltergeist III", and Dominique Dunne, who played the smaller role as her sister, was murdered during the year of the original film's release. Whether there really is a "curse" or not, these sad but strange events add the to the mystique surrounding the film.Bottom line- "Poltergeist" is a well made, original ghost story, and holds your interest the entire way through. While it isn't completely perfect, it's nearly close to it. Out of all of the haunted house films that are out there, this one ranks pretty darn high on the list. Recommended. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the first movies I ever taped. I had gotten cable and this was on HBO. It was utterly captivating. The neat transition from the household ghost that moved chairs to the ugly, vengeful ghost that must be approached to save the little girl ("They're here!") It is so neatly set up with the housing development and the graveyard. The terror as the house begins to put forth the energy of these spirits. The scene when the heavy rain begins to wash the bodies up from under the yard is absolutely horrifying. This family is under assault, but until they know what is going on, they can only deal with the symptoms. This movie gives real estate developers a bad name (oops, that's redundant). To conclude, there are about six different scenes that will stick in my memory forever. That's a lot for a movie. I also loved the very last scene which I won't spoil. See this if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They just don't make movies like this anymore. This movie actually makes sense and is genuinely creepy. Thats more than can be said about 95% of horrors they make now-a-days. This movie deserves higher than a 7.6 , but people are stupid. For example , some people actually like remakes more than the originals. i.e Texas chainsaw massacre, amityville horror (bad example because they both suck - and its all based on a hoax) , house of wax etc etc etc. Hollywood has no more ideas these days , its all special effects , terrible dialogue and repetitive scenarios. If its not a remake , its the same premise as another movie , which most likely already did it better anyways. WATCH THIS MOVIE. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest haunted house films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Poltergeist" is one of the classic haunted house films.**SPOILERS**Real estate agent Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) and his family, Diane, (JoBeth Williams) Dana, (Dominique Dunne) Carol Anne, (Heather O'Rourke) and Robbie, (Oliver Robbins) move into a new home in the suburbs. Packed with nice neighbors, beautiful scenery and a quiet atmosphere, it is the perfect place to raise a family. However, inside the house, strange things begin to happen. Chairs and furniture begin to rearrange themselves after only seconds have lapsed and Carol Anne has a strange fascination with watching the static on the TV instead of regular programming. Steve doesn't believe it until Diane shows him a special trick: a chair in the kitchen slides across the room by itself, with no one touching it. Freaked out, he calls in a paranormal research team, lead by Dr. Lesh, (Beatrice Straight) to find out what is wrong with his house. At first dealing with the spirits and declaring the house free from poltergeists, even stranger things happen to the family to convince them that they may not have gotten rid of them after all.The Good News: As haunted house films go, this one is one of the best. Don't let the PG rating fool you, this is a scary film. Haunted house films usually only have a small margin of error, because how often can you get scared of them? The timeless ones know how to make the audience feel uncomfortable being around the house in question, and this one does it marvelously. The house looks creepy to begin with, which always helps, but the inside isn't, so it looks like a normal house. It looks like it could happen to you, and that is where the best horror comes from: it comes from the fact that it could happen to you. How could the rest of the population believe that the events happening on screen is truly terrifying? Make it happen to real-looking people. Nobody here looks like they just came from the gym, or even seen a plastic surgeon, and the chemistry between the family is so realistic you begin to feel for them. What happens at first is a nice twist: the poltergeists don't want to harm, instead they want to play. You can tell in one great scene: the chair slide. Instead of picking up the chair and throwing it across the room at the characters, the poltergeists have fun by sliding it across the floor. It's a little creepy when you first see it, and the false sense of security is just right to lure you off track. However, once the film gets going and their true nature becomes apparent, it has one great chill after another. When they bring in the paranormal team is great at that. By bringing in these high-tech equipment and other gizmo's is shocking, because we don't know what is happening to deserve this. Once we do learn of what has happened to the house, it just becomes a roller-coaster ride through to the end, with lots of action, suspense, and danger. The middle section also isn't like any other haunted house films, as we are trying to figure out what is happening to the family and how to deal with their problems instead of becoming haunted by what happened in the beginning. It is full of new ideas and flows together nicely with the ending. That action packed ending is another perfect example for delivering chills. After escaping the spirits, the family gets out of the house, and into the front yard, when dozens of skeletons begin to pour out of the ground. Dodging them to get to their car, one erupts out of the garage in front of them and lands on the car, which is my favorite jump in the film. That is such an action-packed ending that it just makes the beginning of the film seem like nothing really much happened. I love endings that send you out on a high note, and this is definitely one of them.The Bad News: The beginning of the film is a bit slow, so it takes a while to get going. Also, I'm getting kind of tired of having the house be haunted by having it rest on an ancient burial ground. How about some more creativity next time?The Final Verdict: Despite being another entry in the burial ground haunting films, this is one of the better ones. It's creepy, atmospheric, and certainly packing enough chills to make it worthwhile. Give it a shot if you like this kind of film, but it is recommended to all horror fans as well.Rated PG: Violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a terrific horror movie in it's time. In the suburbs everything seemed quite normal and peaceful. The happy go-lucky family named the Freelings feel they have the almost perfect life. Until one night they 5 year old daughter named Carol Anne says something after touching the t.v. she says "there here". But who is here? Carol Anne first says the t.v. people. But a supernatural force begins to take over their house. And soon the world of the paranormal is open. We wonder how the Freelings will get through this experience? I enjoyed this movie because it kept wondering what would happen next. This movie was well produced by Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper working together, can it be true? Yes it can. Spielberg co-wrote a terrifying script and handing the directing duties to someone that can scare the hell out of people: Tobe Hooper (now, how much each guy really did is up for grabs). Poltergeist will satisfy both horror fans and non-genre viewers as well. It has a delicate balance of horror and drama and characters we can care about. It's also a sophisticated film simply because Spielberg's name is on the movie. That will put a lot of butts in seats. My favorite moment is when they trick the audience. I love the way they do this. Once Tangina, the uber-short psychic, has "cleaned" the house, you think the film is over. Not so. It could have ended there and been a decent film. However, the film absolutely kicks into third gear in the final act and that is where it becomes a horror classic. Coffins shooting out of the ground, killer clowns, and Industrial Light and Magic doing their best can really scare the pants off of an audience. When people start thinking about the great horror films, I think Poltergeist is too often overlooked. Go back and watch this one as well as its sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Spielberg in this is self-evident. The defining scene, for me, concerns the mother's experiments in the kitchen to find out if the house really is haunted. There's a moment with some chairs. The Hooper is less easy to find, maybe not until the closing moments. You, of course, probably already brought to mind the little girl and `They're heeere...' It looks like a Hollywood movie and is still scary, and as such occupies its own little niche in my affections.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great ghost movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was awesome. Practically every aspect of it was great. It had good atmosphere, it was creepy but still had just the right amount of comic relief in just the right places. The acting was superb, the story was interesting, and the effects were awesome (even by today's standards). One thing that amazes me is that this flick is rated only PG. This is a very intense movie for that low a rating, I'm amazed it got by. I assume this was before the advent of PG-13, which is the reason why.To tell you the truth, I never thought much of Craig T. Nelson. I always thought of him as `That Coach-guy.' But while I was watching this, I realized he's a pretty damn good actor. The same went for the rest of the cast, except the oldest daughter who just seemed annoying for the most part. They all played their parts well, seeming like a normal, happy, tightly knit family. Very laid back and everything. There's an especially funny scene with the parents smoking pot in their room.The storyline and plot was really good. It gives you a lot of action while keeping you informed of what's going on at the same time. I'd think it would be very hard to get lost in this movie. The whole story made it seem real, as if it were based on real events. Paranormal investigators were brought in and they had all their fancy equipment and everything. There were a few problems with the pacing, I thought. It seemed to move very fast and then slow to a crawl and then start up again.The special effects in this flick were very well done. Jan de Bont could take a lesson from this movie on how to properly make a haunted house movie without using crappy CGI effects. It's really sad, I think, that they could make a movie look this good and have some very creepy effects, and yet with the passing of time not be able to do it anywhere as good. A couple particularly creepy scenes involve a tree and a clown doll. There was one scene where a guy tore off his face and you could obviously tell it was a dummy, but that was the only crappy effect in the whole movie.A great ghost movie, probably one of the best of its kind. Great acting, story, and effects. Tobe Hooper really outdid himself. I highly recommend this flick to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very exciting and creepy ghost story from Tobe Hooper, the director of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1&amp;2" and Steven Spieldberg, the director of the "Indiana Jones" trilogy.!!!SOME SPOILERS!!! Our film begins with the "Star Spangled Banner" playing as a t.v. station signs off. Suddenly the youngest girl of the household, Carol Anne, walks down to the snowy t.v. set and communicates with the "t.v. people." Her parents and older Brother and Sister think she's a little peculiar, but go on about their day as if it were a normal one. Suddenly strange things happen. The furniture moves by itself and a tree tries to eat the boy of the house. Next, young Carol Anne is sucked into another dimension through her closet. The family seeks the help from a team of Parapsychologists. As soon as they enter, strange things happen to them. One of them is bitten and eats maggots from a piece of meat. Finally it's Zelda Rubestein to the rescue and she saves the little girl and her Mother from being sucked into the light. The next night, the ghouls return and terrorize the Mother and two younger children. Corpses come up from the ground(The house was built on an ancient cematary that was moved without the bodies being moved), a monster keeps the Mom from getting her kids, and the house sucks itself in after the family escapes. Exciting, suspenseful, great story, acting, effects, and music score. ***** out of *****. Followed by two great sequels(In my opinion).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Few GREAT "Horror" Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really works. Most horror films are laughable, boring, or just plain dumb. Who would think that a PG rated film could have so many great scares? There aren't any cheap gimmicks to make you jump out of your seat like 2 friends accidentally bumping into each other. Which must be a prerequisite for most Horror films. A perfect example of the difference between this scarefest and anything else on the video shelves is the typical..."I can't get my car to start all of a sudden when I really need it too!" This film is smarter then that. Instead to build up tension, we see a frantic search for his keys in his pockets, to finding the right key on the key chain to open the door as his hands are shaking from being scared sh*tless with what's happening to finding the ignition key as his family is yelling at him to hurry the hell up.Most have seen or at least heard the basic plot scenario of Poltergeist. But what many people who haven't seen it don't realize is that it's a truly great movie and you need not be a "horror geek" to appreciate it. It's emotional, fun, exciting, heartfelt, and yes, even scary.Steven Spielberg knows how to write scary stuff that we all have experienced at least a few times as children. Such as leaving the closet door open, or being spooked by one of your toys that just always kind of freaked you out for some reason as a kid or looking under your bed expecting to find something...alive? This film is just as effective today as it was in 1982 when it was released in theaters. Spielberg took over most of the direction while still directing E.T. (Despite Tobe Hooper's directing credit).With Steven Spielberg's "direction" and Jerry Goldsmith's best and creepiest score he's ever done , this film is nothing short of a masterpiece of modern cinema.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark sci/fi horror film of the 1980s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is one of my all time favorite movies. I never saw it until about three years ago (I was only 6 when it first came out--I wasn't allowed to watch it). For a movie that is 17 years old, it still packs a punch in the hearts of movie-goers who believe in the supernatural.Although not horrifyingly scary, the movie will give you the creeps for a few days. The childhood nightmares of Robbie (Oliver Robins) and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) come to life as the spirits of the dead that are buried under their house (unknowingly, of course) invade the Freeling home and send the family into the world of the supernatural to find Carol Anne when she's abducted by the poltergeists who want her to lead them to "the light".The special effects still hold up fairly well to today's standards, mostly with the help of LucasFilm's Industrial Light and Magic.While the two sequels didn't hold up to this one (the second one was decent, the third one sucked), the movie had many different avenues that would lead to the sci-fi/paranormal genre in the 90's. Perhaps while the current trend of remaking hold classics continues, maybe a remake of this movie (my idea would be to add David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as the para-psychologists who investigate the poltergeist disturbances at the Freeling's home). But then, the Poltergeist movies were probably put to rest for good after all the cast members started dying off (O'Rourke died in 1988 a few weeks after shooting Poltergeist III from a freak bowel obstruction, there were three other deaths of cast members following the first and second movies).Still, if you're wanting a highly productive and intriguing horror movie, rent or buy Poltergeist. And by all means, see it on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>haunted house thrills combined with Spielberg fantasy charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980's was such a significant time for what set the stage for the horror genre. That combined with the sentimental elements of Steven Spielberg's wonderful and exciting films land-marked during that time, this is one of the most memorable fantasy/adventure movies up there with "Back To The Future", "The Goonies" and "Close Encounters of The Third Kind" Spielberg is Executive Producer and Tobe Hooper, Director of The original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" work together in a perfect collaboration that is equally disturbing as it is charming and thought-provoking.Ex-hippies, Craig T. Nelson (Coach) and Jobeth Williams and Their three children live in the picture perfect American suburban home, but ultimately undergo disturbances and paranormal activity due to the neighborhood plan being erected on a sacred burial ground. It seems that poltergeist activity is directly linked to the essence of their little daughter, Carol Anne and the presence will stop at nothing to capture her spirit and in the meantime wreck havoc on the family's happy home life. Introducing 4'3" character actress, Zelda Rubinstein as the psychic medium, Tangina in a role that defines quirkiness. This is the film that earmarked the combination of classic haunted house thriller with the fantasy/family fun and scary sentiment that will later on bring us the 1980's box office hits such as E.T., Gremlins, and Indiana Jones. This is one of the classic films that paved the way, and there's no denying its originality, great storyline, effective Jerry Goldsmith music and breakthrough special effects that defined a special era in film-making history. The talented cast together with ahead-of-its-time supernatural elements and entertaining fast-paced humor and eccentrics make this a tour-De force of all our suburban childhood traumas, including a ghostly tree, thunderstorm paranoia, a creepy clown-doll, and other various toy artifacts that are embedded into our psyches and plague our fears of the unknown and overall uneasiness with innocent curiosities. Tobe Hooper, Steven Spielberg and producers seem to know what touches our deepest fears as well as our insight into life-after-death, and they translate it onto the big screen into what is a non-stop action-adventure horror/fantasy for an audience that can appreciate the American dream and the American nightmare of what might be in the closet or under the bed. Highly recommended for all generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's updated haunted house film is suspenseful and intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some will say "Jaws" and other will say "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," but the 1982 "Poltergeist" offers the Exhibit B for of the longevity of Steven Spielberg's magic. Written and produced by the legendary filmmaker, this supernatural horror film evokes the imagination, despite the thin layer of cheese and the now-dated special effects. Standing unfairly in Spielberg's shadow is "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" director Tobe Hooper, who makes "Poltergeist" eerie and suspenseful enough to keep the film engaging when the special effects are full-blown and the lid has been popped off in terms of realism. The subtle and effective camera movements at various moments will keep you on edge, some technique that draws slightly upon Hitchcock (as well as Spielberg, who undoubtedly had a hand or two in much of the production seeing as he was on set most of the time)."Poltergeist" tells the story of a young family in California living in a development who experiences supernatural activity in its house starting with the youngest daughter hearing voices in the TV set and continuing with moving kitchen furniture. At first it seems like some fascinating paranormal activity, but soon it becomes anything but subtle.Despite the film's full-on embrace of the supernatural instead of sticking with minute suspense, there's still a strong curiosity factor that makes the ghostly mayhem intriguing rather than scattered and unnecessarily chaotic. Much of the events happen before we have any true sense of what's going on, which draws us in to figuring out what the events might signify and of course how they'll be resolved. In this sense, "Poltergeist" remains suspenseful throughout, making it effective through the excessive use of strobe lights and wind machines.The cast also possesses an anonymity which keeps the focus on what's happening in the house and suggests that this could "happen to anyone." Horror films started casting unknowns mostly to keep costs down, but the tradition certainly has value in films such as this because big-name stars would draw too much attention to the performances and not to the events. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams as Steven and Diane are a fairly simplistic couple and they don't overcompensate when it all goes down by freaking out any more than they have to freak out.Haunted house films have always had some old-era Victorian feel to them, but "Poltergeist" brought the classic concept into the modern era by brilliantly crossing something as ordinary as a house with something as extraordinary as a supernatural terror.~Steven CThanks for Reading!

		<shortDescription>That's the '80s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than simply a horror flick, "Poltergeist" also functions as a relic of the early '80s: the book about Reagan, the "Star Wars" merchandise, and most importantly, the move to the suburbs. The plot of course portrays a suburban household where some very ghostly things start happening, and how the Freelings - who live there - have to cope.Among other things, this may be the only horror movie that begins by playing "The Star-Spangled Banner". You'll probably have a very different impression of the TV after watching "Poltergeist", mainly because of the movie's most famous line. And I don't know whether or not it changes anything that Dominique Dunne (Dana) died while the movie was in the theaters, or that Heather O'Rourke (Carol Anne) died six years later.All in all, this is a top-notch movie. The special effects, more than just being "cool", actually do give one a sense of fear. The cast does a great job. Craig T. Nelson as dad Steve is fatherly but can blow his top. JoBeth Williams as mom Diane puts a real spin on the image of the suburban housewife. Beatrice Straight as Dr. Lesh looks weird but keeps her cool. James Karen as developer Mr. Teague plays his usual mealy-mouthed character. And that one scene with JoBeth Williams (you know which one I mean)...well, let's just say that the teenage boys must have liked it the first time that they saw it. Oh, and this movie may make you wonder whether your house was built somewhere where it shouldn't have been. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghosts are real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one of my friends first told me about this 1982 "Scary" movie i really didn't know what to think. Movies with ghost usually are not very scary because of that fact that nowadays all they do is jump out at you and startle you once and you can never see it again because you know its coming. But with Poltergeist i mean Jesus. That is some scary ish. Even though Spielberg didn't directly direct this movie i feel that his expertize and style of filming did not go un-used. I think the cinematography in this movie is amazing. The minor characters just add to the already great cast. The fact that you never actually "see" the ghosts makes it all the better. I believe this movie is definitely one of the best thrillers of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oustanding haunted house film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A yuppie couple with 3 darling children (and a dog!) have a gorgeous newly built home in brand new suburban neighborhood. Everything seems perfect. Except for the fact that their youngest daughter keeps talking to the television in the middle of the night. This is one of the better horror films of the 80s, and one of the best in the "haunted house" genre. I watched this movie countless times as a kid, and was always horrified by several scenes (almost everything that happens to poor Robbie). Watching it as an adult, I was bummed to see that these scenes were more amusing than scary, and that some of the effects have become dated. But the movie is otherwise visually stunning, the atmosphere is chilling, and the performances are top-notch.***bit of spoilers***One thing that always got me is that the viewer is lulled into the false security that the horror is over after the "rebirth" sequence (ick!). That could very well have been the climax. Nope, these ghosts are PO'ed. Each actor has her or his own little moment of "horror movie" brilliance at this point in the movie: JoBeth Williams' transition from sheer desperation and terror ("Stay away from my baybays!") to a woman who ain't gonna take no crap from a ghost as she bounds down the growing hallway, Craig T. Nelson losing it at his boss while his house is swallowing up his family, Dominique Dunne with her blood-curdling "What's Happening?!", and finally Heather O'Rourke, frowning in her bed as her closet door starts opening, uttering a helpless and tired "not again."***end spoilers***There are some pretty powerful themes here that I didn't catch as a kid, the main one being a couple coming together and refusing to allow their family to be consumed (literally!) by their material possessions (the TV, their toys, and ultimately their new perfect house). Brilliant. This is the movie that "The Amityville Horror" tried to be but failed. This is the scariest movie that received a PG rating from the MPAA. There are a few flaws, but I still give this a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Horror Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*CONTAINS SPOILERS*"Poltergeist" is one of the best horror films ever. I first saw it 5 years ago when I rented it. I loved it and immediately rented the two sequels the next day. I watch this film every Halloween."Poltergeist" tells the story of a family whose house is invaded by ghosts. These ghosts called poltergeist kidnap the family's younger daughter Carol Ann(Heather O'Rourke). There are many good scenes in this movie. One of my favorite scenes is when the closet in the younger children's room opens due to the poltergeist. Then the closet starts sucking in everything in the room, including the kids. This scene scared me the first time I saw it. Another really scary scene is when the clown starts strangling the son Robbie. Overall I love this movie and I give it 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Poltergeist works as a film of many dimensions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the seventies, Horror was the new "genre" to make a film. Musicals and family films were good fun but many people wanted danger and chills while watching a film that combines terror with fear. A combination most popular with The Texas chain Saw Massacre. The films could be good fun but the plot was as threadbare as the acting. Poltergiest is a film that can appeal to many more people then simple horror movies. It is centred around a family of different ages. It starts pleasantly yet the youngest child Carol Anne talks unnaturally to a dead television screen. Slowly everything blends the music is Oscar worthy and brilliant for the mood. The setting is not isolated as such but the film is in two different worlds. The real life and the an in-between land of people wanting to move away from the light. The screenplay sizzles with quotes such as "they're here" "stay away from the light" "you son of a bitch. you left the bodies but you only moved the headstones." The "kidnap" or "abduction" of Carol Anne is a parents nightmare and the secondary characters who deal in the "supernatural" understand the parents fear creating a blend of subtly and fear is brilliant and terrifying to watch.The build up of tension starts with the "tv people" entering their home and making minor changes to their life's (moving the furniture etc.) Soon trees and clowns all personify to effect the family and try and take Carol Anne into the light. The objects of fear are natural fears (both clowns and skeletons are enough to make you scream at the top of your lungs. Normality never quite remains intact in this film but i would class this as the greatest horror movie. The last 15 minutes literally keep you hanging as you watch the Freeling Family desperate to leave the home that they built. It still holds up and is a pleasure to watch. The two sequels followed and they are dreadful to say the least. Only when you have a film complete with engaging characters, acting of calibre, effects to hold your breath, a score of enchantment and the screenplay and story so gripping you know you're in for a good two hours of chilling and brilliant entertainment. The sequels seem to burn away the cast as it was the "Carol Anne" collection. Whereas it is about the lives of a family. A family story that is similar yet different to a movie about a child abduction, this is simply more inventive and enigmatic. I would even suggest(possibly) a accolade such as best horror movie/a top 250 position. Well it's definitely very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific movie with a terrifying story behind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can still remember when I first saw this movie (when it came out on TV, because I was too young to see it in its theatrical release), and I felt really impressed by both the special effects (even effective today to be honest) and the awesome and above average work of the children. I still feel especially fascinated by the unsurmountable work of the late Heather O'Rourke (as the sweetest little Carol Anne, the real hard core of the plot, in my modest opinion). When I read that most special effects were added in post-production, and that actually the actors interacted almost always with the typical blue screens and/or (nearly) empty sets, that made my admiration increase even more.On the other hand, thinking about all the story that lies beneath made me feel very sad; there were too many disgraces: Oliver Robins was about to die actually in the infamous clown doll attack, a member of the crew died during the shooting (I'm not too sure of that), Dominique Dunne was murdered a few months after its release, when she was just beginning (tho I guess that a jealous guy has actually no relationship with a movie, even a horror movie), and finally the beautiful "human doll" that was Heather O'Rourke also died during the filming of the 3rd shot. Too many tragedies that shouldn't really affect a movie quality and the position of the audiences about that but, who can really maintain it?Now, because of that, I feel sad every time I see the whole movie or just a scene or trailer. However, I can't really help watching it every time it's programmed on a TV channel. It's very hard to repeat such a unique piece like this, especially because there will NEVER be another Carol Anne like Heather O'Rourke. Rest in peace they all and let's feel really blessed for having been able to share that delightful experience at least once in a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched ''Poltergeist'''yesterday because my dad and my friend were telling me that it was a horror classic, and even not being scared, the movie give us a nice time. The only thing I find more bizarre then the movie, is the fact that real skeletons were used in this movie.I am surprise how Steven Spielberg worked on both productions of this movie and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, at the same time.It is so sad to see that such a beautiful,talented and intelligent girl as Heather O'Rourke,(the girl who played Carol Anne) died by cardiopulmonary at such a young age of 12. (Not to mention Dominique Dunne, who plays Dana Freeling, that was killed by her boyfriend with only 16 years old)And if Spielberg wasn't paying attention to the actor Oliver Robbins in the set, in the scene where he is strangled by the clown's arms, we could had three deaths instead of two.An ordinary family has their lives turned upside down when strange events starts to happen in their house. Carol Anne, the youngest of the children, become connected to the spirits by the television. What looks only strange, starts to become bizarre when Carol Anne disappears with the ghosts and terrible events starts to happen in their house.Ps: Since Spielberg and George Lucas are friends, you can see a lot of references to Star Wars in this movie in Robbie's toys.</fullReview>

It scares lies more in it's practical effects then rather in mood. Performances are very good here. Special effects looks not bad in 2015 - they should have looked awesome back in 1982. Story is simple, but effective. Music is not your traditional horror themes, but it's a good score.Overall, "Poltergeist" is solid movie in all directions. It's not very scary, but it has its moments. Craftmenthip of this movie is very good - it's safe to watch this movie for the first time in 2015. All in all - a very solid movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fond Memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born in 1972 and lived out in the country where we had no cable TV. I recall we had 4 major TV stations and that was it - all 4 of these stations would go off the air at a certain time. It was not unusual to go to sleep while watching TV and wake up to pure static! I also recall flipping through the TV channels and would sometimes see "ghostly images" from the antenna that could barely pick up the distant station -- as a kid being 4 to 5 years that scared me - but my parents explained to me what those "ghostly images" were. In 1982, I was 10 and Poltergeist came out. Seeing Carol Anne in front of a staticy TV set reminded me of my very early childhood which made Poltergeist a bit more frightening for me at the time.The movie is pretty good - scary in a lot of places especially when you are 10 years old and see meat crawling on the counter top then spilling out with maggots *shivers*. Anybody hungry for steak?! And the old tree outside of the window gave me the creeps as a youngster along with those toys which reminded me of a few I had when I was about 5 or 6 years old.Even though I was 10 when I first saw the film I was freaked out - very scared watching the movie. It reminded to much of some things that creeped me out when I was around the 5 year old mark. Oh yes - one more thing that gave me the shivers back then was the Poltergeist Theme (music) by Jerry Goldsmith! I had a copy of it and would play it over and over because I love being scared and I found it haunting! I have fond memories of the film and I do recommend it for a good Halloween haunted place/ghost story! I would have rated this movie an 8 but my memories associated with the film tickle me! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting artistic collaboration , , ,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Poltergeist" is an interesting experiment in artistic styles ? two differing styles to be exact, and what happens when they clash might have made real mess if not handled with care. In this corner is Steven Spielberg, the prince of Suburbia, who ? more than any other filmmaker ? understands the world of middle-class America. In the other corner is Tobe Hooper, the mastermind behind one of the best and most unsettling horror films of the 1970s, "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". Their efforts together create a brilliant haunted house movie that both tenderly shows us a family in crisis but also the strange, supernatural events taking place around them.The credits give the reigns to Hooper, but Spielberg is the architect here. He was contractually forbidden from directing a film while preparing "E.T." so he gave Hooper the directing credits. We see Spielberg's world, the same settled-in American suburb that we have seen in "Close Encounters", "E.T." and "Jaws." Their home never feels like a set. There is a lived-in feel to it. Look around the living room, the kid's bedroom, the kitchen. Everything feels like it's been there for years, not like a prop man set it up just before the cameras rolled. That, I think, settles our minds into the reality of this house.Hooper's style comes from the special effects elements. We are familiar with his other films and we can see some of the inspiration of "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" here - rotting corpses, flesh ripping, demonic faces, and decay. We remember his elements in that Texas house all those years ago and much of it exists here.The villains here are hardly ever seen. They're ghosts, lots of them apparently. We are never sure how many. There's some discussion of "The Beast" but what does that mean? In the supernatural half of the film we are led to believe that they are full of surprises, that they can open a portal to the next dimension and take the family away. On the reality side of things are Spielberg's favorite villains ? corporate America, the same kinds of people who didn't want to close the beaches in "Jaws" for fear of losing summer dollars. Here their machinations are much worse, a real-estate company that made a very bad decision.Yet, this film is successful, I think, because of the human characters. There's a close-knit family, and to our surprise, one that we actually care about. Mom and Dad ? Steven and Diane Freeling ? Steve is a real estate agent and former football player. Diane is a former flower child turned doting mother and housewife. The kids are just as defined. There's 16 year-old Dana, whose forward-thinking attention is more attuned to her social life than anything going on at home. There's 8 year-old Robbie, who finds fear in the most normal of everyday objects like a stuffed animal and a tree outside the window. And there's 5 year-old, cherubic Carol Anne, who is prone to sleepwalking and whose attention seems unsettlingly distracted.If not for the production design and the well-defined characters, the movie would be a complete wash-out. Like "The Exorcist" or "Carrie" the movie has to be grounded in reality for the supernatural stuff to be effective. That's especially true of the characters who arrive later, after Carol Anne has been kidnapped and taken to the next dimension. It might have been fatal if the movie had been led by the investigating parapsychologists or even the erudite medium that blows in to explain the situation. Their work is so foreign to us, that putting them at the film's center might have made the movie seem like an episode of "The Twilight Zone." If there is a weakness in the film, it probably comes from the myriad attempts to explain what is going on. The parapsychologist has her explanation. The medium has hers. Even the evil real estate developer has his explanation. Yet, it never really comes together, and after a while they all feel like club-footed theories. Late in the film there is a long-winded explanation of the supernatural forces that have kidnapped Carol Anne, and why, slows that I think slows the picture down. It reminds me of the blabbering psychiatrist at the end of "Psycho", who comes on to explain the plot, when we in the audience don't really care. Get on with it.Yet, it is unfair to be snide about a movie like this. You kind of have to go with it. If there is an illustration of where "Poltergeist" succeeds, it must be in its comparison with "The Amityville Horror" which tells almost the same story but is a complete mess. That film did everything wrong that "Poltergeist" did right. It was a haunted house movie that only cared about the special effects, tossing the characters around like pegs. Also, that film allowed the horror to extend outside the house for no reason. In "Poltergeist", the terror stays home and that lends it a bit of credibility. Grounding the supernatural events to the house allows us to orient our minds to some measure of limits. There have to be rules, otherwise the movie feels like it's just a bucket of special effects with no purpose. "Poltergeist" is a prime example of how to make a haunted house movie under the best of filmmaking talent.***1/2 (of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember to have seen this movie as a teen on an evening we weren't allowed to watch TV, maybe because Spielberg name was strong enough to bend the rule! I found it so great that as i asked my bookseller to read the novelization of the movie in which evil spirits terrorizes a family, he gave me instead "the Exorcist", which was quite a hard reading! Now, i watched it again a quarter of century later and I'm amazed to see that the fantastic here is that the movie is still totally actual, albeit it's dated historically as the boy is a great fan of Star Wars merchandising. I can read that Spielberg was more at the helm that it seems: if i can't tell what really happened, this movie is for me the house next block to the Elliot's one. In other words, "ET" and "Poltergeist" share the same world, the same feeling, it's the same Californian suburb, the same family meeting supernatural and they have both excellent soundtrack! The only difference is the first is about light and the second is rather darkness. Now, i don't find the movie really frightening (see my review for "Prince of Darkness") but I'm rather moved by the family: great home, liberal and caring parents, sweet kids. The cast is just amazing and for sure, little Heather facing the big screen (her TV as well the movie one) is just happiness, innocence, childhood incarnated (helped with big brother Oliver) and her late fate (as well as big sister Dominique) just make me cry... I would like very much to hear Spielberg about the "movie curse" and the use of real skeleton in the movie! If that's true, we just fall then into a nauseating abyss because greed and disrespect for dead ones is indeed the story of the movie!NB: finally, i become more afraid by the "curse" than by the movie itself. In some way, this movie has really made a connection to supernatural: during a scene, you can see on a TV screen the original franchise of Spielberg's "Always". Already in 1982? Already about ghost? But, the creepy fact is really the Superbowl 1988 poster! When i watched the movie on TV, it was so really evident (up the boy's bed) that i have to check the Web to confirm it was done in 1982 and not 1988! And reading the discussion, i discovered this chilling fact: Superbowl 1988 was indeed the place (San Diego) and the date (01/31) of passing of beloved Heather! In fact, she becomes ill for this game and died the next day! I want to believe ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't call it a classic, but it is very adroit and highly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a suburban area, The Freeling's lives are shaken when objects in the house start doing peculiar things. It gets even worse when their daughter Carol Anne is taken by the Poltergeists. They hope they will go away, but they seem to be omnipresent. They call on paranormal investigators to help. This is a damn good film, make no mistake about it. You can definitely tell Steven Spielberg is involved. Nobody can create a movie quite like he can. The story is simple but extremely effective. The scares are delivered (That eerie clown, brrrr) , the suspense is always there, but the most important element of this movie is the cohesiveness of the Freeling family. Not only are they a very strong unit but everyone is likable. They band together during the time of adversity, no matter what. That is what family is supposed to be all about. Hell, even I would help this family. It delivers great buildup, until the finale is turned up several notches. Speaking of the finale, I do think it went on a tad too long. It was never boring and always exciting, but it felt a bit contrived after the false ending. Part of me wonders if they should have stopped there. They went for one too many climaxes. Spielberg pulls it off extremely well, I just wonder if he got pressured to add more thrills and scares. I'm probably being too picky. I really did enjoy the last 15 minutes. It is actually the scariest part of the movie, it just felt needless. Craig T. Nelson makes a terrific Dad. Vulnerable, yet strong-willed at the same time. Jobeth Williams is sexy and a great actress. This woman conveys all her emotions perfectly, especially the trauma she endures with her missing daughter. Heather O'Rourke is fantastic as Carol Anne. She sadly passed away, but she is one of the best child actors I've seen. Oliver Robbins is solid as Robbie. Zelda Rubenstein annoyed the hell out of me. I'm sure that will be vehemently disagreed with from fans of this movie, but I couldn't stand her. I couldn't stand her voice, her style of acting or the sight of her. James Karen has a part as well. He played a good slime ball. The only gore we get is some weird jelly goo, as well as somebody ripping chunks off their faceAdditional NoteThere are very weird circumstances involving this movie. Heather O'Rourke died during the filming of Poltergeist III from stomach issues, and Dominique Dunne was murdered by her ex boyfriend. It is kind of scary to think about. Final Thoughts: Not a classic, but very, very good. Even though Tobe Hooper is credited with directing this movie, this reeks of Spielberg, not that I'm complaining. The man is a genius. If you're looking for a really good horror film to watch, check this one out immediately. 8.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of few I have rated a perfect 10 on IMDb, the others being Rosemary's Baby and a couple others out of 3000 or so titles I've rated. I saw Poltergeist in theaters in 1982, and watching it any time since then it's just as good... emotionally, maybe more so, knowing the tragic end of Heather O'Rourke... she was so adorable in this movie. My friend Mike really sums it best when he said, "The television has an interesting role in that movie. Perhaps the first time that a TV was utilized almost as a main character/antagonist. There are other more subtle subversive themes going on as well, picturing suburbia and the American Dream as an encroachment upon sacred elements." Poltergeist has some of the most heartfelt, honest, heartbreaking, wonderful dialog, you just don't get such honest and stirring dialog like that anymore. The music is haunting and beautiful, directing is amazing and immersive, the horror is palpable, but never over used, the other side never shown too much to destroy the mystery, tension or fear... incredible pacing, with one of the best comedic levity-filled endings that just works out of any horror ever made. Truly a masterpiece 10/10 without question.</fullReview>

Nelson and JoBeth Williams did great jobs as the parents. Now there is a poltergeist going after O'Rourke's character and you never get to really see him so it is creepy. There are many really crazy scenes as well that will leave you terrified. Zelda Rubinstein comes in as a medium and just hearing her voice is kind of creepy. Now Tobe Hooper directed this film, but he had help from Steven Spielberg who was a writer on the film. You can tell some of Spielberg's touches in the film. This is a great horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1982's Poltergeist is a true horror classic. I really thought the cinematography in the film was excellent and the casting seemed to fit the movie perfect. The controversy surrounding the film with the real life death's of main characters'( Heather O' Rourke, Dominique Dunn ) has added a mythical appeal to the movie. I did at times feel the movie start to drag but it seemed to always pick back up quickly. You cant help but realize that your watching a classic when you hear O Rourke's famous line "They're Here". I believe the movies from the late 70's and early 80's can never be duplicated. You cant get a good horror flick on HD or modern camera practices, it lacks the shadows and the grainy look that is a hallmark of those films. Finally I would say that O'Rourke stole the show in a film that had the likes of future star to be Craig T Nelson. You could imagine the parents being replaced while the show could not have been what it was without the performance of Heather O' Rourke. I give this movie a 4 1/2 out of 5. Top ten horror film easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many horror films, Poltergeist doesn't make a whole lot of sense and the plot is a little thin. What it does do well is entertain. The acting was decent. I thought the little girl did a fantastic job. The film was full of suspense. We find out that the house is haunted because the subdivision was built on top of an old grave site. One of the things I couldn't understand was what the para-psychologist (Dr. Lesh) was really doing with all her witchcraft and mind-reading. And the tree branches reaching out to grab the girl through the window was a little over the top. The last ten minutes was done very well. Just when you thought it's over, comes the most dramatic parts of the film. The special effects are impressive and realistic looking. It wouldn't look out of place today. Some parts are out of place for a PG movie - such as the gross part of seeing faces peeling. But this was before the PG-13 ratings.My score - 7.5 of 10</fullReview>

It was then we realized that seeing that movie at ages 8 and 5 had really done "traumatized" us. I rented it the other day and my daughter (11) watched it with me. She too enjoyed the scare.I still closed my eyes during the bathroom scene and I still jumped at the clown scene. It's not as intense as when I was younger, but it still produced that freaky feeling that you want when you watch a scary movie.If you're into gore, then this movie isn't for you. I still can't believe that it was a Steven Spielberg movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw 'Poltergeist' 23 years ago in its poor quality french-dubbed version... Years later, I was able to see it again &amp; again thanks to laser-disc and then to DVD... I do not remember acutely my first screening, but when I got the U.S. 'Poltergeist' Laserdisc I was somewhat surprised by some cues / shots ? seemingly missing... Did anyone ever notice the time when the Freelings come to speak to their neighbors at night, just after Carol Ann has experienced some supernatural sliding in the kitchen... Well it seems to me that the scene has actually been shortened for some unknown reason, because the shot of Carol Ann's parents talking to the neighbors (they are comically annoyed by mosquitoes while talking) is cut just in the middle of a sentence... I then watched the U.S. DVD release and could not but notice the same cut... Could anyone tell me I'm not crazy and provide me with any information about this continuity problem ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah what is there to say about this ground breaking motion picture? Only the best. I think we all know the story of that movie so I will probably not need to share much of it, but that film, for those who have not yet seen it, is quite remarkable for it's time. The special effects are amazing (for that time again), the musical score is divine (composed by Jerry Goldsmith), and the ensemble of the cast is terrific. This ghost story written and produced by Steven Spielberg is directed by Tobe Hooper, who was the director of the original macabre Texas Chainsaw Massacre.A young couple with their three children live peacefully in their suburb house. Unbeknownst to them, not only do they live on top of a cemetery, but only the gravestones have been removed by the building contractors. And one one given night, the spirits of the dead arise, and decide to bring their little five-year-old Carol-Ann with them on the other side to their ghostly dimension. And now the parents have to get some help from mediums to get their daughter back.This is the kind of movie that sometimes makes you wonder if there really is something in the after life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist was released in 1982, precisely at a time when photochemical effects were a growing novelty for audiences and a common theme of most blockbusters since Star Wars had invaded our screens. By this point, audiences had seen a man fly freely through the scenic skyline of Metropolis, seen spectacular battles in the vacume of space, and marveled at the Enterprise travelling at warp speed. So was it any wonder that the same special effects wizards would try to give us a visual world for the paranormal. Poltergeist was effects bonanza like all the other blockbusters of the time. But what separates it from some of its "colder" relatives ( and there were many films during the period which were made precisely because the novelty was so profitable), is the fact that the cast imbued a warmth and vitality into the characters that inhabit the house. Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper managed to get intense performances out of Jobeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson that gave a legitimacy to the whole experience. Their vulnerability is what sold the whole film. It drove it from day one. And it was the lifeforce that permeates the whole of the film. It was what gave the poltergiests their power and allowed two less promising sequels to emerge.</fullReview>

I have to say the movie is very entertaining, the charactors are so believable you cant help but feel sympathy for them and hope they get their daughter back. The child actors are very good, Carolanne looks so cute when she says 'No More'. The ending is super, (watch and see what happens to the familys house at the end)and suspenseful.

		<fullReview>This is what happens when Spielberg dabbles in horror movies; what starts out as a pretty suspenseful horror film becomes so sappy and Spielberg-esque, you can literally see the butter and Log Cabin dribbling down your T.V. screen. Man, I'm really having mood swings! My very soul is defiled. I imagine what this movie would look like if it wasn't a Spielberg production: I'd see a dismal film ahead, instead of the light-hearted family drama/horror story. I don't want to sound like a Monday morning quarterback, but it would be a lot scarier if Hooper had directed, without Spielberg in his way. What you have are three different films; the family is in movie A, the evil force is in movie B, and the daughter, she must be movie C. Their son was such a little brat, and in all of the scenes where he's being beaten senseless by the evil force, I kept wondering "Is it wrong for me to want to see this?" Anyway, this film is about the dark, primitive ritual of revenge, so you'll get used to it. It's actually a pretty scary movie, and I was surprised. 80's "PG" looks like 90's "R", anyway. Also, the black man was a savory character, and we have to have that. You've got the family, the poltergeist, Craig T. Nelson, and the black man, that should be just about everything. Rating: (7/10) I read in Newsweek that Tobe Hooper completely re-wrote Steven Spielberg's original script-he was really mad. Wait a minute- I read Newsweek? What a loser!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist is an amazing movie. It combines science fiction, horror, comedy and drama and does it fantastically. Although even the best of movies have their flaws. First off, I don't understand Dana. She serves no real point in the movie. While everything happens, she's off at friends houses. But, for the rest of the series it is as if she never existed (we all know the actress that portrayed her was tragically killed and the writers never put her in the scripts again). Secondly, I don't understand the sub plot about Dana's birth. Steven mentions Dana is sixteen and Diane is 32. This means that Diane was 16 when Dana was born. This was mentioned and never elaborated on. As the years pass, we see Poltergeist spoofs everywhere and a whole new generation will be introduced to this amazing film.</fullReview>

We had some great seats right up front that night. Close to the end of the movie when the house gets folded up, a voice comes from back of the theatre during that silent moment. "Hello Prudential". That phrase was in a popular commercial at that time. The whole theatre broke out in laughter. We came to find out it was our friend that was the voice.

		<fullReview>POLTERGEIST is yet another remarkable film from the mind of Steven Spielberg. It belongs in the same class as Spielberg's other excellent projects like JAWS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, and E.T. It is not so much the special f/x or what exactly is happening to these people, but rather the human drama in dealing with it. From point A, we are given a typical suburban family in their daily routines. Then, little by little, strange things start happening. So before any ghosts even appear, we have warmed up to this family so much that we are almost a part of it. The combination of the great acting by everyone involved, the often nail-biting direction by Tobe Hooper with the Spielberg touch, and the spectacular use of light and Lucas special f/x, make this movie a prime example of the kind of movies that just aren't made anymore. I hope to God they decide to re-release it in theaters some day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as scary as I thought it would be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They're here!"I'll probably get a lot of backlash for this, but I wasn't really a huge fan of Poltergeist. I know many consider it to be a classic in the horror genre and some have even regarded this as the scariest movie of all time, but I simply can't find the appeal. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that it hasn't aged well or that countless horror films since have imitated it, but I found it rather predictable and silly at times. The movie does begin by setting up the characters in an interesting way (this is where Spielberg's influence as a producer is felt), but once the horror elements begin to take center stage I felt disengaged. I can imagine those final fifteen minutes must have haunted audiences during the 80's, but I just found it a bit convoluted and silly. I wanted to check out the original before I decided to see the remake, but considering I wasn't such a huge fan of this film now I probably won't even get near it (the only appeal right now for me is getting to see Sam Rockwell who is always brilliant). Poltergeist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are Tobe Hooper's most revered horror films, but at least the first doesn't seem to have aged well. I was disappointed and when compared to other horror classics like Halloween, Psycho, Alien, and The Shining, I don't think Poltergeist deserves to be considered among that group. Steve (Craig T. Nelson) and Diane Freeling (JoBeth Williams) seem to be enjoying their peaceful lives in the suburbs along with their three children: Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins), and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). That is until strange events begin taking place: their youngest daughter, Carol Anne, begins sleepwalking and having conversations with the TV set, the house begins to shake but only they seem to experience it, bent dinner forks are found at the table, the chairs are placed in bizarre positions, and finally a terrible thunderstorm destroys the house and mysteriously makes one of the trees come to life and snatch Robbie from his room. It is evident that the house is haunted by some strange presence, but while everyone is distracted by trying to save Robbie, Carol Anne is sucked into the closet and disappears. However the family can hear her voice through the static TV screen and that is when they fully understand that they are dealing with supernatural forces so they hire a parapsychologist, Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), to help them find and save their daughter. The film is at its best when it's setting the atmosphere and introducing us to the family members. I did enjoy the first part of the film, but once the strange events begin taking place the film lost most of its appeal. I didn't find it scary, but it wasn't disturbing either. I know that the premise has been imitated hundreds of times now so perhaps that hurt my overall enjoyment of this film. I wish I could've experienced it back in the 80's to see if it would've had a different effect on me, but I can't simply give it a pass for it because I've seen many other classic films that are older than this but have aged much better. The greatest thing about this movie is Heather O'Rourke, who played the cute little girl, Carol Anne. That scene where she tells her family that "they're here" is probably the best moment of the movie. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original (and best) supernatural haunting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since (roughly) the U.S. remake of 'The Ring' Hollywood has tended to follow the same template for its horror/supernatural movies. This revolves around a family (sometimes single parent, sometimes not) moving into a house. Strange things happen. These are ignored. Then they're taken seriously. Help is sought via a convenient 'expert' who is easily located within the town. Resolution/confrontation with the evil presence.I haven't seen 'Poltergeist' since the eighties when I was young and actually managed to forget that, despite it being one of my favourite supernatural movies, it actually follows this template pretty closely. The difference is... it still feels original to this day.I've pretty much summed up the plot (and hopefully haven't given too much away!), but the family in question lose a daughter to the presence and have to work out a way of getting her back. Yes, some of the effects look a little dated (like they've been hand-drawn on in post production), but for every blatant bluescreen effort there's another special effect that's as creepy now as when it was first conceived (the meat/flesh scene springs to mind!).The cast is largely (and deliberately) unknown, as the producers didn't want famous faces distracting the audience from the film's vibe. But, don't let the fact that they're not recognisable make you think that they can't turn in excellent performances. Poltergeist has given us some of the most memorable performances that have stood the test of time (the 'medium' for one), not to mention some of the most chilling lines (and you all know what the girl says when she announces the spirits' arrival!).Normally, this is where I say that a film made in the eighties will probably only be appreciated by those who lived through the decade and have a particular nostalgia for the period. Besides, today's audiences are only interested in 'jump scares' and CGI effects, aren't they? Possibly, but I'm kind of hoping that 'Poltergeist' is the exception to the rule. Yes, us 'oldies' will like it more, but I reckon anyone with an appreciation for supernatural-horror should definitely give it a go. It's damn creepy. And it's damn good. And you'll probably never laugh at another clown again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most elegant film of its genre I have yet to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even more than three decades after its original release, Poltergeist remains the most elegantly made supernatural horror film I have yet to see. Unconcerned with payoffs delivered through the drudgery of jumpscares or convoluted setups that do nothing but squander the inherent simplicity of these kinds of films, Poltergeist so flawlessly weaves through storytelling components, atmospheric attention, tension, and pleasantly controlled chaos, creating the complete package of a film that proves that blood need not be shed and ghosts can be included in a good horror film.The film revolves around Steven and Diane Freeling (Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) and their three children, Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins), and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke), who encounter an unrelenting supernatural spirit when Carol Anne, the couple's youngest, finds herself able to communicate with the family's Television set when it's tuned to complete static. Strange events begin to occur in the Freeling home - everything from glasses breaking and furniture altering startles the family. The culmination of these strange events happens when Carol Anne is sucked into the Television set one day by an unknown apparition, who continues to haunt the Freeling home whilst holding Carol Anne captive. The family must find a way to get Carol Anne back to safety along with either finding a way to rid the spirit of the home or finding a new home themselves.Much has been made about who actually directed Poltergeist, as Steven Spielberg, who was also directing E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial at the time, couldn't have his name as director on both projects due to contractual obligations, sought assistance from Tobe Hooper to bring his vision to life. The relationship between Hooper and Spielberg was said to be less a cooperation and more a monopolization by Spielberg, who found Hooper to be more-or-less a "yes man," excited to work on a mainstream project and simply trying to remain an active positive on the film. While the film bears a campiness in its videography similar to Hooper's known style in both The Funhouse and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there is a Spielberg- level scope on display in terms of capturing a cacophony of action with his evident clarity.Spielberg has a way about his shooting that reveals an uncommon amount of professionalism within his work. He can take a few million dollars, as shown here, and turn it into a creative spectacle, or he could take hundreds of millions of dollars and turn it into a blockbuster. Here, Spielberg and Hooper work to give Poltergeist just the right amount of leverage visually to make it easy to take seriously, but infuse just the right amount of camp and low budget horror in certain scenes (specifically the "they're here!" scene in addition to the end sequence) to make this a collaboration of different styles fit for the horror genre.Poltergeist remains entirely clear in its visual scheme, even when the action turns wild and arbitrary circumstances begin to take place. Being one of the first of its kind for a mainstream audience, the stigma of ghost movies being childish and relatively "kiddy" in nature was something that had to be surpassed and forgotten with the creation of Poltergeist if it wanted to succeed and be hailed as a great film. Thankfully, the talent on display here assures competence with every turn thanks to Spielberg, Hooper, and the trio of writers (Michael Grais, Mark Victor, and Spielberg himself). This, at times, is a legitimately terrifying film that thrives on slowburn suspense and unique visuals rather than the bare-bones inclusions of low-budget horror films. Rather than a momentary diversion, an experience and a frightening world was created within Poltergeist and that among its visual scheme, simple-but-effective storytelling, slowburn tension, and pacing contribute to its elegance not only within its subgenre but its larger genre.Starring: Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Beatrice Straight, Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robbins, and Heather O'Rourke. Directed by: Tobe Hooper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>and the moral of the story is... kill your TV (maybe)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An idyllic family. Typical football games with friends for the dad (sometimes with remote matches with the; fun arguments at the breakfast table with the kids; goofing around between parents at night when the kids are (supposedly) tucked into bed, maybe with a little pot, hey, why not; and the kids having their little 'I'm afraid of this' in the dark sort of thing. This is what writer/producer/sorta-director Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper concoct as the set-up here. And it's terrific, for the most part. And then the scares happen, the roller-coaster of a haunted-house that they've constructed. That's fine as well, especially given the effects hold up for today. Then comes Zelda Rubinstein as the resident Exposition-cum-Ghost-Slayer, really awesome climax. And then there's climax number two. Hmm...Poltergeist is a Steven Spielberg production first, Hooper film second (maybe we should call this a 'Hoopberg' film). If there is any trace of Hooper - in that sort of hapless, halfassed 'Auteur' explanation - it may be in some of the quick, gotcha-sty;e horrific editing (think those shots of Marilyn Burns' face and other montages in Texas Chainsaw). But everything is else is Spielberg, no matter what anyone says on the production, and of course most say it was him doing most of the creative heavy-lifting. If E.T. was his A-side work for 1981/1982, this is the B-side - no less filled with high-manipulative orchestral strings and chorals, albeit Jerry Goldsmith (though it's no less merited than Williams if less iconic), and playing to the family audience. Yes, the family audience, so what? It's enjoyable, popcorn fare as far as a kind of super-charged, intense, sometimes very well acted film (Jobeth Williams is really good here, never less than believable and showing heartbreak and joy and humor in equal measure, Craig Nelson too, the kids, well, that's another story), and it's not to slight that it can be enjoyed "for the whole family". My A-side B-Side comparison is not being facetious, it is what it is: if the kids want their spirits to soar, they can fly with the bug-eyed alien across the moon. Or, if they want to see lots of cool s*** flying around and spooktacular savings, look no further than Poltergeist.It has such a fantastical set up and mostly enjoyable mid-section, and dynamite special effects that hold up, that it's easy to forget the biggest liability: it has two g*ddamn climaxes. That might not be terrible, except that after you're done with one crazy horror roller-coaster, and you think things are about to wrap up, you're taken very soon after on another, and there's not much actual surprise for this given the once-again slow build-up to it. Adding to this, it's the only time, in the last ten minutes, that I was befuddled by the characters decisions - spoiler, I dunno, Don't GO BACK IN THAT HOUSE ITS FRIGGING EVIL! But, all in all, Hoopberg have at least got more on their minds creatively and character-wise than the horror flicks of today; ironically, Spielberg would later consult on the first Paranormal Activity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well done horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist was a movie that totally redefined the horror movie genre like that of The Shining (1980). The movie tells the story about a family whose house is haunted by ghosts when at first they don't even realize it until about an hour or so into the movie. Hooper and Spielberg were really good while making this movie especially with Spielberg's intelligent screenplay, and Hooper's Hitchcockian direction for the movie. But not only that the movie has a very good cast which includes JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson as the parents, Heather O'Rourke as the youngest child who says the most famous line in the movie "They're Here!", Dominique Dunne as the oldest child Dana (who unfortunately gets murdered a few months after the film's release),Oliver Robins as the middle child and only son Robbie who steals the show throughout the entire movie. the movie also has an intelligent supporting cast that includes Beatrice Straight (who won an Oscar for Sidney Lumet's Network (1976) as one of the scientists who is trying to help the Freeling family solve their problem, and Zelda Rubenstein who gives the best supporting performance in the entire movie as the lady who helps the Freeling parents save their youngest daughter. This movie goes on the list as one of the best horror movies ever made along with Kubrick's The Shining (1980), Psycho (1960), Alien (1979), and Silence of the Lambs (1991). One of the best movies of 1982.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This 1982 classic is the best ghost movie ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that "Poltergeist" was the very first horror movie that I saw at the age of about 7 or 8. I have very fond memories of the experience, and to this day I am sure that this movie is the movie that kindled my romance with the horror genre. I remember being scared out of my socks the first time I saw it.And now, some 32 years later, "Poltergeist" is still one of my all-time favorite horror movies and always have. I can't count how many times I have watched parts 1 and 2, but not overly keen on part 3.Right, well, for those not familiar with "Poltergeist", then the story is about the Freeling family; Steve (played by Craig T. Nelson), Diane (played by JoBeth Williams), and their children Dana (played by Dominique Dunne), Robbie (played by Oliver Robins) and Carol Anne (played by Heather O'Rourke). The Freeling family live in an idyllic suburban place named Cuesta Verde. The youngest daughter, Carol Anne, starts talking to the TV and soon after, harmless events start to occur as chairs are moved about by their own. But things quickly take a turn for the worse and what started out as harmless events become life threatening, and the five year old Carol Anne becomes taken into a ghostly realm, trapped within the house. The Freeling family call in parapsychologists for helping them get their daughter back.The storyline is so well thought through and there is a great build up of suspense and scares through the movie. It starts out idyllic and simple enough, then escalates to harmless paranormal pranks, up until the Freelings are fighting an unseen force who has taken their daughter from them.For a movie from 1982, then "Poltergeist" manages to keep up its own right even today in 2014. The effects are still great today. Of course by today's standards they are considered crude and obsolete. But I still enjoy the movie tremendously.The movie is very well directed and helped so greatly along by the vibrant camera-work. And the production value also really helped the movie in the right direction."Poltergeist" wouldn't be this impressive if it wasn't because of the great cast. And the people were doing wonderful jobs with their given roles. And especially Heather O'Rourke, she was just a star in the making, and she was taken away far, far too soon, and may she rest in peace but her memory will always live on.One of the most impressive things in "Poltergeist" is the haunting soundtrack scored by Jerry Goldsmith. This is without a doubt the most disturbing and scary soundtracks I have ever listened to. It is so outstanding that I had to invest in the soundtrack on CD, and just listening to it causes the hair on your neck to stand on end."Poltergeist" is an important milestone in horror cinema, and it is without a doubt one of the best ghost movies ever made to grace the screen.If you haven't already seen this 1982 classic, then you owe it to yourself to get to it. "Poltergeist" is a MUST have for all fans of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist is one of the first ghost/horror movies I've seen, where a family of four are visited by spirits in their home. At first the ghosts appear friendly, but soon turn menacing and monstrous, terrorizing the family and kidnapping the youngest daughter into their world.I remembered seeing the scenes with the daughter pressed against the TV and the dreadful tornado sequence. As I watch it again years later into the 2000s, being a movie made in the early 1980s, it still holds a great amount of horror, as its elements will grip you and send chills down your spine. This movie doesn't rely on gore and violence to make it entertaining, but rather relies on the appearances of the ghosts and the frightening powers that they are able to unleash onto the unfortunately family, highlighted in very polished and keen special effects.The screenplay and story by Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais, and Mark Victor were well-written, giving us a compelling plot, and the direction by Tobe Hooper is top-notch, making the movie brilliant and original. The acting was superb and the family (Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Oliver Robbins, Dominique Dunne, and Heather O'Rourke) gave a stunning and heartfelt performance.I have always been fascinated by the supernatural and become excitingly scared when listening to eerie and frightening ghost stories being told. Putting a ghost story onto the big screen that embodies just the right touch of horror elements resulted in a movie that is a must-see for any ghost-genre movie fan.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist is One of the Great Scary Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist isn't quite a horror picture, more a generous scary movie, but one of the great ones. Poltergeist is too commendable for cheap scares. It's got a good scary story and sharp editing, simply great overall production value with excellent special effects. Poltergeist lives off its spooky effects. Poltergeist has some of the best special effects ever seen. All the best moments happen with the poltergeist, and Carol Anne, and the rest of the story is laid out very nicely. Heather O'Rouke is the Poltergeist's poster child. Heather O'Rouke dying at the tender age of 12 gives Poltergeist an added dimension of spooky. Poltergeist is a chiller. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are very good in their respective roles. Neither were major stars, but both were terrifically cast. Craig T. Nelson is more in the supportive role, while JoBeth Williams is Poltergeist's great star. She is the focal force of the movie. JoBeth Williams is completely capturing and very excellent. Poltergeist has such a distinct identity to it. It surely had a preset following in place that allowed people to quickly pick up on it, immediately loving it, an easy cultural niche. Poltergeist has significant depth stemming from its existential nature. Poltergeist is a great scary movie as it is, and always will always be a classic, surviving the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Successful realtor Steven Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Diane (JoBeth Williams) live peacefully in their suburban community with their two daughters and son. Falling asleep in his chair one night, Steven wakens to find his youngest daughter Carol-Anne (Heather O'Rourke) talking to the static TV screen. She does the same thing the next night, only to announce to her parents that "they're heeerre!". Strange things start to happen around the house, until one night Carol-Anne is sucked into her closet which seems to be the conduit for the 'white light'; a light that the dead must walk into if they are to achieve peace. With their daughter missing, Steven and Diane call in a team of paranormal investigators, along with a creepy old woman called Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein).Although it says 'directed by Tobe Hooper' in the credits, it has long been debated who in fact directed Poltergeist. All of Hooper's usual traits of screaming women, a masked or disfigured killer, grisly deaths, lots of blood, all with a Grindhouse feel, are noticeably absent. Instead, the film feels something much more Speilbergian, with the industry's biggest Jew listed in the credits with production and writing duties. Spielberg was heavily involved in the production, working on it almost back-to-back with E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial (1982), and it does have the same atmosphere as his family-friendly alien blockbuster. This works both for and against the film.During this era, Spielberg was arguably at his best, and was one of the finest craftsmen of blockbusters and sheer entertainment perhaps ever. One of the key attributes to his 70's/80's films was his realistic portrayals of often broken families, and the characters of Steven and Diane are fully-realised, and more importantly wholly believable. The characterisation here is better than most horror films care to give, and these joint-smoking liberal parents are funny and real, and give a much- needed heart to the story.Yet when Spielberg (sorry, Hooper!) gets over-excited and insistent on giving the audience something spectacular, I felt the film failed. Flying household objects and static tentacles I can deal with, but giant tree-arms, demon heads and a computer-generated monster take it many steps too far, and crushes any real feeling of atmosphere. The film is just too ridiculous to be remotely scary. Perhaps a more low-key approach would have been more effective, and as entertaining as the film was throughout (although it does have a climax too many), the theatrical effects make the film look dated and suffocate any chance of real scares. A clean, enjoyable horror, but hardly a memorable one.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Star-Spangled Blue Velvet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really recommend that you see this as a compromised David Lynch film.Both Spielberg and Lynch have a signature control of a style and vision. They're both heavily cinematic in their effect. Both attempt fluid motions derived from parts of old Hollywood. Their key difference is that Lynch understands darkness to be welled inside and which pouring outside forms the illusion of a Dream, Spielberg on the other hand perceives that same suburban Dream as a certain kind of given purity that has to be defended from external forces. If Lynch is this generation's Epstein, Spielberg is our DW Griffith.I maintain, however, that it's this suburban Spielberg that is worth watching. The other Spielberg, the one of serious aspirations, is a pompous historician and pretentious storyteller. I believe this is the closest he came to getting it right. You will have to discard a few cheap devices along the way, for instance the theme of ancient burial grounds that reflects Stephen King's involvement with the project in the early stages. Some corny SFX work. And the whole amusement park ride of the finale that is basically Spielberg obliterating every thread of the film in bland cinematic fireworks - this is now the template of a good summer movie.The tantalizing premise is that we have a Brady Bunch who are so absorbed in their prosperous lifestyle their young daughter is seduced by and quite literally disappears inside the TV. That same TV lulls the family to sleep every night with the Star-Spangled Banner. And once merged with the daughter, and the family has to keep it running to maintain contact, the TV plays only static, reflecting the static hiss of disoriented minds.Even better notions; the suburban prosperity given to us as mysterious supernatural properties in their own kitchen, fascinating at first. The flipside is ominous storms booming closer and closer to home, until a tornado almost tears asunder the very fabric of the world beneath their feet. There is a marvellous shot of the daughter being sucked away into a closet along with the toys and trinkets of their comfortable living. Later she escapes from the TV with the poltergeist force that keeps her captive and is diffused into the very walls of the house.So this is pretty great, outer layers that makes visible echoes of a metaphysical fabric. Something has gone horribly wrong in the sunny household, something to do with the daughter, doesn't matter what, has been suppressed by a Reaganomics- and TV-induced stupor, and we're experiencing inner turmoils and after-effects of this as a puzzling close encounter with the supernatural.You can see how Lynch would have worked this. The old lady medium who explains about souls seeking the light would have been so overbearingly kind it would have registered as evil. The other medium - a midget no less - would have been a more distressing figure.Most importantly, and this is the world of difference between these two; Lynch would swim across into the 'other side' filming there seamlessly from a real world, Spielberg's far less imaginative or daring solution - modeled after The Haunting - is a radio play of disembodied voices that only parts to reveal only those glimpses that merit some elaborate SFX contraption. There is a film crew on our side who films the bits of ghostly spectacle. And a whole other post should be devoted to how a narrative was devised to both reveal and obscure the fact that Tobe Hooper was sidestepped during production. A big clue is in the promotional campaign of the film. Another is inside of it, with neighbors fighting with remote controls for control of the TV broadcast. Our guy 'wins'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite the exhilarating film that, as many before has commented, feels like a Steven Spielberg film, although directional credits went to Tobe Hooper, and it's somewhat Spielberg's take on something a la The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror as he typically places family and kids in the front.The great special effects are one of the film's major assets, so is the acting by the family who gets haunted by evil ghosts, they're lovable people who lives in lovely suburbs. Much of the film is delightfully devoted to the excitement and thrill of it all, but the film gets a bit draggy when some experts on the paranormal field enters the house and starts investigating - luckily the film raises it's torch when that rousing and long climax comes upon us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs without expedients</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I knot together my handkerchief in order to make a sign out of it, I am the expedient of this sign because like any other signs it serves for the purpose of communication and thus presupposes besides an expedient at least a channel and a percipient. However, there is a special class of signs which obviously have no expedients, e.g., the icy flower-patterns that appear in cold mornings on glass-windows, a sudden pain in my body which I did at least not purposely send to myself, the thunder which is caused by a physical law. These and many other examples have occupied the fantasy since the early time of mankind, assuming that there actually are expedients, but hidden ones. So, the sky, the areas underneath the earth and on the mountains, in the forests, inn ravines, etc. have been populated by ghosts, demons, fairies, witches, reckoning that these expedients are supernatural. Therefore, it is not so much the physical part of these well-known, but still unexplained phenomena like the nightly cracking in the walls, step-noises in the attic, murmuring in the cellar, etc. which attracted the interest, but the possibility that these noises are caused by intelligent creatures which communicate in this way, i.e. as semiotic and not primarily physical phenomena."Poltergeist" (1982) is possibly the most famous horror film which has exactly these "natural signs" to its thematics. It is interesting that the Polstergeister survived Illuminism and Rationalism like so many of their relatives, although they have been forced in the world of fairy-tales, legends, myths, horror-films etc. which serve as their asylums. Psychologically, they represent an early stage of the human spirit which is not too far away from animism. Whenever someone cannot explain a recurring phenomenon, the recurrence implying systematic events, there rises a vacuum, and it is this vacuum which prevents these early projections of our mind from dying out. Hooper (Spielberg?) has used the full power of the technical possibilities in this movie, made at the beginning of the eighties. Like the ghosts that are portrayed, it is an evergreen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I was astonished when I first saw this movie. It is so incredible and one of the best horror movies I've ever seen! This was directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and starred Craig T. Nelson (The Incredibles), JoBeth Williams (The Big Chill), and Heather O'Rourke (Poltergeist 1, 2, &amp; 3). The story is simple but is very well executed in this classic.There is almost nothing that is wrong about this movie. The performances are great, all of them. It's very suspenseful and one particular scene (involving a clown doll) made me jump out of my seat. Steven Spielberg produced this and wrote it.The special effects are great even by todays standards so back then, they must have been amazing. The film was sappy at times but it was made up for with the awesomeness of it! Any horror fan, or movie fan in general should DEFINITELY see this movie! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much more than a ghost story - one of the best entertainment movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Landmark Hollywood horror film of suburban California family invaded by evil spirits, that kidnap their daughter into another dimension - the TV-set!! So much more than a ghost story - in the middle of its whirlpool of shocks and scares, is one of the best entertainment movies of all time, regardless if the supernatural is one's everyday cup of tea. Well-known fact by now is that this is by far Steven Spielberg's work, despite the director credit going to Tobe Hooper, and this can clearly be seen in its look and feel: The colorful production, frantic pace and an absolutely gobsmacking fireworks of special effects (remember, this is early '80s we're talking here!) adorn and enhance its story that creates that uniquely magical mini-universe all of its own, with countless classic scenes to make one's spine shiver: the TV-dimension, the attacking tree, the rip-apart face, the hiding clown, the moving chairs... aah! Jerry Goldsmith's ominous score certainly sets the mood for things to come.Astonishingly well-written, it has the biggest of hearts, as no characters feel left out: The Freeling family is SO likable and believable (not to mention superbly acted) in their loving relationship ties- without the cheeziness - amidst the horror- &amp; fantasy elements that surround them. I still can't watch Jobeth Williams in the "She went through my SOUL!"- scene and keep my eyes from watering up! The paranormal investigator team is also depicted with warmth - Beatrice Straights's endearing team leader has a wonderful, moving speech about the spiritual world. And who can forget Zelda Rubenstein's legendary exterminator with the strangest of cleansing methods?! One of the best assets is also the laugh-out-loud humor (both slapstick and in dialog) galore, that allows the audience pauses to breathe between the stirring eruptions of supernatural chaos.Even after 27 years, it's one of those movies that I can watch repeatedly and not find a single weakness... and I refuse to even refer to or compare its sequels in the same league!10 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first "vision"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this one in 1989. It was my first "video" watched in a "videozal". Quite luckily it turned out to be one of the greatest movies, which I appreciate even more as the time passes.It has fantastic scenes - they can be called "groundbreaking classics". Among them are: the crawling meat in the kitchen, the attacking tree that grabs a child and tries to swallow him alive, the menacing TV-set which opens doors to another dimension (to hell maybe?), the dilapidating face of the scientist who takes a look in the mirror, the ominous clown that assaults the boy, the dead bodies floating in the mud and grabbing the woman, the ghost walking down the stares, etc.It has light-hearted humour that for a few seconds lets the viewer forget that it is a serious horror film. One of the best such scene is the beginning, when the man on the bicycle is being fooled by a band of boys with a remote-controlled toy.Finally it has food for thought. I know examples when in our modern heretic world the multi-storied buildings are being erected right near the cemeteries, the careless adults are buying dangerous toys to their beloved children (what is the new trend - "Bratz" or something?), the easy-going mothers and fathers are going to mediums for help instead of putting the ways straight and in the right direction, and the list can go on.Nowadays I look at this movie as at a colourful snapshot of our hectic world. It is often treated as the old-school special effects fest only. My point is that it's a mistake to come up to this film with such an easy attitude. It's definitely not another "Gremlins" or "Star Wars" (no offence implied here but "Star Wars" to me is just a cute balloon of a movie).A brutal 10 out of 10 - a rare mark for a horror flick. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best haunted house film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember catching a glimpse of this film when I was about 3 years old. Of course, being so young I wasn't allowed to sit and watch with the adults, so I was sent to the kid's room. But I just couldn't get it out of my head, so I snuck out and hid behind the couch. I took a peek at the screen and saw a few seconds of the scene where young Carol Anne is sucked into the closet. It would be at least 5 years before I'd get to see the whole movie and when I did I could see what all the fuss was about. 'Poltergeist' is not just one of the best horror films of the 80s, it's one of the best horror films period. It's not some run-of-the-mill, poorly shot, and acted waste of time. It's a grand piece of entertainment and exercise in terror that's got more heart in it than most.Pros: Has a real feeling of realism, mainly due to the suburban setting and actors that look like regular folks, which is something missing from most other horror films. A first rate cast. An unforgettable score that's at times beautiful and others spine-tingling. Some awesome and exciting set pieces. Thrills and chills up the wazoo. Some really good special and visual effects, most of which have held up well. Some good humor is put in, and luckily it doesn't kill the horror. Good pacing, which at one moments is steady and then suddenly moves like lightening. A good, fresh take on the haunted house genre. One hell of a finale.Cons: Some dated effects.Final thoughts: I've seen this film I don't know how many times, and I never tire of it. 'The Amityville Horror' wishes it could be as good and chilling as this. This film is one of those rare cases where the filmmakers take what sounds like a B movie idea and gives it the A list treatment, and here that's a very good thing.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist is a horror picture with a lot of touching moments. It does what many horror film just simply cannot achieve and that is true emotion. Trust me what i say, its not only scary, its touching, funny and dazzling. I grew up watching this film and to me it hasn't aged a bit. No horror film even comes close. It has a beautiful score by Jerry Goldsmith which gives the film a lot of energy. Its beautifully photographed and the visual effects by Industrial Light and Magic are spectacular, but not overdone.I think that was Spielberg's intention, not to make it over the top and to make it as realistic as possible. Spielberg also used a lot of his own childhood fears and put them into the film. The acting is ace from Craig T.Nelson, Jobeth Williams and the late Heather O'Rourke which whom does not have much screen time but is the centre focus of the movie. She was just an angel.With all of the elements of visual effects, sound, acting, directing (Tobe Hooper) and writers (Steven Spielberg) this is one film that achieves everything you want to see in a motion picture. Don't expect the usual gore and typical shocks you see in all modern horror films these days, Poltergeist is not about that. Its the emotion of losing a loved one, a family coming together to fight to bring that loved one back and the hell they have to go through to succeed.This film, even though considered by many to be a classic does not receive the credibility it truly deserves. Poltergeist is a marvelous piece of work. The film received 3 Oscar nominations for visual effects, sound effects editing and original score. These awards which were all won by Spielberg's E.T. I truly believe Goldsmith should have won the Oscar for this film for the score. Nevertheless its one film that cannot be overlooked and will always be classed as one of my favourite films ever made.</fullReview>

All of the special effects are pretty nifty, and hold up well considering the film's age. And there's a terrific score from Jerry Goldsmith.

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's story of this average American family's adventures in the supernatural is extremely effective thanks to the marvelous script, some very neat special effects and a strong cast.The storyline concerns the Freeling family, whose lives are turned upside down when some mysterious force takes a hold of their house and 'kidnaps' their daughter Carol-Anne. Director Tobe Hooper makes the implausible plot work excellently as he maintains a fine balance between the comedy (which is very funny), the drama and the thrills. And of course the f/x team produce some convincing apparitions to suitably spook us.Final word however must go to the actors and actresses, who really put on a fine show. As the concerned and terrified parents, Jobeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are very competent, whilst the supporting cast are also very good, especially Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina.A very entertaining and chilling 114 minutes, with one of Jerry Goldsmith's best scores to cap it off.Friday, December 3, 1993 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real estate agent Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) and his family, Diane, (JoBeth Williams) Dana, (Dominique Dunne) Carol Anne, (Heather O'Rourke) and Robbie, (Oliver Robbins) move into a new home in the suburbs. Packed with nice neighbors, beautiful scenery and a quiet atmosphere, it is the perfect place to raise a family. However, inside the house, strange things begin to happen. Chairs and furniture begin to rearrange themselves after only seconds have lapsed and Carol Anne has a strange fascination with watching the static on the TV instead of regular programming. Steve doesn't believe it until Diane shows him a special trick: a chair in the kitchen slides across the room by itself, with no one touching it. Freaked out, he calls in a paranormal research team, lead by Dr. Lesh, (Beatrice Straight) to find out what is wrong with his house. At first dealing with the spirits and declaring the house free from poltergeists, even stranger things happen to the family to convince them that they may not have gotten rid of them after all.Solid, entertaining ghost story has amazing special effects, memorable set pieces, and plenty of scares. However, it would have been nice if director Tobe Hooper had put more of his directorial touches into the film.Rated PG for Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this movie is so perfect. The acting is great, led by Craig T. Nelson playing a man being driven crazy by the absence of his daughter from the regular world. The special effects are top notch, including a scene where everything in a room is floating and running on it's own. The gore effects were also great, with the classic pulling off the face scene. It's amazing how wonderfully this film was paced. It was a pretty slow moving film, but it added a certain laid back charm to it, and developed the characters better. The final great thing about this is the beautiful Jerry Goldsmith score that is such a nonthreatening tune, but when played with this movie it's terrifying. This movie about ghosts taking over a family's house is a classic and is thought of as a horror milestone/masterpiece.My rating: ****/****. 113 mins. PG for Language and Violence.</fullReview>

First being seemingly playful, but ghosts soon become aggressive and destructive.Not many film's carried mainly on special effects are truly enjoyable, but every now and then you get one that is just down right enjoyable. Star Wars, Independace Day, Jurassic Park are a some of the most famous ones and they are right up there with Poltergeist. Each sequence of ghastly action here manages to top its predecessor in providing new chills and thrills. Also the film has a lot of appeal since it is a family in the middle of the terror and not a group of stupid teenagers, which is one of the main elevating points of the film: likable characters. There are a few underlying themes which partly mirror The Shining, but we are spared the heavy drama. This is a just a fun ghost story all the way through. --- 8/10Rated PG despite a LOT of horror action and terror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless Horror....Spielberg &amp; Hooper pose a formidable tandem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Spielberg is responsible for the most polished, complete productions of my lifetime. He may be second to only Hitchcock in strength of "viewer manipulation." It has been said that Hichcock had such a flair for suspense that viewers would overlook/ fail to notice the plot holes (of which there are many) in his work. If there is a knock against Spielberg, it is not plot holes- his scripts are often airtight- but it his lack of grit, of edge, of the substance that made his first few efforts so great. It is true, upon such mighty laurels as he achieved early in his career, anyone might mellow out, become complacent. At times Mr. Spielberg is like a living Hallmark card...Enter Tobe Hooper of Chainsaw fame. If anything, here is a director with the capacity to shock, but perhaps a little lacking in the production department (this guy really put some awful work to screen, much of it later than POLTERGEIST though). Hooper's flair for visceral imagery is really what cements this film as a horror classic, not just a creepy drama. The most unsettling scene may be watching a guy ripping his face apart after he watches his raw steak crawls across the kitchen counter and subsequently erupt. However, POLTERGEIST does excel in the pervasive creepiness it evinces, similar to the tone of the Gothic horror pictures of decades before. Transposing to a sunny California housing development the type of atmosphere usually reserved drafty old castles and Victorian mansions on craggy hillsides. It is not this ambiance that puts the film over the top though, it is the combination of these solid, structured elements handled by the production team paired with penchant for gore that Hooper brings to the table. When you see his name attached to a title, you needn't worry it a "vanilla" picture.The cast is exceptional. Williams and Nelson (both in STIR CRAZY, 1980) are wonderful as the loving, ultra-liberal parents of the family. This reviewer has a special place in his heart for the portrait of liberal family life that Hollywood films of the 70's/80's depict (damn, how do those teenagers get so much free time!!). The late Heather O'Rourke is a scene stealer as young Carol Ann, and the other children are serviceable, thus avoiding the 'obnoxious child' pitfall of many other films. The parapsychologists are likable, and Tangina, of course, is one a kind.All in all, this is a stupendous film. Well deserving of it's hallowed status, and lionized by numerous rip offs and homage through the years (most recently, and quite well, on TV's FAMILY GUY). This film had potential for all kinds of cool intellectual horror, but the screenplay fails to extrapolate upon these opportunities. Perhaps it is for the better, for quaint charm and lack of pretension are virtues that age well.9/10* Exceptional. If you have seen this film five times, watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an imaginative, creative, smart film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is one of my all time favorite horror/thriller movies of all time. The directing is great along with the cast and the acting. Compared to the special effects of this age, poltergeist's are not that great, but they were top of the line back then. This movie didn't make me jump at any scenes, but the whole idea of it was scary. Actually, there was one scene that made me jump, and it was the clown scene. Its classic. For some reason, the horror movies of this age lack the true horror elements like the ones fifty or so years ago. Every horror movie now is so freaking typical and almost boring at times. This is not the case for Poltergeist. Its extremely original and there is never a dull moment in the movie. Its fast paced and scary if you really think about the concept. What i think is scary about the movie is the concept of the unknown. Unlike slasher movies where you actually see the killer, in Poltergeist things are confusing and it has no boundaries in what it does. It can make a tree attack, chairs stack, a clown attack, a man rip off his face, it can even make a closet try to suck up two kids! With a regular slasher movie, the killer cant do those kind of things. They are very limited in how they kill their victims.Overall, I would highly advise you to see Poltergeist. Its original, imaginative and scary. If your a true horror fan, you should definitely see it. I give it 9/10 A great movie. P.S, sorry for any misspelled words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! ever since i was a young kid i have liked it. when i was young i would watch it over and over. now that i am older and have taken some film classes in college i have come to respect different aspects of the film such as the great special effects, the great acting (carolanne was adorable), and its good plot line which was creepy and at times humorous. i always thought the idea of being trapped in another dimension with ghosts would be horrible. especially if you were that little.one of my favorite scenes is when carolannes mother hears her voice in the TV, then carolanne's "spirit" moves through her. i liked all the characters in the movie, but one of my favorites is tangina. she added a flair to the film and she also gave it some humor as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist is my favorite movie of all time. Horror, action, drama, some comedy. It has it all and look at the producer (Steven Spielberg) The director (Tobe Hooper) and that little girl is too cute. A wife and husband (the Freelings) and their three children, live there days like any other family. They are happy. But when Carolanne (the youngest daughter) starts hearing voices in her television, Diane, her mother, starts to become concerned. From there, their house turns into a supernatural highway! It starts with the kitchen (things moving by themselves) but soon changes drasticly to the children's bedroom where Carolanne is horrifyingly extracted from her bed and into her bedroom closet! But when the family tries to find her....she isn't there.This calls for an expert...or 3. a doctor and her 2 assistants enter the Freeling home. The paranormal researchers, "studying in this ghostly hobby" don't expect what is coming AT ALL! well, i dont want to tell you everything, but there are a lot of lights, ghosts, wind, drama, screaming and some gore that scared the hell out of me as a child. let me just tell u this.-This house is NOT clean-over all, i gave Poltergeist a 9/10 Jim</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This House is Clean" I don't think so!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] In a small suburb of Cuesta Verde, lived a family known as the Freelings. There's Steven and Diane. Children: Dana, Robbie and Carol Anne. Life was going along pretty good for them, but what they didn't count on was evil spirits within the house. They communicate through the TV and the only one who understands them is youngest daughter, Carol Anne. One afternoon, Steven and his friends were watching football, but the channel kept changing to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. I like this scene! But it was the fault of Steven's neighbor, who's TV was close to his, so his remote changed them both. It happens. But one night, there was a terrible storm. The old tree in the backyard grabbed middle child Robbie, while Carol Anne was sucked into the closet and disappeared. But the tree let Robbie go and disappeared. But the family couldn't find Carol Anne. Had she really been sucked into the house? They call in professionals: Dr. Lesh, and crew Marty and Ryan. They monitor activity around the house. The kids' bedroom was full of objects flying around! They were unsure if this was a haunting or a poltergeist. It's obviously a poltergeist, because that's the name of the movie. But for a while, there was no progress. So they called in Tangina Barron, the best house cleaner in the land. She came up withthe plan of one of them going into the other dimension and bringing Carol Anne out. Diane did and came out successful. Tangina smiled and declared, "this house is clean." I don't think so, for that night, more evil spirits attacked Diane and the kids when they were getting ready to move out. Steven to the rescue. They jump in the family car and escape just as the house disappears into thin air. What had happened was: Steven' company relocated the cemetary, only they moved the headstones. They left the bodies and that's what was attacking them: decomposing zombies. The Freelings arrived at the Holiday Inn and checked into their room. A minute later, the door opened and Steven shoved the TV set outside. A pretty good movie. It has it's moments, and one of them is very grotesque. It's where Marty, or was it Ryan, one of them is looking in the mirror and pulling his face apart. Geez! I gotta turn away when that scene comes on. Gross! Look carefully and you'll notice alot of Star Wars things allover the kids' bedroom. Because George Lucas worked on this movie a little too. I'm sorry to say that three cast members are no longer with us: Dominique Dunne (Dana) was killed in 1982 by a creep that should've got life in prison, but only got two years. I also hear the hospital just let her die. Very sad; Heather O'Rourke (Carol Anne) died in 1988 of some strange disease. It is very sad when children die. They shouldn't have to. They should live full productive lives. Beatrice Straight died in 2001, but she died of old age. So in conclusion, this movie is pretty good. It's got Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, and Zelda Rubinstein, who would return for II and III. Poltergeist III was the worst motion picture in the history of anything. I recommend Poltergeist! And we'll miss poor Dominique Dunne and Heather O'Rourke. By the way, Happy 20th Anniversary, Poltergeist! Twenty years ago, we, er you (I wasn't born yet) walked into the theatre and saw this fabulous Spielberg film. Directed by Tobe "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" Hooper and Steven "Jaws" Spielberg. I recommend Poltergeist!!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So says little Carol Anne Freleng (Heather O'Rourke), the clairvoyant daughter who sees "TV people" in this highly suspenseful parapsychological thriller from co-writer/co-producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper. The story revolves around a suburban Southern California family's dealings with noisy spirits (or poltergeists) that have invaded their home. Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams are the heads of the household who must resort to thoroughly unconventional means to get O'Rourke back when the poltergeists abduct her. It is then learned that their house, and others like it built in the Cuesta Verde Estates, are built over what had once been a massive graveyard.Eschewing blood and gore for a combination of parapsychology, sci-fi-like special effects and suspense, POLTERGEIST ranks, with Kubrick's THE SHINING, as the premiere horror film of the 1980s. Hooper, best known for his all-too-effective 1974 shocker THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, gets a lot of mileage out of the story and the cast. Jerry Goldsmith's great score is the capper. After nearly twenty years, two vastly inferior sequels, and a lame TV series that had nothing to do with this film, POLTERGEIST is still effectively suspenseful, as well as a clear influence on the more recent THE SIXTH SENSE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is considered one of the best haunted house/ghost movies ever, but it is actually a hodge podge of some of the worst ghost cliches to have ever come out of a writer's pen. There is nothing in this movie remotely similar to a real haunted house except for the very brief scene where JoBeth Williams turns her back and all the chairs behind her have changed places. Speilberg has created a very chilling movie here, but it is not very truthful to the subject nor is it very accurate. The mere end itself is sheer stupidity as is the concept of a child getting pulled into the spirit world through of all things - a television set !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this entire movie on the edge of my seat. That's how good it was. I enjoyed this movie more so than Jaws. While Steven Spielberg didn't direct this movie (he wrote and produced it), he had an obvious impact. I would have called this movie perfect had it ended after the Freelings had recovered Carol Anne, and were moving out. That was the climax, and it should have ended then. After delivering their final lines, the camera should have moved from the actors to the house, and then panned out in a spectacular view of the entire community while rolling the credits. Instead however, the story continued. And while the scenes after the climax were the most frightful and disturbing, I found them to be tedious and pointless putting an unsatisfying end to an otherwise incredible movie. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Subtle vision about roots of a host of ghosts and activity of the supernatural. Delicate nuances of faith description, slices of historical poem and introspection of ambiguous world, with accent on its fears and expectation.The fundamental virtue of film is the measure. The science to discover the gestures beyond classical images or old definitions, beyond fight against confessional space of the other or didacticist explanations.A film about a family for who the faith, time and relation with God are essence of his self-definition. For who the existence is material for reconstructing the future.The acting of Craig T. Nelson is amazing and Beatrice Straight is a very subtle Dr. Lesh, lyrical, touching, idealistic and cruel in soft manner.In some moments, "Poltergeist" is an ecumenical movie, piece of political correctness but, the Romantic flavor and the intelligent acting are arguments for define it as an interesting exploration of haunted era of present times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg wrote the screen play to this film and most of his childhood ideas made this film possible. When he was a child he hated lightning and thunder and there was an old tree that use to rub against his bedroom window and caused him many problems trying to go to sleep. Steven also looked at television and thought that people were watching him. While this film was in production, Spielberg was busy making another film ET and therefore he gave Tobe Hooper the opportunity to direct this picture. As we all know, Carol Anne Freeling, (Heather O'Rourke) was a young girl in this picture and she started seeing people in her TV and started talking to them and some of them started a great deal of trouble to her mom, dad and older sister. Craig T. Nelson, (Steve Freeling) was the father in the household and JoBeth Williams, played the role as Diane Freeling the wife. This is a very scary film and it started a series of other films. Unfortunately, Heather O'Rourke at the age of 12 passed away and is now on a bigger stage in the hear after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a trendsetting spookfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Poltergeist' was released virtually simultaneously with 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' in the summer of 1982 and there has never been any doubt in my mind which Spielberg production is superior. To me, 'E.T.' is a nice little fairy tale with some cute moments, a two and one-half star film. But 'Poltergeist' is perhaps THE great modern horror flick, a trendsetting movie and one of those which pays homage to to its predecessors while raising the bar for all that follow. I won't get into the who-really-directed 'Poltergeist' argument, Tobe Hooper or Steven Spielberg, other than to say it has Spielberg written all over it. This time, that's a good thing, as the material plays to his strengths and minimizes his weaknesses. He loves telling stories that revolve around a family, which 'Poltergeist' certainly does, and his childhood love of horror flicks stands him in good stead to deliver the scares several times during the warm-hearted yet spooky adventure. Casting of the actors was certainly a key factor in the film's success. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams were hardly household names at the time, but the two of them have never been better, as Steven and Diane Freeling. Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins, and especially Heather O'Rourke each provide exceptional performances as their kids in the film. O'Rourke is a natural child star, adorable beyond words but just as importantly, absolutely believable. There are several ways 'Poltergeist' could have gone terribly wrong. Spielberg manages to rein in his cutesy side just enough; it's still there, but in tolerable doses. It must have been tempting to simply make the ghosts mischievous and funny. Fortunately, one of them isn't, and there is a very real aura of menace and fright as well as concern for what might happen to Carol Anne (O'Rourke). Likewise, the spiritual medium brought in at the end, Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) has her share of funny lines but thankfully isn't played just for laughs. Even though it's a horror movie, 'Poltergeist' is one of those films you wish you were in. The Freelings are such a likable family that you think, "I wish that was my family." Sequels followed (the second 'Poltergeist' is a very decent and scary film) but inevitably they ran out of steam and ideas. The first one however is the real thing and has taken its place among the great horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hollywood Classic Thriller Just in Time for Halloween!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist became famous because it had a stellar star cast featuring Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams as parents in a California suburban home in a new development. Their children are played by Dominique Dunne and Heather O'Rourke who both sadly died before their time. Anyway the cast also features Oscar Winner Beatrice Straight as a parapsychologist and Zelda Rubenstein as the psychic. The story begins with little strange occurrences in the house. It isn't until O'Rourke's character, Carol Ann, gets trapped in the bedroom closet that we don't get to understand that she is being held hostage by a poltergeist and how to get her back. As a student of the paranormal, it is highly unlikely that this event would ever occur but you can't be too sure. Anyway, O'Rourke will always be Carol Ann Freeling to us. She died tragically during the making of Poltergeist III from an illness. If she had lived, she would have been a beautiful woman but she is timeless and trapped in our image as the blonde child. Her older sister Dana Freeling played by Dominique Dunne was murdered by her boyfriend. They are both buried in the same cemetery. While the other cast members have moved on, their loss is still felt now watching the film. It's a good entertaining film. When I was a kid, we all pretended that we were Carol Ann in the closet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been almost 25 years since Poltergeist hit cinema screens, and it's lost none of it's power. A deeply chilling and often disturbing horror film for the way it takes place in the normalcy of suburbia, pulls the rug out from under us, builds the scares and shock effects steadily and effectively until all hell literally breaks loose.Although credited as a Tobe Hooper film, it's quite clear Poltergeist is one of Spielberg's. It has his trademarks all over it. The vision of suburbia coming into contact with otherworldly beings, fantastic special effects, and at the heart of it, an all-American nuclear family. (It was even filmed on the same street as ET. Watch them back to back and you'll see). The Freelings live in Cuesta Verde, and have lived there for five years without incident. Until one night, they're youngest daughter, Carol-Anne, wakes up, goes downstairs, and is drawn to the TV set. At this late hour, the channels have been replaced by static. To us. But to Carol-Anne, it represents something else. Something that she is in tune with, but the family aren't. It's quite a creepy scene really, with Carol Anne's figure reflecting off the static. A very eerie beginning.The rest of the family, Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson), Diane (JoBeth Williams), Dana and Robbie are quite happy in their home, and are completely none the wiser to anything else. But the next night, Carol-Anne is again drawn to a TV set, and this time when she reaches out to it, something reaches back. An ectoplasmic vapour that drifts out the screen and makes its mark on the Freeling house.Strange events start occurring. Chairs stacked on top of each other. Furniture moving by itself. These scenes are quite effective because they portray the spirits haunting the Freeling house as playful and mischievous. But the film is setting us up for a fall. Because things suddenly turn nasty when the tree outside Robbie's window tries to eat him (this is not as silly as it sounds). But this is all a distraction. Because the spirits at work here have a bigger agenda. Carol-Anne. Her bedroom cupboard suddenly turns into a portal, and sucks her into another dimension.As the disturbances intensify, trapping the Freelings in this appalling situation, they bring in parapsychologists and a midget medium to contact Carol-Anne and bring her home.Poltergeist is one of the most effective horror films ever made, because of the way it gets under your skin, and resonates on many different levels. There is something almost psychological to the terrors at work here. The dark cupboard becomes a doorway to another dimension. The scary clown doll becomes a monster under the bed. The gnarled tree outside your window is an entity that's alive and hungry. All childhood fears that stay with you, and something that Spielberg utilises to great effect.Having the spirits kidnap they're daughter is ingenious, because it means the Freelings can't leave. And it means Spielberg and Hooper can draw more and more scares out of this scenario. If it had just been a simple haunting, the Freelings could have left and the film would be over too soon. It would have wound up working less effectively. The way Spielberg and Hooper prevent that from happening is inspired. The visual effects are really quite dazzling and hold up well. The scene where one of the scientists sees his face dissolve right before his eyes is shocking and lingers with you long after the film is over. Items flying about the kids bedroom is a scene that really takes one aback. The beautiful scene of the spirits manifesting in the living-room fills one with wonder and awe. And the ectoplasmic creature that guards the bedroom is brilliantly realised and very scary. It doesn't look like a special effect at all. It looks 100% real!Some of the film's best moments are not always because of the special effects. Some of the scarier scenes are achieved through simple atmospherics. Like when Diane gently opens the kids bedroom door, and an unearthly, beastly roar is the reward for her nosiness. Its a very unsettling and unnerving scene. It scares you without ever using a single visual effect. And its all accomplished by implication alone.Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams convey stellar performances, and give some of the best work of their careers so far. Beatrice Straight makes an impression as Dr Lesh. Her very presence makes you feel better. But Zelda Rubinstein is the stand-out as psychic Tangina Barrons. She is occasionally a little irritating but she always conveys a startling presence. We're never really quite sure what to make of her. Spielberg makes her motivations interestingly ambiguous.Something that pays dividends in the final scenes. It's a point where everything you know is wrong. And the fact that it's so unexpected makes the ending so satisfying. Hooper &amp; Spielberg really pull out all the stops and deliver a grand finale that's a whopper of a shocker. I wouldn't dream of spoiling the ending for those who haven't seen Poltergeist, just that the Freelings get their daughter back, but it comes at a high price. Its an ending that elevates Poltergeist from a well above average scare show to a timeless horror classic.Some of the explanations as to what's going on are unsatisfying and don't quite fill in the blanks as we hope, but the film is so genuinely creepy and entertaining that by the end, you feel just as drained as the Freelings.The greatest horror film of the 80s, and scary enough to make even the most hardened individual sleep with the light on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic from the unlikely team of Tobe Hooper and Stephen Spielberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist (1982) was the first of the horror trilogy. An old fashion ghost story told through the use of modern day technology. Stephen Spielberg wrote and produced this movie and he had horror director Tobe Hooper direct for the most part. For Mr. Hooper besides it being a paycheck, it was a chance to work within the Hollywood movie studio system (he would be a sucker if he didn't take the chance). Sadly he would become a victim of the Poltergeist curse because he never worked on a major studio production again.Poltergeist is a tale about a haunting that terrorizes the Freeling family. The Freelings are your typical All-American family. They're living in a new community that the husband (Craig T. Nelson) is helping developing. One night, the youngest daughter is drawn to a t.v. that gets no reception. That's just one of the strange things that has been going on in the household. But it gets a whole lot worse (and very interesting) from this point on!Stephen Spielberg and company created a truly frightening film. Not only did this spawn two sequels but it became a part of American pop culture. Poltergeist has become a fixture amongst the horror film genre as well. Spielberg used his pull (which would later work for Saving Private Ryan) to secure an R-rating.Even though Spielberg wrote and produced this film I feel that Tobe Hooper should get the credit he deserves for directing this film. Poor Mr. Hooper, his career was never the same after this one. Hollywood should give him another chance.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alarming realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of who actually directed this movie, I have to say it's one of the best true horror movies out there. Other people have mentioned being disappointed in the DVD and I must admit that I, too, was disappointed that they used the last, bad cut of the movie to transfer this one to DVD. The scene change between the kitchen scene and where Diane and Steve (JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson) are standing on the neighbors' front porch, is deplorable. I GOT the DVD version in the hopes of ridding my collection of what I consider a botched dubbing job, and ended up punctuating it with ineptitude, instead. That set aside, the DVD quality itself is horrendous. The film is grainy, you can see dust all over it and the sound fades in and out. I do not suggest you buy the DVD until they come out with a (hopefully) special edition/director's cut. There are no extras on the DVD. Just the movie. (Note: there IS a recent re-release of Poltergeist 2 &amp; 3 on the same DVD...of course the only way to GET you to buy 3 was to give it away with 2...who would want to actually pay for it? There are no extras on that DVD, either. There is one disk, with 2 on one side and 3 on the other and that's it.) While both Hooper and Spielberg are now credited as the directors, it's Spielberg who wrote the original work, the screenplay and is credited alongside Hooper as the director. They say this movie is a product of Tobe Hooper's direction, but I have to wonder about that, myself. If you ask me, it's classic Spielberg, through and through. It feels like Spielberg was sick and laid out a week of production and Hooper got credit because he was just...there.Compared to modern-day epics (the Mummy, Mummy Returns, Jurassic Park, et al, etc), this movie pales. But in its class, there are few out there who can best it for true horror. The effects are good, if perhaps a tad unbelievable (only just a tad) and the story is a great story. Zelda Rubenstein and Beatrice Straight are wonderful as mediums/clairvoyants and this movie is where I first saw and came to love Zelda Rubenstein. She's marvelous! "This house is clear," is HER line! This movie has earned its place in the Horror Hall of Fame, so I won't bother with the storyline or plot synopsis here. But I must say that the direction, whom ever's credit is deserved, is absolutely magical, the acting is some of the best, most believable acting I've seen in a long time (and possibly the best of JoBeth William's career), and the settings and props were very well done. I would've liked to have seen the "Other Side," but it's almost better that they didn't muck around with that and left it to your imagination. The message of this movie, they all have them, don't they? is that love and family are stronger than any other force there is. Another one of my favorite movies. It gets a solid 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Poltergeist" is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. It's definitely the best ghost story ever made. This movie still makes me jump today. Steven Spielberg co-wrote and co-produced this rollercoaster ride of a movie and it's directed by Tobe Hooper of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" fame (rumor has it that Spielberg actually directed some of this). "Poltergeist" is about a suburban family whose home is invaded by supernatural forces. It all begins when the youngest member of the household Carol Anne Freeling (wonderfully played by the late Heather O'Rourke) begins communicating with the ghosts through the television set. Then strange things start happening. Furniture moves around by themselves, silverware is found bent, etc. This is followed by a shocking occurence. Carol Anne mysteriously disappears, but her family knows that she's still alive because they can hear her voice through the TV set. Carol Anne's father Steven (Craig T. Nelson before TV's "Coach") and mother Diane (JoBeth Williams) call on some psychologists (including Oscar-winning "Network" actress Beatrice Straight) and a diminutive psychic (Zelda Rubenstein) to try to get her back. "Poltergeist" is one hell of a scary movie filled with outstanding special effects, a creepy music score by Jerry Goldsmith (who received one of his many Oscar nominations for scoring this film), and splendid acting from the cast. Plus it has a good sense of humor. And just when you think the movie is over, more terror follows. The recent ghost story "The Sixth Sense" may be a good movie, but "Poltergeist" is better. It's excellent in every way.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror Steven Spielberg ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on experience, yet made for the big screen, "Poltergeist" is one of the best ghost films I've ever seen. It really wants to reach out to the audience and say, "BOO!" But wants that? That's child's play! Here You got a family in middle class suburbia, the house in a big valley in California. The perfect life. YEAH RIGHT! The other side lurks in the home of The Freeling family, and little Carol Anne(Heather O'Rourke,1975-88) gets herself sucked in. Losing a child to the supernatural is worse than losing it to a child predator of any sorts. The Freelings are more than determined to get Carol Anne back by all means. I liked the part where the brother Robbie(Oliver Robins) has all the Star Wars memorabilia in his room, and the scene where that clown doll attacks him from behind and tries to kill him. Diane(JoBeth Williams) was great looking in the movie when she and her husband Steve(Craig T. Nelson) were getting high. But Diane almost got disrobed by the poltergeist when she was moved all over the place. And Steve was completely outraged by his boss when he finds out why these occurrences where happen especially when he's building phases on a cemetery. At least he didn't blame the descendants he blamed the company he's working for. Steven Spielberg deserved a lot of credit for this movie, the cast is great, the plot and the story is outstanding. And I'm glad he made two more sequels. Sadly, the success had it's price for the first one. Dominique Dunne as the eldest sister did her best in this movie. May her memory live on! RIP Dominique Dunne. For the movie here, nothing can top it! Rating 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marred By The Test Of Time, But Still Effective In Parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making excellent use of its resources, brilliantly paced from start to finish &amp; employing clever use of horror elements throughout its runtime, Poltergeist might have been one of the most influential &amp; heart-pounding horror films of its time but over the years, its scare factor has diminished by a great deal, thanks to its dated special effects &amp; countless imitations.Set in a California suburb, the story of Poltergeist focuses on one particular family whose home is abducted by malevolent ghosts. Amusing at first, the paranormal activities within the house soon begin to intensify but things turn for the worst when the family's youngest daughter is abducted by them. With the help of parapsychologists &amp; a spiritual medium, the family tries to bring her back.Co-written &amp; produced by Steven Spielberg, Poltergeist isn't directed by the revered filmmaker but despite that, it feels more like his work than Tobe Hooper's, the director of this film. There are many sequences here which carry Spielberg's trademarks and even the scary moments carry some playful undertones. The technical department leaves less things to complain about with its dynamic photography, superb editing, impressive VFX &amp; splendid score.The performances by the cast is no slouch either but here it's the sum of the parts that turns out to be more effective than any individual contribution. And, there are also certain moments when you can't help but roll your eyes at few things that appear quite silly now. On an overall scale, Poltergeist is a very finely crafted horror movie that promises a fun &amp; entertaining experience and despite being marred by the test of time, it can still surprise the new comers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist isn't really scary. It really isn't. That may be because I've recently seen "The Shining" for the first time, and that film scared the crap out of me. Thats not to say that Poltergeist doesn't have scary scenes, It does. Not gonna spoil anything, but there are some scenes that truly makes this qualify as a "horror" movie, but if those scenes wasn't in it, It would be a spooky thriller no doubt. I actually really enjoyed the characters. I wanted them to survive, but I thought some didn't have enough screen time (like the big sister, she's the only one I didn't care for) But where the movie really shines, is in the last 25 minutes. It gets really intense and action packed, and I loved it. It moved the film up a good notch.In conclusion:Pros:+Some truly scary scenes+Fun concept and enjoyable characters+That freaking clown+The last 20 minutes+Good characters...Cons:-...but some of them deserved more screen time-Slow start-Not that scary8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A STEVEN SPIELBERG Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the controversy surrounding who really directed Poltergeist (1982) supersedes the film itself but make no mistake, Steven Spielberg desired his name to resound above all others.Tobe Hooper's film credit as Director is literally surrounded by Steven Spielberg credits and if that was not enough, the end credits begin with "A Steven Spielberg Production" spread across the screen. If Tobe Hooper's "director" credit had been the first at the end of the film, the psychological effect would have been to give the director greater credit. Spielberg intentionally drowned out Tobe Hooper's contribution by using this calculating method to all but pronounce that he and not Hooper had been the director. That said, there is no doubt that this is a Spielberg film. His finger prints are all over it. Tobe Hooper was simply relegated to the post of jobbing director. He had little if no part in the post-production process by way of editing, sound design or scoring.It has often been said that a film can be made or broken during the editing process and it is clear that Spielberg's intention was that the slog of the shooting schedule should be somebody else's burden. It appears from contradictory testimony given by the cast and crew that Spielberg was on set most of the time physically directing scenes or "directing" Tobe Hooper from the side-lines. If the cast can't agree to who actually directed them, then we can assume that Tobe Hooper was employed as the grunt to service Spielberg's imagination.The opening scenes exploring the family unit are brilliantly done because it is late in the proceedings before any expository information is imparted. This confidence in the attention span of the audience and the leisurely pacing of the opening sequences allows the audience time to empathise with the characters. Tobe Hooper's raw style of film-making is balanced by Spielberg's overt sentimentality. One scene in-particular could only have been directed by Spielberg because of the laborious sentimentality it evokes. The scene in question is where Beatrice Straight as Dr. Lesh whispers lyrically about the super-natural in terms ripe for kiddy consumption and helps to equate any paranormal activity with bullying. Poltergeist also gives the audience two thrilling climaxes. Once the daughter is rescued from the clutches of the "beast" and the house is pronounced "clean" the film calms to prepare the audience for yet another relentless climax.Tobe Hooper's career did not thrive after Poltergeist. Much of his subsequent output has had to rely on his associations with his low budget classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). Spielberg on the other hand has become the movie mogul he so wanted to be. His latter work has been markedly inferior to his early classics. Spielberg cannot help but coat his recent movies in his unique brand of syrupy indigestible sentimentality. Speliberg has been blamed in part for the "dumbing down" of American popular cinema but his early works such as Jaws, Close Encounters and Poltergeist show a remarkable talent and faith in an intelligent audience. He seems to have forgotten or lost this gift or insight while crusading to control and produce a considerable part of Hollywood output.Classic SpielbergDuel (1971) - Jaws (1975) - Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) - Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - Poltergeist (1982) - E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) (The Syrupy Nonsense cements itself here) - Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) - Jurassic Park (1993) - Schindler's List (1993) (A great movie sentimentalised by the modern day sequences)Syrupy Nonsense Spielberg The Color Purple (1985) - Empire of the Sun (1987) - Always (1989) - Hook (1991) - Schindler's List (1993) (As above) - The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) - Saving Private Ryan (1998) (The opening sequence is classic but proceeding drama is sentimental nonsense) - Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001) - Minority Report (2002) (More nonsensical rubbish than anything else) - The Terminal (2004) - Munich (2005) - War of the Worlds (2005) - Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) (Could this be considered one of the worst movies ever made?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boo who?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched POLTERGEIST again after 25 years. One of the most enjoyable rainy afternoon movie days was spent in the luxurious Paramount Theater Sydney with 1200 screaming others laughing and rolling about as we all shrieked in breathless unison through this terrific film. In 2008 with 100 CGI boo-fests behind us, POLTERGEIST does seem more than a little Disney but there are several key factors as to why POLTERGEIST still mostly works: It has a terrific script, quite moving in explanations of the undead and their suburban wanderings; also the family (casting) is completely real. The laugh breaks in the most tense scenes are genuinely uproarious and elicit tremendous reaction (especially if with a large group watching). I dislike re-makes but I will admit that if the same script and story line was re made as a 3D CGI extravaganza, POLTERGEIST might just be the right remake for the new century. If you were lucky enough as I was in 1982 to have seen POLTERGEIST in a huge gorgeous packed cinema as I did then POLTERGEIST would remain in your memory as one of the best fun frights of your life. For those too young, get the DVD onto a huge TV and invite 20 of your best friends over and settle in for a genuine scream-a-thon. As with other comments on this site, I too seem to remember other snippets missing from the DVD I watched. I seem to remember far more of the watches and jewellery falling through the ceiling, and the scene of the ghosts coming down the stairs was longer and more scary. What I saw tonight seemed trimmed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start saying that I have very fond memories of "Poltergeist", as this was one of the few films that terrified me as a kid and among those films that started my interest in cinema in general. Those very good memories of it made me doubt of re-watching it as many movies I enjoyed as a kid have been turned out as disappointing now that I'm older. To my surprise, "Poltergeist" was an exception, and more than 20 years after its release it still holds up well and manage to give good scares.The plot is the classic story of a haunted house tale, a young family is attacked by ghosts that inhabit their home, things go wrong as they kidnap the youngest of the family, little Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). The story follows the basic outline of this kind of ghost stories, with the family going from disbelief to terror as the poltergeist activity increases. Sure, not the most original plot ever, but the magic of "Poltergeist" is in the execution of the film.Many controversies arose about who exactly directed this film, as apparently, producer/writer Steven Spielberg was in charge of most of the artistic decisions leaving only the actual shooting to Hooper. This is the most plausible scenario as Spielberg's influence shows up through the movie and it could be easily referred as "E.T."'s scary brother. This is for both good and bad, as "Poltergeist" exemplifies the two most important characteristics of a Spielberg film: its imaginative compositions and its shameless excess of melodrama. As usual in his stories, children are the focus of the story, Carol Anne's kidnapping and her brother's haunting experiences with the ghosts become the central events of the movie in a similar, albeit opposite, way to Elliot and her sister meeting with the extraterrestrial in "E.T.".Spielberg's story takes the haunted house story from the dark ancient castles of Gothic novels to the suburban landscape of 80s society. Contrary to old school haunted house movies, "Poltergeist" makes a good (and extensive) use of special effects to portray the haunting, and despite looking a bit outdated by now, the visual effects still are effective. Despite everything pointing to the contrary, one is left to wonder if Tobe Hooper had a hand in the many action-set-pieces that take place in the film, as its over-the-top action is very reminiscent to Hooper's style in horror movies.The cast is another important element in "Poltergeist"'s success, every member in the cast is simply perfect. The parents, played by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are excellent and have very good chemistry; their believable performance is what gives the movie a heart, as the fear is based more on their reactions than in the overload of special effects shown. The children of the family are very good, but even when they are the focus of the film, their role is somewhat small. Completing the cast are Beatrice Straight as a parapsychologist and Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina Barrows, the Clairvoyant; both of them very effective and appropriate in their roles.Still, "Poltergeist" is not a perfect film, the script is filled with action-set-pieces that while look very cool and completely terrifying feel somewhat out of place in the film. The characters at times make very illogical and out of character decisions that serve only to move on the plot. Spielberg has claimed that the movie contains most of the things that gave him nightmares as a child and this is possibly the reason of the many disjointed scary scenes placed on the film. However, one has to recognize that this little details only come out when one gets picky on the movie and that at first sight come unnoticeable. After all, the movie is written more as a surreal nightmare than as a realistic portrait of a poltergeist."Poltergeist" was a favorite of my childhood and still is a haunting experience. I would not say it is a perfect film, but it probably will become a classic in the near future due to its unforgettable scenes and its entertaining plot. Definitely one of the best horror movies of the 80s. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the MPAA rating would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, the PG rating on the Australian DVD cover put me off. I need not have worried. Poltergeist is one of those films that, were it made today, would probably face a more restrictive rating. Parly because its content has an untapped potential to disturb, but mostly because the MPAA and its equivalents in other English-speaking countries have become more nanny-like as time has gone on. Not that Poltergeist is a soft film by any stretch. It is a two-hour testament to the fact that it is not the quantity of kills or scares that count so much as the quality. In spite of the fact that it has more than its fair share of silly moments, and not a single character dies during the running time, it keeps the viewer in a heightened state of fear throughout.Part of the winning combination for Poltergeist is in the casting. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson fit the ideal parent archetype perfectly without becoming nauseating. Dominique Dunne works wonders in the minimal screen time she has, making it all the more tragic that she would not live to see a sequel, or any future performances for that matter. Oliver Robins is competent, but Spielberg wisely decided to minimise his screen time. He is incapable of emoting in a believable, human fashion, or so his performance here would suggest. The big surprise in this cast is Heather O'Rourke, who, like any good actor, manages to milk a line consisting of a few words for all it is worth. Indeed, the signature warning "they're here" would not have become such without her creepy intonation.Part of the film's problems lie in the confusion over who is really directing here. Tobe Hooper, fresh off such fare as the TV version of Salem's Lot, and with the mother of all slasher films on his resumé, should have been trusted to deliver a masterpiece on his own. For the duration of Poltergeist, however, one can clearly see the arm of Spielberg protruding from his buttocks. Whether Hooper would have made a more explicitly violent film without being puppeteered is debatable, given that he supposedly shot The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a PG rating in mind. But this is where Hooper excels as a director. Rather than brutalise his cast before the camera, he shows enough to get the viewer's imagination going, and lets said imagination do the rest. This is the one touch in Poltergeist that gives it bite. Without this Hooper touch, it is doubtful that it would be remembered as such a classic.Unlike Tobe Hooper's other most well-known classic, Poltergeist has not aged that well. The special effects look very dated, as do the sets and costumes. Most films bear a mark of the year they were made in to one degree or another. Classics like RoboCop, for example, announce that they were made in the late 1980s through their political tone. Poltergeist, on the other hand, might as well have had "this film was shot in 1981 or thereabouts" stamped on every frame. Even the clever placement of Star Wars toys, obviously insisted upon by little Steven Spielberg, dates the film mostly due to the fact that the toys seen have not been in production since the original Star Wars films went to weekly rental at the emerging video libraries of the times.Still, when all is said and done, Poltergeist is a film worthy of an eight out of ten. If nothing else, it proves that one cannot judge the quality of a film solely by its rating, at least not where films from the 1980s or before are concerned, in any case. It is well worth seeing once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're good!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I'm not a fan of horror movies, because most movies in the genre lack realism and are completely over-the-top (with hundreds of zombies crawling around, blood splattering all over the place,...). But not every horror movie fits that description and "Poltergeist" is certainly one of the more original ones.We see a middle-class suburban family, living in an average family house in a very nice neighborhood. So far, nothing abnormal, except for one thing. Through a dead channel on the television, their youngest daughter, Carol Anne, seems to be connecting with ghosts or spirits. Soon the creatures show themselves by coming out of the TV and entering the house's walls. In the beginning it all seems to be innocent and harmless. The ghosts do some tricks, much to the amusement of the family, but don't harm them. At least not in the beginning, because later on they start terrorizing the family with an angry tree and a murderous doll and finally even abduct Carol Anne into her bedroom closet, the entrance to the "other" side.The special effects may look a bit dated, but you have to take into account that this movie was created in 1982, so long before the time of the excellent computer animated graphics that we know now. The story is very good as well, but it is the acting who makes a real difference. All actors did a fine job, but especially Heather O'Rourke is very good as the platinum blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Despite her young age, she is very convincing and did an excellent job in this movie.If you want to see a very good horror classic, without ridiculous amounts of blood or gore, than this is definitely the movie to see. I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist (1982)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1982 was a very good year for Steven Spielberg: not only was his name attached to E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, but the unparalleled success of the previous year's Raiders of the Lost Ark began raking in video sales, and somehow in the midst of all this a little film he made named Poltergeist achieved mediocre success. Even though the direction credit was technically given to Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Salem's Lot), it is quite obvious that this is purely a Spielberg movie: you have the atypical suburban family, the alien intruders, and the almost-too-perfect ending. And even though some might pretend to disdain Spielberg's formula, there is no denying that it works -- most of the time. But let's get to that later, and focus on what's great about the movie first: the story follows the Freelings as their house is abruptly taken over by other-wordly forces and their daughter disappears into the house itself. Not knowing what to do, they bring in a group of paranormal investigators (led by Beatrice Straight) and end up having to perform an exorcism on their own residence. JoBeth Williams plays the flawed-but-loving mother who only wants her daughter back, and Craig T. Nelson is the devoted husband, but these aren't your typical movie parents: they smoke pot at night in their bedroom (very good pot apparently, since you'd have to be pretty high to be attentively reading a biography of Ronald Reagan) and don't freak out when their furniture suddenly turns into an episode of H.R. Puf'n'Stuf (come to think of it, maybe the whole movie is one big drug-induced hallucination -- cue Twilight Zone theme). The script (by Spielberg and two co-authors) follows the Spielberg Formula rather closely, but -- like all of his films -- it has just enough originality to maintain its pulse. The cast is impressive: the daughter (played by Heather O'Rourke, who died at a terribly early age and spawned the notorious "Poltergeist curse") has some genuinely creepy moments, and Williams and Nelson are both fully submerged in their roles. A special prize goes to Zelda Rubinstein, who's a hoot as the off-beat clairvoyant who "guides" the family through the process of retrieving their daughter. In one scene, Zelda is about to enter the parallel universe and Williams tells her, "She won't come to you; let me go." Zelda replies, "You've never done this before," and Williams quips, "Neither have you." There's a brief pause before Zelda decides, "You're right; you go." Moments such as these recall the impeccable brilliance of Raiders, but sadly, they don't last for the entire duration of the movie. Poltergeist is like a cross between The Exorcist and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but the problem lies in the fact that it never really decides which side it belongs to: it's one of those movies that tricks you into believing there's much more going on than there really is (in reality, the characters are simply standing about in their living room talking to the television), but it doesn't always uphold the illusion. There are times when you start thinking about how fragile the film truly is, and as soon as you start thinking about that it becomes very easy for the movie to just fall apart: luckily, Poltergeist never does -- but it comes awfully close. It redeems itself with some authentically frightening moments -- there was at least one part that truly made me jump, maybe two. The movie begat two sequels -- both of which you shouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole -- but (as is the case most of the time) the original is the only one of any substance. Poltergeist doesn't always work (it's certainly not a masterpiece in the vein of E.T. or Raiders), but when it does succeed, it does it in spades; it's a semi-classic that may just be worth a second look.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fabulous movie, only one thing bothers me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta love a movie that was filmed in the town where I've lived for over 30 years. Besides, it's Spielberg. Even the minor characters are well developed--Ben, the next-door-neighbor for example. There's a real genuine quality about the way the house is decorated and the clothes people wear in this movie, it looks like they went down to Mervyns on Sycamore Dr. and bought out the store. It's a real slice of 1982. The parents are "reformed" hippies who still smoke pot. I get a pang of nostalgia when I see the way Simi Valley looked back then, when building on the hillsides was, for the most part, not allowed.This is a very scary movie; at least I was scared the first ten times I saw it. And the special effects are great for its time.The one thing that bothers me is toward the end of the movie. After going to hell and back--literally--why would any husband and father leave his family alone in the very house where it all took place? And would any mother really leave her two young children in the very bedroom where the "heart" of the house was? Geez Louise, the portal to hell was in their closet! But no, she goes in, takes a leisurely bath, dyes her hair, turns on the blow dryer and shows a complete lack of concern. I guess to her Tangina's words "This house is clean" were gospel. I just don't buy it!Aside from that, this is one of the most entertaining movies of all time. I never get tired of watching! Fabulous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good scary fun...WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POLTERGEIST is a movie that, like THE EXORCIST, has been plagued with bad rumours and sad news. The rumour that Spielberg directed the film instead of Tobe Hooper and the sad deaths of Dominique Dunne at the time of the original film and Heather O'Rourke after the third film in 1988 has heightened the stories over the years, but whatever the truth, the film is still one of the best of it's kind.It is the sort of movie that Hitchcock may well have done if he had still been alive well into the 80's and there would have been a lot more darker moments in addition to the ones that are on show here.Inevitably, the use of light and shadow is a key strength of the film and the simplicity of the scares are more deceptive than imagined which makes them all the more powerful. (For the record and without letting on, two key ones take place in the upstairs corridor and the kitchen!!)What's also nice about the movie's set up is the way that some of the scares are turned into laughs (Carole-Anne's slide across the floor wearing a football helmet when the poltergeist is first encountered) and the first acknowledgment to the neighbours that things are not all them seem is played with the right touch and mix of emotion and dramatic requirement.Jerry Goldsmith provides another classic soundtrack score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Ghouls and Ghosts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is a funny movie. It isn't scary, but somehow remains involving. The biggest problem is that there is too much of an emphasis on its plethora of FX and not enough on mood. This was also the case with Spielberg's Jurassic Park movies. Many scenes resemble Close Encounters of the Third Kind in intensity--of light that is.Tobe Hooper, relishing the success of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, would go on to emphasize the "light show" aspect of this movie with Lifeforce. Fortunately, this supernatural thriller is better in both acting and depth. At many times you can see the influence Poltergeist has had on such horror spoofs as Evil Dead, Ghostbusters, and Beetlejuice. In many cases he lets the scenes play out themselves, that is far more effective than a flurry of cuts. Of course, it is Spielberg calling most of the shots because he knows he is a better storyteller.Thankfully, the creators of this aren't trying to make a teen slasher flick, hence there is no sex. If horror movies are supposed to be scary, why do they feel the need to include people making out? Horror is about assaulting the senses and Spielberg does this in a fashion similar to Jaws, but to lesser effect.The casting is fair, but not exceptional. There are the usual Spielberg suburban stereotypes similar to ET that he released the same year. While the dialog isn't very great, it could have been a lot worse. I was surprised that the black guy didn't die--does that count as a spoiler? Many other Spielbergian elements are present such as the family makeup and interaction, the role of the father, etc. and lend a familiar note the movie.Spielberg called the movie his "revenge on TV" and he is correct. The whole movie is one giant satire against the television set, in some ways it's made more obvious than others...right to the end. Jerry Goldsmith's score is disappointing, though, since it resembles an amalgamation of his work on Alien, The Omen, and some John Williams subliminal touches thrown in the more peaceful scenes. Overall, while not at all scary, Poltergeist remains a decent suspense flick with very high production values. I can certainly recommend it higher than The Amityville Horror. A little less babble from the parapsychologists would have been nice. 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SILLY AND HIGHLY OVERRATED, YET IN THE END SOMEHOW SATISFYING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The generation that was young during the cultural movement of the 1960's and early 1970's now are all in their 50's and 60's, and have young children (teenagers and kids in their early-twenties). This group of young adults, born in the eighties and raised in the 90's, are commonly considered the generation after the generation during Vietnam, JFK, and so on. But what about those in the middle of these two generations? Those that were born in the 70's and raised in the 80's? I believe that this group of individuals, now in their 30's, has been forgotten. Why? Because the 80's was and is totally insignificant, and doesn't even equal half of the importance of the 60's, 70's, or 90's. Should we even consider those raised in the 1980's a generation? Regardless, they definitely consider themselves a generation, and within that generation there are favorite 80's films. "Poltergeist," loved by those young during the 80's, is now mostly considered a silly and overrated escapade by all those that belong to another generation.The rumor is that although Tobe Hooper technically directed this movie, the creative control and input from Spielberg was so concentrated and numerous that in some circles he's credited as co-directing the film. And by the end of this picture Spielberg's creative control is so blatantly appearant that it's sickening. This isn't surprising, considering Spielberg wrote and produced the film, but if Hooper was left on his own I believe this movie would have been much better. The reason for this is because Spielberg, widely considered the most formulaic and corny filmmaker alive (definitely so by yours truly), couldn't decide with "Poltergeist" whether he wanted to make a truly scary horror film or a fun-for-the-whole-family recreation of a Disney Land ride (complete with bright flashing lights and skeletons). Some parts of the film lean towards scary, and then Spielberg feels he's pushing a boundary or breaking routine, so he throws in bouncy music and comic punch-lines. Not to mention that there's literally about fifteen minutes of character development before the bizarre occurrences pop-up, and it takes about 10 seconds for the little girl (who, just like in "The Shining," made two years prior, can sense supernatural happenings) to convince her mom of what is actually going on ("It's the TV people mom"). So, after miniscule development, and after play-it-safe plot evolution, it's time for Mr. Lucas &amp; ILM to come and save the day with some truly good special effects (one of the only positive things about this film in my opinion). But even in the midst of "terror," none of the performances are really convincing, and because of the lack in story, none of the haunted house-type situations seem conceivable. If you're 12 or 13, you'll probably really like this film (or if you were raised in the 80's), but if you're a more discerning film lover, comparisons to "The Exorcist," "The Shining," "Rosemary's Baby," and the rest of the greats are inevitable; and, unfortunately, "Poltergeist," can't stand a chance.This film has great FX for its time, a few semi-creepy scenes, and one or two interesting cinematic moments, so I recommend it. But don't expect what you've heard, because it just ain't that good of a movie. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightening Spielberg production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY RATING- 6.9It's quite a frightening mov directed by Tobe Hoper and co produced by Spielberg, thing that is visible with atempts to scare all of us. This time Spielberg challenge us with a house that has a lot of paranormal disturbances. The victims are JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson and his kids, specially the little daughter who is capturated by the ghosts.We get really scared with some scenes in the kids' room with the alive tree attacking. We even get a pause when the ghostbusters leaded by Beatrice Straight and a midget woman appear. The final attack is particularly frightening, with all that difficulties of getting out of the house, but it can't get out of my mind the time the midget said `This house is clean'. Too early to say that, I think-- One thing that also confuded me was JoBeth Williams being so young and having already a 17 year old daughter! Overall, a nice spooky flick, but not the best of the genre.</fullReview>

Now Tobe Hooper has talent, if you have ever seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre of Lifeforce, then you know what I mean. This film doesn't seem like a Tobe Hooper film. There are scenes that remind me of Spielberg, but not Hooper. If anybody else feels this way, write me if you know something. It's a mystery I would like solved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay ghost story, but a little too loud and obnoxious at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess there's no objective reason for it, but, in my mind, ghost stories should be subtle. In general, I think all horror films should be subtle. Poltergeist is anything but subtle. It's a loud, flashing, exploding horror film. The basic story: a suburban family is terrorized by ghosts. It starts innocently enough, with a young girl hearing voices come out of a television, forks bending and chairs being moved. Three minutes later, though, ghostly hands are shooting out of televisions, beefsteaks are crawling around like slugs and giant demon heads are popping out of the closet. It's all too much, too fast. Watch the scenes in The Exorcist where objects begin flying around the room, then contrast them with the scene in Poltergeist where the paranormal investigators open a door and see the objects there flying around. The film was directed by Texas Chainsaw Massacre auteur Tobe Hooper, but the marks of its screenwriter and producer, one Steven Spielberg, are all over it, and not generally in a good way. That's not to say I didn't like the movie. In all honesty, it has a lot of memorable moments, from the iconic "They're here!" to the chair stacking sequence. There's a really good use of a false climax, which I imagine caught people off guard at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is ass (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In times past, religion was considered the opiate of the masses. Now, though, television seems to have taken its place. All throughout the land grown men fall asleep to its warm, comforting glow and children everywhere suckle on its electronic teat. The idiot box has taken over our lives.Poltergeist begins with the 'Star-Spangled Banner' ringing comfortingly from a suburban television set as a middle-class father respires gently in the living room. Yes, it's the TV that is the centre of this family, not the man snoring in an armchair.At first the Freeling family is kind of amused by the fact that their daughter talks to the television set and that weird forces are present that move furniture. But just when the family thinks the phenomena is harmless, a tree attacks their son and a closet eats their daughter.It must be said that the special effects for the tree attack are simply atrocious. Yes you have to bear in mind the fact that the film was produced in the early 80s, but still, there's very little horror to be had when you can clearly see that the tree is made out of rubber ? it wobbles like mad. And it also doesn't help that the dialogue is atrocious. A young child is being sucked up by a tree and it's going to eat him and the child screams, 'It's taking me in!' I don't know about you, but if I were about to be devoured by a woody plant I'd be screaming in a series of grunts. I wouldn't be very precisely describing what was happening like it was a minor annoyance.Another abysmal piece of effects work occurs when a group of paranormal investigators are trying to help the Freeling family. One guy wanders the house at night and sees a piece of meat crawl along the kitchen work surface. It then opens up and maggots crawl out. Disgusted, he goes to the toilet and then sees his face becoming distorted like the meat. He then rips his face off, flesh coming apart in handfuls. Really this should be a scary scene, but it just looks ridiculous. The face-melting scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark is infinitely more effective.But the film really does fail quite spectacularly in trying to be scary. There's one bit where through a bit of nonsense the mother has to go into another dimension to rescue her child who is trapped between worlds. In order to do this she has to go into the closet while attached to a bit of rope that her husband holds. So the husband holds onto the rope as she disappears and then from within the closest comes a massive skull. It's meant to be a frightening physical manifestation of the evil force that is holding this family hostage, but instead it just looks like a gnarly skull a marijuana-sozzled Ozzy Osbourne fan would worship. Confronted by this fearsome sight you could imagine this fan getting on his knees, venerating it with the devil horns finger salute and rhythmically banging his greasy, lice-infested head.Then there's the infamous clown scene. Now I know a lot of people have an irrational clown fear. Somehow they fail to appreciate the belly laughs that strange men with white painted faces, freakishly bright hair and silly clothes generate. They don't see the warmth, the love and the benevolence that resides within. But still, the clown doll in this film is insane. It leers at the children like an inanimate psychopath. Quite why any parent would buy it, I don't know. But despite all of this the scene is just silly. The toy strangles the child and drags him under the bed and then the child beats it up. Maybe if you're ten or you've never embraced clown love, it's a crapathon, but otherwise it's just kind of amusing. But poor kid, eh? First a tree tries to kill him and then a toy clown wants him dead. Have a nice life, pal. Don't spend too much on therapy.But even though we're meant to feel sorry for this family, I can't help but wonder whether they had their tree/skull/clown apocalypse coming. We see the mother smoking pot while the father avidly reads a book about Ronald Reagan. Yes, you took your hippie ethos and got into bed with a monkey-loving, gay-hating, astrology-fixated nincompoop. Congratulations, you're middle-class, conformist scum.And there's also a scene where the youngest child is watching the static on TV. The mother comes along and says it's bad for her eyes and switches over to a war film. Yes, violence is much better for a child's eyes.But the criticism of Reagan's America goes further. The father sells houses for a corporate scumbag who moves graveyards to make way for housing. But to make it even worse, we find out that the family's house is itself on the site of an old graveyard. The only problem is that only the headstones were moved ? the skeletons were left in place, hence the bad vibes.The end of the film sees the family booking into a Holiday Inn and then moving the television out of the room. The lesson to be learned? Corporate greed is bad and you shouldn't let television bring up your children.But although it's nice that a horror film has a message, it's a shame that the film is so poor. The film is devoid of scares and most of it makes little sense. Plus it features a wise midget with a strong Southern accent who supposedly gets rid of all the bad vibes only for the clown doll to go mental when she's gone. I hope the Freelings sued her tits off, the useless, ghost-obsessed, midget charlatan. 'This house is clean' my ass.</fullReview>

Then another movie ! (When The TV Swallowed Our Kid !) It's about kidnapping the child with too long conversations about death looked so naive and separated from what's before and what's after as just a try to make some depth for a horror movie wants to be unusual and thoughtful. Then a third movie already ! (The Night of The Living Dead) about how the angry corpses take over, take down, and take in the whole house with some very serious satire about that capitalist immoral old man who undervalued the values for making money when he built over the cemetery with no respect for its holiness...So why didn't the spirits attack his home instead ?! Why the innocent buyer not the criminal entrepreneur ?! Moreover how could those very spirits come back after the confirmation of the great medium ?in the second movie's end !- that "This House is CLEAN" ?!! Don't you ever exhaust yourself in thinking, only enjoy the good cinematography, and the dexterous frightening moments (the climax's sequence was their best), and don't busy yourself much with the social or the philosophical issues that had been presented through this because it's not that serious, nor coherent (The TV devours children, consumes the middle class and imprisons them ? death is a part of the life ? when money became more important than soul...The Dead became more life than the living, etc..) like it's more than one ball in the ground of one match !I didn't like the music score at all, it seemed bigger than the movie, or that it's expressing some things and the actors' performance along with the story are expressing some things else ! Plus I couldn't define who's the enemy here exactly ? : The TV ? ?good spirits vs. bad spirits ? - Living Dead want to revenge ?! ? The opportunism of business men ? ? The innocence and the ignorance of their honorable employees ???..Save the question marks and the exclamation points to deal with it like this : it's nothing but a bright showy work wanted to allege cogitation yet unsuccessfully. So as you see seriousness was a ghost in here !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My entire review may have a lot to do with the fact that I watched this today (april 2015), which is probably the reason I didn't like the movie, but I really think it was bad; really, really bad. All of this film is just poorly done. I like Steven Spielberg's work and I am a huge fan of horror movies but Poltergeist lacks a lot of interesting things to be considered a classic, or a good horror movie. I feel like it is overrated mainly because it falls under the "it's from the 80s so it must be rather good" conventionalization. Firstly, the plot is nonsense even though it could have been great. So an entire neighborhood was built over a huge cemetery, which is why these random ghosts decide to kidnap, for whatever reason, a young girl during a stormy night. Her parents seek help and so a group of ghost-busters goes into the house and, by doing pretty much nothing, save the girl. After that there is a huge ghost manifestation that forces the family to finally leave the house, and that's it. Almost two hours for not too much going on. The effects are good for the time, the acting is solid, camera work is flawless, but there just had to be more to this film! Its tone felt WAY too comic, the horrible music appears to be composed for a drama flick, and there aren't just enough "scary" moments. I am not talking about jump-scares (no one cares about them), but about creepy atmospheres and unsettling events! This movie lacked that precisely, and it's the whole point of horror movies! I understand that 70s-80s was the era of slashers and maybe Poltergeist tried to do something different for the time being, but it just didn't get it right.All in all, this film isn't a classic nor the best horror movie ever made nor anything memorable. If you wish to watch it just for the sake of it being popular and famed, go ahead, but have in mind that this isn't 1980 and therefore it won't be even slightly impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grow up, Spielberg! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing Poltergeist I had a hard time imagining how the teaming up of top sicko Tobe Hooper and saccharine merchant Steven Spielberg could work. Hooper's Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a horror giant, but since Jaws, Spielberg's been unable to stop wetting his pants at any movie rated above a PG; how these minds could collaborate successfully was a mystery to me. After seeing it, I realised it was a mystery to them too.Poltergeist is an uncomfortable blend of Spielberg's happy-family obsession and Hooper's plan to make you leave a trail of vomit behind you on the way out of the cinema. Every time the horror element gets too scary, Spielberg steps in to show us the magic of suburbia and undermines the whole thing. Imagine taking The Exorcist, removing the tension, blasphemy and profanity, keeping the unconvincing effects, and filling up the gaping holes with Nutrasweet, and you've got yourself this half-hearted horror-free horror movie.Set in beautiful Spielbergville, a new housing estate in the heart of Cloying County, the startlingly unoriginal plot sees a house invaded by a poltergeist. And then a bunch of dead people. And then the devil, who, for the sake of an audience-boosting PG rating, is referred to only as `The Beast'. I can't believe I just wasted four seconds of my life explaining the plot, when the title sums it up in its entirety. And there's a huge flaw right there, because while Spielberg's inability to write subversive horror is the biggest problem, a close second is the movie's inability to keep its secrets to itself.This is a film called Poltergeist. The name of the movie tells us right away that it's about a poltergeist. There's no ambiguity in the title ? this isn't `Could Be A Poltergeist', or `Maybe It's Related to The Storm', it's called Poltergeist. The secret's out. So while the first forty minutes of the movie are spent watching the (blissfully happy) family trying to understand why their youngest daughter has started talking to the TV, the audience remembers the title of the movie and starts twiddling its thumbs.Where The Exorcist or the Chain Saw Massacre built tension based on the predictability their titles had given them, Poltergeist remembers how desperately it wants a PG rating, and simply kills time. In a humane way, obviously. The only build-up Spielberg allows is a sliding chair and a bendy knife and fork. It's hardly edge-of-the-seat stuff.This non-tension is followed by a non-finale which takes place twenty minutes before the film's running time is up. Anyone who believes we'll spend the next twenty minutes seeing the family living happily ever after has obviously stolen Spielberg's rose-tinted glasses and doubled the thickness of their lenses. The predictability is just depressing, and the second finale is no more interesting than the first.This is a useless horror that ignores the concepts of tension, gore, realism, logic, and horror itself. After watching this weedy offering, even The Waltons would tell Spielberg to drop his loveable-family theme and get some cynicism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie hoping it would be scary,since its very famous and everyone was telling me i should watch this. So,it started out pretty well then it just went downhill.I mean,a tiny lady with helium voice and a ugly looking clown doll,come on? The story isn't even trustworthy,and nothing scary happens at all.I cant believe how this is considered as a horror movie. One of the worst movies that i have ever seen. The scariest thing about this film is that it got 2 sequels,that just gives me the creeps considered how crappy this movie was. I give it 1/10,but if i were able to give it 0/10 believe me i would. My advice,if time is precious to you then stay away from this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny how you can view the same movie at different times in your life and feel totally opposite of how you viewed the same thing years ago. Like most people, I loved this film when it came out and enjoyed it both at the theater and on VHS a handful of times. However, after a long absence and watching this a couple of years ago, I went the other way.On the last viewing, I got totally turned off in the first 20 minutes thanks to Jobeth Williams' character, "Diane Freeling." A foul-mouthed, pot-smoking Mom is going to be someone we are going to root for? Not me. She's a main character in here and way too abrasive. By now, she and the film look too '70s. For something that many people thought was a kids' movie because it was the same year as Stephen Spielberg released his "E.T.," it was certainly anything but kiddie fare.However, I cannot deny this wasn't another entertaining Spielberg effort with some wild, memorable scenes. Who can ever forget little Heather O'Rourke sitting in front of the TV set and saying, "They're here!!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone I know loves this film and I decided that it was time I saw what is considered a classic of horror. I was pretty let down. The plot is barely being held together by anything. The movie suggests causes for the events in the house left and right and quickly discards them. The actual events started off being subtle, but then we are quickly thrown head first into an array of crazy events that feel like they were there to cover up the many plot holes and show off ILM's command of the effects. The acting is mediocre and the effects, while impressive, feel out of place. I personally did not find the movie to be scary at all. So, why is it that everyone loves it so much? Maybe we just feel like we have to because its a "classic". I know that initially after the credits started rolling, I thought to myself, "did I miss something? That wasn't even that good."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A better-than-average horror movie. Not that it says too much, as horror movies set the bar quite low...Being written and produced by Stephen Spielberg and directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), it started from a position of advantage over most horror movies...Decent story setup and build-up. Plot is fine, though does rely on a few horror clichés. Genuinely scary and not at all predictable at times, it does put most of today's horror movies in the shade.The special effects haven't aged well, unfortunately, looking quite sloppy at times.Good performances all round, but especially from Jobeth Williams and Heather O'Rourke (as the youngest daughter).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on Spielberg....don't lie. This film is obviously all your crafting, it has your handprints everywhere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is about a haunted house in the middle of suburbia. A family of five is living the peaceful life when one night their youngest daughter Carol Anne starts talking to something inside the TV. With the iconic lines "They're heeeere" a series of paranormal events occur with the Carol Anne being sucked through the closet and into the spiritual world. Refusing to leave her cursed home Diane, the desperate mother played by Jobeth Williams, contacts scientists and spiritualists, doing everything in her power to get her daughter back. If the question is does Poltergeist scare then the answer seems to be a mixed yes and no. Unfortunately Poltergeist is a film that doesn't age well with time. The reason being is that Poltergeist relies heavily on its special effects and puppet techniques that simply seem ancient nowadays. With computer effects advancing at such a fast pace anything over 20 years will seem antiquated. At the time I'm sure the effects were miraculous but watching scenes from Poltergeist today is like going to a 50 year old ride at Disney land. Yes there's a bit of charm to it but the tricks are only going to work on toddlers. One example is the "tree" scene, where this tree made out of wire and molding is clearly not a tree at all and looks ridiculous obtuse in their suburban backyard. The scene I found the scariest actually occurred in the first five minutes and had no special effects. The scene is of a little girl with huge eyes and strobing lights. The vulnerability of the girl alone combined with the music is a powerful effect. Everyone knows this movie is going to be full of scares but not knowing what they're going to be is the terrifying part. Poltergeist is a little long; six minutes short of 2 hours is far too long to sit still being scared every 15 minutes. The story is a little uneven with very important characters introduced into the movie very late. The acting is not too bad. Williams' desperation comes from a true place most of time but many of the side characters aren't all that impressive. The film also starts to grow a little cancerous towards the last third. What I mean is that all of sudden the haunting expands in dramatic fashion but instead of being "scarier" Spielberg simply goes for "bigger". The special effects are enlarged in scope stretching beyond the house. This choice almost takes it away from horror and turns Poltergeist into scifi, which we know Spielberg is great at. However in this case I don't think a clear cohesion between the two genres was achieved. At its release Poltergeist was probably break through for its time. There are some unique scares which you will notice from other films that copied it but the overall Poltergeist doesn't contain that 'timeless horror' feeling like that the Shinning or The Exorcist. Who this film is not for: -People who don't like horror films -People who constantly obsess over the quality of the special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Horror Film, But It Is Flawed (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSI have finally seen Poltergeist. I can not believe I have not seen it ready. I mean, it is supposed to be one of the greatest horror films ever, right? Well, this is a great film. It is spooky, the special effects are quite good for the 80's, and JoBeth Williams' acting is great. The rest of the acting is a bit over-the-top, especially Zelda Rubenstein. That voice shall haunt me for the rest of my life. This film is flawed, of course. Some scenes are more funny than scary, like I said, some of the acting is weird, and some scenes are just boring. With all that being said, here is the summary.The Freelings are your normal suburban family. There is the mother, Diane, the father, Steve, the oldest child, Dana, the second oldest, Robbie, and the youngest, Carol Anne. Then, strange things start to happen in their house. Carol Anne starts to hear voices in the television, calling them the TV people, who are actually ghosts, chairs start to move around, and forks bend. Then, Carol Anne goes missing. The family then hears Carol Anne through the television. It turns out that the ghosts took Carol Anne to their dimension. The family hires three parapsychologists to the house, who are shocked of what they see. It turns out that the ghosts in the house are a poltergeist, not a regular haunting. They find out that the ghosts have not gone into the light yet, so they took Carol Anne because she gives off the most light force. Not only is there ghosts, there is also the Beast, a mean spirit that uses Carol Anne as a distraction from the other ghosts. They hire a medium, Zelda Rubienstein. She discovers that the entrance to their dimension is in Carol Anne's closet. Diane saves Carol Anne, and all the ghosts go away, except for the Beast. The Beast wants Carol Anne back, so he attacks the family. The family escapes, but they found that the whole problem started because the neighborhood was built on top of a cemetery.Overall, this is a flawed horror film, but it is also one of the best and the most frightening. I mean, come on, who is not afraid of the scene in which the clown attacks Robbie? Clowns are frightening either way. Still, probably the most mysterious part of this whole movie is the aftermath of Poltergeist. I think you know what I mean. Anyway, some scenes are cheesy, some are scary, but either way, this is truly a great horror film.8/10Recommended Films: The Amityville Horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yuppie Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie when I was a teenager. However, I'm less impressed these days. Like me, this movie hasn't aged as well as it could have.Hippies-turned-yuppies Steve and Diane are living the American Dream in Reagan-80s suburbia. Unfortunately, the planned community that Steve helped build (and where he, his wife and their 3 children currently live) has been erected over a cemetery; the headstones were relocated, but the bodies left to rot, forgotten, beneath the high-priced houses. The dead are not at rest, and when Steve and Diane begin digging up their back yard to make room for a swimming pool, the violated spirits finally decide to get mad AND even. Driven by a powerful force of absolute evil (identified only as "The Beast" - make up your own mind whether or not it's Satan Himself) the desecrated dead invade their home and kidnap their youngest child, a 5 year old girl named Carol Anne. This is an interesting horror movie, in that there are no deaths and very little violence. Instead of being driven from their home by the demonic forces, the family sticks together and fights back, determined to regain their stolen child. The special effects look a little dated, but they're still pretty cool: a guy rips his face off in front of a mirror, moldy corpses with black eye sockets pop out of their coffins and bob about in the unfinished pool, an elongated white, skeletal phantom with the head of a beast blocks the doorway to the childrens room and a closet door turns into a giant fleshy tunnel complete with writhing tentacles seeking purchase. This is really a very good film...but it would have been better if it had a few less Spielberg-ian touches. Tense moments are made overdramatic, the kids are too cutesy and therefore somewhat unbelievable and much of the dialogue is ridiculous, characters emoting so hard and heavily that you just want to smack them so they'll get to the point at long last. The pristine neighborhood and beautiful homes are so perfectly sunshiney and neat that it's almost a relief when it's decimated at films end. The angry dead seem justified in their actions, and I found it difficult to empathize with a privileged family who has everything, living a perfect life without a care. In a way, it almost like watching a stupid slasher film, laughing as the obnoxious, popular jocks and cheerleaders get butchered, and the virginal outcast saves the day and lives to see another: it was therapeutic (for me, anyway) to see the perfect family disrupted, their perfect lives thrown into chaos and their perfect home turned into a house of horrors. I don't think I was supposed to feel that way...but I did. Maybe it's not a bad film, maybe I'm just sick...but I liked this movie better when I was younger and more innocent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many believe that the films hype is its only saving grace. Its pedestrian pace slows the film down although it has enough memorable scenes to justify its running time. The `happy, happy family' prospect of the film is a used idea and comes off as being lacklustre. It's a shame they didn't use more popular actors, as the leads are a serious case of, `where are they now'. One good thing about the movie was that it didn't need any hi-tech visual effects to come across as chilling. Spielberg's directing was excellent and brings a tremendous atmosphere to the film. On the whole I enjoyed Poltergeist. It has its flaws and various scenes of unnecessary, gratuitous nonsense. But hence the old saying, `the ends justify the means'. 8.2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I'm another person who has seen this movie at a real young age. I had to ride my bike home in the dark from the neighbor's house after watching it. Nevertheless, I rode real fast. As a kid, this movie scared the hell out of me. Being afraid of lightening as a kid, that one particular scene was terrifying for me. As a 7 year old I would rate this movie as a 10. Much more terrifying than friday the 13th movies.Now from an adult standpoint. I can get over the cheesy special effects. I still watch other older movies with outdated special effects and still like them. The acting is absolutely horrible. Many say it is good, but I cannot find any good acting anywhere. I'm still looking for it. The story is uneven, and the characters actions are very dumb- even compared to other horror movies. Production quality while better than most horror films, is still lacking. Perhaps I am biased knowing that this is a Spielberg film.The only thing this film has going for it as an adult, is the memories I had of how scary it was when I was a kid. I can still feel that fear. So the movie's only purpose today is as a nostalgia piece. The rest of the movie is not good enough for an adult to enjoy.Summary: This film does not stand the test of time. Watch the original Shining instead</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Tobe Hooper is credited as the director of Poltergeist, it's common knowledge that the film's writer/producer Steven Spielberg had more than a little creative input: the film's content and style?the suburban setting and scenes of familial domesticity, lavish Jerry Goldsmith score, and flashy Richard Edlund effects?are much more redolent of the man who gave us ET than the one who unleashed Leatherface on an unsuspecting audience in '74.But even if Hooper was nothing more than a puppet for an exceedingly busy Spielberg (who was also directing ET at the time), it doesn't change the fact that Poltergeist is a solid piece of mainstream horror entertainment?a tasty concoction of spooky supernatural occurrences, sudden shocks, touching emotional drama, nail-biting tension, and even a little gore, all wrapped up in a satisfying, shiny, big-budget blockbuster package.Whilst it would have been extremely interesting to see what Hooper might have done with the film had he been left to his own devices, there are no guarantees that the end result would have been as impressive (after all, the director has had his fair share of turkeys): let's just be grateful for what we've got?a damn fine film that still stands the test of time (and which features not only one of the freakiest clowns in cinema, but also one of the finest movie MILFs in the form of JoBeth Williams).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg and Horror... A Different Kind of Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The daughter (Heather O'Rourke) of a family (headed by Craig T. Nelson of "Coach") encounters the "television people", spirits she can hear talking inside the television's static. One night the house shakes and the spirits come loose... can the family live with their new house guests, who may be more than merry pranksters? This film is Tobe Hooper's other big hit, following "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" (though the under-rated "Funhouse" is far better). Allegations persist that he is largely undeserving of credit, being guided almost entirely by Steven Spielberg. True or not, this does not take away from the film, which is nothing short of legendary... from the theme song to the iconic phrase "They're here"...Now, I can see the Spielberg influence... this has a very "E.T." vibe to it, and is for the most part not nearly as dark or gritty as Hooper's other work. No excessive violence or torment. Sure, maybe some scenes are disturbing or creepy... but not much beyond a PG rating. (Of course, PG does not mean a bad horror film... look at "The Gate".) But one has to sympathize with Hooper -- with Spielberg writing, producing and storyboarding, what wiggle room is left for the director?I do not have much to say in the way of criticism for this film. It has stood as a classic for over twenty-five years, and with good reason. I do not see much sense in my saying what others have said, and even if I were to trash it -- which I will not -- it really deserves to be seen simply for its place in horror history. If nothing else, enjoy the beautiful score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great effects, but a better script could have done wonders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a big fan of supernatural horror/thriller, I may be somewhat biased against any movie that has a theme like this, with haunting and ghosts and all, but I have to admit, I really enjoyed this film, despite not being able to pay attention to the whole thing and thinking that the script was somewhat poor. I have never really believed any of the supernatural/more-between-heaven-and-earth stuff, but this film actually managed to make it scary and exciting. The plot is decent, but it drags too much for too many non-effect scenes, especially just after the first hour has passed, and most of the scenes involving the clairvoyant. The pacing is decent, but as I said, the film seems too slow after about one hour or so, and I couldn't keep watching attentively. It surprised me, actually, as I had enjoyed pretty much everything leading up to that moment. The acting is decent, but nothing special... not a big surprise really, as most of the actors are unknowns. This didn't really hurt the film, though, as they seemed credible enough. The characters are well-written and credible, though I found the character of Dana, the teenage daughter, to be an almost entirely redundant addition to the family/group of main characters, as she really didn't do anything in the film... at all. The special effects are extremely well done, I didn't find a single one to be poorly executed. The direction is pretty good, but not good enough to manage to keep my attention for the just less than two hour runtime. The script is somewhat poor, and the story seems to be made up to showcase the - admittedly great - special effects. The film also seems to try a little too hard to provide comic relief, possibly to reel in a bigger audience; not to say that it didn't work... I laughed at just about every piece of comic relief that the filmmakers sent my way. However, I think that they just made us, the audience, laugh a little too much for us to take it seriously, in the end. Maybe that's what brought the movie down... or maybe it was the so-so direction in the last half of the film... but most likely, it was just the script. I recommend this film to fans of supernatural horror, and possibly fans of Spielberg and Tobe Hooper, seeing as they both had quite an effect on the final cut of this film(though, according to the rumors, Hooper did far less than Spielberg). I give this film a 7/10, just for entertainment value. If I hadn't found it so damn funny, intense and well done special effects-wise, I probably would have given it a lower score. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>traumatizing for kids, weak on scares for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist unsuccessfully attempts to hide its true status as a Steven Spielberg film. Even though Tobe Hooper injects some of his usual style into this film, the final product looks so patently Spielberg-esque that it's hard for me to even digest it as a horror film. That said, Poltergeist is typically juvenile as Spielberg films go, with a heavy degree of emphasis on a family coming together through a rough situation (much like E.T., Jaws, or Empire of the Sun) and a lot of the stuff as expressed through the point of view of a child (much like Jurassic Park or A.I. Artificial Intelligence). I'd have to say that this came much to my dismay, as this film certainly works best children or adults who have somehow retained a childlike innocence all through their years. Spielberg's best two films were his first two `horror' films: Duel and Jaws. Most of his subsequent work is so excessively juvenile in execution that it's hard to understand how he maintains his status as perhaps the only celebrity director. It's a pretty sure bet that he called the vast majority of the shots in Poltergeist, with Hooper placed mainly as a stooge to do the more technical stuff and to take all the blame if the movie tanked. In a sense, this totally ruins what could have been a really good movie.There's certainly some good effects put to use and some genuinely frightening concepts such as the killer tree, living door, the imploding house, and giant mouth opening up in the wall, but overall they fail to really instill any real horror as they never really seem too menacing. This is probably due to Spielberg's hesitance to show the world as anything less than totally `goody-goody', as best expressed by how he makes old people seem all ethereal and all knowing (compare the presentation Tangina to all the old folks on display in Spielberg's ultra-corny segment on Twilight Zone: the Movie). Real horror could have been accomplished had anyone ever actually been harmed or killed over the course of the movie. The best chance would have been with James Karen's character, who's clearly the villain and the most deserving of a horrible fate (at least as would be most foreseeable in a typical Spielberg flick ? as Spielberg always has to take some `old white guy' and make him the only evil character). The ending fails to even kill him off, even though he's just standing around pretty much just waiting to be killed. It's so infuriating that I almost wanted to climb into the film and just slap the `poltergeist' in the face. Not only does it fail to kill anyone, but it doesn't even seem to have the ability to injure people, making me wonder what the hell all those characters were scared of in the first place.Had Tobe Hooper really been in charge and in full Texas Chainsaw-mode, this could have been a lot more functional of a horror film, well at least something as effective as say, Funhouse. A little bit of a sense of menace and a lot less of Spielberg's cutesy-poo vision of the world would have helped this movie in providing more than cheap, superficial scares, and might have been one of the scarier movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GET OUT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist is a slightly entertaining, mildly frightening film that suffers from a horribly written final fifteen minutes. And that is too bad because the rest of film is quite good, it's just that what happens at the end of the film seriously hinders what you feel about the rest of the movie. If Brody went under water with a knife and some flippers at the end of Jaws to try and kill the shark, would it have been as good? If Michael Myers pulled off his mask at the end of Halloween and said " surprise!!!" would Halloween have gone down in history as one of the best horror films ever? If Leatherface just gave up half way through the forest while chasing Sally through the woods, would it have been as revered as it is? The answer to those questions are most certainly NO!! What happens at the end of Poltergeist is just awful. I like Spielberg and consider him to be one of the best directors in the world, but his botched explanation at the conclusion of Poltergeist is abyssmal. It is on par with any number of dim-witted teenagers venturing into a dark barn and calling out hello 12 times before they get hacked with a machete by Jason. We'll get to this later.What is good about Poltergeist is some of the basic primal fears it makes us deal with and comprehend. This is the story of a suburban family and suburban kids that are afraid of things that really have no basis of fear to them. But large, ominous trees are foreboding and evil looking. Clowns have evil smiles and look mischievous. Night lights are always on and there may always be something under the bed. Most of the time in life as in this film, these are all irrational fears. But the one time they are not just fears, the one time they become deadly entities, they can kill. This is what Poltergeist is great at.Spoilers ahead.Poltergeist is about a house that was built on an Indian burial ground. When the company excavated the ground, they removed the headstones but not the bodies. So the house wants to extract some revenge for this blunder. Freaky things begin to happen. For instance, the young Carol Anne gets kidnapped by the TV people. The family spends a great deal of time and probably money to get her back. And when they finally do, they decide that it is time to move out of the house. So instead of moving out immediately, instead of getting someone else to pack up all their things and perhaps stay at a relatives house or a hotel while this is being done, they decide to stay one more night and then leave the next day. Now I don't know about you but if I had just seen my daughter kidnapped to a different world, watch ghostly skeletons appear from that porthole, watch my daughters room whip things around like a 24 hour temper tantrum, have a spirit lady help us get our daughter back by "cleaning" the house, then having to go into that porthole myself and get my daughter back and watch as many other ghostly things happen, I'll tell yo this. I am not staying another minute in that house. I am getting the hell out. Not only do they not leave right away, but they send the kids back into the same room where all of the pandemonium started. That is just ludicrous. That is the acme of stupidity. And this left me feeling bitter towards the film. Of course this sets up some of the better scenes in the film but what a silly way to do it. Couldn't Spielberg think of a better way than that to do it?6.5 out of 10-- The film is tense in some parts but laughable in others and it is not the film that everyone seems to think. There are other better horrors out there, even from the 80's. Check out April Fools Day, The Changeling and Angel Heart for a good chilling experience. Poltergeist is worth a look, but don't expect a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Lord, this movie is loud! Two hours of nonstop noise that you are thankful is over, when it's finally over. This movie signified the end of Spielberg's filmmaking magic. It was the beginning of his making brainless, soulless fare like this and "E.T." It was at this point that he became more a manufacturer of "entertainment" than a creative director of it."E.T.," also in 1982, is essentially a dumbed-down version of "Close Encounters" for children or for those who want all the edges polished away. No need for characters you could believe exist in the actual world. Instead they're replaced by mannequins who have little to no dimension.The 1980's was all about that, following the Reagan call to give up on humanity, give up on dreams, and just crank out lifeless stuff and make the most money possible.And so, "Poltergeist" is one of the most perfect examples of this. It is sort of entertaining in its thoroughly stupid way, but that's about it. Tobe Hooper, who had directed "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," went on to direct something much closer to his fairly perverted sensibilities with the great, and thoroughly nuts, "Lifeforce" in 1986. Here, he's more gun for hire, technically being the director, while it is said that Spielberg was on the set more than Hooper, and shot most of the movie. You can tell!If this movie accomplishes anything, it is an accomplishment for the Visual Effects and Practical Effects teams. Creating an atmosphere of horror is out of reach to a vast majority of those who worked on this.The one person in the cast who hits the mark is Heather O'Rourke, who out acts everyone else by a good margin. Jerry Goldsmith, as expected, turns in an excellent score, and contributes what is easily the most artistic component to the film.**** (4 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like horror films. No, I love them. But this...this was not horror in the common sense. It was horrible.The plot could have been good if it weren't for the acting, the music, the special effects (ridiculous), the set....the everything else.I wanted to like this film, I really wanted to, but I had no chance. I watched it with my boyfriend an we both agreed that this was a really bad film.I cannot even write down everything I hated about this film because I have a word maximum, but how about a sneak-piece of how bad this film actually was?There is a Poltergeist (which is no spoiler since that is the title) and they drew it. Like, with pencils. It looks like a Disneyfilm! A bad one! Yes, fine, the film is old, but come on, that is the best they could do? I doubt it!SPOILERThen, at one point in the film, the mother and the daughter return from what I understood as some kind of afterlife and, without any reason, they were covered in a pink glibber. It made no sense and it was disgusting. I am just writing this down because it kind of summarizes the film. Weird and inexplicable.Do NOT watch this, I advise, do NOT! Eat a sandwich instead, that will be more thrilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Freeling family are happy and functioning perfectly well until one night their youngest daughter announces that thru the TV, the supernatural are here!Poltergeist divides the horror crowd big time, the gore fans are simply not impressed by the events in the film, while ghostly supernatural fans such as myself see it as a wasted opportunity. But strip away the flashy production and you start to see the core joke of kids infatuation with the goggle box, so yes, the film could easily be titled under the banner of being a Black Comedy. But be that as it may, and lets not be under any illusions here that, Poltergeist is not a knowing wink wink horror film of substance, the film really could have been a truly terrifying piece of work to cater for all tastes, and I firmly believe that that was the main intention of the makers from the off.Thus lies the chief problems with Poltergeist, it tries so hard to cover all bases it gets that confused to the point it veers from tedium to shock and back again before you have time to digest, and it kills what should have been a genre masterpiece. There are moments in the film that chill the blood, the sense of creeping menace hangs heavy during a storm, a toy clown becomes evil personified just by being lit in the stormy light, and then? Well it violently switches to something involving a tree that wouldn't be fit for Creepshow 27! On the film goes, suspense with chairs and pieces of meat, and then BAM...monster time! It just doesn't work, it's a collage of genre splicing that both director Tobe Hooper &amp; producer Steven Spielberg are firmly to be held responsible for, because it's obvious that both their signature's clash to create an uneasy bedfellow.Yet as uneven as it is, and as blatantly plagiarised as it is of Twilight Zone episode Little Girl Lost, I still find myself enjoying watching Poltergeist, with its slick production and some memorable moments; the clown, poor darling Heather O'Rourke saying "they're here", the first chair sequence, and the always creepy Mrs. Tuthill, all things that help to make it a frustratingly enjoyable nights viewing. 6/10Just don't go into the light afterwards I guess...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of Spielbergian excess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had been 24 years since I last saw this, when it was in theatres, and I thought I'd take another look at it tonight on TCM. Back in 1982 this picture was the other horror thrillride to come out along with John Carpenter's re-make of The Thing. I saw the Thing again a couple of years ago only to find it a little dated and flimsy though the SFX and some suspense scenes still had impact.Poltergeist? Nothing has held its impact with this film, a cheap carnival ride that the years haven't been kind to. The SFX is shoddy, the suspense non existent, and it amounts to little more than Spielberg (and Toby Hooper too as the story goes) hurling everything including the kitchen sink at the screen in an attempt to scare the audience.In 1982 I was young enough to not care about a structured storyline, set-up and hadn't yet seen films like Rear Window to teach me that horror and suspense pictures don't require a shock a minute, gory slime, and a lot of noise and flickering lights to make you squirm in your seat. So naturally I ignorantly came out of the theatre with my friends awe-stricken at what I'd just seen. Spielberg went with the visceral over-the-top approach, the glossy blockbuster with his usual gimmicks hopeful for a McDonald's tie-in, and any value this film had as a result has long since faded. It's just not scary or shocking anymore. If anything it's ridiculously overdone and tiresome. I'm surprised he never shot it in 3D what with all the flying objects and in your face effects.I love most of Spielberg's films, many of them go over the top as well, but this one was Spielberg in overdose mode, out of control with no regard in any way, shape or form for self restraint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, the scariest part of it was not the plot, but the one scene where the boy is looking at that giant stuffed clown. I've always hated clowns, and it still freaks me out to think of how he looked at the clown, looked away, and when he looked back again, the clown was gone. I was sleeping over my friends the first time i saw this, and the entire night i had nightmares that i would wake up and not see my friend, but instead, the freak clown with the creepy smile on it's face. Another scene that sends chills down my spine is when the little girl is staring at the television, and says "They're here......" and a strange and scary voice, like she is possessed. it freaked me out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoilersThis film disappointed me on so many levels. Mainly because I'd looked forward to watching this film since I was seven or eight and wasn't permitted to see this until I was old enough. Even worse I managed to see the sequel first at a friends house.Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper were responsible for this. I believe Hooper took control of the directing after Spielberg handed the directors chair over to him. Initially the film starts off in the similar vein to E.T, a suburban setting followed by comedy moments involving the neighbours and builders. First the Freelings little girl Carol-Anne starts to talk about the `TV People', before the rest of the house start to experience strange things. Then a tree grabs Carol-Anne through her window and whisks her off into the sky. This scene features one of the most ridiculous hurricanes in cinema history (even for 1982), and the characters actually believe it to be legitimate. Madness.Soon the film starts to go downhill when the family hire paranormal investigators, who investigate the strange goings on and the disappearance of their daughter, who appears to be talking through the TV set. The fact the family realise there's a supernatural force in the house early on took something away from the film, also Carol-Anne is a great actress and great presence as the sequel proved, and her absence for being captured made me feel empty. Instead the real meat of the film is in the family getting Carol-Anne back and the mothers relations with one of the investigators, and very little on understanding who captures her daughter and why.The climax of the film is over-the-top and quite frankly ridiculous. After the gargantuan struggle of getting her daughter back, mother Diane goes for a bath and leaves her daughter in her bedroom of the same house which nearly killed all of them. Nice idea, Diane. Here we are treated to an opening to the other side and a monster which looks like it's stepped away from a filming of Sesame Street. Wouldn't you want to get the hell out of there with your lives after you've had to go to another world to rescue your daughter? Personally I don't like Spielbergs films to be overly depressing. I love the start of the film and its resemblance to films like E.T and The Goonies. But here the loss of a child looms over you and creates a rather depressing tone the whole way through. Maybe that was because Tobe Hooper took the directors chair, he directed Texas Chainsaw Massacre after all. When Carol-Anne is finally rescued it's too late to make a good go of the supernatural force, Spielberg could have done so much more of it.I can understand why some people really enjoyed this film, but for me it was disappointing. Without Amityville I doubt this film would exist, even though Poltergeist is a much better film. The sequel and even Poltergeist 3 did so much more for me. Still a good film in its own right. I'm still confused as to why this film ever received a PG rating in America, for the one scene of a man ripping his face off. Very strange. 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grab-bag ghost story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening to theaters at about the same time as Steven Spielberg's "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial", this much-nastier supernatural story was quickly seen at the flip-side of that commercial release. Everyone in the know was aware that Spielberg conceived this film as well, and his homey sense of humor and penchant for carnival ride-type scares is evident in the direction (particularly at the beginning and near the end), although Tobe Hooper receives the official credit. An ordinary family living in sprawling suburbia is initially tantalized--and then, quickly, terrorized--by ghosts in their home (the smallest child's closet seems to be the poltergeists' entrance into the abode, although they first make contact via the television). Hooper gets a good, jovial rhythm going which may feel somewhat slight or derivative, and yet is also amusing at the same time. By the mindless third act, with bodies piling up, the film ditches originality for "Raiders of the Lost Ark"-styled effects, and one is distinctly aware of the plagiarism. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Girl Lost in Hell House...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I pointed out in print at the time of this movie's release, POLTERGEIST comes across as an ode to the late Richard Matheson. His name appears nowhere in any of the credits, but his influence is there. In LITTLE GIRL LOST, an episode of the original TWILIGHT ZONE series, we have a little girl who disappears, apparently, under her bed one night. It turns out that she's actually disappeared through her bedroom wall. The parents can HEAR her, calling to them from The Other Side, but they can't see her. At one point, her dog goes through the Doorway and eventually leads her back. In THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, a team of paranormal investigators that include both a physical and a mental Medium tackle "the Mount Everest of Haunted Houses," the dread Belasco House- a.k.a., Hell House. If one were to combine these two scenarios, one would end up with- viola!- something very much like POLTERGEIST. Throw in a couple of dope-smoking One Percenters and a trio of really Bland suburban kids and you're all set. While most people contend that it was Steven Spielberg calling the shots behind the scenes and not the credited director, Tobe Hooper, I can't really say it matters much, one way or the other. The movie's not very interesting (and it sure ain't scary). An early example of Horror Light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Hollywood makes this a dull movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to revisit this movie after more than 10 years and was disappointed. If you saw this as a kid in the late 80s/early 90s you were probably as terrified as I was. Unfortunately this movie just hasn't aged well at all. The special effects look juvenile but that's not even my main problem with this movie. Personally, I couldn't stand the bombast, the hammy acting, the melodrama and the god-awful depiction of "ghosts" as lonely spirits. Give me a break.It honestly felt more like a Disney live action cartoon than a horror movie. On top of that the story jumped around with little to no explanation. The little girl disappears, the boy is almost swallowed by a tree and no one sees this? Their neighbours must have been deaf and blind to have missed what was going on next door.But it wasn't all bad. Like I said, this movie terrified me when I was younger and I think most kids would still be scared of this movie (though they would probably laugh at the special effects). The clown doll, the ominous tree, the skin peeling scene are all pretty scary (the last one isn't really for kids at all).Check this out if you haven't already, you might like it. Just remember that it was made in the early 80s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-the-top bi-polar haunted house movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersPOLTERGEIST is an over-the-top (OTT) haunted house film which sorta suffers from "bi-polarism." We all know the controversy about who really directed the movie. Oddly enough, IMDB has included Spielberg as "co-director" of the movie, adding more controversy to the whole thing. Personally, I don't think we'll ever know the truth behind the making of this movie (unless an actor comes out and spills the beans) but by just looking at it, it's obvious the movie was directed by Tobe Hooper. You only have to watch all his films to see his unique style of filmmaking in evidence throughout POLTERGEIST. With that said, POLTERGEIST also contains a ton of typical Spielberg treacly bits and ideas which gives this film a particular bi-polar character. Some moments are total Hooper (the Tangina character, the attempt to go through the other side, the ever extending corridor, the overall chaos, etc) while others are total Spielberg (the suburbs, kids in jeopardy, cue-in the clever one-liners, the constant whispering, the showy special effects, etc). Fortunately, the movie NEVER suffers from this "bi-polarism." In fact, I think it added a lot of odd character to the film.The real problem with POLTERGEIST is the ridiculously over-the-top horror elements, most of them during the ending. The film should have ended after they rescue Carol Anne. Up to that point, the movie is steady and even if there are some OTT moments (the tree attacking the kid), it's still pretty much fun and sorta credible. But the ending, after they rescue Carol Anne, feels tacked-on and suddenly the film's credibility is literally thrown out the window. For instance, the kids are back in the room. If those kids were real, they wouldn't have returned to that room, with that closet and that clown, for anything in the world. It just doesn't make any sense for them to be there again after what they went through. Then there are the coffins popping out of the earth, the numerous attacks on JoBeth Williams, the odd monsters appearing here and there (what were they?). But the most ludicrous thing in the movie is that huge vagina-like monster appearing in the closet and trying to suck the kids and Williams. I mean, come on! What in hell was that? It's the goofiest monster thing (I don't know what to call it) ever conceived for a movie. I always laugh out loud whenever I watch that moment. It's not scary or terrifying. It's just over-the-top silly. Had they come up with a less cheesy monster, I think the film would have been a classic but for now, the OTT ending sorta keeps POLTERGEIST in the silly category.If you're a huge Tobe Hooper fan like me, watching POLTERGEIST is a no-brainer. Just remember that this is a Steven Spielberg produced movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not very good at all. Its not scary, its mostly risible. There are some nice moments but there are too many bad moments (the tree, the swimming pool, the end...) and in the end whatever may've been good about the film gets lost amongst all the crap. The special affects are well naff. I know this film is kinda old now but that's no excuse. The acting is pretty good though, with the actors playing the parents each giving good performances. The little lad-type fellow is extremely annoying however and I would've actually been glad to see some dark forces take him away. The musical-score is awful and cheesy. Good on old Spielberger for having a go but like a lot of his films there's an overwhelming cheesy, 70s/80s americana thing going on. Whuch in some films is brilliant here its like horror-by-Disney. And all the Star Wars toys/posters/bedspreads in the house, I mean I know Star Wars was BIG but get your nose out of Lucas' ass Stevo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Film like 'Poltergeist' is Scary, Creepy &amp; Innovative! Tobe Hooper directs this eerie and disturbing story with proper treatment, while producer Steven Spielberg offers him the correct ambiance.'Poltergeist' has been a favorite for many years now. Released way back in 1982, this horror flick still manages to throw in the chills, it promised to offer even then.There are many ways to look at life, and there are many ways to look at a film. 'Poltergeist' is unsettling, it questions you the thoughts, it raises. You witness a family breaking, you witness the supernatural take over them. It's a difficult story to make and comment upon.What also stands tall in this cult-hit, is the acting. Late Heather O'Rourke delivers a splendid performance, and evokes the intuition within the viewer each time she appears. Craig T. Nelson suits his part and performs with sincerity, while JoBeth Williams is flawless. Another performance that stands out is by, the Late Dominique Dunne.On the whole, They have been better Horror Flicks, and that's the reason why I rate 'Poltergeist' 6, rather than a knock-out 10 on 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, produced but not directed by Steven Spielberg, couldn't be more distant of Spielberg's own 'E.T.' (both are from the same year), as this one is a horror film and quite a strong one...'Poltergeist' has elements characteristic from the 70's and 80's, yet it manages to be surprisingly modern and its impact is still deep. Like I said, it has elements from the 70's and 80's - for example, the house looks like the house from 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'E.T.', besides, there are ghost-like special effects not unlike 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'.On the other hand, it has very strong content which is so common in the 2000 generation, making it some 20 years ahead of its time. Not only strong, but disturbing and not recommendable for more fragile people.For something that is nearly 30 years old this sure is scary and freaks me out, with stuff such as: a little girl communicating with ghosts, spirits sucking the little girl through the TV and the extremely difficult and risky attempt to save her (which turns out to be successful but only after a long nightmarish experience), some absolutely terrifying spirits that could give you horrifying nightmares, a possessed tree winning a life of its own and grabbing that poor little boy through his bedroom window and nearly swallowing him, the terrifying swimming pool scene with skeletons, coffins and skeletons erupting from the ground throughout the neighborhood and in the house, the house possessed by dark and evil forces and even being collapsed into nothingness, the immense stress that this family faces because of these terrible events... as you see, a large number of creepy paranormal episodes.An interesting film but not necessarily a good one. It's not that there is that much of wrong with it (even considering it's far from being a masterpiece) but it's a very disturbing and frightening film. It ain't for everyone. Whether you like it or not, it's an experience you'll never forget. Good or bad (to each his/her own), it is that memorable and its impact is long-lasting.Heather O'Rourke, our little Carol Anne, is unforgettable and amazing in this difficult role. Her talent is worth mention. Plus, she is so natural and has those very expressive enormous sparkling blue eyes that look like two pieces of sky. She was a very pretty little girl, she looked like a little doll or even a little angel. I think it's adorable the way she says the famous line «They're here» with her cute voice. Sadly she died ill and way too soon.Dominique Dunne stars as the older sister Dana in a minor role that unfortunately doesn't bring much to the movie because of that. A role that should have been bigger. Plus, she talks very little during the whole film. As such, I can't say much about her performance. But one thing I know: she was so beautiful. Sadly, she died prematurely too - in her case, it was homicide.Oliver Robbins is great as Robbie, the middle brother.</fullReview>

If the movie would have ended from the first ending i would of gave this movie a 7 but the just had to put something bad in there again. But its a better movie than some stupid horror movies today.

		<fullReview>I think Spielberg took this film a little too personally when he wrote it. It is supposed to reflect what scared him as a kid growing up, so his intention is to make the audience feel equally uncomfortable. Poltergeist as a horror film is poorly crafted for generating suspense. It is too loud and chaotic, with Spielberg and Hooper, trying to force haunting visuals into your head till they reach the point of obnoxious. As a result, the story collapses under the weight of its violent energy. What we have here is a dopey ghost story which offers some accomplished special effects and an occasional sense of humor.The story centers on a normal American suburban family whose house becomes haunted. After the ghost inhabitants take the youngest child with them back to their world, the family hires an exorcist to deal with the problem.Poltergeist starts off rather nicely. It gives a quirky introduction to our characters and their neighbourhood before launching into terror mode. All sorts of crazy things happen. We get living trees, killer clowns, flying furniture, and lots of skeletons. As ridiculous as it sounds, the movie never takes itself too seriously. Sometimes it even intends to make us laugh. Unfortunately, this good spirit only lasts for part of the picture. The climax on the other hand is nasty, violent, and too over the top, giving way to an equally poor ending.Poltergeist is worth checking out, but there are more fun horror flicks out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mainstream 80's ghost movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist was one of the big horror hits of the early 80's. It showcased what was then groundbreaking special effects and combined the talents of producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper. The story is extremely simple. A family begins to experience intense poltergeist activity in their home. It begins innocuously enough and then spirals out of control in increasingly more deadly ways. Paranormal specialists are then brought in to record and explain the nature of the phenomena, which turns out to be related to an old disturbed graveyard.Looking back, it's quite difficult to see what all the fuss was about with this movie. While it doesn't exactly take long for spooky supernatural events to occur, they aren't always executed for maximum effectiveness. A case in point involves the single best moment in the film. The scene in question is when the mother is in the kitchen an turns her back for a couple of seconds only to then turn back and see all of the dining room chairs perched up on the breakfast table. It's an extremely simple and brilliant idea; a very scary way to show a supernatural presence. However, instead of building on this tension, the film proceeds to next show the mother placing her daughter in the middle of the floor in an American football helmet, and laughing joyously as her little girl is propelled across the floor by some unknown supernatural force. It just deflates the tension and doesn't ring true. And to a certain extent this happens too often in the early stages of the film, where the threat is dealt with in a far too unconcerned manner. It's really only when the film-makers decide to treat their poltergeists as a genuine malevolent threat that the film starts to pick up momentum. And everything does eventually end in a crescendo of otherworldly mayhem.Much debate has ensued regarding whether Poltergeist is primarily a work of Spielberg or Hooper. Certainly on the face of it, it seems more indebted to Spielberg's style, with its story of an everyman family battling the odds against evil. It certainly doesn't seem to bear too many of the hallmarks of the director of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. But I guess we shall never know, and I suppose ultimately this is an example of a collaborative effort where the producer is a hugely powerful film director in his own right. But forget those two creative forces for a minute because in many respects the real star of the show is the late Heather O'Rourke who is perfect as the little girl who is a conduit for the evil spirits. Her real-life early death is well documented but it is nevertheless a terrible tragedy.Overall, this is a decent enough horror film; it's just that it hasn't aged as well as some others from the same time. This may have something to do with it being so indebted to its special effects, which by today's standards aren't anything remarkable. If you're a fan of mainstream 80's movies though, then this one could be of interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not like this movie very much. A family's house is infested by a poltergeist. This sounds interesting, so I watched it. But the poltergeist is only seen by the youngest daughter in the TV after close down. Then suddenly the daughter disappears and the family tries to find the daughter. Her voice can be heard but they do not know where she is. This is combined with very boring but also very brutal scenes which is the reason for the Certification of 16 years. If they would have left these brutal scenes the movie's certification would be about 6 years and interesting-for children. Never the less the end of the movie is not bad and quite exciting. So 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Norman Rockwell-type family is menaced by ghosts who steal away their little girl Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). The family fights to get her back.Sounds silly but it all works. You're given a very likable family, fantastic special effects, taut direction (supposedly Tobe Hopper directed but I have my doubts), a good script and some enjoyable shocks. Also the film is saying something about TV--I'm not sure what it is but it's in there!The acting is just great--Craig T. Nelson is good as the father, JoBeth Williams is great as the mother, Oliver Robbins very believable as their son. O'Rourke and Dominique Dunne are OK--sadly, this was Dunne's final film (she was killed by her boyfriend shortly after the film's release) and O'Rourke died a few years later while doing "Poltergeist III". Also, Beatrice Straight and Zelda Rubinstein are lots of fun as ghost busters.The direction by Steven Spielberg is also good. I know it's credited to Hopper but come on! This looks, feels and plays like a Spielberg film. Scary, funny, absorbing--still a great film 20 years after it was made.Warning: Some of the film is pretty gruesome. It originally got an R rating until Spielberg requested that they drop it to a PG. This film taps into childhood fears very well...not for small children.</fullReview>

The actors and actresses looked having difficulty controlling themselves from laughing out, too.The plot is nonsense and naive; the acting is not-into-the-show; the special effects are redundant.

The supposed ghosts looked like something out of a peter pan movie, sparkly lights.....and the corpses at the end were just terrible. Since this movie has some obvious sci-fi, just go all out and make the dam corpses dance and try to kill people. I would not recommend this to any horror movie seeker, this is more of a little kid horror film, or if you are scared of clowns u might get scared for a second or two......the tag said "horror" but is the horror when the guy is peeling off his face? and those hands seemed soo weird doing that, that bothered me because it did not look like the guy was peeling his own face off, it looked to me like someone else was doing it....I dint like this movie so much that I even started getting bothered by little things like that...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a shame. This could have been a classic horror film. Directed by Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and produced by a young Steven Spielberg (fresh from E.T), Poltergeist starts out promisingly, but gets more ridiculous with its fair share of scares. One cannot be helped but feel that the movie is merely a showcase of 1980s visual effects.Though Poltergeist is consistent with its scares and thrills, it's neither shocking or disturbing. So it is kind of scary to see it dominate the box office when it was released. The cast were screaming so much throughout the entire second-half of the movie that they were probably taking the chance to vent their anger at the filmmakers weak effort. And some of the cast actually went bonkers too, signing up to do the sequel, which was just about as useless as a submarine in Sahara.Poltergeist is a horror movie that could have been better. And I stress, could have been better if the filmmakers were more focused in their task. It pales in comparison to standard bearers such as The Shining, Halloween, and The Exorcist. In a nutshell, Poltergeist is a movie that deserves to be forgotten.SCORE: 6/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to rent this because I knew of its reputation as one of the best scary movies of all time. The famous image of a little girl mesmerized by a TV screen showing only static, is intriguing and suggestive of all kinds of supernatural fun. I suppose I should have known that this type of film rarely withstands the test of time, with key aspects like special effects and soundtrack becoming outdated as fast as they are created. But I thought, hey, it's a classic, it's probably still pretty good. Instead, I was extremely disappointed with it's inability to even offer a slight thrill, and it's very simple storyline. I can tell that it was a great achievement for it's time, even nominated for three Academy Awards, but unfortunately it does not carry over into the current generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist is about the suburban, subdivision dwelling Freeling family whose young daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) disappears into the netherworld. The ghosts start off as playful by moving chairs around the kitchen but their tricks turn more serious as they terrorize the family.Low budget director Tobe Hooper (Texas Chain Saw Massacre) hacks up another movie this time making a big budget vanish. Admittedly one of my least favorite directors, he once again shows that he has absolutely no understanding of film making or of the horror film genre. Poltergeist follows on the heels of the abysmal Salem's Lot and Funhouse and is an omen of worse things to come in The Mangler and Crocodile.Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina Barrons the diminutive clairvoyant/ exorcist with bad clothes, worse hair and an annoying nasal voice is totally ridiculous and unintentionally funny. I have to think writer/producer Steven Spielberg was trying to throw work Hooper's way because he felt sorry for him. This movie deserved a quick burial in the studio vaults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I don't think this is as great as the majority of users. Its got a fantastic beginning, when you get the know the family they are not that far removed from anyone's family. There is the foreshadowing of Things To Come in the scene of Carol Anne's parakeet Tweety dying and her sadness. There is the fear of thunder and lightning and even clowns afoot, even before the real horror starts. Then Carol Anne is taken by the forces that live in the house and outside help is required in the form of shrink Beatrice Straight and company. They can only do so much, so Zelda Rubinstein is brought in for the real job. She pretty much steals the movie when she arrives. All this I can handle. Its the third act that is unnecessary. After Carol Anne is rescued, am I really supposed to believe the Freelings would still be anywhere NEAR that house? I just could have lost the last fifteen minutes and not missed anything. But before that, its all really great. You can see Spielberg's fingerprints all over the place even though he did not get the director credit.</fullReview>

The Alfred Hitchcock suspense buildup is clearly not used correctly here. With no scares or even a sense of suspense, the film is an utter failure. That being said, the movie tries its best, there is well-timed comic relief here and there. The actors do their best with what they have and the little girl has some good lines. Yet when it comes to ghost movies, I would take The Shining over this in less than a second. Although some bill it as a classic, I disagree. Not worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that "Poltergeist" is not scary anymore would be an understatement; even "The Gate", a kiddie horror pic, was more frightening than this! I think the most appropriate word for it is "noisy"; skeletons keep popping up from all over the place and the heroes keep running away while screaming. It's got some really spectacular effects, but a nonsensical and silly script, as well. Basically, the whole movie is one long excuse to showcase the effects and it succeeds in that department, but it has been praised so excessively over the years that you might expect something far superior to what you will finally get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out promising, with the discovery of *something* in the house. A few early scenes are startling, and I was hoping for greatness.Unfortunately, it quickly falls apart. Honestly, it feels like several different movies were shot, and the scenes pieced together to make Poltergeist. It's so...random....both in terms of plot elements and the characters' reactions to them. First it's just spooky presences, then a tree comes to life (what?). Then there's a vortex in the closet leading to where some creature lives. Then someone tears apart his own face for no real reason (an exercise in special effects?), but was it imagined or real? Then there are zombies. There's no driving logic. It's simply "anything goes."The ending especially feels tacked on. There's closure, in that the house has been freed of spirits. Then all of a sudden it's possessed again by something with no relation to the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe it was worth watching in 1982</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I decided to watch this movie, I hoped to see something similar to John Carpetner's "The Thing" or (if I'm lucky) Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" - in terms of quality, not gore/sfx. Unfortunately "Poltergeist" doesn't offer something that good.My main complaint is that characters are poorly portrayed: For example, you could easily remove "older daughter"(Dana) character from the story and no one would notice - she had nearly no lines, and you can't really tell anything about her - the only thing you'll know that she might have a boyfriend, and that's all. Even her personality is enigma. Same thing goes with other 3 main characters - it almost looks like as if their main purpose was to scream sometimes. Sure, Diana and Steve has some dialogs where pieces of their background pops up, but even after that they doesn't make any sense. There are many people that literally work as an element of backdrop, adding little to the story. Take Steve's boss for example - this guy is supposed to be business shark or something (after all, he is responsible for all problems), but he doesn't even look like a bad guy, because he doesn't have any character portrayed - he drops few occasional remarks, seems to care about having Steve as employee, but that is all. You don't know if he is obsessed with money or something - the movie doesn't tell you.There are also a lot of problems with the story and directing. The story leaves a lot of things unexplained (which isn't bad in some cases), but doesn't provide any clues to make your own explanation. Instead of adding elements of mystery, a lot of things doesn't make any sense. For example, why ghosts attacked only after the storm if the house was standing on the graveyard all that time? Why people that dug up the pool didn't find any corpses? Who is that "dark presence"? And why ghosts came back after that "psychic" character told as that "this house is clean"? Why did ghosts attack Steve's family instead of going after his boss (who is responsible)? And why did ghosts destroyed the house? And why they didn't kill the family right away instead of playing with chairs? There are a lot of questions like that, and they don't have reasonable explanation.Directing is very inconsistent. Beginning of the movie looks reasonable enough, and even has some good scenes (for example, when Steve sees moving chair - looks great). Once "paranormal investigators" arrive, the movie looks pathetic - because characters act unnatural, especially at the moment when that small "clairvoyant" character starts explaining what is going on - at that moment there are five people silently listening (looks extremely unnatural), and director's attempt to add atmosphere by playing music in background only ruins scene further. The problem is that the dialog of "psychic" character at that point is extremely weak. For example: "for her it simply is another child. To us ... it is the beast", at that point we see horrified face of Diane Freeling with tears. For me her reaction doesn't match the words, and looks like overreacting. Because of this the whole explanation scene looks pathetic and might provoke occasional laugh at best, but won't make you feel horror of situation. Also there are certain annoying clichés in that part of the movie (like "two people kiss in the beam of light before one of them goes into dangerous situation"), and several pitiful attempts to make me feel compassion (I'm not heartless, you just have to try harder and avoid clichés). Last 30 minutes looks like another movie directed by different person. Suddenly we see main heroine in the bath (no nudity, but it still looks pretty strange compared to previous hour of the movie), there are suddenly a lot of corpses in coffins popping out of ground, action, destruction, although movie could have ended several minutes ago (remember that "psychic" said "this house is clean"?). Although those last minutes look much better than the rest of the movie (at least I wasn't bored to death anymore at that point), they look too different, and doesn't match the mood of other parts of the movie. And there is another problem. Movie was released in 1982, so ghosts and moving furniture alone wouldn't work for modern generation that is used to shooting all kind of unholy abominations in computer games (including moving furniture and Lucifer himself). I had only one cheap scare during the whole movie (the second scene with the clown). Right now "Poltergeist" will be probably scary for kids, or people that are not into video games or horror movies. Movies like already mentioned "The Thing" and "Hellraiser" still "work" for people not because they have astonishing special effects or gore, but because they offer unusual story, nice world, good mystery, great characters, they are solid and because of this they are still enjoyable. In "Poltergeist", however, I did not find anything like that. Maybe it had good special effects back in 1982, but right now it has nothing else to offer. Not for me, at least. Of course, there are many movies that are much worse than "Poltergeist", but I'd still prefer to watch something better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielbergeist Strikes Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This haunted house movie has the look and feel of the low-budget horror movies of the 1950s except that it's not as good. Although directed by Hooper, this has all the earmarks of a Spielberg film. Spielberg co-produced and wrote the story, and it's the funniest material he has ever written. Unfortunately, all the laughs are unintentional. It's meant to be scary, but it's utterly ridiculous, with no rhyme or reason to the proceedings. The sets are cheap looking and the special effects are cheesy. The acting is uniformly bad, not helped by the pedestrian dialog. On a poignant note, it's hard to watch this without thinking about the tragic short lives of O'Rourke and Dunne, who play sisters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS.My sentiments exactly.There's still, amazingly, some doubt about whom actually directed this movie. I think it's quite clear, even the continuity announcer introduced it as being by Stephen Spielberg. Where's the argument? Did the man behind The Texas Chainsaw Massacre direct this film, or the man who would follow this with E.T.?Only two scenes show anything like a Tobe Hooper influence; a scene where a man rips the flesh from his face (which then turns out to be an illusion, which doesn't make sense), or another where the mother of the family (JoBeth Williams) contrivedly falls into the swimming pool and gets confronted with dead bodies.The rest of the way it's a sickly-sweet tale of cute pets, light family comedy, Disney-style ghost animation and a spoilt brat that can't act being sucked into a television set. Okay, this may have reached a "horror-lite" PG audience in the states, where it fulfils its function well ? to scare six-year-olds. But in Britain you had to be fifteen or over to get into see what is about as scary as a teddybear's tea party.Whoever was behind this ? and I fully believe it was Spielberg, he has no idea of a lot of things ? has no concept about what is scary. Silly giant heads, flashing lights, special effects... its all such nonsense. Two sequels followed, both of which are improved by not being as long. They're still as irritating, but at least they finish quicker. The Other Side is probably the pick of the bunch, a mediocre offering enlivened by Julian Beck's spirited characterisation of the Priest.The final part of the trilogy saw a decrease in special effects and a more psychological approach to the hauntings. Unfortunately, it was about as interesting as a bag of sugar. Now living with her Aunt and Uncle (including a worryingly tactile Tom Skerritt), the constant "mirror" motif this one flags up is unsettling at first, repetitive after the first fifty billion times. And how often does someone scream "Carol Anne!" in this movie? The dialogue coach must have had an easy time of it. The only other attempt at spooking the audience is by having Carol Anne's Speak and Spell ominously playing by itself. Though this is lost on the family who think it's Stephen Hawking come round for tea. The film also nicks one or two riffs from The Exorcist, though if horror movies were rock and roll then this would be less Hendrix, more Leonard Cohen.A turgid end to a turgid series, a non-stop boreathon trilogy that can't see past the dollar signs and the patronising derivative banality of its lazy premise. I really, really disliked these cheesy films and would rather have root canal surgery than have to watch any of them ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember catching a special inside look to the making of POLTERGEIST in one of those 15 minutes clips introduced from Turner Classic Movie's vault and you could get an idea how involved Producer Steven Spielberg was in the overall production of the movie. After watching it again, POLTERGEIST is distinctly a Steven Spielberg picture, just without his name under the director's credit. I feel bad for Tobe Hooper..it's the THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD all over again with Hooper taking the Nyby credit, not leaving an indelible mark that defines his style at almost any point(..perhaps the face peeling away to reveal a skull or the graves bursting at the end were partially his, but I figure if this were his film, the family wouldn't have escaped intact). Despite that tiresome debate, I felt that what excels in this movie is the superb acting from about as good a cast as you could ask for. From top to bottom, the cast is uniformly excellent..the film establishes a family you can identify with, and the suburbia backdrop is ideal for the fantastic twist at the end. It's perfectly 80's as, at one point, you see Realtor Craig T Nelson reading a Ronald Reagan biography while wife Jobeth Williams spokes a dooby. The supporting cast is simply divine with particular work from Beatrice Straight and Zelda Rubinstein adding an incredible amount of value to the film. Straight's work opposite Jobeth Williams is impeccable.The plot is infinitely Spielberg..a middle class family discover that their home is being invaded by poltergeists who kidnap daughter Heather O'Rourke holding her due to the spirits wishing not to depart into the light. The reason the spirits are restless is uncovered at the very end in quite a hair-raising finale as the bodies of buried dead rise from the earth "seeking revenge". James Karen's limited role is of vital importance in that he represents corporate greed, lacking any kind of conscious in his decisions on starting neighborhood projects on "hallowed ground." Zelda Rubinstein, of course, bursts onto the scene in an unforgettable portrayal of a "paranormal house cleaner". Beatrice Straight is a psychologist who operates a small paranormal group whose interest lies in helping those who are supposedly haunted(..or to prove if clients are making bogus requests). I can not praise the performance of Straight enough and her character so emotionally invests in this victimized family, there's such warmth in her moments on screen with Williams..you believe this woman genuinely cares for them. O'Rourke is adorable in her iconic performance as Carol Anne, just a beautiful girl who stirs your heart which is important for the plot because you need to wish for her safe return from the place between the world of life and death. Richard Endlund's team really provide some stunning set-pieces with what were state-of-the-art effects at the time as we witness the series of paranormal activity which plague the Freeling family. Wonderful melodic score from the late great Jerry Goldsmith. Some terrific supernatural monsters, wonderful light effects, and great use of skeletons all provide visual eye candy. Some thrilling sequences include the tree which wishes to swallow Oliver Robbins(..as well as the scene with the creepy clown doll which attempts to strangle him with it's arms), Jobeth Williams being pulled across the walls unwillingly, and O'Rourke's room being sucked into the closet where a vortex exists. Dominique Dunne(RIP)has a minor part as the older sister in the Freeling family, but makes the best of it with such an independent attitude, a cynicism that is expressed in scenes like when O'Rourke buries her dead bird and when she flips off construction workers ogling her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not the scariest movie I have ever seen but it certainly is the most fun to watch.Unlike many other horror movies this movie has very little gore but that doesn't mean it's not scary. It has lot's of sounds and visually scary moments. The tree and the clown scene are two of this very scary scene's!Also unlike many other horror movies this movie is in a way fun to watch. The movie also have seem to be made with lot's of fun and there are some typical Spielberg comical moments and dialogue. Just one of the things that proof to me that Spielberg was more then just a producer/writer. Other things that proof this are the characters and the way some of the scene's are shot. Even the atmosphere is the same as in "E.T." that Spielberg made the same year. I don't know what Tobe Hooper did for this movie but it can't have been much.The cast is excellent. Rarely have I ever seen such a great realistic and natural portrayal of a family. I especially like Craig T. Nelson as the father of the family. The characters that aren't part of the family are mostly extremely entertaining such as the neighbor Ben Tutthill or the pool workers who have to take at least one bite out of everything that's in the kitchen. But also of course Zelda Rubinstein as the extremely small but smart and wise Tangina Barrons.Another wonderful thing about the movie is the cinematography, the editing but especially the music by Jerry Goldsmith. It's too bad he didn't won an Oscar for it but if you have to compete against John Williams score for "E.T." you just don't stand a chance and then it's no shame to lose.The special effects are typical 80's like and can now days be described as with all respect; campy. They can be compared with the one's used in "Ghostbusters". But for some reason it adds to the charm of the movie and I extremely like it.Wonderful movie with some scary moments that still is very fun to watch.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Poltergeist' is a chilling tale about a young girl, Carol Anne(Heather O'Rourke), who is abducted by ghosts in her own home. Consequently, the girl's family enlist the help of a mysterious psychic (Zelda Rubenstein), to rescue her.The movie kicks off in great style by offering its audience something different from most standard '80s horror flicks: thrills not generated by visual effects or over-the-top gore. Early in the film, most of the thrills in 'Poltergeist' are generated by the tension felt by the characters, as a result of Carol Anne's mysterious disappearance. However, it is in the second half where 'Poltergeist' falters. It is at this point where the film begins to dwell upon familiar territory. The visual effects become the focus of the movie. The characters are reduced to only screaming and acting scared. Too bad, it's this inconsistency that keeps the film from being a thing of greatness. Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

Instead we get a great first hour, filled with funny and entertaining moments and the other half of the movies which left me with a really bad after taste. It's not scary, it's not explained, and it looks like it was written in two minutes. Plus it features Zelda Rubinstein, a woman with the most irritating voice ever, and she just can't stop preaching and ruining every scene she's in. Did I mention she's a really bad actress. Well, the children aren't much better either, but the real gem of this movie was JoBeth Williams, who, besides being very attractive has a character who's really hip and cool and with Craig T. Nelson gives the best parts of this movie. Most of the effects are really spectacular(like the house being sucked into vacuum), but some are very sloppy and unbelievable(the tree scene, the guy's face when it falls off). A PG rated horror flick that for the first hour or so looks incredibly like the first hour of "Jaws" (Spielberg, coincidence) but is ruined by a truly unimaginative and unsatisfying ending. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poltergeist tells the tale of the Freeling Family, mom &amp; dad Diane (JoBeth Williams) &amp; Steve (Craig T. Nelson) plus their three children, the eldest Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins) &amp; their youngest Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) who live on the newly developed Cuesta Verde estate. They are a very happy family who appear to have a nice life, that is until one night it all began. The night Carol Anne sat in front of the TV &amp; started to talk to it, from that moment on their lives would change forever as the house in which they live is full of evil poltergeist &amp; Carol Anne discovers she can communicate to them. Spooky things begin to happen, objects move on their own, rooms vibrate, the TV goes nuts &amp; cutlery begin to bend. At first these odd occurrences seem strange but not really dangerous, however during one stormy night an old tree outside Robbie's window comes alive &amp; grabs him, while Diane &amp; Steve help Robbie the other poltergeist inside the house take Carol Anne into their world with the intention of keeping her. Diane &amp; Steve are distraught as they can hear Carol Anne's voice plead for help, they call in paranormal investigators Dr. Martha Lesh (Beatrice Straight), Dr. Marty Casey (Martin Casella) &amp; their assistant Ryan (Richard Lawson) in a desperate attempt to get Carol Anne back...Directed by Tobe Hooper Poltergeist is a fine haunted house horror although generally speaking I don't really like this sub genre as they tend to make for dull films. The script by Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais &amp; Mark Victor is a bit patchy, there are long periods where things slow down considerably &amp; then it will liven up again with a burst of paranormal action. I'm almost certain that this approach was deliberate as we have to care for the Freeling family for any of this to work &amp; by the end we do care for them. As a whole Plotergeist works very well although there are a few lapses in logic like it's never explained that clearly why these poltergeist want Carol Ann or how an entire estate of houses could be built with any of the builders digging any of the coffins up (I mean they're only six feet under the ground, right?).Director Hooper was apparently overshadowed in the creative department by Spielberg which is not wholly surprising. There are some effective jump scenes &amp; some nice atmosphere with the huge tree that comes to life, constant thunderstorms, a creepy clown that comes to life, ghosts, monsters, maggot covered meat &amp; a gory bit where someone rubs the skin off their own face plus a garden full of rotten corpses. He even manages to make an ordinary TV seem almost eerie.With a supposed budget of about $10,700,000 Poltergeist was a well funded film. Technically the film is good, I would imagine most of the money went on the special effects which are decent enough but I get the impression that they would have impressed a lot more back in '82 than in '06 when compared with todays CGI driven effects. The acting is strong by all involved although the pint-sized Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina annoys. Actress Dunne was strangled to death by her boyfriend before the film premiered &amp; O'Rourke died of intestinal stenois several years later.Poltergeist is a good film that works on several levels &amp; is an absolute must for any horror fan out there &amp; anyone who likes a decent scare. Thus far two lame sequels have emerged, Poltergeist II: The Other Side (1986) &amp; Poltergeist III (1988) but the original is far superior to both of those. Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still scary to watch...but ultimately over-the-top and preposterous...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POLTERGEIST is an original haunted house movie that offers some real chills along with some good performances. Craig T. Smith is especially good as the head of a household who has to deal with supernatural happenings of the wildest sort. But there is one major problem with the script.The storyline would have us believe that when the child disappears, the parents wait for a day or so before calling in a poltergeist and then a clairvoyant to find their child. They never once think of calling the police or detectives about the strange disappearance of their missing child after a complete search reveals the girl to be missing, not to mention the horrific happenings within the house itself.However, worrying about credibility is something the viewer can put aside once the happenings start. The award winning special effects are enough to convince you that things really are startlingly real and the tension builds nicely as the film spins to a dazzling climax involving graveyards and tombstones.Nice work by JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Smith, aided by a sterling supporting cast--especially Beatrice Straight as a frightened out of her wits clairvoyant and Zelda Rubinstein as a determined, no nonsense poltergeist. The weird happenings are more than a bit over-the-top, even for a story of this sort. Amityville's horrors seem mild by comparison.Years ago, a little gem called THE UNINVITED, told a more graceful ghost story with just as much horror and twice as much subtlety without all the graphic special effects. There is nothing subtle about POLTERGEIST. All the way you can detect Steven Spielberg's influence on script and direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B Plus A Equals B</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you give a "B" movie director a lot of money, help and resources? A "B" movie with "A" special effects, actors and soundtrack.I recently saw "Poltergeist" again for the first time in about ten years. The movie has aged poorly, and it's evident just how incredibly manipulative this film is. It plays off its (utterly mainstream) audience's fear of death, the unknown, and loss of family/loved ones. Plot is sparse, acting is overblown and at times very corny, and the effects (while interesting at times) are dated.High points: A good soundtrack, special effects further the plot (what little there is) rather than the other way around.Low points: Lots of plot holes, dumb "new-agey" viewpoints, a few horrible special effects (the guy tearing his face off), cornball lines ("she went through my SSSOOOUUULLL!," "GET AWAY FROM MY BAY-BUUUUUUYYY!!," "Go into the light! No, get out of the light! Go into the light! Get out of the light!")Overall, 6/10. Not bad. Not good either (the first sequel was actually edgier and somewhat better). I'll wait another 10 years at least until I see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Summer Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poltergeist (1982) *** (out of 4) This blockbuster is remembered for a number of reasons including the controversy over who really directed the thing. Tobe Hooper gets credit for the film but there is wide reports and belief that producer Steven Spielberg did most of the work and I've always felt this was a Spielberg movie and after revisiting the film for the first time in decades I feel even more confident in my opinion. The story is pretty simple as a family finds the house they're living in to be haunted and things take a turn for the worse when the youngest daughter (Heather O'Rourke) gets sucked into some space between the living and the dead. POLTERGEIST is a film that many, many people love and you'll hear many people calling it one of the greatest horror movies ever made. I've never been a huge fan of the film but with this recent viewing I could at least respect it for being that certain type of summer blockbuster that didn't contain much story but it at least went for it all and gave us some dazzling special effects and some nice performances as well. I think that a lot of the summer blockbusters get killed because the special effects take over the story and I think that's this films biggest fault. I've never really seen this as a horror film because it's more of a science-fiction tale or a fantasy and I believe this is where Spielberg's touch is so visible. The ghosts in the film are never scary but instead they're fascinating because of the way the filmmakers show them. We're not seeing them and being frightened but instead we see them in fascinating ways brought out by the effects. You could see the use of the television or in the rather cool way that they can enter through a closet in the bedroom and exit from the ceiling in the living room. There are even more impressive effects including one where an entire room has its belongings floating around in space. These events are never scary but instead you sit there impressed with what they're able to do with the special effects. Everything looks incredibly believable even when compared to the films of today. I often wonder what Hooper would have wanted to do with the material and if he would have wanted it to be much darker. Sure, there are some scenes of violence but I think they're all played rather safe and they never cross that line to where viewers would be turned off. The performances are all extremely effective with the young O'Rourke doing a terrific job as well as JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson as her parents. POLTERGEIST is a good movie but I think it falls well short of being considered a great one or a classic of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most disappointing Steven Spielberg film he ever created. This film makes me appreciate as Jaws as a masterpiece of a Steven Spielberg horror- and i hate it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was terrible, the 'special' effects where so terribly bad they where annoying!(even for the time.) This film reminded me of a low budget Disney film. It had a very unclear storyline that seemed to o nowhere. It got really silly not far into the film. From a plastic tree attacking a boy and then objects floating around the room It got so bad.One of the worst films I have ever seen. On the back of the DVD box it claims strong horror and is rated a 15. I was very left down when every scene failed to even make me jump, once! It seriously wasn't scary at all.Blurb: "They're here," 'playful at first... but not for long. A storm erupts, a tree attacks and little carol Anne freeling is whisked in to a spectral void. As her family confronts horrors galore, something else it here too: a new benchmark in Hollywood ghost stories.' The film claims to be a classic, don't bother with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poltergeist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From producer and writer Steven Spielberg, and director Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Salem's Lot) I had always heard about this from many sources and seen clips from the film, so I was definitely wanting to watch it. Basically the Freeling family: father/husband Steve (The Incredibles' Craig T. Nelson), mother/wife Diane (Stir Crazy's JoBeth Williams), teenage daughter Dana (Dominique Dunne), young son Robbie (Oliver Robins) and sweet little daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke); live a happy normal life in the peaceful Californian suburban neighbourhood Cuesta Verde. One night though Carol Anne acts strangely after waking up and seemingly talking to the television transmitting static, and this becomes a fixation, to the point when an apparition emerges, creates an earthquake, and the little daughter says "They're here!" (number 69 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes). Then strange things start happening in the house, such as glasses and utensils breaking or bending, chairs moving and stacking, and a spot on the kitchen floor that moves something forwards towards the wall. With these things going on it becomes even more apparent that the phenomena is getting dangerous, and Robbie ends up being attacked and almost swallowed by the outdoor old backyard tree, and Carol Anne is sucked into a portal from the closet door. The Freelings can still hear her voice coming from inside the television, so they invite a group of parapsychologists to investigate the paranormal activity, and Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), Ryan (Richard Lawson) and Marty (Martin Casella) are just as shocked as the family are. After a little while they also bring in eccentric dwarf spiritual medium Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) who says the spirits are in some sort of limbo and not at rest, and one particular demon has been identified as the "Beast" who is restraining Carol Anne. The paranormal team eventually conclude the entrance to the other dimension is through the portal in the bedroom closet, and the exit comes out of the living room ceiling, so Diane with rope tied around her passes through to try and bring their daughter out. After Tangina has left, claiming "this house is clean", the Freelings prepare to move out and go somewhere else, and during the last night in the house the Beast and other spirits return with a vengeance, coffins with rotting corpses emerging from the ground and many things attacking. Steve realises that his house construction colleague Teague (James Karen) built Cuesta Verde over the cemetery, with the bodies left behind and the gravestones moved, and in the chaos the Freelings race for the car and drive away, while the house implodes into another dimension, and the end sees the family check into a hotel, and the television shoves outside the door. Also starring Michael McManus as Ben Tuthill and Virginia Kiser as Mrs. Tuthill. The last time I watched this it was absolutely terrifying, the second time it did still have some great scary moments, and it is certainly a film to recommend, with a good build up of creepy things all the way to horrifying and grisly moments with some terrific special effects, a fantastic horror. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. It was number 84 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror or pure Marketing ???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, Poltergeist is the perfect proof that you only need a big name to create a successful movie. Do you honestly think Poltergeist would have reached the status it enjoys now if the name Steven Spielberg wasn't attached to it? I seriously doubt it because the story is average at his best and contains no groundbreaking elements what so ever. It's a childish ghost story about a house that was built on an ancient burial ground. The restless souls make contact through a little girl and make her vanish, eventually. The entire production is a Spielberg project and therefore, it received a lot more credit and praise than it actually deserves. Even though Tobe Hooper is credited as being the director, it is Spielberg's style that overrules the film at all times. Don't watch this film if you're a Hooper fan and you're expecting to see another raw, brutal and low-budgeted film like his masterpiece, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. In his own production, Hooper proved himself to be a innovating and creative storyteller who makes the most out of a simple topic. He has the ability to build up an atmospheric tension without much use of special effects and that's why he fails here. Hooper clearly couldn't handle the overload of visual and sound effects. Poltergeist contains too many sentiment, drama and morality to appeal to horror fans. It might manage to impress young children or inexperienced fans of the genre, but the more developed horror buff will laugh hysterically with this plot line. There are many decent (and overlooked) ghost stories out there to discover, don't waste your time on this fairy-tale. And besides, if you take my advise on this one...you'll be saved from the utterly annoying Zelda Rubinstein. This midget-actress looks like the ideal cast for about 2 minutes, then she becomes a real bore and very annoying to listen to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, but not in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the nastiest example of producer/writer/co-director Steven Spielberg's penchant for malignant, pseudo-religious spookery - though all the Indiana Jones movies run it pretty close in that respect. There's no terror of the mind here, no atmosphere, no suspense; just sick stuff happening, mostly to children, at increasingly short and predictable intervals. It's also objectionable, in the wider cultural context, that this and several other Spielberg films are predicated on an unquestioning assumption of the reality of psychic and "paranormal" phenomena. Isn't there enough stupidity out there already?Incidentally, I don't know whether or not Spielberg is a religious Jew, or a religious anything-else, but if I were his rabbi or his priest I'd be wanting a word or two with him about morbid trash like Poltergeist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was scary, but only for it's time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now-a-days, this would be considered nothing in the horror section. Is it a classic, yes. And it is very disturbing and a very cool story. But I was never really into the ghost stories per say. They're just not too appealing to me. And you have to admit that the acting and lines are beyond cheesy. The old lady was a little over the top.The special effects though were very cool. And the whole story over all was original. But like I said, the acting and the lines just can't get out of your head. You don't know wither to laugh or scream at certain moments. But I would recommend this movie because it does have it's chilling moments. It's fun to watch on a stormy night.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I HATE THIS MOVIE (minor spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>does anyone else agree that this movie is just god awful? I mean it just sucks. It doesn't make any sense what so ever. All of a sudden there is a clown fighting a little boy and a tree and then a big gaping hole in the closet that looks like the inside of a whale. What the heck! And what was with that kid sliding on the floor in that st louis rams helmet. AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THAT HELMET! Why did they chose the rams didn't they live in California! I know that the rams used to be the Los Angelas Rams but cant they be a little more up to date! This might be the worst movie I've ever seen. IF YOU HAAVE NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE THEN DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...GET A BETTER HORROR MOVIE LIKE MADMAN OR HALLOWEEN! THIS MOVIE SUCKS!</fullReview>
