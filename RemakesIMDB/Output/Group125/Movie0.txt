		<shortDescription>A somewhat "difficult" film, but extremely good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a prologue showing a priest walking through the results of an astonishing massacre, we meet a young Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) not long after he's abandoned his faith and is considering himself an archaeologist rather than a priest. Merrin is asked in his new capacity to travel to British East Africa, where a Christian church has been discovered 1500 years older than any church in the area should be. He's specifically asked to find a particular relic/statue--of Pazuzu, the infamous demon from the Exorcist films. The bulk of Exorcist: The Beginning has Merrick in what has come to be known as Kenya, exploring the bizarre occurrences surrounding the town where the church is located, the other European residents, the natives, and of course the church itself.Series note: Since this is well set up as a prequel, I recommend watching Exorcist: The Beginning as the first film in the series. There is no need to watch any of the other Exorcist films before you see this one.This film is getting knocked a lot, but I can't help thinking that much of it might stem from the fact that Morgan Creek initially had Paul Schrader shoot the film, then canned the result when he turned in his cut. It was said that they believed Schrader's version wasn't "visceral" enough. So they hired Renny Harlin to direct and had a completely new script written, although one still based on novelist Caleb Carr's initial treatment, which he wrote after finding an older script that had been languishing in Morgan Creek's vaults, or "tomb", as he calls it (Carr has been employed as a "script polisher" for Morgan Creek). In any event, I agree that Morgan Creek's actions were loathsome, especially their eventual decision to not include Schrader's version on the same DVD as Harlin's (initially they had promised this, but it seems that they have some other scheme in mind for trying to recoup some of the money sunk into the fiasco). But I don't agree that Morgan Creek's actions make Harlin's film bad by association. It isn't. In fact, this is an excellent film that comes just short of being a 10 out of 10.Harlin's effort certainly is visceral--wonderfully so. He lets us know this from the first frames by showing us the haggard priest's face overbaked by desert sun and wind and then pulling back to a wider shot showing the massacred bodies. The film has an incredible visual style. The gorier aspects are extremely well done--always servicing the story and having maximum impact. The special effects are often subtle and for my money, the sparse use of cgi (most noticeably with the hyenas) is handled brilliantly.The current trend towards monochromatic cinematography is strongly present, but rather than overused blues, Harlin has cinematographer Vittorio Storaro embed us in browns/sepia tones and grays with many scenes having very deep shadows. Harlin has said that he was aiming for the look at the end of Apocalypse Now (1979), when Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) finally encounters Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) in Kurtz' compound. It was probably no accident then that Storaro was chosen, as he was also the cinematographer on that Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece. Amusingly, Harlin and Storaro reference Apocalypse Now many times during Exorcist: The Beginning. For example, we get shots looking at Father Merrin from above a ceiling fan. One sequence is even constructed similarly to the opening scene of Apocalypse Now and ends with Father Merrin breaking a mirror.But Harlin references all of the Exorcist films to date as well. This helps integrate Exorcist: The Beginning into the mythos of the series, deepening the stylistic and subtextual ties. The bulk of The Beginning can be scene as an extension of the middle section of John Boorman's severely under-appreciated Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977). Although the details may have been changed, The Beginning's plot is very similar to Merrin's trek to Africa to explore a mysterious church in Boorman's film. The only thing lamentably missing is a reference to locusts, or the locust man. Harlin also gives us an excellent asylum scene and more subtle nurse references that are reminiscent of The Exorcist III (1990). And of course there are numerous references to the "big daddy", The Exorcist (1973). These range from admirable small details, such as the supernaturally halting pendulum, to major plot elements, such as Pazuzu and a possessed woman looking and sounding very similar to a pea soup-vomiting Regan (Linda Blair).Although an artistic triumph, Harlin may have chosen a hurdled route in presenting a film that is often "difficult". He doesn't pander to shortened attention spans or a need for a clearly linear, simple plot line. The pacing of many scenes is not what most viewers would expect, but it's always right for the scene, at least in retrospect. The cast turns in complex performances, and Harlin requires that you pay rapt attention to visual cues--silence is often stretched while narrative is conveyed in a manner closer to a silent film. Part of Harlin's more studied approach may have been due to an attempt to bridge the style and language of film-making circa 1973 with modern sensibilities. Whatever the motivation, it works, but Exorcist: The Beginning isn't exactly a "popcorn film".The most obvious themes and subtexts are those related to faith and the nature of evil, but Exorcist: The Beginning also has interesting things to say about European colonization and domination of non-European cultures and religious and other cultural appropriation/absorption of preexisting Others. The latter subtext is interestingly present in a very literal way in the church that is the focus of the film.But the primary attraction is the emotionally dark face of Exorcist: The Beginning, and its comfortable place in a very unusual series of films. Don't let Hollywood's behind-the-scenes blunders dissuade you, this is a film that deserves to be watched and appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a pity this movie is so underrated, but I think the main reason for that is the fact that people judge the movie before seeing it, so they won't watch it objectively. Another reason perhaps is the adventurous style of the film, but it is acceptable because father Merrin is younger than in the original film. The best actor to portray a young father Merrin is certainly the wonderful Stellan Skarsg?rd, what a stylish performance, this superb actor gives such a perfect image of how the main character would have been at the moment in his life when he lost his faith. The two other most important roles by Izabella Scorupco and James D'Arcy are excellent, the best supporting role is performed by Alan Ford. The madness and the confusion in the final battle between the Turkana and the Brithish are convincingly brought to screen. As for the crew members, I was very impressed by Trevor Rabin his soundtrack, the production design of Stefano Maria Ortolani and the magnificent cinematography by Vittorio Storaro. Conclusion: if you watch this film objectively than you will probably enjoy it. All though sometimes over the top, Renny Harlin has made a good prequel to the original one, with some very memorable scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the worst of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Number one on Entertainment Weekly's list of the scariest movies of all time. Number 196 of the top 250 movies as rated by fans on the IMDb.com database. Number one R-rated film of all-time if adjusted for inflation. Banned in several countries including the United Kingdom. Possibly the scariest and most controversial film ever made. The movie was The Exorcist, the horror film about a possessed child that took the world by storm in 1973. Those of us lucky enough to see the film in a packed theatre or to have lived through its release will never forget the experience. News about paramedics being on hand in major cities to handle the panic stricken and reports of people fainting in theaters were rampant. Religious leaders like Billy Graham condemned the film claiming the movie itself to be possessed by the devil and there were rumors of a curse put upon the production crew that grew increasingly elaborate with every broken telephone connection.All the hype and hysteria lead to buckets and buckets of cash for the Warner Bros. Studio and then two inferior sequels (which seem to be the right of passage for a film in this genre). Restored in 2003, director William Friedkin added some 'never-before-seen' footage and re-released The Exorcist theatrically. Its second run scared up another $40 million to add to its already impressive cume. So based on a franchise that fizzled out with the third installment in 1990 only to be resurrected with the 30-year anniversary DVD edition of the original, Hollywood has decided to go back and try and breathe new life into the series by telling the story of Father Merrin before he encountered the possessed Regan MacNeil in the apt titled Exorcist: The Beginning.Going backwards in time is usually easier for filmmakers as they don't have to deal with leftover character explanations or story plots that still needed resolve. But this was the least of the films production problems. First were the revolving door of directors attached to the project including John Frankenheimer who stepped down from the production eerily just before his death. Then Paul Schrader (Auto Focus) came on board and shot an entire film. Studio executives were however unimpressed with the lack of scares and gore and greenlit the film to be re-made again under the helm of Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger). Harlin re-shot the entire film incorporating only a few scenes from the original Schrader version. The next obstacle was with the availability of the actors for a second full shooting schedule. When Gabriel Mann was unable to reprise his role due to a scheduling conflict, another actor, namely James Darcy from Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World was brought on board to replace him. Other actors and actresses and additional story lines were added to help shape Harlin's new vision and voila,?two versions of a film to make the perfect 2-sided DVD (Like that will ever happen!).Whether Schrader's version will ever see the light of day is unknown and that is too bad, for in the interim, we are left with a shell of a film that is so misguided and uninteresting, it made Scary Movie look like an Oscar contender. For those of you who caution to comment that no film could ever live up to the original, I argue that this movie stands on its own to being the worst of in the series and maybe even one of the worst films of 2004.Exorcist: The Beginning centers on the Father Merrin character. Here, he is not far removed from the brutality he witnessed during World War II and his faith has severely waned. While aimlessly drifting through Egypt, Merrin is contracted to help in the excavation of a church that has been uncovered as part of an archaeological dig in Kenya. As their desecration begins, an evil is unleashed unto the land with unspeakable force. How much force you ask? Well, enough force to cause the MPAA of slapping a NC-17 rating on the film unless specific cuts were made. As Merrin continues his research strange things begin to happen to the village. Tribesmen fall into uncontrollable seizures, hyenas begin lurking amongst the workers and after a young boy is torn apart, his younger brother seems to be in a state reminiscent of Regan MacNeil. While the everyone from the Vatican to the British Army tries to interfere with the progress or the information being released as part of the dig, Merrin and the local doctor (Izabella Scorpuco) defy the warning signs of evil as they try to put the pieces of the churches puzzle together. For a movie that is suppose to scare the pants off us, I didn't even feel a tug at my zipper. I was actually surprised at the lack of scares and how the film tried to resort to the usual tricks to try and induce jumps. Clocks that stop ticking, crosses that turn upside down when you're not looking and doors that open and close on their own have all been done before and wouldn't scare even my young nephew despite the fact that with each attempt they blast a sound bit so loud that it's obvious that they felt they needed the help. Also crippling the films credibility were the below average special effects. The hyenas were so CGI as to be distracting and the possessed individual in the final chapter comes after Father Merrin like something out of the Evil Dead series. In maybe the most ridiculous scene in the film, dead butterflies stuck to a hobby board begin fluttering. Scary indeed.Maybe the filmmakers should have taken a look at the history of church related mysteries in the past five years. The Order and Stigmata proved that people are no longer interested in seeing religiously overtoned thrillers. Maybe the real horrors of war and its atrocities being broadcast over our breakfast tables have us more grounded in present day repugnance. It would not be fair to bark at the acting in Exorcist: The Beginning simply because Stellan Skarsg?rd and company have so little to work with, they don't seem to be interested in their roles and let's face it ? it's hard to take the bull by the horns when the bull is a donkey. For all my bitching and complaining, I will give this stinker a ? star. I did like the opening that had a wide angled shot that takes place after a war leaving thousands dead or dying on the battleground, and I will admit to not seeing the twist at the end of the film even if it was for lack of interest. But ? star or no stars, my hopes is that people read this review and spare themselves the wallet ravaging to give this dog the box office it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Regan and Merrin Met</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Renny Harlin creates an intriguing, interesting prequel to the events shown in The Exorcist and its two sequels. This film follows Father Merrin to East Africa, initially having given up his priesthood, where his expertise has been called upon to explain some ancient temple that had been unearthed from the sand and dirt at a major archaeological dig site. The temple is in pristine shape and has some major anti-Church motifs abounding. Merrin soon realizes a demon exists and...well, you get the general picture. This film worked for me for a number of reasons: it is story driven as well as effects driven, it has solid acting, great location shots, and a strangely, highly flawed script that does create interest. The last half of the film begins to bog down under the weight of some of the makeup and special effects, but never to the point of overtaking the film and its atmosphere. And atmosphere is one thing this film has plenty of. I especially liked the way the character of Father Merrin was treated. He is a flawed man with an interesting past that the film delves into through flashbacks. These flashback scenes are effectively done and help make Merrin all the more real. The acting of Stellan Skarsgard in the role is the film's principal strength along with some innovative camera-work. Sure, much of the script is hokey hooey and will not make terribly much sense - I'm still not sure what happened in the end, but the film works nonetheless for the aforementioned reasons. I was pleasantly surprised despite some pre-conceived ideas going into the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beginning over Dominion? Definitely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that I didn't know Dominion existed until I discovered it going through the program guide. I started watching and man was I confused! I though that there was ANOTHER prequel that I didn't know about, until I continued to watch. Dominion seemed to me like a movie made out of pieces of film on the floor of the editing room. Clara Bellar's acting was awful in my opinion. I was completely distracted by her performance as well as several others.While not a true horror movie, I really enjoyed The Beginning. I've watched it many times and found it very suspenseful. It kept my attention. I enjoyed the actors and the story. I've watched it over ten times and the scenes where Father M had to choose those to die? Chilling. Who wouldn't lose faith? The boy being torn apart? There were some good scenes.Peace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror movie, but nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Schrader's "Dominion" in the morning and Harlin's "Beginning" in the afternoon, hoping that watching them back to back would make a comparison easier than for most people who waited a year until the deleted version by Schrader was finally released. Renny Harlin used only a few minutes from the already existing footage, so "Beginning" really became a new movie. But unfortunately, the whole effort of re-shooting didn't make the movie better.In Harlin's "remake", we get a smart young priest, straight from the Vatican (James D'Arcy) who has received all the information about the buried church in advance. In "Dominion", Gabriel Mann played an innocent priest who does not expect anything terrible, he just wants to start a school in the middle of Africa. The latter was the better screenplay idea in my opinion, because D'Arcy is such a cool "professional" that we don't really care about him, whereas Mann was a character the audience loves for his human feelings. Also there is more mystery in "Domionion" whereas "Beginning" once explained the whole background, and that was it - too easy."Beginning" has a lot more gory effects, swarms of ugly insects and its demon uses obscenities in same way Linda Blair did in the original "Exorcist" movie. This will probably entertain people who just want a horror movie and nothing else. Mind you, "Beginning" also has good photography, a few unforgettable moments like the battlefield at the beginning and good actors! But the release of the original version "Dominion" proved that the story has had more potential, Schrader worked more careful with the characters and their relationships and gave more food for thought. I voted 6/10 for "Beginning" and 8/10 for "Dominion".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very scary movie for 2004</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many of the comments concerning this movie and find that I tend to feel that this movie should not be judged in relation to the first. This movie stands out on its own by reviewing Father Merrin's life long before his fateful encounter with Regan years later. My son Nathan and daughter Ryann both found this too scary for them and felt it was far more scarier than the first. I saw it to be more historical and would judge it on that content. Yes, people are right in their comments about all the gore and vileness, but I saw that in the first movie in 1973 when it came out. I'm going to venture to say that people are turned off by this movie simply because it in no way resembles the original. This is the part where a director steps back and quits trying to leech off the first success. Give him some credit about trying to diversify this movie for the audience. Don't go in with any type of preconceived notion about the original or you will be disappointed like the rest in these comments. It is a good movie and well worth seeing.

		<shortDescription>Not the piece of trash that I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying that this Exorcist prequel is surplus to requirements in terms of movies that needed to be made; but in spite of that, it's actually not bad at all. The film was never going to be received well, due to the fact that it's a prequel to one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and of course the whole Paul Schrader fiasco; but I'm happy to report that The Exorcist: The Beginning has risen from amidst the chaos and turned out to be a very decent horror movie. The action takes place before the events of the classic 70's movie, but it still follows the same character - Father Merrin, who was played by the great Max Von Sydow in the original, and is brought to life by Stellan Skarsg?rd in this movie. We follow him as he joins a British expedition in Kenya after an ancient church that has been buried underground for hundreds of years has been uncovered. You know what's coming, and this discovery is a springboard for all kinds of evil to be inflicted on the surrounding village.The film really falls down on the character side, as we never really get to know any of them and with the possible slight exception of the lead; not a single one has any depth. That's unimportant, however, as this film's main focus is definitely the atmosphere; and it's suitably malevolent throughout, which does the film no end of favours. The action is very slow, especially for the first hour, but it hardly matters as watching the plot bathe in the atmosphere is always entertaining enough, and while it is slow you can always count on something to happen that will get the excitement levels back up. The film features several shocking and disturbing sequences, my personal favourite being the hyena attack; with the stillborn birth coming a close second. The CGI in the film leaves a lot to be desired, especially on the aforementioned hyena attack, but the effects aren't too much of an important element anyway. When the film boils down to it's ending is when it really lets rip, and the final fifteen minutes or so deliver some really great horror. While this film doesn't even nearly touch the original; it's much better than you would think considering all the turmoil surrounding the release and on the whole I give it a thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>S10 Reviews: Exorcist: The Beginning (2004)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exorcist: The Beginning is a prequel to one of the best known horror films of the 20th Century. This time around Stellan Skaarsgard steps into the Father Merrin role that was originally played by another Swedish actor Max Von Sydow. Lancaster Merrin is a priest who lost his faith due to a horrific act that occurred during the war. He is now just simply an archaeologist investigating a strange discovery. In the African desert a church was uncovered. A 1,500 year old church that was so perfectly preserved that it appears to have been buried the moment it was finished. A sequence of events tests Merrin's limits as he uncovers the truth behind the evil at work. It covers the events referred to in the original film, Merrin's first exorcism and his meeting with Pazuzu.I was skeptical at first due to the nasty problems that plagued the film (namely the original version was shot by Paul Schrader who was later tossed out by Warner and replaced by Renny Harlin, who dumped most of Schrader's version and re-shot a different script} and just the fact that it had hard shoes to film. But when I saw it in the theater I was pleasantly surprised to see a film with some excellent performances (Skaarsgard in particular) and several decent "boo" scenes and an overall satisfactory atmosphere and very strong sound effects track. A few minor quibbles aside, mostly due to CGI believability that don't detract too much from this decent scary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too brutal, no substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you do when you're stuck with making the third sequel to a long-ago horror classic, and the two previous sequels have played out every possible angle? Why, you make everything as gory and bloody and exploitative as possible, far exceeding all three previous films' violence and gore quotient. You also hire a hack director, in this case Renny Harlin, because any reputable director would either: A. refuse to make this, or B. never be able to top the original, anyhow. In THE EXORCIST, William Friedkin directed a masterpiece to which there should never have been a followup, simple as that. EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING should have been a straight-to-video release, for all the special effects and bloody killings and panoramic desert shots. Stellan Skarsgard is saddled with following in Max Van Sydow's considerable footsteps as a younger Father Merrin in this so-called prequel, and no one else in the cast is worthy of note. There's no Linda Blair or Ellen Burstyn or Jason Miller or J. Lee Cobb here to lend able support. So the whole thing falls on Skarsgard's shoulders, and as mush as I admire the actor, he simply isn't up to it. He spends most of the movie standing around, providing reaction shots to the various doings, which include an endless series of children and adults being shot in the head, some shown repeatedly. As we know, this is really the director's fault. Renny Harlin. How much worse can it get? A couple of scary moments don't make up for all the crap the rest of this film is loaded down with. Plotwise, we have a middle-age, spiritually fatigued Merrin involved in a post-WWII East African dig that unearths the very demon he is destined to meet up with again in a Georgetown townhouse many years later. The good versus evil battle fought here is, shall we say, less than auspicious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beginning v. Dominion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just completed watching both versions, and I must say that Beginning by far out weighs Dominion. I can understand where Dominion was trying to go, and not very far without funding. Harlin's version offers a much more believable character in Merrin with the flash backs and use of photography.I believe that the characters presented by Schrader are far more simple and naive, lacking depth and intenseness into their roles. The only people that have fear of the church are the (Tikati), whereas in Hanlin's at least the young priest has knowledge and some fear of the powers in play.Schrader's version does do a better job extending the description of the ritual execution of the British soldiers in the church, however the church itself lacks the presence and ambiance of holiness.Schrader's Satan is to Buddhist looking and the use of the red-eyes is lame at best.Harlin's use of the lady doctor and her husband are absolutely perfect and highly unexpected. Excellent job.While I can't consider the Beginning to be a true prequel to the original, it's story is by far easier to fall into than Schrader's.Choosing between Beginning v. Dominion is easy...Dominion = Concept to be sold to the studio Executives as in a pilotBeginning = Final Cut and masterfully acted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this prequel to the classic horror 'The Exorcist' we meet Father Merrin during a phase of his life where he has lost his faith. Stellan Skarsgard plays this role excellently and is easy to relate to the character we know from the original film, when he joins a British excavation in Kenya where a Christian church has been unearthed. Beneath the church lies the dormant horror that Father Merrin seems destined to meet.The direction is stylish, the cast are very strong, especially Skarguard, D'Arcy and Scorupco; and the film delivers background story and horror far more convincingly than i ever believed it would.7/10</fullReview>

Every single time there seemed to be a little tension building it amounted to nothing but crap. And the good/evil duel between Merrin and the demon at the end had to be the most comical piece of filming in movie history. It looked almost identical to a Neo vs Agent Smith showdown from The Matrix. LoL every time the demon would fly towards Merrin he would counterattack with a prayer or holy water and the demon woman would go flying like 50 feet against the other side of the wall. Oh the humanity. Hopefully the other version will be watchable. This one was definitely the funniest of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Hollywood horror garbage, only worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had at least expected EXORCIST - THE BEGINNING to be somewhat faithful to the original movie. The CGI-created camera swoop over the opening massacre dashed that hope. The gritty realism of THE EXORCIST is absent here. What we have is yet another special effects-laden spectacle along the lines of THE MUMMY, much darker, but no less stupid.Renny Harlin proves once again he was born to direct beer commercials. He seems to have no concept of camera movement, editing, timing, pacing or much of anything. It's like giving a first year film student $50 million and saying "make this into a movie." He tries to impress, and fails. His camera moves for no reason, he cuts to close-ups at inappropriate moments, ends scenes prematurely, and guides the actors to deliver more bad performances then any one movie should have to bear.There is one genuinely unsettling moment, when a mother gives birth to a rotten fetus covered in maggots, but pretty much all the other "scares" and attempts at tension or suspense fall flat. There are the usual cheap shots, such as loud bursts of music and slamming doors, and some second rate CGI sequences that look like rejected effects from THE HULK. Kind of hard to be horrified by the sight of a little boy being ripped to pieces by hyenas when the scene looks like it belongs in a video game.The screenplay is needlessly convoluted, perhaps to cover up the fact that the writer can't write dialog to save his life. Throw in a few battle scenes and a sand storm and maybe no one will notice how much the story sucks. Characters are introduced into the story for next to no reason. The female doctor serves little purpose other than to look pretty and take a three second long shower. She does play an "important" role in the finale, but only through a ridiculous and pointless contrivance which reeks of hack work. The British officer who sends Merrin on his quest in the beginning shows up again so he can kill himself after his butterfly collection comes to life. Oooooo, scary.EXORCIST - THE BEGINNING makes EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC seem not so bad. I am not sure where the writers of this drivel got the idea that the character of Father Merrin ever lost his faith. It is repeatedly referenced in THE EXORCIST book and the movie EXORCIST II that Merrin exorcised a Syrian demon named Pazuzu from an African boy while he was working as a missionary in Africa; yet here, Merrin is an atheist and they seem to fighting Lucifer himself. I thought this was supposed to be an actual prequel to THE EXORCIST, but it seems more like an episode of THE ADVENTURES OF YOUNG FATHER MERRIN. This story was covered better and more intelligently in EXORCIST II, as flawed a movie as it may be.This is definitely one to skip. I didn't have to worry about ruining the ending for you because I didn't make it that far. I don't remember the last time I gave up on a movie. This is one for the record.EXORCIST - THE BEGINNING is the pits.</fullReview>

But I liked the movie even better.After my third viewing I am confident in my assessment that while this is by no means a masterpiece, I was most surprised at the caliber of the production, the top notch cast, (most notably, Stellan Skarsg?rd, the actor playing the young Father Merrin), and the fact that the story of the incident alluded to in the original is not as cheesy as some viewers would have you believe. Moreover, when one considers the sequels to the original, this prequel, in comparison, is indeed a worthy complement.To be sure, some of the horror, blood, and gore can be most disturbing. But, hey, folks, its a HORROR film...it is supposed to make you recoil in disgust!!! In the final analysis, this is infinitely better than the sequels that the original spawned and makes a wonderful horror doubleheader with the original.Certainly a worthy addition to any film library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth staying up late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was most surprised at this film having heard from various sources that it was pretty awful. It came on late on one of sky channels and I was alone and thought, why not? Love horror, love The Exorcist original. I found the acting superb and although not paced the quickest, very absorbing and effective. The Nazi scenes were perhaps a little clichéd but certainly added depth to Merrin's character. The CGI sometimes bordered on Playstation graphics but it wasn't over used. Although the end bowed to some classic exorcism stuff, there was a nice twist and it just about managed to hold together. Definitely worth a look.PS I stayed up even later and watched Exorcist III which was on straight after (funy scheduling!!) and they were chalk and cheese. I think either film stands up on it's own, regardless of the franchise. Looking forward to seeing Dominion now as a comparison!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first satisfying Exorcist film outside of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Renny Harlin directs the second prequel to the brilliant "The Exorcist", after Paul Schrader's initial attempt was deemed not scary (or gory) enough by producers. Concerning the abandonment of his faith before the events of "The Exorcist", "Exorcist: The Beginning" is at most largely different in tone to its chronological follow up. At a glance, the film would seem more suited to the "Omen" saga, with the director using legitimate biblical events to establish Lancaster Merrin's relationship with the demon Pazuzu. The weaker points of the movie include the casting of Alan Ford as Jeffries. His character seems unusually vacant from the plot and insignificant to the story whilst Ford makes no attempt of playing Jeffries as anything other than Brick Top from "Snatch", a performance that stands out uncomfortably in a bleak horror film set in the late forties. Meanwhile, whilst Stellan Skarsgard's performance as Lancaster Merrin is convincing and well acted, he is not playing the same Merrin as Max Von Sydow, an advantage to Skarsgard's ability, but it weakens the sense of continuity within the character. It does not feel like the viewer is watching the same person, whereas, in a similar case, Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi Wan Kenobi in the "Star Wars" prequels compliments Alec Guiness' in the earlier films. These weaknesses are very much outweighed by the positive elements in the film. Whilst the tone is different, the shock value is still there and there are many shocking "Exorcist" elements that reinforce the fact that this is the same evil the viewer endured in the 1973 film. Much like "The Exorcist," "Exorcist: The beginning" introduces the viewer to a wealth of uneasy psychological tension (aswell as the most shocking child - related accident ever put on film) before unleashing unrestrained shock and vulgarity, at some points even more unsettling than the original film.... lets just say Reagan was strapped safely to a bed. Although there are numerous flaws that prevent this from holding the torch to the original, "Exorcist: The beginning" is a worthy foundation for the demonic saga and casts a triumphant shadow over previous sequels and the climactic encounter is a nostalgic treat, whilst Merrin's rediscovery of his faith can not fail to raise a smile in an otherwise bleak situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern horror movies just don't cut it anymore. Yeah this has been said (by me as well) about a million times before but the message never gets across. This movie is different however than the tamed, psychotic, darkly, lame horror movies of today which are all the same pretty much. This movie is genuinely horrifying and gruesome. The Exorcist series always does a good job of shocking or making you cringe, no matter what the previous movies have offered. This movie stars Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) in how he became a world renown exorcist. He is much like Karras was in the first film, lost, faithless, and given up hope. However, this will all change. This movie is very evil, and I will go so far as to say it might even win my own personal award as the "Most Satanic Movie". This is NOT a movie for the light-hearted, or the god-fearing. This movie is evil in any way you can think of. But that does not mean it cannot be appreciated for what it is. Some scenes are extremely hard to watch. This movie's tone is very well set. The characters are all very well played, not a single flaw in the acting can be found. The CG wasn't bad either. It actually made the movie better in some parts where it was needed. This movie could NOT have been pulled off without CG in my opinion. I recommend this to anyone who thinks they cannot be scared, grossed out, or mentally shaken. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adequate introduction to the Father Merrin character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This prequel to the classic terror tale of "The Exorcist" was directed from scratch by Renny Harlin; originally Paul Schrader had done a version (which is its own separate film) that was scrapped by the studio. It shows us the earlier days of the tormented Lancaster Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard). Haunted by something that he was forced to do during WWII, he now works as an archaeologist. He's hired to work on a dig in East Africa, where a church has been found buried under the sand. This place, of course, is shrouded in evil. A child is harmed, workmen go mad, and there are special effects galore.This could and should have been a more powerful story about one mans' rediscovery of his faith. Unfortunately, it just doesn't have that much impact. There's spooky atmosphere to spare; the filmmaking is at least commendable on a technical level, with very stylish lighting by Vittorio Storaro. The story is treated with the utmost seriousness, with very little in the way of humour. There are passable shocks, but nothing that's all that eerie, and certainly nothing that's really memorable. The CGI is pretty damn unconvincing at times. After a while, it all starts to feel pretty familiar, not just to followers of this franchise, but to followers of religious horror in general. We never get to really know most of the characters - only Father Merrin is fleshed out to any substantial degree.Thankfully, Merrin is a compelling character, and Skarsgard is extremely well cast. He and his supporting actors do their able best with what they've got. Izabella Scorupco plays a dedicated doctor, James D'Arcy the helpful Father Francis. Alan Ford chews up the scenery as Jefferies. Child actor Remy Sweeney is appealing as the imperiled Joseph.Naturally this effort is going to fall short when compared to the iconic 1973 original, but it isn't altogether bad, and one could certainly do much worse than this.Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary enough and way too slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1949, the British army has stumbled onto a buried Byzantium church in Kenya. The church's date is too early and shouldn't exist. Merrin (Stellan Skarsg?rd) is a former priest who suffered a traumatic war experience. He's called in to help with the archaeological dig. Father Francis (James D'Arcy) is sent in by the Vatican, and Sarah (Izabella Scorupco) is also trying to escape the horrors of WWII.This is simply not a scary movie. That's the biggest and really the only measuring stick for a horror movie. At almost 2 hours, it's way too long. The pace is way too slow. The look of the production seems smaller than what the budget would indicate.The feel of the movie hearkens back to the 70s, and not in good way. Horror movies have moved on, but this one still believes that flies are scary. The CGI is not the best. The blood and guts are acceptable. The baby with maggots looks creepy. But other times, the movie holds back too much. The coyote attack should have been scary, but it's never given a chance. It's just not good enough for today's audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood sure chews 'em up and spits 'em out: one minute, director Paul Schrader is working on a long-awaited prequel to The Exorcist; the next, he's been replaced by Renny Harlin, one-time director of mega-budget action films starring the likes of Stallone and Willis, now reduced to the task of salvaging other people's failed projects (the result of having had one too many expensive box office disasters of his own).However, despite the film's troubled history, Harlin has managed to turn out a fairly reasonable time-waster. The story is pretty unremarkable, detailing Father Merrin's struggle with his faith and his first encounter with the demon Pazazu in Africa?but the stylish direction, wonderful cinematography, decent gore (gotta love those snapping limbs!), and a strong central performance from Stellan Skarsg?rd as the emotionally scarred Merrin give viewers plenty to appreciate.Some of the CGI could have been better?I wasn't very convinced by the hyenas or the insects?and Isabella Scorupco's shower scene is woefully short, but these are minor quibbles for a film that had the potential to be absolutely horrendous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Or, Exorcist: the African version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a film which had a more interesting story behind the cameras rather than on the screen. This beleaguered production originally had Paul Schrader directing, but studio bosses were unhappy with his more intellectual interpretation of the events so they hired go-to guy Renny Harlin for extensive reshoots that amped up the gore content. What emerges is a troubled, visceral production with occasional flashes of greatness. Overall it's a let down, with a sense of what could have been rather than what is.The film sets off on a poor footing with some extremely bad CGI work of a huge landscape. These kind of schlocky effects periodically turn up and are laughed off screen every time they appeared; a scene involving CGI-ed jackals is particularly bad. The ensuing story is choppy and disjointed, building up a series of portentous moments and religious iconography and then backing away from them. There's also a lot of bad taste stuff involving plague victims, a stillborn birth and colonial racism.As the sort-of youthful Father Merrin, Stellan Skarsgard is a bit of a mixed bag. He's suitably tough, but his icy exterior never cracks for an instant, meaning it's difficult to feel any sympathy for him. He's supported by a bland James D'Arcy, a pretty-but-wasted Izabella Scorupco and two cameos from Ben Cross (a neat bit of casting, seeing as he himself played an exorcist in THE UNHOLY) and David Bradley. More fun is Alan Ford (SNATCH) as a delightfully scuzzy deadbeat.Finally, after a lot of spectacle and not a great deal of sense, the film plays its true hand in the last twenty minutes. Here it becomes a full blown EXORCIST copy, complete with an extended and dramatic showdown between good and evil and not bad makeup effects. In actual fact I didn't mind the ending, it may be cheesy but at least there's stuff going on. I wish, thought, that it hadn't taken so long to get there ? it's one of those films which is all build up and little actual climax. This isn't a particularly great film, but it isn't particularly bad either; just kind of so-so.</fullReview>

Father Merrin is asked to find an ancient relic believed to be buried in the church before the British find it. Merrin agrees to take the job. But beneath the church, something much older and malevolent sleeps, waiting to be awoken. When the archaeologists start excavating, strange things begin occurring, and the local Turkana tribesmen who were hired to work refuse to enter the site. which results in madness and death. but the horror has only just begun. unexplainable tragedies strike the innocent people that are living there. Merrin discovers that an ancient evil force has been set free because of the excavation, and must try and find a way to stop it from happening. I thought This that this was a very interesting and a very good horror movie. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least it's better than the two sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the two Exorcist prequels. Famously, Paul Schraeder's version was considered too esoteric and not bloody and violent enough, so the studio hired hackmeister Renny Harlin to make the version they wanted. This version bombed, though, so the next year they released Schraeder's version, which was generally considered better but it tanked, too. I'll be watching Schraeder's version at some point later this month. The story behind Harlin's version was well known when the film was released, so it really had no chance, at least critically. It's definitely not a great film, but, seeing it after the controversy, I find that it's at least okay. I mean, it is Renny Harlin, and, as I already said, he is a hack, but it's fun in an over-the-top kind of way. It also has a handful of effective scare moments, although, as you might expect, they're punctuated by sharp stings on the soundtrack (always a nuisance, as far as I'm concerned). Stellan Skarsg?rd stars as Father Marin (Max von Sydow's role in the original film). He's the stereotypical ex-priest, who lost his faith after his experiences in WWII (the film takes place in 1949). He is now an archaeologist, and is recruited to uncover an early Christian church in the African desert, a place where Europeans oughtn't have reached by that point in time. He and the other Europeans on the dig begin to uncover great evils in the church, which effect the local tribespeople. A young child, Joseph, seems to be possessed. One thing this film certainly is is tasteless. Oh, my, it can be gross at times. And violent in ways most people do not want to see. In particular, there's a scene where CGI hyenas (I hate CGI, and I remember these effects being criticized when the film came out, but this time around, in my opinion, the jerky movements of these hyenas gave them an otherworldly feel) rip a 9 year-old boy to shreds. In another sequence, a baby is born dead and covered with maggots. This kind of exploitation may bother normal people, but horror fans probably won't be particularly repelled. A lot of the film is laughable, especially the climactic sequence, which actually does involve an exorcism this time around, but it's all in good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harlin's Beginning of the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father Merrin has crisis of faith after the horrific events he witnessed during World War II but when an ancient church is uncovered he must confront a supernatural evil force.Renny Harlin's prequel to the Exorcist's is of almost the same material as Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist, using some of the same actors and sets it is debatably technically superior. The script seems sharper, the sets appear dressed and lit better, the acting more subtle and the use of more cuts with higher quality effects make it feel a far bigger movie. Stellan Skarsg?rd as Father Merrin is again a good choice and he's far more likable in this version. The little Joseph boy played very well by Remy Sweeney deserves a mention and Izabella Scorupco brings some weight to the role of Sarah. It does however have a special effects driven finale. Director Harlin delivers some jump scares and atmosphere notably the Indiana Jones-like explorations. It's the history of 'making of' which possibly makes The Beginning more interesting given the fact there are two films that utilise the many of the same actors and story. All in all it's not a classic but the first half of the film is certainly effective and entertaining. Harlin's version is a solid film, but it arguably doesn't fit in tonally to the Exorcist (1973) world which may disappoint some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set 24 years before the original film in 1973, this tells the story of Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) has abandoned his faith in god years ago. Merrin is now archaeologist for hire, Merrin joins a British archaeological execration in Kenya. Where they have discover inexplicably pristine Christian Byzantine Church has been buried for ages. But something much older has been sleeping and waiting to be awaken. This spirited demon is slowly swiftly towards the villagers and British soldiers committed to turn on each other by this demon in a innocent village. Merrin is slowly believing that Evil was born many years ago. Now this demon flows freely on the East African destroying the blood of innocents. Merrin has no other choice to regain his faith in God and to face this demon.Directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2:Die Harder, The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Deep Blue Sea) made an entertaining supernatural horror thriller for two thirds of a movie. Harlin done some of his best work as a filmmaker, the only real fault on this film in the last third act. Where it become a different movie and becomes increasingly absurd. But film moves at a fast paced and never boring. Harlin, who rarely made a horror film. Harlin directed two horror films before making big in Hollywood. The low budget supernatural thriller:Prison, starring:Lane Smith and Viggo Mortensen and the box office hit:A Nightmare on Elm Street 4-The Dream Master. Since Exorcist:The Beginning has been completely re-shot by Harlin with a slightly different story but it has the same lead actor:Skarsgard, some of the same production designs &amp; sets, same producers, the same three-time Oscar winner cinematographer:Vittorio Storado (Apocalyspe Now, The Last Emperor, Reds).DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an powerful-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS Audio). DVD has interesting commentary track by the director:Harlin, a short behind the scenes featurette and the original theatrical trailer. This could have had more features on this DVD like a documentary and deleted scenes. Since this film was a box office disappointment. Paul Schrader's original psychological horror drama will be released on DVD in the fall of 2005. Schrader's original film is now titled "Exorcist:Dominion". Since Skarsgard is brilliantly cast as the young Father Merrin, since Max Von Sydow played the role in the original Exorcist. The film is worth a look, since this film is forever known in Hollywood. As one the most complicated and completely re-shot by a new filmmaker. This is certainly a plague production and which it will be always remembered. Since Harlin's flawed prequel and Schrader's seemingly strong prequel will make this interesting double bill and also for students of film school. Good music score by Tervor Rabin (Armageddon, Con Air, The One). Story by William Wisher (Terminator 2:Judgment Day) and novelist:Celeb Carr. Screenplay by Alexi Hawley (Grimm). Super 35.

		<fullReview>I saw THE EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING on DVD today and I'm split. For the most part I actually liked it. I thought that the plot was very good. The script was flawed but the core story I thought was decent and interesting, it kept me interested. The acting for the most part was also good. The leads were fine but when you go down to the supporting cast you have some problems. But my real grip is with director Renny Harlin. His style was all right, the lighting made things eerie (thought not terrifying like THE EXORCIST), the camera angles etc. made things nice to look at. But you could tell he was rushed, you know the story by now... about how Warner Bros. fired Paul Schrader yadda yadda yadda. They scraped Schrader's version because it was to heady and not gory. Well lets just say Warner Bros. got their wish. This is one of the most blatantly gory movies I have seen in a while. Its not KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 gory or HOUSE OF WAX (2005) gory. Its unnecessary gore. Its like any little scene where they could have some kind of violence they just went overboard. It took away from the picture. I don't want to go into it much because I want you to see it for yourself. Well, besides that problem I thought that this movie was decent. Not the disaster people made it out to be, it is flawed, don't get me wrong, but I actually liked it. I am very excited to see Paul Schrader's version entitled DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST, I have heard very good things about it so I want to see it. Overall THE EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING is better than THE EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC, not as good as THE EXORCIST III and no where near THE EXORCIST, but on its own it works fine. My rating 6/10 a C+ a flawed but worthy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the excellent spine-chilling Exorcist 3 comes a prequel almost fifteen years later. It is great to see the curse of the new millennium of horror movies hasn't affected Exorcist The Beginning, as it's a very interesting and engaging horror movie with both excellent actors and storyline.The prequel centers around a church that has been strangely buried in the desert, 1500 years ago. The dig reveals a vandalised church complete with an inverted cross. Supposedly this is where the demon wakes and the possessions begin.With some truly stunning cinematography and music, the only thing that lets this down is the frequent use of cartoony CGI effects. Apart from that this movie takes no prisoners, spilling gallons of claret and using children as bloody victims. Amazing this scraped away with a 15 certificate. There are no fake scares, just full on horror and suspense resulting in a worthy addition to the Exorcist series.8.5/10</fullReview>

Secondly, this is not a teen slasher film populated with WB stars in their early twenties. Once you understand that, you may enjoy it more. That said, I highly enjoyed the film. Stellan Skarsgard was excellent in the role of a young Father Merrin. In fact he reminded of Max VOn Sydow's performance. This film makes many interesting connections to the 1973 classic. In addidtion there are quite a scares (or at least the person sitting next to me thought so counting by the number of times she kept jumping and trying to curl herself into a ball)and the level of intensity is rather high. So do i recommend this film. Yes. In my opinion, if you watched this film followed by The Exorcist and then The Exorcist III (avoid part II: The Heretic at all costs) you would have quite a horror trilogy to enjoy (especially if you watch all three in the dark)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After sitting through a lot of garbage this summer (Avp being the biggest one of them all), I wasn't expecting too much from this franchised sequel. In fact the only thing that piqued my interest was that Morgan Creek had spent a ton of time and money getting this made, they seemingly cared so much that it was completely re-shot after Schrader left. My point. The film is very good. Real Kudos should go to Caleb Carr and Renny Harlin, this film compliments the original Exorcist very well, and still maintains its own story, depth and horror. I was relieved when I saw that the film was not simply a flashy rehash of a green vomit spewing kid on a bed. There is so much more that adds to the feel and tone, that I was really impressed.Is it scary? Short answer: Hell yes. Long answer: Yes BUT not in the same way the original was. Though the ending (I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying there's an exorcism that takes place in the movie) is very scary, what really got me was all the build up, not just the jump out of your seat moments (there are quite a few) but also the slow dread that falls on you as you see the African camp fall apart. Some of the scares I saw coming, but there were many that I did not. One of which put a real twist on everything.What really shines in the movie is Merrin's own personal struggle to regain his faith, for that storyline alone it made the movie well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a really good prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the good prequels that a lot of people would like due to the fact that it leaves everything that the original starts off. It is connected good to the original exorcist and the acting and make-up makes this movie even more better. A lot of scary and jumpy scenes and the sound effects are really impressive. Father Merrin has lost faith in religion and turns to archeology and finds the place where the devil has been casted to hell. Merrin doesn't believe in the facts until evil has taken over and people have turned against each other violently. This movie is by far the most scariest film in years and it is a really good start to an unbelievable movie made in 1973.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not nearly as bad as the critics are making it out to be. Obviously it can't compare to the original, but it's worlds better than the other "Exorcist" sequels. "Exorcist: the Beginning" is a very suspenseful mystery that, in my opinion, stays true to the mood of the original novel. The central question surrounding "The Exorcist" concerns the origin and nature of Evil. Who needs the Devil when we already do so many cruel things to each other, anyway? How do you explain atrocities like war and the Holocaust? How could a [good] God exist and allow such pain to happen? The film is not about gore, it's about losing Faith and finding It again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are their 2 versions? heres why:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Exorcist the beginning, i turned on the TV a little while later only to watch, Dominion: prequel to the exorcist. And i thought, "why are there 2 almost duplicate versions of the same movie?" This confused the hell out of me so I looked it up on Wikipedia. The reason is it was first directed by Paul Shrader (the one with the crappy special effects and decent looking nurse). After he submitted his version to the producers, they decided it was total crap and had it re-shot by Renny Harlin. Harlins version is much better and has the grandiose fight with Sarah at the end (played by the HOT Isabella Scorupco). But, after showing "exorcist the beginning in theaters, they decided to release both versions for video. So I hope this cleared things up for you. To recap:(Shrader - Crappy 80's like version "Dominion: prequel to the exorcist") (Harlin - good version with Isabella scorupco "Exorcist: the beginning")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starts off with a man being an ex-priest. Since the same man starts off the original Exorcist as a priest, you're not playing with a full deck if you can't work out where this one is going. God 1, Devil 0 after penalty shootout. Stellan Skarsgaard is a capable actor but he's on autopilot here. The plot makes the Phantom Menace's look interesting. There's an ex-Bond babe in there demonstrating exactly why Bond babes usually fade into obscurity once England's finest has had them. As much gore as the 15 (in UK) rating will allow. Computer fx by kids who skipped through the hyena chapter of the manual. Worst of all, it was given to a director who can't make any of it even half as scary as that fish with the huge teeth that almost snacked on Nemo. Only recommended if you think Rick Moranis would make a good Hannibal Lecter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it with people nowadays. This film was great. all you are doing is comparing it to the exorcist, now be honest, if you do that then whats the point in watching the film at all. the only reason the first exorcist film was brilliant was because that kind of thing had never been done before and it was a shock to everybody at the time. I bet that if the exorcist was released today it wouldn't get the same reception that it got in the 70's. It's a fact that most people who watch the film now laugh at it and think its funny not scary. The Exorcist the beginning won't scare todays generation cause its a case of "been there, seen that" but it is interesting none the less. So give the film some credit. It had genuinely good actors that were pleasant to watch and it had a great storyline that kept you glued to the screen till the very end. Yes it was quite gory at some parts in the films but some people like that kind of thing. To be honest i think the film would have been fine without the gore because its not the gore that the audience wants its a good storyline and atmosphere. I think that Stellen Skarsgard was very good as Lancaster Merrin and he looks a lot like him as well. Thumbs up for the casting andXXXXXX SPOILER SPACE XXXXXXXXXXXi thought it was nice to watch the relationship between Merrin and Sarah but it was a pity what had to happen at the end.XXXXXX SPOILER SPACE ENDS XXXXXXXSo to finish if people had the same attitude to films that i have they wouldn't slate them as much. 9 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh it's not all as bad as that...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have certainly seen much better films in my life, but Exorcist: The Beginning was not THAT bad. I have two major criticisms of the movie and one minor one. Major Criticisms:1. I concede to those to have posted before... the CGI was awful and way overused... even in the opening scene much of the background and even some of the foreground is cgi... so much so that until you see live actors milling about in the marketplace, it could have been the start of an animated movie.2. There are critical points left out. Characters do things and say things that there is no logical reason for them to do or say. I actually read the book (I assume that was adapted from the screenplay?) and I felt much more in the know than I would have been just seeing the movie.Minor Criticism:Again this is from my having read the little book. *** Possible Spoiler***Jeffries' face... it was not nearly bad enough in the beginning to elicit the kind of responses it got. In the book it makes it as though his ENTIRE face is covered in these boils to the point of him being horribly disfigured. I know this is nit picky but the guy just wasn't so incredibly repulsive at first to warrant Merrins look of disgust.End SpoilersAnyway I really enjoyed the movie overall. I felt entertained and to me that is what a movie is all about. I get a little amused when people don't allow themselves to even enjoy a movie because they become so bogged down in the minutia of continuity from a movie that is decades old. I appreciate their fervor and dedication to the artistic level of the original film... but damn have a little fun.</fullReview>

It blows my fragile little mind! This is the WORST movie I have seen in my life (well, maybe "Deadly Prey" or "Autumn in New York" was worse)The gross-out scenes were so over the top as to be completely laughable and only served to point up the fact that in the original that scared the crap out of you, the grossest scene was Regan spewing green vomit all over poor Father Karras. They didn't NEED no stinkin' crows or hyenas or maggots to make the point. It doesn't even add anything-I mean nothing-to story of Father Merrin's encounter with Regan years later, which I suppose was a loose reason for the plot. Uncomfortable and ludicrous, yes; scary, absolutely not. I saw it for free-monetarily, although it still cost me time out of my life that I can't get back-so I'm at least not out much. But some films are so bad they should be considered crimes for which you could go to jail for participating in them, and this is one of them. Save yourself from this mess. Go to the video store and see the original if you need a fix.</fullReview>

When I sit through a horror movie, I except to be entertained. With so many movies lately, its more about who is in them than what they are about. While Exorcist: The Beginning doesn't fail on the gore and grossness (ie the murders of crows eating icky things and the whole bit with the hyenas), it doesn't get lost. On the contrary. It brings to light the why and the how of The Exorcist. When you're sitting in a darkened theatre surrounded by people waiting to get scared, the tension so thick you couldn't even cut it with King Arthur's Excalibur, and a creature pops up, making the people in front of you lose their popcorn, the entire experience is all the better. Exorcist: The Beginning delivers just this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best One Since The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently bought The Exorcist Anthology on DVD, which contains all 5 Exorcist movies (The Exorcist, Exorcist II-The Heretic, Exorcist III, Exorcist-The Beginning, Dominion-Prequel to The Exorcist). The only two worth the money, however, are the original and this. After a very disappointing set of sequels, they have finally delivered a worthy chapter to the original. The film is set about 30 years before the events of the first one, showing a young Father Lancaster Merrin (played with expertise by Stellan Skarsgard), who has lost his faith in religion, but is now forced to battle evil when an ancient church is found buried and a demon, believed to be that of Lucifer himself, plagues the small African town with a horrific (and very gruesome) curse. This is a fantastic movie which will both frighten and sicken you. Director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) does a terrific job of balancing the plot with the horror, giving you a very frightening thriller. This is not the first prequel that was made. Dominion was the original prequel directed by Paul Schrader. But Warner Bros. decided this was not the film that they wanted, so they hired Harlin to direct a different version of the movie and changed most of the script and cast members (but kept Skarsgard). This is,of course, The Beginning. But when it flopped at the box office, they decided to give Schrader's first effort a DVD release. But this version is quite poor and therefore, Warner chose wisely in scrapping this version in favor of The Beginning, which really is a brilliant film and is worthy of bearing the Exorcist title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 2nd Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen (-10/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. It has been so long that a movie has scared me that I can't remember a single movie which actually has. Knowing that the original was a bit creepy I put some hope into this film increasing the intensity of the first and adding an up to date quality a film buff like myself could appreciate. Sadly, given the pathetically unrealistic CGI, boring dialogue, unoriginal scares, stupid characters, cheesy music, unintentionally hilarious possessed woman, and worn to death storyline, Beginnings is the worst movie of the year...of the decade.....aw hell, in history (ok not that bad; that honorable title goes to Rob Zombie's sh*tfest House of 1000 Corpses). What makes it so terribly bad is the fact that the film actually takes itself seriously and expects the audience to do the same (at least 1000 Corpses had an intentional humorous quality to it). Frankly, I found it to be insulting that the film assumed that it's cheap scares would affect me, or anyone else for that matter, in anyway other than to make us roll our eyes and chuckle at the ridiculousness of it. I saw the movie 24 hours ago and I'm still angry over its futility. It's crap like this that give contemporary horror movies a bad name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exorcist: The Beginning starts in Cairo during 1949 as Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) is approached by a man named Semelier (Ben Cross) who ask's Merrin to join a dig in Kenya in which a buried Church has been found that dates to 100's of years before Christianity ever reached the continent. Interested Merrin agrees, under the supervision of the British Army the Church is totally excavated, the native tribe the Turkana are afraid of the Church &amp; warn of great evil. Once inside Merrin discovers that it was once used for evil sacrifice &amp; that terrifying demonic forces have been unleashed, demonic forces that Merrin has to use his faith to conquer...Originally set to be directed by John Frankenheimer who stepped down just before he died &amp; then Paul Shrader was hired &amp; finished the film, however Morgan Creek the production company fired him after not liking his version at all &amp; hired Renny Harlin to turn in a much more audience friendly supernatural horror thriller with copious amounts of blood &amp; gore which Shrader's version apparently lacked. About 10% of Shrader's original cut made it into this &amp; I have never seen Shrader's version which has been released separately as Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005) so I don't know how that turned out but I have to say I enjoyed Exorcist: The Beginning much, much more than I expected &amp; I'd even go as far as to say it's a damned fine horror film in it's own right. The script by Alexi Hawley is actually a fairly engrossing &amp; deep supernatural horror thriller that delivers some good shock's, gore &amp; chill's. The story is surprisingly intelligent, don't get me wrong as you don't need a degree in rocket science to follow or understand it but as far as Hollywood horror films go there's a good story which works on several levels with good character's, good dialogue &amp; a tight taught plot. It's obviously more expansive than the original &amp; goes into the origins of the demonic force, it works very well on it's own &amp; when viewed as part of the Exorcist series which lets face it is hit &amp; miss anyway. A really good film, better than I expected &amp; the executives at Morgan Creek made the right call giving both Shrader's &amp; his boring version the boot.Director Harlin does a good job &amp; the film looks very slick &amp; has plenty of atmosphere. The film looks great with nice locations, great sets with the old Church in particular looking good &amp; the CGI computer effects are also very good. There's some really good gore here as well, from bones sticking out of people's skin, horribly mutilated bodies strung up with birds pecking it's eye out, people shooting themselves through the head, a gory battle sequence, slashed throats, a still-born baby covered in maggots &amp; more. There's a nice creepy feel to the film as well, there is a definite supernatural feel to it &amp; a cool ending as Merrin comes up against the demon who has possessed someone.According to the IMDb Harlin's version cost around $50,000,000 &amp; it certainly looks impressive, it's well made with good scope &amp; scale. Shot on location in Morocco &amp; in Italy. There's a good cast here &amp; the acting is good from all involved so I have no complaints on that front. Alan Ford perhaps better known as Brick Top from the brilliant Snatch (2000) puts in a good shift.Exorcist: The Beginning is a much better film than I expected &amp; for me it has become one of the better big budget Hollywood horror flicks of the past few years as far as I'm concerned. I really liked it which pleasantly surprised me considering it's production problems. This is a prequel to The Exorcist (1973) which was followed by the dire Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977) &amp; the distinctly average The Exorcist III (1990).</fullReview>

THe creators of E:TB had a genuinely golden opportunity to create a philosophical, interesting and terrifying film, every bit as original, artistic, and terrifying as The Exorcist. Instead, they used the fame of The Exorcist as an excuse to make a cheap horror flick about demons that go bump in the night. E:TB illuminates nothing about the interesting character of Father Merrin, relying on a poorly written script, loosely explained events, uninteresting characters, cornball motivations, unrealistic computer animation, and gruesome explicit violence that eventually becomes more humorous than frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The astonishing aspect about Exorcist: The Beginning is that Farther Merrin's back-story wasn't made into a film ten or twenty years ago. There are some discrepancies between the original Exorcist and this 2004 prequel, which created a feeling that this film wasn't truly a part of the franchise in comparison to The Heretic and Part III. The story wasn't that interesting, portraying Merrin as kind of a pathetic person, not giving the same respect and honor that Max von Sydow was given on screen. However, the majority of the characters in The Beginning were dull and weak due to poor writing and dialogue. Special effects, make-up and an unexpected twist ending that the original Exorcist perfected also failed miserably too. Exorcist: The Beginning can be sat through and watched but the film is pretty avoidable, not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist: The Beginning (2004): Dir: Renny Harlin / Cast: Stellan Skarsgard, Isabella Scorupco, James D'Arcy, Alan Ford, Julian Wadham: Prequel to the 1973 masterpiece taking us back where the confrontation began. Stellan Skarsgard plays Father Merrin who is summoned to an African Archaeological site where a Church is unearthed. This Church has a mysterious past where thousands lay dead and an unspeakable evil possesses a boy named Joseph. Surprisingly well written and suspenseful but a scene where a pack of hyenas attack and mangle a boy will likely turn off certain viewers. The Biblical arguments regarding Satan aren't exactly scripture based either. A big improvement for director Renny Harlin who made the dreadful Deep Blue Sea as well the the expensive flop Cutthroat Island. Excellent performance by Skarsgard as Merrin who is haunted by a past incident. Isabella Scorupco plays a nurse with a mysterious past and an unspeakable fate. James D'Arcy plays a young Priest overseeing the discoveries, and witnessing first hand the outreaches of evil. Alan Ford steals scenes as a contact with a facial disease but that is the least of his problems. As prequels go, this one at least lives up to its hype. It is visually well crafted and attempts to apply intelligence where many of the sequels faltered. Not as broad or striking as the original but a haunting back story nonetheless.

		<fullReview>In the same way that Columbus discovered "America"--a giant place that was there for millions of years; Marrin discovered churches in east Africa. The problem is that Christianity factually entered that area during the 3-4th centuries. The first church in that region--Debre Damo--was built in the late 500's A.C.E. It is worth noting that Christianity actually started in the east and then spread to Rome.. not the other way around. Aside from that, as an atheist, I don't take much of the movie seriously. I do like the horror genre so I try my best to appreciate a good story line either way.I was drawn to the side-story that "bad things" were happening during the filming of this movie back in 2003. I am not certain as to whether they were trying to use the same "supernatural appeal" that Blair Witch had a few years earlier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blasphemous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a prequel to "The Exorcist" is an interesting idea. Though briefly touched upon in "Exorcist II: The Heretic," a movie most would ignore anyway, the full details of Father Merrin's first encounter with the demon all that time ago in African had never been elaborated upon. Prequels were still hot business in 2005, as well, before that cycle turned to the current reboot cycle where in now. Of course now, we all know what a massive mess the production of "Exorcist: The Beginning" was. The original director died before production started, the version shot by Paul Schrader was discarded by Morgan Creek for being too noncommercial and too bloodless, and Renny Harlin was brought in to shoot an entirely different movie. Neither version was critically or financially successful, making the whole ordeal look like a totally wasted endeavor. Of the two, "The Beginning" has always been considered the worst, which is why I've avoided it until now.After witnessing Nazi atrocities in World War II, Father Merrin lost his faith and abandoned the cloth. Instead, he turns to archeology as a career. He is sent to Africa to find further information about a casting of a Sumerian demon. There, he discovers an ancient Christian church, buried underground and left in perfect condition. The church is full of blasphemous desecration. Soon, strange events begin to happen in the village around the church. A boy acts strangely, seemingly under the sway of something. Tension rises between the African natives and the British army, leading to war. Merrin soon realizes the devil is responsible and must regain his faith to fight back the demon.There's many things I dislike about "Exoricst: The Beginning" but I'll start with the nonsensical plot. The movie breaks continuity with "Exoricst II: The Heretic" wildly, which is not surprising. However, that the movie dispenses entirely with established lore is frustrating. Kokumo is not mentioned and Merrin does not perform an exorcism on a little boy. The plot revolving around the abandoned church goes wildly awry. It is revealed that a massacre occurred in this spot years ago and that the Catholic Church believes this to be the spot where Satan fell from heaven. As a result of this, everyone around the church goes violently insane. Eventually, the English soldiers and the native Africans get into a bloody battle together as a result of this, with plenty of suicides. None of this has much to do with the mythology of "The Exorcist." The plot is mostly a collection of unrelated gory sequence, the faithless Father Merrin and the boy he believes to be possessed wandering around the edges of the story."Exorcist: The Beginning" is also an awful horror movie. The movie indulges in all the worst excesses of modern studio horror. The film is packed full of obnoxious jump scares, loud noises or musical stings or sudden appearances screaming at the audience all the time. Morgan Creek reportedly refilmed the movie because they wanted more gore in it. Director Renny Harlin, he of "Die Hard 2" fame, gave them just that. The movie is loaded with sickening violence. A psychic force breaks men's fingers and arms, the bone stabbing through the flesh. A body is found with a huge chunk of meat taken out of the middle. Another dangles from his entrails. The movie is loaded with CGI head shots. I can't even enjoy this stuff from the perspective of a gorehound, partially because of the crappy CGI but mostly because the violence so nihilistic and thoughtless in its use. Speaking of crappy special effects, what about those CGI hyenas? Who thought that was a good idea? In its last half-hour, "Exorcist: The Beginning" remembers that it's a prequel to "The Exorcist." In a cheap plot twist, the character we've been led to believe is possessed is not. Instead, a character that has shown no previous symptoms is revealed to be possessed. Set inside the abandoned church, what follows is a melodramatic battle between Merrin and the demon. The possessed person gains the same sickly skin, scars, and voice as Linda Blair did back in 1973. Using modern special effects, the possessed bends their body at painful angles, screams limp profanity, and slithers around on the wall. Merrin regains his faith spontaneously, his character arc coming to a blunt resolution. Because this movie was made by idiots, Merrin exerting the power of God over the demon is shown literally by waves of "power" blasting and twisting the demon's body.Despite being an otherwise terrible movie, "Exorcist: The Beginning" does have a pretty good cast. One of the few reoccurring faces between both versions is Stellen Skarsgaard as Merrin. The flashbacks to the war, the event that made the priest loose his faith, are melodramatically presented and cut into the present story in inelegant ways. Skarsgaard does his best though, doing professional work with the material he's given. I also like Izabella Scorupco, who has chemistry with Skarsgaard. The conversations between the two actors, and the slow way her history is revealed, are the only times the movie begins to feel like a real film."The Exorcist" was a horror film for adults, struggling with serious and complex issues. "Exorcist: The Beginning" is a horror film for stupid teenagers, full of senseless gore and a thoughtless story. It's so dumb that it actually ends with a sequel hook, Merrin now dressed as a priest and walking off like a superhero. That one of the best horror films of all time is associated with this massive piece of tripe is an insult to every living creature on the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beginning... a very good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always never keep my hopes high about sequels, prequels and... but this one surprised big time.When the movies started and Mr. Merrin was approached and sent there to investigate in a desert i thought, okay, this is going to be either very good or unwatchable, and it turned out to be a very good Exorcist.I really enjoyed The Beginning from the starting point till the very end of it it started good, it developed slowly but brilliantly it didn't leave any questions unanswered from Father Merrins earlier life.The original one left me wondering why the figurine that Father Merrin found meant to him, but it is very well explained in The Beginning.There were also some very scary moments and scenes in this movie that every horror fan expects to see in a horror movie. And apart from these goodies it has very surprising events that keep the movie very very watchable.But there were some discrepancies historical as well as factual that are preventing me from giving ten stars to The Beginning, but still a very good horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't really expecting that much, but this movie really surprised me. Going into it i was unsure if it was going to stack up to its earlier counterpart, but i was pleasantly surprised. The writer of this movie must have been seriously disturbed as a child. The script is fantastic and the movie all together is flawless(the cgi was a bit spotty, but was forgivable). The conflicts in the movie add even more suspense to this already suspenseful movie. Father Merine has lost his faith in God and anything supernatural and throughout the entire movie is looking for a logical answer for everything that is happening around him. This film also had one of the most disturbing scenes i have ever seen, with a young child being mauled by a pack of hyenas. It was brutal. But this movie is a great compliment to its cult classic sequel. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging by the average rating of 5 here at the IMDb, it seems that this prequel was not very well received. I can understand that some might be angry at the idea of another exorcist feature coming along so many years after the original, but I like to think that a prequel is the best kind of sequel. I feel that it stays true to the tale of the original 'The Exorcist' very well, more so than say 'The Exorcist II: The Heretic' did. Those are all films that I need to revisit as well, though. Stellan Skarsgard is an underrated actor, and I feel that he was a great choice for Father Merrin. It's nice to see Isabella Scorupco in a different role than we usually see her in as well.Director Renny Harlin does a good job at setting the atmosphere and the tension nicely. Better than you would expect the director of 'Deep Blue Sea' to handle such a heavy subject. The film does follow a more conventional storyline than the first films did, and I will admit that maybe it could come off as somewhat predictable to some viewers. I thought it was very well done though, the tension rises tremendously throughout the first half of the film. It gives way to the sort of feeling that 'The Reaping' would build off of a few years later. The art direction is very nice, the sets are all beautiful, the makeup and effects are mostly decent with very few exceptions where the computer generated special effects were slightly cheesy. The film was creepy and suspenseful, and it seems to me a very enjoyable yet underrated film.EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING -----7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say "SHUT UP" to all those people who are constantly saying that Exorcist: The Beginning was a bad movie, not scary, bad special effects and all that... Sorry for being rude but this movie is better than 1973's Exorcist and as well as better than Dominion. Well 1973 Exorcist is 13 years older than me and I respect it in the fact Exorcist's ending was a nice one according to that time. But as for now, I was totally laughing when the so called scare scenes were there in exorcist. But boy! Exorcist: The Beginning originated some pure chilling &amp; scary moments like the ending scenes where Sarah was revealed to be possessed from demon. Her appearance was definitely scary. And the starting.. what a superb one.. (those who say its a cheap CGI effect.. come and generate some "realistic" effects.. then you criticize..), the asylum scene, Sarah's room.. there's a list.. Acting was a strong one in Exorcist: The Beginning.. Dominion.. the story is so lousy and boring that i lost my interest halfway through the film. Its fine that Exorcist: The Beginning has some factual errors and doesn't fits with the original's, Dominion is more factually correct; but everybody is not perfect. And according to me the CGI effects were quite OK.. that was not over used. Some user was complaining that this movie De-characterize Christianity, and some movies are made for entertainment basis. I would like to say that which movie is not made for entertainment? Directors make documentary for other reasons.. Harlin made a superb movie.. Thumb's up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, in a creepy way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie right after I saw "Dominion" (I realize this one was made first), and I must say I thought this was so much better. Don't get me wrong, "Dominion" was good, but "The Beginning" was so much more in-depth, answering some of my questions that lingered from the other. Among the notable differences that I appreciated seeing were Merrin digging up the empty graves of the natives, his flashbacks being segmented instead of just a "hey -- this happened" at the start of the movie, more of the characters dying for the sake of the ambiance (these aren't exactly supposed to be feel good movies are they?), and the woman being possessed instead of adding this random "Che Che" character (she was so much creepier!) This version had me staring at the screen with my jaw hanging open several times, which is a pretty difficult reaction to get out of me these days. After seeing this, I was even a little disappointed to watch the original Exorcist again. I recommend this to anyone who has a strong stomach (compared to the others in the series) and wants to see a good "scary" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beginning vs. Dominion and my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually watched the Beginning and Dominion in back-to-back nights. Needless to say, I was very confused why one would put out two movies that are so similar. I would say one or the other would suffice. I thought both movies had their positives and negatives, but I definitely enjoyed the Beginning better. While I watched Dominion, I shook my head because I saw certain characters die in completely different ways (such as Francis). I thought the Beginning had more of an "Exorcist" feel compared to the other movie. If I were to create a new movie for the Exorcist, I would plot it from when Merrin leaves Africa and give a little more illustration on the time between Merrin in Africa and his path to the Exorcism in Georgetown. Two movies so similar are simply confusing (especially if you watch them back-to-back).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Low expectations might have something to do with it but overall "Exorcist: The Beginning" is not a bad horror movie. It follows Father Merrin on an archaeological dig in Africa where a mysterious church has been unearthed. Merrin must ultimately battle the devil who resides there and may have already possessed a small child in the surrounding village.First there was "Dominion; Prequel to The Exorcist" directed by Paul Schrader and also starring Stellan Skarsgaard as Father Merrin but the movie was nixed and Finnish action movie director Renny Harlin was hired to re-shoot 90% of the film and make it more modern in terms of gory showstoppers and less emphasis on talky meditations of what evil is. The result isn't too shabby as the film builds a reasonable amount of atmosphere, has some gory sequences and climaxes in a fairly scary confrontation between Merrin and the devil.I actually thought "Dominion" was an OK film, a bit heavy and long-winded but a solid thinking man's horror film. This movie has more going on, relies a bit more on sub-par CGI effects but is reasonably suspenseful, well acted and well paced. Needless to say it isn't nearly as effective as the original "The Exorcist" but Harlin equips himself well and manages to make a surprisingly coherent film splicing together small elements from Schrader's vision and making it fit here.The prologue from "Dominion", pretty effective in it's own right, is actually bettered here by spreading it over the course of the film and a new one (admittedly CGI infested) inserted here which actually helps audience better grasp why Merrin lost his faith.Overall, "The Beginning" is a solid horror film, not as brooding as "Dominion" but a well paced flick that entertains and even has a solid twist in the end that I didn't see coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior Prequel To Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After John Frankenheimer left the production and died shortly after and after firing Paul Schrader, Finnish director Renny Harlin was given the reins by Morgan Creek Entertainment to come up with an acceptable theatrical release of this prequel to The Exorcist. The result is less than exciting. As expected, Harlin's version turns to a healthy dose of blood, computer generated effects, gore, and foul language that's utterly absurd, ridiculous, and obviously meant to shock all in lieu of the more interesting story portrayed in Schrader's version.Stellan Skarsgard stars as Father Merrin, haunted by Holocaust memories that forced an unspeakable dilemma upon him. He turns his back more emphatically on his faith in this version before being forced to don the priestly garb and do battle with a demon unearthed from inside a long dormant, buried church. The demon possesses a young tribal boy who is being tended to in a makeshift clinic by a local doctor played by Izabella Scorupco. James D'Arcy plays Father Francis as bit more mature in this version.It doesn't take long for Harlin's over-reliance on computer generated effects to make itself apparent. Once it does, the film decidedly goes down hill. The film uses several obvious references to the first film, if for no other reason then to use them. The falling over and smashing of the IV bottle/pole, the similarity in the demon's voice, and the quite obvious facial similarity to Linda Blair are all apparent. However, other special effects' scenes, like the hyenas tearing apart a boy, seem gratuitously designed to appeal to mass audience viewers.The final confrontation between Father Merrin and the demon is a worthy conclusion, but it's ultimately an exercise in pushing the audience's buttons. The dilemma he faces is fragmented throughout the first half of the film in the form of flashbacks which end up greatly minimizing the effect they had on Merrin's torment and faith crisis. This area of the film plays much better in Paul Schrader's version. It's clear Renny Harlin is all about mass appeal and the result is more "in your face" gore and excitement; where as, Paul Schrader is more introspective when it comes to directing. This may be what viewers need to consider when deciding which version of the film to watch. ** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great prequel to a classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie four times while it was played in the theaters. I have seen the 1973 original over seventy times -along with "Heretic," and part III. God only knows how many times I have declared undying loyalty to the Exorcist films. A strong dispute exists between the Exorcist fans on whether or not Shcrader or Harlin should have been given the ultimate box office release. I own both films, and I think both are great, but this particular version gives Father Merrin the build up that he deserves (based on the events in Heretic). Both films, clearly, involve Stellan Skarsg?rd (who was amazing), but this one deserves the credit for keeping interest as the dominant prequel. It is far more believable, considering the personal attacks that those pesky demons like to do, than Dominion. Schrader's work, as it is, will be available in crime/action sections of the video store. Most of Paul Schrader's work revolves around city life and is not as eclectic as the work of Renny Harlin. I do consider it a close call between the films, which I found both to be enjoyable, but this one makes more sense considering the film's lineage. It is a tough call, but this is definitely a film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've not been a fan of the "Exorcist" franchise. The first film was lauded, I thought, only for being an "A List" horror film, but it felt wooden, nonsensical and?well, I laughed a lot. The following films each tried to make a different kind of stamp on, what I still felt was nonsense. So much so, that I struggled through the William Peter Blatty novel to find out what/who Isuzu was/is. That didn't clarify anything.In particular, that first film seemed to miss an entire act. Father Merrin is called in to meet his old nemesis who's now residing in Linda Blair, but we never know why there was this conflict. Some "wind" escaping from an archaeological dig in the prologue was intriguing, but never defined. Why inhabit a child? A female child at that? Well, in "The Exorcist: The Beginning" it all gets cleared up. And I thought this was the best of any of the "Exorcist" films. It had an interesting, developing story arc. It's well acted. It's pretty scary without hitting you over the head repeatedly with loud noises or ridiculous effects. It conjured up the old "The Mummy" pictures from the 30's?with some Indiana Jones thrown in.I did see this film on television, with what must be significant cuts, because nothing garnered an "R" rating on TV, much less hinting of NC-17 that the film was first saddled with. A child is put in peril (and worse), but so was Linda Blair.In particular, the "secret" of the church that Father Merrin (well played here by Stellan Skarsg?rd as "the younger" character Max van Sydow plays in the 1973 film) is dispatched to research was imaginative?even earth-shaking?and certainly worthy of all the drama in Blatty's first novel. I'd recommend viewing the two films in sequence, and perhaps I could reevaluate the original?after seeing "The Beginning." And if that's a confusing statement, you can get some idea of what I felt like after viewing the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: A violent vomitorium by an action director rather than a prequel to "the scariest movie of all time". I'm not at all abashed for liking this "prequel" to THE EXORCIST back then, but unfortunately, it grew to be totally unwatchable throughout the years. It's just not that effective anymore, like it ever was. This prequel takes place before Father Merrin and Regan met in that American exorcism in Washington. This film tells Father Merrin's first meeting with the demon Pazuzu, in the deserts of Africa, where the demon Lucifer fell during the battle in heaven. EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING is a bit hard to follow since it is quite hard to familiarize it from the original. Sure their Father Merrin exorcising the demon from an unwary victim, but that's just about it.EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING is one of the two "identical twin" movies. The other is DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST, which was the original cut of the film after it was rejected by Warner execs for "not being scary enough". But even if the film is very, very similar to each other, there's a minor difference. One, EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING had overtones of an action flick, mainly because the director is Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Deep Blue Sea). "Dominion" is more of a reflective story, it focuses in the nature of the human mind, and also referring it as a source of the evil we mostly fear, mainly because it was Paul Schrader, known for creating psychological dramas and mysteries. Shrader's version should have been the better version, but the film suffered from res-shoot problems and a very modest budget. Not that Harlin's version is any better, but the pacing is a bit better.Unpleasantly gory and gloomy, EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING has its redeeming qualities and a few shocks. Unfortunately, it's obvious it should have been so much better. When will Hollywood realize the audience is too old for the same old, same old parade of cheap scares? Rating: ** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some things that has to be noticed when watching Excorcist: The Beginning - first, the movie gets it right to be a 70's horror (because I think that was the look it was going for), it has a couple of tremendously scary moments (the butterfly-collection scene really spooked me) and in that it becomes somewhat effective. But there was more miss than hit - too much sound, and the fright-scenes did not really adhere to the subplots of the film - i.e what's up with all the worms? And a pack of possessed heyenas that take an hour to kill a little boy? The focus should have remained on the devil and his reasons for coming out of hell to entice man in eternal darkness. All in all, it is a horror film with disgusting moments of which some were laughable and some were intense and chilling, which makes it a very mixed-up movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...because I'm a huge fan of the Exorcist movies. I'm sure that many people watched it for the same reason because the movie does not offers much. This movie is not as bad as many people say. And it's unfair to compare it with the previous Exorcist movies. Each one has it's unique elements and are stand alone movies. "The Beginning" suffered the attack of the CGI and PG-13 ratings. The story is pretty good and deserved a better execution. The first minutes are also decent and had potential. Sadly, the movie falls free and does not find an equilibrium until the ending which could pass easily as a scene of a b-movie involving Indiana Jones and the devil. Still, "Exorcist: The Beginning" has it's moments. Stelan Skarsgard delivers a great, solid, performance. He stole the show. The man deserves better acting chances. Father Merrin was portrayed perfectly by this actor. The situation that involves Merrin's lost of faith is interesting because it sets the audience to make their own interpretation. The bad features of the movie include the CHEAP CGI. It's an Exorcsit movie for God's sake! it deserved a better release. Also, the plot twist near the end is beyond absurd. It wasn't necessary to shock the audience when we all know the premise of the movie.The last 20 minutes are popcorn entertainment. I enjoyed how the unique possession scenes from the original Exorcist were released in the new millennium. I enjoyed them for fun I must say. I felt the obligation to watch this movie because I'm a huge Exorcist fan. I was disappointed but I must admit that the movie is not as bad as it's reputation. Watch it only once... it does not deserve your money. If you can catch it on cable, you might enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A parade of gimmicks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film. I really did. I like Renny Harlin. I loved the first Exorcist. I knew that regardless of how Exorcist: The Beginning turned out, it would suffer bad reviews from fans and critics alike because of the untouchable status of the first film and the troubled production history of this one. I did not want to jump on the "hate Renny bandwagon." I did want to see a good addition to the Exorcist family, and I was willing to suspend my disbelief very far . . .The film opens on the sin of Exorcist II: Heretic ? it goes epic, and the camera sweeps across a battlefield where hundreds of Christian soldiers had been crucified upside down. It's great that Renny is shooting to add depth by creating a heavy handed leitmotif to use at the end of the film to tie Merrin into some ambiguous crusader, but does it really add anything to Merrin's story? Does it add anything to the characters? Can't we just imply the never ending struggle between God and Satan without showing it? Nevermind. After the irrelevant opening Exorcist: Beginning sets up the story as well as any Exorcist fan could hope for: slow paced development moments as father Merrin is given his mission to investigate the buried church that's showed up where it doesn't belong. The film takes its time introducing Father Francis, Sarah, and the other important characters. Again, it throws in another reference to the immortal struggle of God versus Satan with the church.And once all is established, I'm afraid to say the only glimpses of glory come in the fleeting stillness between action sequences. The execution of the last two acts is like watching the world's unluckiest man walk through a yard full of rakes, destined to get smacked by each and every one. Or for the sake of being Epic: an unlucky indestructible man walking through a minefield destined to step on every mine.Starting in act two, the gimmicks become painful only to evolve into unbearable by act three. It's not enough to have a mysterious employer and an out of work ex-priest meeting in an outdoors café to discuss the mission that will bring Merrin back to God (another leitmotif for bookending the film), now we're going into stingers on statues, long dark corridors that imply stalking sequences, hallucinations that inspire suicide, antagonizing side characters destined to threaten the female lead then die a horrible death, lots of shocks that give us reason not to watch the film again, an adrenaline pumped finale with higher stakes that puts the world distinctly in the land of make-believe, and a tragic ending in a vain attempt to add class by touching on Greek storytelling.Of note ? the gimmicks are executed with varying degrees of success, most of which are done pretty well. What bothers me is that they are there in the film. Not just isolated incidents, but the gimmicks swarm like the plague of locusts from Heretic. While watching, I yearned for a dialogue scene with conviction in its writing ? the acting is capable, but the writing is not. I longed for an explanation that didn't pander. I wanted to watch a film driven by its characters and storyline, not by the next scare tactic.The CG hyenas was a significant improvement over Dominion ? I can live with that. Digital backdrops throughout the film, I can live with that too. The CG contortions of the demon possessed? Now we've hit comic-book territory, and horror goes out the door. Exorcist: Beginning is not done, though. Not while it can pour salt in the wound.Throughout the film we're lead to believe a little boy is possessed, when it was really the doctor! "Gasp!" I felt cheated ? like I was watching a rip-off of the post-Scream "who-dunnit" theme that plagued horror for awhile. At first I was upset (and even mentioned this in my initial review) that they broke with Exorcist mythology ? that it was a boy who was possessed ? until I remembered this was revealed in Heretic, a film that deserves to be ignored and forgotten. Still, the switch up is a cheap surprise, unnecessary and unwanted.Maybe I would have accepted the "shocking" revelation at the end more readily had Harlin not shot such a silly exorcism sequence. In a film that majors in action and sci-fi with a minor in horror, I could accept a possessed woman charging down a long corridor while the spoken words of power physically strikes her down . . . but not in *this* movie with *this* setup. Not in Exorcist IV. Hide and seek in dark tunnels with a blue woman who can cling to walls and scurry away ? it's just too spectacular, too comic-bookish ? it breaks the reality, and deadens the impact.Although, curiously, I will admit I didn't mind the ceiling-crawl in Legion.On the bright side, at least The Beginning (mercifully) does not have hypnosis, father Lamont aka "the holy Terminator", and thank God it does not have a locust-covered boy with a stupid grin, idiotically announcing "I am Pazuzu!" No, I don't hate Heretic . . . I loathe it.Interestingly, The Beginning shows the signs of potential. It features some wonderful lighting (I adored the tent-interiors). It had a capable cast, and Renny Harlin can direct . . . the problem is always the material he chooses to direct. Minus the gimmicks, The Beginning could have been good and unique . . . a true sequel to the Exorcist.</fullReview>

Thats really sneaky. cheap, but sneaky. I'm a bit disappointed in the 8 minute making of video on the DVD. Obviously there's more to the story since it went thru a major re edit. Would love to see what the original was.Clearly I was expecting very low things from the film considering it's controversial upbringing. But was clearly also impressed. It is rather violent however. With some of it bordering on racism. But you go have a look see and we'll see what we have then. :)6/10Quality: 6/10 Entertainment: 9/10 (darn those tight spaces) Replayable: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I just saw the Renny Harlin version of "Exorcist, the Beginning" ... and I found it to be an OK movie. The story wasn't too shabby, the visual effects were done properly, Mr Skarsgaard has always been a fine actor, and besides from wanting to blow everything up (and he does also like his snow scenes doesn't he ...) Renny Harlin is a competent director who has proved he can turn any idiotic premise into a fun viewing (Deep Blue Sea, Cliffhanger, Mindhunters to name but a few).But of course I understand why this film was met with such disdain. Another version by another director (Schrader) wasn't deemed scary enough by the producers, so it was buried. And on top of that, nobody in the world thought it was a good idea to add yet another title to the Exorcist list, because let's face it, the original still stands as a strong film, all the unnecessary sequels just didn't do it justice.In closing I'd like to say that The Beginning turned out to be a nice popcorn movie, nothing more, nothing less. But it won't stand the test of time.Stephen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist: 1949 Vintage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Gory prequel to the original "Exorcist" that takes place some 24 years earlier in 1949. The former Father Merrin, Stellan Skarsgard, now going back to being an archaeologist is contacted my this mysterious Mr. Smelier, Ben Cross, in a Cairo café. Mr. Smelier want's him to go to British East Africe to find and ancient artifact of a pagan demon. Travling to Nirobi Kenya Merrin is told by the British Major Granville, Julian Wadham, who in charge of a dig,that a 1,500 year-old Christian church has been excavated in the area. The mysterious church had been built some 1,000 years before Christian missionaries ever converted that region in East Africa. We later learn from Father Francis, James D'Arcy, that a Christian church was indeed built there and for some reason then forgotten about. By orders of the Vatican all the records were kept secret until 1893 until someone, a hight official, in the Church of Rome found out about them and the church. An excavation was then organized the next year with a number of Catholic Preists to dig up the church with the help of the local natives, they all disappeared never to be seen or heard of again. The Vatican in order to cover up this strange event came up with the story that a plague hit that area and everyone ended up dying from it in order to keep other adventures and archaeologists away. Years later after the site was rediscovered by British troops there was no way to keep that awful secret from the public. What we find out from Father Francis is that the church was built to seal the place where it's believed that the Arcangle Lucifer fell to earth and where now the Devil dwells. Breaking into the church breaks open the seal that kept the Devil in check. Now he's out in the light to do the dirty work that he's been prevented to do for some 1,500 years, which would make events like WWI&amp; WWII look like child-play in comparison. Decent but not great prequel with a lot of things not fully explained in the archeology dig in Kenya as well as a number suicides among the major players in the movie. The exorcism itself, which had us confused for a while to just who's possessed and who's to be exorcised, is far more graphic and almost as terrifying as the original in the 1973 Exorcist film. You have to "dig" real deep to connect the bloodbath that takes place aboveground between the British troops and the Turkana villagers where everyone ends up getting massacred; to the beginning of the movie when we see tens of thousands of dead soldiers in the same place some 1,500 years earlier. Lancaster Merrin who lost his faith in God and himself, because of the horrors that he lived through in WWII, regained it in the horrors of what he encountered in British East Africa and overcame them with the faith that he so long ago lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the winner of the "Courtney Love" look-a-like contest is...the Demon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the measure of a sequel is its comparison to the original, this one, as expected, falls short. The actor that played Father Merrin is the best part of the entire film; without his strong performance that interests you in the character, you might otherwise not even finish watching the movie, but he captivates you and makes you want to find out what is going to happen next. I would love to see more of this actor in other roles.The set decorating, cinematography and directing all were adequate; however, the skipping around to create drama to "unfold the mystery" falls short of the target and at times it is confusing.The second best part of the film is the demon, which has such a striking resembelance to Courtney Love that you except her to break out singing "Doll Parts" after delivering a throaty, potty mouth monologue.Worth renting on video, but wait until it goes to the $1 a night section at the video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is probably one of the best horror films ever made,the only thing that held it back was the lack of suspense. When putting Renny Harlin's Exorcist:The Beginning next to The Exorcist you will of course be extremely disappointed and somewhat angry.I like the story Renny was trying to tell but it is far too much overshadowed by Gore,and CGI.The Exorcist was a special film because it didn't need gore,it scared you and made you think.Renny Harlin brings a lot of suspense to his Exorcist movie but it either doesn't pay off,or the pay-off is disappointing because of the gore/CGI put in.Stellan Skarsg?rd's Father Merrin is excellent though.Merrin was an interesting character in the original,and I really can justify a prequel,Father Merrin's back story needed to be told.The story is set in 1949 roughly four years after the end of WWII,you know some characters had to be affected by it.Nazi's kill children in Merrin's town to force him to tell where he is hiding the Jewish people.Father Merrin is a good character,he has a good heart,and it burst when he saw an innocent child get their brains blown out,he steps down as a priest after this.Merrin has nightmares,and flashbacks through out the film of this,the Demon/Devil uses this against him.I will make a comparison to Father Karras in The Exorcist,Karras is trying hard to keep his faith,and Merrin in this one is trying hard to be able to get it back.Karras fails to be strong when The Devil torments him,and Merrin keeps his faith.The story isn't really scary,and a lot of people will cringe at some of the stuff in it.I like what Renny was trying to say,cut a little of the gore and CGI,and this would be a worthy companion to The Exorcist.I am interested in seeing Paul Schrader's Exorcist:The Beginning because it is supposedly more Psychological like the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as you'd think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually quite a useful film in the trilogy of exorcist movies(note i said trilogy, excorcist 2 was in no way related to the others). It deals with Father Merrin's first encounter with the demon Pazuzu (whose statue is seen briefly when father Karras tries to strangle Regan in the first movie).It involves unearthing a church built 1,000 years before Christianity reached Nairobi. As the story unfolds it is quite apparent that this movie is actually half decent. As for those that think it relies more on gore for shocks then they may have a point with Alan Ford (who played the head gangster Bricktop in the film Snatch) especially having an uneasy time of it (to put it mildly).I won't spoil it but like Stigmata it unearthes some of the cruelty that the Christian faith sought to bring to the "heathens" of other lands regardless of their threat or innocence at the time of the crusades.The special effects are good and the story has a few interesting plot twists and it is just about the right length though perhaps could have been cut by ten minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, director/writer Paul Schrader was in charge of directing a money stealing prequel that had actually a point to begin with (explaining the previous exorcism Father Merrin had done in "The Exorcist"), and the producers didn't like his so-called "psychological horror" approach. They re-shot the movie with Renny Harlin, the guy from that shark movie where they ate Samuel Jackson in a hilarious way.Not nice. Not nice at all.But, the movie is entertaining. I had a good time with it, even in the dumbest parts. It had a nice directing flair. And, if anything, it made me even more anxious to see Schrader's take.Sure, the end result is so uncompromising it hurts, an awkward combination of Indiana Jones and "The Omen", nothing that even resembles the poignant tone of the Friedkin classic (I never found it really disturbing, but the way, but I love it anyway), but Harlin is not one to take his job too seriously and makes a formula movie endurable through some overdone but exciting camera-work. The final third of the movie is an enormous nod to "Evil Dead" and the rest of it has some rather effective scenes. The acting is correct and Vittorio Storaro sure can film a landscape. It has also classic cheesy moments like Father Merrin painting a cross on his forehead and getting up with a "I kick ass for the Lord" expression on his face before fighting the Demon. Hilarious bit.I don't know, I didn't think I would like it, but I did. I'm almost positive that the original version is a hundred times more worth seeing and I look forward to the DVD edition, though.P.S.: has anyone noticed how easily a protagonist in this kind of movies is convinced to open graves? A religious man, even an ex-religious man, would think twice before digging on supposedly sacred ground, but this guy just goes ahead and does it. The movie is campy enough so that you don't have to worry about this kind of detail, but I just felt like pointing it out.</fullReview>

Everybody sometimes thinks "I must be strong and rich and etc." Here it is powerful. So I love this film. First film is very interesting and horrible. But next films are disgrace. "Hardly Exorcist The Beginning" is catch new view. Specially ý afraid from babies and children on horror films. This film is too. For example Pet Cemetery, Ring, Dawn of the Dead. But ý don't like special effects. Because they are queue. Maybe Evil must show its face to us. Nevertheless We must not forget:evil is bad.

		<fullReview>The Exorcist. A film which holds its place in entertainment history. After two feeble attempts at capturing the feel of the original, we are again, subjected to, this time around, a prequel. Personally, I am a fan of the original, and by God I give credit to anyone who wants to attempt to recreate the feelings that that movie instilled in me. Unfortunately, neither of the sequels, including The Beginning was able to do so. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy The Beginning. I did, very much so actually.The reviews that people have put out there are so judgmental. I knew going in to this film, not to expect the original. But, everything you read has it being compared to the original. I think if the movie had gone by a different name and characters with the same basic story, fans would have been much more accepting. Exorcist: The Beginning offers good imagery and a fairly good story. It has an interesting basis and the exorcism itself was done nicely. I give this movie a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This prequel contains good production values and a flair for creepy and thoughtful fearful, scares...it is the tension kind not usually the gross out kind though it dabbles into it. This version is more cerebral and more sedate...however, the special effects and some of the cheap thrills pull the movie down just a tad. Too its credit, the movie didn't pull out the usual bigger is better stuff for the most part and the possibility of the movie cheapening and lowering itself was avoided so that by the end the movie ends on a even balance than most horror flicks. I enjoyed this movie and it has some of the better scary scenes in recent years - with the isolated build up. I can't say it was a great horror movie, it lacked that additional polish, that final flair of psychological tension and sensibility of plot continuity. Yet I could easily recommend this movie for its entertainment value and a good solid night for something to do. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard that there was another Exorcist movie coming out, I was excited. I have been a big fan through the years. My excitement was drowned when I finally saw Exorcist: The Beginning. I must say that I thought the storyline was good. Without saying to much, it gives a bit of a history of Father Marin. I was disappointed that the action of the movie did not do the storyline justice. There was little action.Also, when I think of Exorcist movies, I think...Gore, scary, etc. This movie had little of either. Yes, there were some scenes that were a little disgusting, but not to the extent that one comes to expect. As for scary...well, if you consider fake looking animals scary, then hey...this is the movie for you! Though I wasn't overly thrilled with the movie, I do recommend taking the time to watch it. It is one of those movies you just have to see for yourself. Who knows...maybe you will like it a little more than I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly underrated and misunderstood film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this movie. Based on all the negative feedback I have read, I went in with pretty low expectations. Imagine my surprise when I was confronted with a deeply moving experience that affected me profoundly. No, I am not kidding. I think the real problem with this film is 1) the name, 2)marketing. 1) This film was not about the Exorcist:prequel. In fact, if you rename the film - without changing any else - I think it would have been received better. With the exception one or two scenes that lasted only a few minutes, there really wasn't anything that tied this film to the first one. And even those could have been viewed more as a homage more than a sequel to the first film.What should it have been called? How about "Father Martin: Journey of Faith" with the tagline "He had to fight the devil. But first he had to fight the demons inside himself." or "To save others, he had to save himself first."2) The film is about journey of faith. everything -every scene - in this film was centered around Father Martin and his journey of faith. This is not a horror film by any means. It is a profound portrayal of someone who has lost his faith in God and refuses to believe in even the Devil for fear it will bring him close to God again. Only when the evil around him becomes so real and hurts the one he loves, is he willing to deal with his faith. The horror/occult aspect of this film is merely a backdrop to Martin's story.Perhaps it is those who have gone to the mountains and down in the deepest valleys in their journey of faith that can see what I saw. I can understand why some people didn't like this film. If you went in expecting a horror film (let alone one to rival The Exorcist) you will not only be disappointed, but you will miss the many layers of symbolism and the messages that this film conveys. Yes, there are certainly horrifying images and violence - but even those are part of the landscape that forced Father Martin to face up to his faith. But to enjoy this film one has to view it in a certain perspective. The fact that the very scenes that moved me to tears or scared me where the sames scenes that had people laughing is evidence that not everyone will enjoy this film.The reasons for Martin's loss of faith I thought were portrayed brilliantly.Each flashback gave us a little glimpse of the event that caused his 'fall,' until at the end we understand why abandoned God. Every scene made sense - at least to me. And the fact that I was genuinely scared a few times just added to the enjoyment.Yes, some of the CGI was pretty fake. Yes the 'monster' at the end felt too much a force-fit from the producers to make some kind of connection with the first film. I think they made a mistake there. Because this film is far better than the first one from a faith perspective. The first film was a horror film that scared the wits of you. That's fine. But this film touched me in my soul like very few films have. I am not Christian, by the way, but the struggles of faith are not limited by man-made religious divisions. The fact that this film could reach me says a lot.Even with not viewing this film from a faith perspective, I find it hard to believe why everyone is so hard on this film. Even as a horror/occult film, it greatly surpassed Exorcist #2 and 3. And since when in the history of cinema was sequel #4 any good anyhow? I don't remember the critics and public blasting #3 like this. And The Beginning had more genuine scares than that one.Renny Harlin is known for mood, violence and action. This film has a lot of the first two, but those expecting the adrenaline rush of Die Hard 2 or Long Kiss Goodnight will be disappointed. He has learned to balance over-the-top action with mood and creepiness. A lot of the beginning seemed slow, until I realized that the pace of the film matched the journey of Father Martin. Slow, almost comatose at first, and then a rush of enlightenment at the end.I think Mr. Harlin has done an incredible job in bringing a beautiful photographed, acted film about one man's journey of faith.It is a shame that the studios didn't realize this and marketed it differently.But I realize I may be in the minority with my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*I am writing this comment on Thursday night. By this time tomorrow, Hurricane Frances should be blowing my way. I have spent all day putting up storm shutters and I am beat. Exhausted. We had to improvise a little bit when the brain surgeons who installed the shutters forgot to give us a crucial piece. So where there once would be shutters, now there is plywood. We're thinking of nailing the shutters to the plywood. By all accounts, Hurricane Frances should be a monster. I have never lived through a hurricane. Hopefully I can live through this one and see another day when I am commenting on movies on the IMDb. I had to get these thoughts in before the power gets knocked out.So you're asking yourself, what does any of this have to do with "Exorcist: The Beginning"? One word: Apocalypse. Father Merrin heads to Africa. There's something funky happening in a buried church. What the heck is going on? Is there a demon involved who wants to possess people? Is the movie called "The Exorcist"?I thoroughly enjoyed "Exorcist: the Beginning". It's not a great movie but it has its charming B-movie ways. There are plenty of vicious gore scenes to keep your mind occupied as you wait for the Exorcism scene. That scene is the key to the movie's success.*SPOILER ON ENDING*So throughout the movie, we think that the little kid is possessed by a demon. As I'm looking at the kid, I realize that he won't be able to handle acting like he's possessed by a scary demon with a deep voice. He's just not a good enough actor. So I resigned myself to another mediocre horror movie ending. Then, in a pure B-movie madness moment, the filmmakers let the woman with the heaving breasts be the demon's plaything. YES!!! Good call! The Exorcism scene lasts for about twenty minutes and it has all the right ingredients. Foul mouthed demon, deep voice, slinking on walls and large demonic breasts all make for a satisfying conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist the End. (*1/2)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father Merrin, the Exorcist, is a priest who has lost his faith in God in this prequel to Friedkin's horror classic. While on a mercenary mission to retrieve an ancient artifact on an archaeological site in Africa, he meets his arch enemy, the demon Pazuzu, for the first time. Before you can say 'projectile vomiting', evil is unleashed in an escalating frenzy of blood, gore, out of place CGI and thunderous music. Eventually, this leads to a final epileptic showdown between the-priest-with-no-faith and Satan himself!The emotional high point of the movie has Merrin regaining his faith and making like Clint Eastwood in 'a Fistful of Dollars'. He picks up his cross and holy water again while angelic choral music is playing on the soundtrack. M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs', this ain't.Actually, we should all give thanks as director Renny Harlin has shown tremendous restraint in not rolling out wire stunt work and bullet time photography as Merrin and Pazuzu ?almost- go at it in the air like Neo and Agent Smith in 'Matrix Revolutions'. Guess he ran out of cash. Still in 'Mindhunters' mode, Harlin gleefully parades every trick in his book: from pulverized human remains to a massive gun fight. I wanted to say 'you have to see it to believe it', but I guess that's not very good advice.Stellan Skarsgard, a very good actor, can do little to save his dignity in this sometimes hilarious monster-horror-western mess. Then again, he was in King Arthur. Maybe he should get a new agent. 'That's (I am) _Father_ Merrin', he intones as he walks away purposefully towards a blue screen projection of the Vatican in the closing sequences. Don't stop him, he's got a license to exorcise.This was a pretty awful movie.</fullReview>

Another pendulum stops dead in its swinging-track (the wall clock) indicating that something evil is about to begin for Fr.

		<fullReview>Don't waste your time if you are going to this movie expecting to be scared out of your wits and be scared many days after, because it won't happen. This movie was very, very good for the first 75 minutes, and then got completely ridiculous!! Noise was unbearable at times, but for the most part was effective. A fair amount of genuine fright moments, but mostly in the first 75 minutes. I didn't understand the beginning at all, until the end of the movie. Several holes in the movies- Possible Spoilers!! 1) Character of the doctor not developed 2) Character of the little boy not developed 3) Birds in the church?? 4) 5 minute exorcism??For 75 minutes, I was glued to edge of my seat- not in fear, but in suspense of what was going to happen. You will expect to happen what was allude to in the Exorcist II. Something else completely unexpected takes place, in more ways than one. The last 25 minutes were some of the worst acting performances and material ever, both in terms of pure acting ability and in terms of gore and action. This would have been better if they would have stuck to the suspense factor, rather than relied on gore and profanity to shock.By the way, did some of the face make-up get progressively uglier as the movie went along?? (Archaeologist, doctor, and Fr. Francis)Good points- 1) Massive upside down cross gave me the willies 2) Excellent character development of Fr. Merrin (Nazi history, etc) 3) Excellent scenery and sets 4) Good acting in the first half of the movie- this movie was not slow as previously indicated5) Spider walking 6) Scary faces throughout- you must look for them!!All in all- 6/10</fullReview>

What a mess. The film doesn't even match what's on the official web site!What was that business with the butterflies, anyway? Idiotic. Poor Julian, I hope they paid you well.The CGI was some of the worst I've seen in a while, both the hyenas and the Devil in Sarah. Speaking of whom, the love interest plot was completely unbelievable. Paul Schrader was the original director. With his writing skills, I said, OK, not my cup of tea, but he will do something interesting with it. It won't be slash and gore with no sense. However, when I saw that Renny "Cutthroat Island" Harlin had taken over from Paul Schrader, I gave up all hope. I'll be interested to see Schrader's film, if it is ever released to DVD.</fullReview>

Blatty wrote a whole and complete story which was turned into a whole and complete movie. This isn't Spiderman were you can throw in a new bad guy and get a new installment.The Merrin character is very interesting and I can understand the desire to want more, but it isn't there or Blatty would have written it. If you want accuracy, we would have seen a replay of the original story being performed in Africa. Not much of story.

It sadly lacks the thrills of the first one and the first hour is a bit of a sleeper. The fact it had 3 directors is obvious and suffers from lack of consistent thought and theme. Why is it that the women are always the one to be possessed? I think the "wickedness" and presence of evil, is missing from the film. There was a good concept lying on the editing room floor I am sure. It made its money now put it t rest. Excise this film from the theatre and give it to the video public for consumption. Oh, for there to be a descent horror movie...I hope Hollywood hears my cry...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i really don't understand why this movie got such bad reviews. i myself was at first skeptical to see this movie, but i did, and in the end when i walked out of the thearter i had to say that i really did like it. i cannot say it lived up the original movie, but it comes pretty close. i thought this movie was going to be very bad, but in reality i really did like it. it was very eery and creepy and at times disturbing. all in all it was a good horror movie, compared to the junk that is out there these days. there are some very gory scenes, and i think that it made the movie better.. i really like the story line too, it was very interesting and compelling. this movie was very good. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really am confused as to the reviews of this movie. The reviewers could not of seen the same film as I did. The plot flows the logical events make sense, we see exactly how Fr. Merrin lost his faith.Yes the hyena's looked pretty fake, but still exciting. Sarah had a well played part and there was enough trickery on behalf of Satan. We all can see that many people see Fr. Merrin as something special even without his "collar". He is a priest deep down inside and a true servant of God.Folks many people have told me over the years that they laughed at the original exorcist and found it stupid, many of these people have a hard time following "See Spot Run" as in many movies today the general audience has to be held by the hand and told the whole story. I am not that stupid, I can take small pieces of info and put them together. If yo want to see a movie that if you follow it and understand the circumstances surrounding it, this movie achieves this on every level.I plan on watching it many times.</fullReview>

It was i dunno.. people say the first one was better but when the first one was released that was like one of those first kinds of horror movies where the little girls head spins around and she is very horny.

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie on Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched The Exorcist and to be entirely frank, I was freaked out. I thought the movie more sickening than frightening though. But, it was a nice little basis for...."The Beginning"This wonderful second installment which also doubles as an awesome prelude to the sick original movie was so scary I wanted to pee my pants. Watching the movie I felt like I was going slowly slipping into a living hell and when the movie was over, I came back to life again. Many parts you just know something scary is going to happen and I just flinched waiting for something to happen and when it did, I nearly screamed every time. It was the most fun I had had in a long time. Especially since I had been searching for a movie to scare the living hell out of me for a long time now. 28 Days Later did NOT do the trick. I totally recommend this movie to everybody out there who wants to get scared sh*tless. Don't go if you have a weak heart though, that means you grandpa. Though some parts I felt went unanswered which was a bit disappointing. That's the only smack I have to say about it though.</fullReview>

The scariest thing about seeing this film was the price of the stale popcorn &amp; flat soda. At least it lives up to the rest of the director's work.Perhaps the unreleased version by Paul Schrader will be a little more entertaining. Personally, I don't mind if it is a little too much of a character study and a little too light on the horror for the studio's taste.Now Exorcist 2 has some competition for the worst sequel every made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING" smells like the END of the series...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard horrible things about "EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING" from friends and read reviews. The original is a classic, probably impossible to top! "Exorcist 2-The Heretic" was panned, and was notorious for years being referred to as the "worst sequel ever made"! "Exorcist 3" did NOT fair much better. Even though the sequels never measured up to the originals, I LIKED them, and was NOT going to be dissuaded from seeing PART 4! I thought surely the film could NOT be as bad as the nay-sayers were leading me to believe. Boy, was I WRONG!I've been following the development of this movie for a long time. I knew it was a very BAD sign when the films release was pushed back and the studio SCRAPED the original film and reshot the whole thing with a new director. But surely, the first version of Part 4, the one done by Paul Schrader, can NOT be as HORRIBLE as the version they released? (I soooo want to see it and have HIGH HOPES for a special edition DVD with BOTH films)!***SPOILERS*** The film is about Father Merrin's first encounter with evil (in the book, the demon was named Pazuzu. However, in the original movie, the demon's name is never mentioned--but the demon does say it's "the devil". It's not until PART 2 that the demon is named Pazuzu on screen)...but I do NO think I heard the name Pazuzu mentioned when I saw the film today. Instead, i think they were referring to the devil (I KNOW I heard a character say that the spot in Africa where the film takes place was the place where the devil landed when he was cast out of Heaven...). It is mentioned in the original, that Father Merrin had performed an exorcism ONCE before. He, as I said, had encountered Pazuzu in Africa in PART 2 and performed an exorcism on a young boy named Kakumo. So, I questioned the need to explore his past AGAIN with Part 4.The story starts off interestingly... but there are constant attempts to emulate the original. The early scenes in Iraq in the first film have whole sections lifted and poorly reproduced in Part 4. Interesting gimmicks from the first movie (such as the clock stopping) are shamelessly thrown at us again. I thought the movie was just okay though, despite it's tired recycled feel, until we got down the the ridiculous last 20 minutes! O' my GOD!The demon make-up makes the new movie look, NOT like a genuine film in the EXORCIST series, but more like some overseas knock-off! And what was going on was just ludicrous! People were LAUGHING in the theater I saw it in. It had almost become self parody! How could anyone take it seriously?I know the original was called THE EXORCIST, and this film is trying to go further into the character of said Exorcist...but I really think the producers have totally MISSED THE BOAT on this franchise! The audience of the first film wants to see more of the same thing they saw in the first film. The want Linda Blair's character back. What's going on with her? Maybe she's got a daughter of her own? What has her life been like? She was the focus of the original story (well, so was Father Karras, the priest who'd lost his faith...but, we revisited him in Part 3). I think audiences would have preferred catching up with her and facing new horrors in her life. And I think anyone out there who has SEEN Part 4 would agree that a story with Regan MacNeil would have been preferable over the maggot-covered stillborn mess EXORCIST-THE BEGINNING turned out to be! The original is the undisputed classic. Parts 2 and 3 were not great, but no where near as Part 4. Even the whored-up sucker-punch VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN re-release had things to recommend about it. But, EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING has surely killed the series for good and has spelled the END of the franchise! It's enough to make your head spin!</fullReview>

If it's a movie that got bad rating like this one, go and see the bargin matinee for 5 bucks instead of 8 bucks. I thought this movie was well made. It really showed how the devil can take someone's mind and body over and control it. Whoever thought that Sarah was the devil the whole time? You never know. She seemed like a normal person throughout the whole movie. Everyone thought it was the little boy that the devil possessed. Susan was the one that was making it seem like he was possessed because the bed shook and would make him convulse. She in ways was controlling him too. There were some gory scenes like when the one guy slashed himself to death. So as I said don't take somebody elses word, go see it you won't be disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****NO SPOILERS****(nothing to spoil)Of course this movie is not going to live up to the original, but the producers didn't even TRY!In the original, they took the time to make a dummy for the head turning scene, and had Linda Blair, or a stunt double tied to wires for the spider walk. The producers got fricking lazy and cheap, and had pathetic CGI scenes done instead. Every time I saw something CGI, it pulled me out of the movie, killed the mood, and made me angry at first, then chuckle with disbelief.This movie HAD potential, there is a few freaky scenes (the end of the tunnel at the end, for those who've seen it) was a scene that could scare the crap out of someone. But I wasn't captivated enough and wasn't really IN the movie, if you know what I mean. The acting, in my opinion, was fine.The story was there, even though some more character development could have helped, it didn't bother me either. In this day and age, nasty profanities, and nudity don't really render shocks of amazement. But for it's day, the original Exorcist's crucifix masturbation scene was horrendous. It would be horrendous today. The new film should have pushed new boundaries, and made people incredibly uncomfortable, and make them get the urge to go to confession right after they got out of the theatre. But I didn't get remotely bothered. Except the fact that I wasted money seeing it in the theaters.Do yourself a favor, wait 9 months, and make it a blockbuster night.

THAT's what I'd hoped this could have been like. This is a total joke. People don't know whether to laugh or be scared or walk out, as some are. wow. What a let down.

		<fullReview>Listen folks, this is a bad movie. I'm talking BAD. B-A-D. However, I do agree with whomever posted the fact that seeing this movie makes you appreciate how good The Exorcist truly was. What it also does, unfortunately, is make you realize that the people of today have stopped making films. They just make movies now. It's painfully difficult to review this flick without drawing comparisons to The Exorcist, you know, being that it's a prequel and all and wouldn't have a foot to stand on had the other film never been made, but I'll try. If The Exorcist had never been made, this would still be a bad movie. It clearly wants to evoke a number of emotions in its audience yet manages to fail at every turn. The gruesome incidences throughout would be a hundred times more horrifying if we actually cared about any of the characters, but we don't, because the filmmakers chose to make this an action movie with an exorcism at the end as opposed to a character revealing, thought-provoking film. Father Merrin is played as an action hero. His backstory is revealed in a mess of cheap flashbacks that are excruciating to watch because they consistently conclude with cliffhangers that are MEANT to make you want to know more, but instead just offend you at the blatant storytelling of it all. In fact, almost every scene ends with a cliffhanger. And almost every scene contains some dramatic shot of a flame or a puff of smoke that is really only there to create ambience but doesn't because it's so flipping obvious what they were trying to do. Let me put it this way: In one scene, the young priest leaves the room, closes the door, and in the mirror we see the cross on the wall has flipped over. Then the camera zooms in on the inverted cross, just in case we missed it. A film that could stand on its own two feet would not have needed to zoom in on that cross. It would have trusted those in the audience to see it and process the information. The Beginning is all about manipulating the people in the theater. It pretends to be deep and intellectual but is actually just a big mess. If a movie wants to be nothing but popcorn entertainment and fluffy, that's fine by me. It's when the movie uses every popcorn entertainment cliche and expects to be something else that offends me. To the filmmakers: ...No, try again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently viewed this film last night and i have to say that it is pretty bad. The story is lame and the makers of the film just tried too hard to match the intensity of the Exorcist. The actor who plays father Marin was what kept me in my seat. His performance was very good playing the younger version of the Old priest in the original Exorcist. ***POSIBLE SPOILER*** The only good part was his story of how he lost his faith and regained it to reenter the priesthood and at the end of the movie, we see him walking off with the same priest attire that we see father marin wearing in the original exorcist when he shows up to Ellen Burstyns house. Also, when the female doctor is possessed by the devil and looks like young Reagen does when she is possessed, it is very agressive. The things that she says when possessed are just stupid and not as catchy as they are when Linda Blair was possessed. i feel like this film just tried too hard. I think that they just need to leave a classic film such as the Exorcist alone and let it just be. I mean whats next, a Prequel to Psycho or Halloween directed by Ridley Scott??? Other than the acting of Father Marin, the sound in this movie was rather extraordinary and the directing was around par level. But overall, i give it a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist: The Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first, original Exorcist the day it premiered, along with 3 friends, and we were scared to death! The whole concept of that movie was so frightening to us that 4 adults, upon returning home, turned on all the lights in the entire house, and sat up all night together in the same room.The religious implications, along with the virtually non-stop visual and subconscious impacts, made an impression on me that has lasted to this very day.Needless to say I was in great anticipation at the release of "Exorcist: The Beginning", as was nearly everyone that I knew that enjoyed the ultimate horror of the original Exorcist.I was bored to death. The film is extremely slow-moving, very predictable, with lousy CGI graphics. I thought the flies were imperfections in the film, and the movements of the "possessed" individuals were very jerky and unreal, even for a demon.It was all I could do to stay awake for the entire film, unlike the original Exorcist where I was hiding underneath the theatre seating with hands in front of my face.I could go on and on about how dull the entire film was, but I won't bore you to tears as the film did to me.A good flick if you're looking for a well-directed, well-acted, slow-moving drama --- but hardly ranks in my top 100 all time greatest horror movies. The potential was there to build off of, and tie into, the implications of the original Exorcist, but the final product was a disaster in my opinion (and that's what these reviews are all about - opinions).I give it a 1.5 stars out of 5 merely for the production design and directing. Nothing else was of any consequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed this movie has been getting a lot of criticism, but it really isn't that bad. The original Exorcist is FAR better than this one, but it is still a good movie. It basically is a pre-story about when Father Karras first encountered the demon in Egypt.It had some recent-horror like scares in it like the overused "jump" scares, giving it a more modern spin to it, unlike the original that built up dread and horror to scare you. But hey, movies are changing in this day and age. This movie was still entertaining and interesting. To all of those who think this movie is evil: it's just a movie! It is all fictionalized. It was written by a normal person and the characters were portrayed by normal people. I'm not saying that possession can't happen, that's for you to decide, but this movie is just fiction, and there's no reason to think that it is evil. It actually had a positive side to it, as does all of the Exorcist films. It's good vs. evil (or God vs. Satan), and good (God) wins. If you are a true Exorcist fan, you should enjoy this movie, but don't expect anything better than the original. I didn't exactly think the original was perfect either, but it was better than this. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie a few days ago, thereby I am a huge horror fan, especially to the exorcist. It is the only one movie that makes me scared to think anything of the devil and so on because when you think about it, this stuff happens. The thing that bothered me the most was the lack of makeup artists for Izabella Scorupco... yeah, Sarah. i was expecting sumthing new, and scarier because these makeup people gotta be learning new and scarier techniques, but i guess not. They tried to recreate linda blairs look and it just ended up making her look stupid. Now when i think of it she looked kinda like a blue berry, a very skinny one..the kind that are sour. but any ways, she had cheep contacts.. those yellow ones made her look horrible, the cheap makeup and the lack of details just really saddened me. Besides the horrible makeup for her, the gore was good, i was impressed as to how much they put in, especially where this boy is getting ripped apart.but this is another thing that bothers me, the use of computer animation.. sure they couldn't have done it any other way, but i found it cheesy because you could really notice it, at sometimes no... i must admit its not as bad as HULK or The Order, but yeah people are looking to get scared and what no one seems to notice, its by all the old films that are low budget and creative. The story line to start all of those other exorcist movies was good. It fell perfectly in line with everything else, congrats to the writer of this movie. I found it perfectly creepy and realistic. It really is a movie worth seeing if you enjoy a horror film with a good story (can't find too many these days).</fullReview>

There's a lot of anticipation throughout the film to make you jumpy, but the scariest stuff comes late in the film (in my opinion). I'd say if you saw the first one and really liked it then by all means see this prequel, just don't expect it to top the first one. That being said, I will say that this film has more symbolism than the original had. The use of various animals in key points of the film give it a rather dark and menacing tone, and keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout a lot of the film. If you like suspense, you'll like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it, but there's a good reason this movie's rated R...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen The Exorcist before. The first one, I mean. I've never seen any of the others, but I'm OK with that. The Exorcist was never really big with me so when I saw previews on TV for The Exorcist: The Beginning, I was like 'Oh God, don't tell me this is another one.' But, surprisingly, the previews got to me because the day the movie came out, I went with a friend and I saw it. I am such a hypocrite...The movie was far FAR better than I expected. From the beginning, I was hooked. The opening scene was... frightening. I'm all for horror movies. In fact, it's my favorite genre, but this movie (from the beginning!) was truly scary. After the opening scene it kinda dragged on for a short while, but the concept and ideas behind the movie were truly interesting and there were some surprising and not-so-easily-guessed twists throughout the plot.Is there a down side? Of course there is. There is a down side to every movie. Like I said before, after the opening scene, the movie kinda dragged on and at some points it was almost difficult to understand. And some things aren't thoroughly explained and leave some small (but annoying) loose ends. Sequel (to the prequel...)? Hmm, probably. WARNING! There is some violence and gore throughout random and unexpected parts of the movie and it's realistic and straight-forward. And there's some 'bad' but oddly amusing language at some points. I don't want to give away anything so I'll just leave it at this: beware.FINAL THOUGHT: Great tribute to Linda Blair (please stay for the whole movie to see what I mean), but be prepared to wet yourself (or at least cringe) when some of the more gory scenes come up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly Not As Great As the Original Film, But Still Okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've noticed this movie has been getting a lot of criticism, but it really isn't that bad. The original Exorcist is FAR better than this one, but it is still a good movie. It basically is a pre-story about when Father Karras first encountered the demon in Egypt.It had some recent-horror like scares in it like the overused "jump" scares, giving it a more modern spin to it, unlike the original that built up dread and horror to scare you. But hey, movies are changing in this day and age. This movie was still entertaining and interesting. To all of those who think this movie is evil: it's just a movie! It is all fictionalized. It was written by a normal person and the characters were portrayed by normal people. I'm not saying that possession can't happen, that's for you to decide, but this movie is just fiction, and there's no reason to think that it is evil. It actually had a positive side to it, as does all of the Exorcist films. It's good vs. evil (or God vs. Satan), and good (God) wins. If you are a true Exorcist fan, you should enjoy this movie, but don't expect anything better than the original. I didn't exactly think the original was perfect either, but it was better than this. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone commented that he lost the head stone in Africa...Well, if you remember where the dig was at...Iraqi, that was considered part of Africa at the time. So, in fact, the story holds true. Good try though.This movie was damn good. It was separate than the first one, but totally leads you into the original.(SPOILER) The only thing that kind of blew was some of the unnecessary CGI work. The does were super fake.I was so scared of being scared that I completely enjoyed it.Good work. And big kudos go out to the new "Merrin". A fine, fine actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So-being an avid Exorcist fan (book and 1973 film) I went with HUGE expectations of what I was going to encounter. I was equipped with the knowledge the book and film gave me and I expected that information to be carried out and the story to revolve around the incidents alluded to in the original book and film. I would have THOUGHT the screen writers would have done the same.The information provided is: Merrin is a well respected author and archeologist; he has battled this Demon before-in Africa-in a LITTLE BOY--the exorcism took months and nearly killed him; he discovers the amulet of Pazuzu in Irag, and later drives out to an undisclosed location to face the statue of Pazuzu. This is all given to us in the original movie.So here we are in Africa--there is no possessed; the personality of the Demon is never explained (one of the most important purposes of making this film I would think would be to explain the personal history between Merrin and Pazuzu-the demon is never identified). Finally, the "church", whose purpose of existence is only touched upon, gets buried under ground (along with the statue of Pazuzu that is never identified)...so how would Merrin find it in Irag 30 years later?Add to that cheap effects-demonic Hyeenas that look like Disney animation; a fake out with the young boy being possessed; a computer generated picture of the Vatican complete with Merrin donning his black raincoat, hat and briefcase; the appearance of the St.Joseph chain for NO reason whatsoever except that it was in the original (and was also rediscovered in Irag; a possessed WOMAN (???) who crawls on the cave walls; and direct dialogue like Merrin saying "My will is weak" as he accepts a drink. The demonic elements were SO "on the nose"-upside down crosses?? Come on--you can do better than that! And I truly feel they made a woman possessed in the end because they were used to the Linda Blair/Dick Smith makeup of the original (complete with scars all over her face for no reason; at least we see Reagan cut her face with the crucifix). I would be interested in seeing Paul Shrader's version--as it is more of a thinking piece and less gory...but I fear that the whole story needed to end differently...somehow with those artifacts getting lost somewhere so that they could be found in Irag.Stellan Skarsgard does a WONDERFUL job of playing a younger Merrin, however, and his speech is impeccably close to that of Max Von Sydow.As absurd as it sounds, I wish someone could make a GOOD prequel...alas, now that this has been done-you can forget it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of potential, but comes up empty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read comments on this film before seeing it, and most were not good. Of course, taking a page from Agent Mulder (Trust no-one), I decided to spend my $15 and see it for myself. So was it worth it? Probably not.The first 15 minutes of this movie are great. We we are introduced to Father (rather, Mr.) Merrin as a man who is in conflict with his ideas on God, and then set the premise for why Merrin goes to Africa. The background and mystery of his African visit is intriguing. But then, rather than deeply exploring his conflict with religion, or understanding the evil that is at the site, we are given some cheap thrills and gore for probably a whole hour. By the time we deal with the demon, we feel like we are watching another trite possesion film.When you think of the first Exorcist, some believe that it was a good movie because of the grossness and shock value for its time. However, there were other things that made it a classic--to the point that it was nominated for Best Picture for its year. Exorcist I took its time to flesh out the two stories within one movie; first was the disintegration of an innocent girl to a cruel fiend, and second was the conflict of physician priest with God and his inner demons. On top of this, it was aided by some excellent actors like Jason Miller, Ellen Burnstyn, and Max von Sydow. I have a feeling that if the Paul Schrader version of Exorcist:Beginning comes to light, it will be just as intelligent as the first Exorcist. Movie studios, unfortunately, see the moviegoing masses as complete sadist retards and believe as long as the film is gross and has a few scary moments, people will go see it. I think if they believed that there would be some intelligence in their customers (yes, we are their customers), the quality of movies produced would be vastly superior. At many points in this Exorcist there could have been times that the script could have dove into one or two good stories and carved them out well (e.g. Merrin's choices in WWII and how he becomes an atheist, how the devil was first defeated, etc.), but instead, left them stragling and made way for pure trash instead.The real reason to watch this is for Stellan Skarsgard. Always an excellent actor, he makes you believe he is the Father Merrin we saw in the first movie (doesn't hurt that he's Swedish like Max von Sydow) and conveys his emotions with good restrain. All the other actors are easily forgettable, except for the little boy who looked more like evil Webster (maybe that's why half the audience was giggling). Otherwise, with the exception of a few well shot sequences, most of the effects were either horrible or substandard (I did not expect the audience to laugh at some scenes, but they did).Overall, an o.k. film. Would rather have rented it on DVD. Hopefully the Paul Schrader version comes out on DVD as well, and if it does, maybe we'll see the full potential of the film come through. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so it really wasn't that bad, but if the actors were any less into their characters, i think the i would have cried. Not tears of fear, but tears of boredom. The acting is so flat. I mean, the main guy (sorry don't remember his name) is just to blah. I mean, here we have the evilest place on earth, changing everyone and everything, and he's acting like he's stuck in some horrid 4th. grade social studies class, memorizing dates of presidential births (really he's that dull). And none of the others are much better. The computer animation birds have more emotions then most the actors and actress. The story line itself, could have been good. and it wasn't really bad, but the horridly flat acting took away from much of the story line. Then we have all the gore. Some is pretty cool, like the baby:) others are just, well, seemingly out of place. I know, how can you have out of place gore in a scary movie, trust me! I'm gonna leave it at that, OK plot, horrid acting, icky computer work and blah ending. But, it does give a background for the Exorcist (org.). I wouldn't waste your money, but it's your money....i'd say rent it, fast forward to the somewhat interesting parts, but then again, why not just spend those five minutes that could be interesting and just watch the original?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie, but could of been spookier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exorcist: the beginning is the story about Father Merrin, a priest who is troubled by an evil which is summoned by the discovery of a church buried beneath the sand. Merrin is hired to find an ancient artifact which is believed to be hidden inside the church. However after the exploration in the church strange and evil things start to affect the village and its people. Father Merrin begins to question his faith even more until he finally meets the devil himself. I just saw Exorcist: the beginning last night and it turned out to be a pretty good film. I just felt it could of been a little more spookier and frightening like the original Exorcist was. However the final scene was pretty scary when Merrin fought with the devil. So overall It turned out to be a good movie. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was NOT disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie expecting to be disappointed after reading some of the comments on this site and the critical reviews from the internet.I was NOT disappointed. This movie was disturbing and scary. I am a fan of The Exorcist, I think it is the greatest horror movie of all time. I read both Exorcist and Legion and have seen all three movies (4 if you count the revamped Exorcist) though I don't really remember Heretic because it was so confusing. I thought, as far as prequels go (especially with no writing credit by the original author), this was on level with the original and 3. I thought the casting of father Merrin was WONDERFUL. I also though the other players were very good. There were many times I thought my heart was going to jump out of my chest. There was the mystery element of what had happened years ago, and it was obvious to me why Merrin had lost his faith. Of course it wasn't perfect, with all the reshoots and William Peter Blatty's voice being absent, it couldn't be. But it WAS scary and entertaining and lots of fun.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a darn good movie---</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two sequels spawned by 1973's original horror classic, and greatest horror film of all time The Exorcist. Didn't even come close to capturing anything from the original. But 'Beginning' does stand on it's own as a damn creepy, sometimes disturbing film. That delves into the back story of Father Merrin and his first encounter with the demon. Directed by Renny Harling ( Nightmare 4, and Deep Blue Sea) this movie is a vicious attack on your nerves. Keeping you tense through the whole movie as the demon wraps it spell around the characters and the audience. Stellan Skarsgard does a great job portraying the tortured Father Merrin. He keeps his performance his own, never trying to mimic or immulate Max Von Sydow's. The story develops rapidly and throughout continues it's attack on the viewers nerves. There is jump-out-of-your seat scares a minute here. Some are cliché', but some others caught me off guard. The creepy atmosphere created in the film holds tight and doesn't slink off or fade. There was some sequences that just grabbed my attention and held it, I don't even think I blinked during the Tribe's attempt at an exorcism-- the sequence is scary as hell, but beautifully shot and edited. The film's visual style is just amazing and the sound design and score are incredible too. There is also a plethra of creepy images that will undoubtedly disturb some, even I got a little freaked out a couple of times. Seeing upside down crosses and stuff is a little uncomfortable at times, especially in the context of this film. There is a hearty supply of blood and gore, but never going into absurd or excessive amounts, just enough to keep some viewers on their toes. My only complaint with the film is the slight cartoonishness of the finale's exorcism ( and no I didn't ruin anything for you-- the movie is called the Exorcist ya know-- there was bound to be one in there--- and in this case there is 2)-- but it was still alittle frightening. There is a very "in your face" feeling to the finale's exorcism. I think it comes off beautifully. I was enthralled by this film from beginning to end and I think many other horror fans will be to. Though it's getting slammed by reviewers, I don't think this is in any way a bad movie. I think being labeled an "Exorcist" films creates a standard that is just unreachable in trying to compare to the original...and I think a lot of reviewers or viewers for that matter. Will spend more time comparing the two, than looking at "Beginning" as it's own movie--- which is what I tried to do in the above. You'll notice at no time do I compare the movies. This film can stand on it's own as a slightly disturbing, creepy and sometimes down right scary film, that just so happens to be the prequel to "The Exorcist."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing wrong with this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, it isn't better than the original but it's much more interesting than the last sequels were. Oh no, there's a lot of blood and gore as well as some scenes of Nazi soldiers doing their job...so what! It's a Horror movie and it's meant to shock, isn't it? God forbid someone makes a true Horror flick for once that isn't about five sexy teenagers running from some masked idiot in an asylum, abandoned farm, dormitory, rural village... you get the point. This is a well-made film with some genuine scares. I think everyone giving this movie a bad review is just pi$$ed that Adam Sandler or Will Smith didn't get a role, good... the lesser-known actors, the better the movie. I can also say that I am very glad this played at the drive-in BEFORE Catwoman so I didn't have to waste two hours of my life in which I could be eating or sleeping.

		<fullReview>If I had seen avoided this movie based on critics ratings, I would have sure missed a good movie.If you are looking for some soul searching or diving experience, this movie is not for you. But if you are looking for a good thriller, and a good way to spend your weekend evening, this movie is for you.I had seen the original Exorcist when it was re-released in 2001, and did not find it scary. I felt it was too overblown. Now that I did not have high expectations from the prequel, I enjoyed the movie.Agreed, that the technical portion leaves much to be desired. The settings do not look real, and look more like cardboard cutouts, the horror effects are only limited to violent shaking and blood-gore, but it is much better than psychological thrillers like Mulholland Drive or THe Unbreakable, where you tear out your hair in frustration, waiting for action to happen.After being terribly disappointed by movies like "The Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind" and "Being John Malkovich", I hardly care what critics has to say. If I enjoy the movie, it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before viewing the latest chapter of the exorcist series I tried to keep an open mind and not compare it to the original which was greatly done. The beginning of the movie got my attention and I began to think that maybe this actually will turn out to be a decent movie. Within 20 minutes I quickly realized that this movie took a turn for the worst as the plot began to lack anything remotely interesting and that gore was used just to create a cheap sense of a scare. The movie was very graphic, but it didn't even coincide with what actually was happening. For anyone who saw the movie I think my point is clear in the scene where the young boy is mauled by a pack of wild dogs (that were poorly animated by the way). The movie did have its frights, but in the long run it just seemed like another poorly executed horror movie that wasn't very satisfying. Not to mention the original writer of the story was fired half way through movie production and another writer took his place maybe this is why the movie lacked anything spectacular. Who knows? I give this movie a 5/10, simply because it wasn't all that bad, but it definitely didn't compare to its original predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had its moments - but overall disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that this film had three different directors - its shows. The film had some definite moments but then dragged out everywhere else. The general storyline was good - but somehow it kept getting lost in the script and direction.I am a fan of Izabella Scorupco and was looking forward to seeing her in another film. I was very impressed with performance in GOLDENEYE. Her later films were less entertaining, but she always managed to shine. While her performance was adequate here, it reminds me of the saying that "a cook is only as good as his ingredients." I guess that a good actor can only be as good as the quality of the script that they are handed.I believe that Iza's role was added in by Harlin during his reshoot. I believe that she had a baby in December 2003, which meant that working in a film during that short amount of time is a credit to her endurance and reliability.I liked the film for it general storyline. It also reminds me that when evil is trying to misdirect or seduce someone, it may not come in a form that is ugly or frightening ... it may come in a form that is alluring and seductive - like that of a beautiful woman.</fullReview>

The story was very well written and put together beautifully. The acting was exceptional, especially by Skarsgard and Scorupco. I thought that movie was very eerie in that it was so dark. It left you to wonder what was around the corner. Each scene had a great buildup to a intense moment. The nazi scene where merrin had to choose 10 ppl to die was the most dramatic scene i've seen in this franchise! Especially the little girl, that really got to me. Being a HUGE fan of the original i know exactly what this franchise needed, and Renny didn't only achieve it he topped my expectations. The demons voice was dark and intense. Each scene in this movie had my heart racing. In fact my girlfriend started having panic attacks during the exorcism scenes at the end. I know a lot about demonology and Renny sure did his studying very well. Everything about this film was great, except for the cheesy CGI hyenas. All in all this was a good film to see, and if you haven't seen it I recommend you do so. Great Work Harlin!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as it should of been? No....but it certainly isn't "the worst".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone expecting this movie to be as good as the original film is, well, an idiot. I guess it's easy to forget how well done the first one is, how it takes its time, and how truly frightening it is. A film like that is hard to come by, and they usually don't in the same franchise/series. Is The Exorcist: The Beginning as good as The Exorcist? Nope. Is it horrible? Nope.The major complaints about this film seem to be the following: The shotty CGI, the lack of scariness, the use of horror clichés (like the loud noise-jump factor), elements of the climax, and these are all part of the directing. All of these complaints have some validity, but not to the degree many people are claiming. Yes, the CGI looks rushed and the loud noise thing was used a little too often. The demonic woman at the end was a huge throw back to the original, and instead of shocking us, she was amusing. But Linda Blair's character also became amusing by the end, didn't she?My biggest complaint about this film is pacing of it. They seem to trying to force in too much too soon. Remember how tense the original one was while the script took the time to establish all the characters before anything really dramatic or "over the top" occurred? That's not present in "The Beginning". This is where the movie fails the most, we're too quickly thrown into the "shocking" part of the horror.What's good about this movie: The acting. The cast is excellent. All the dialogue is natural. Skarsgard is great. The story is also very good, which I'm noticing a lot of people aren't mentioning. Merrin becomes a very well defined, 3-D character in this film, and he's interesting to watch. A lot of elements in the plot too were things i weren't expecting: the African exorcism, the conflict between the tribe and the British army (which could of been written a little better) and the twist towards the end was something that took me by surprise. And lastly, I would like to say that this movie IS scary. Maybe not "haunt your dreams" scary, but suspense is often reached and everyone I witnessed/went with to see this film was on the edge of their seat. There are also a few moments when the creepiness of the original is reached (as is the latent sexuality), however this doesn't happen often enough.It's a shame that directing and studio juggling can go so wrong with a movie and concept that holds so much promise. I'm convinced that with some rewriting and more inspired directing that this prequel could of been much closer to what the original was. I'm looking forward to seeing the original version to compare the two, but I found a lot of the criticism this movie is getting to be overly exaggerated and sometimes unfounded.The Exorcist: The Beginning - 6/10</fullReview>

Not very many sequels or prequels ever live up to the original, but especially when the original is a Masterpiece in movies. While there are problems with this movie, ie: poor cgi graphics, gore just for the sake of gore scenes (especially the scene with Josephs brother and the hyenas was way over done), some corny dialog, and like some have said I thought Father Marrin was almost killed doing the exorcism on a young African boy. But all in all it's not to bad. If you do go see it see an early show, there cheaper.That said I would really like to see the version that was deemed not "scary" enough for the studio executives.</fullReview>

(assuming these scenes will be some bonus DVD crap)overall, i thought this movie was decent. nothing ground-breaking.. &amp; it certainly didn't fill the shoes of the original, but decent. IMO the acting was average, but the script was horrible. this movie was written terribly. in movies, the writing appeals to me the most. imagery is nothing unless it is based upon facts, &amp; obviously this movie is fictional... so the imagery in this movie takes the typical jump-out-of-your-seat-valley-girl approach. the only compelling quote was the one revolving around Lucifer landing during the war. when i go to see a "horrifying" movie, i expect the audience to be holding their breath when the villain's climax arrives... not laughing at references to "juicy asses". although i enjoyed the ending somewhat, it still seemed as if the demon was casted from the Chappelle Show. movie's such as "Seven" had writing which appealed to me (the ending obviously). ETB should not have based its entertainment factor upon gore &amp; special effects (which sucked by the way), but rather a thought provoking script.this is one of the best horror films in recent years... but what competition does it really face? Freddy VS. Jason? loli expected to see a well written piece of art &amp; received the sequel to Stigmata instead. i hoped that ETB would reach into the depth of religion &amp; develop an interesting storyline, but instead paid to see the oh-so unique "he/she's the antichrist, kill him/her now!" plot.although i was disappointed, i also heard that another version by Schrader might be released. is anyone else familiar w/ this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE DEVIL MAKES THEM DO IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On Christmas Eve 1973, the world of cinema horror was forever catapulted to new and disturbing heights. Director William Friedkin, fresh off his Oscar win for 'The French Connection', brought his considerable talent and street-tough filmic approach to the screen adaptation of William Peter Blatty's 1971 bestselling book 'The Exorcist', and the results-a pitch-perfect fit of filmmaker and subject-shook the foundations of cinematic fright. 'The Exorcist' remains one of the most mind-numbingly scary films ever committed to celluloid, and its impact can still be felt by many today, especially from the nightmares of those still haunted by it.Of course, the money-makers in Hollywood know this well, and they are determined to milk it for every last dollar. And after the flop of its initial sequel, 1976's 'Exorcist II: The Heretic' directed by John Boorman, the Powers-That-Be realized that any money to be made from this venture had to be done independent of any film 'artist'. Thus, their greedy little hands have been driving this haunting tale of demonic possession into the ground ever since.Granted, Boorman's sequel was a mess, but it's a glorious one. Full of spectacularly lurid scenes of flying locusts, sexy demons lurking in an abandoned Georgetown house, ESP mind-synching and a truly ludicrous performance by Richard Burton, 'The Heretic' had guts, even if it failed miserably (actually, the film does have its share of fans; none other than Martin Scorsese has gone on record saying that 'Exorcist II' is one of his favorite works of the Seventies).Stung by the appalling failure of the Boorman film, the studios were initially content in letting the story die. But in 1983, author William Peter Blatty resurrected the tale. His novel 'Legion' followed Lt. Kinderman, a character from the original story, as he struggles to solve a series of grisly murders patterned after a dead serial killer. His trail leads to the exorcism that occurred in Georgetown, and a direct confrontation with the demon that possessed Regan McNeil. The book went on to top the Best-Seller lists, and suddenly there was renewed interest in demons and possession. So in 1989 Blatty himself brought the tale to the big screen, much to the delight of the studio brass.Looking for lightning to strike twice, the brass had high hopes. After all, Blatty was the one who started it all, and if anyone could bring the flocks in, it was the man who cultivated the story of 'The Exorcist' into two bestselling books and a box-office champ. However, when they saw his initial cut, their reaction was one of bewilderment. Why are there no exorcisms? No spinning heads or projectile vomiting? What is this existentialist horror crap? Blatty argued that he was faithful to his novel, right down to bringing in Jason Miller as the not-quite-dead Father Karras.'But', the studio said, 'How can we call it 'Exorcist III' when there is no exorcism in it?''Who said we were calling it 'Exorcist III'? That's not the title', Blatty retorted. 'This film is called 'Legion', just like the novel.''No, no, no,' the studio explained. 'You were signed to make the third installment of 'The Exorcist'.'And thus it went.In the end, Blatty was forced to add a pointless sub-story involving a Father Morning, who has nothing to do with anything but has to somehow come in and save the day with a fire-and-brimstone exorcism. So in the end you have two thirds of a very good and genuinely creepy spiritual horror film with a ridiculously over-the-top ending that means nothing, does nothing to advance the well-crafted story, but by golly sports one hell of an exorcism, complete with slithering snakes and a dancing chorus of demons.And the title of this compromised film? Well, 'The Exorcist III' of course.Which brings us to the forth installment, 'Exorcist: The Beginning'.Written in part by Caleb Carr, author of the novel 'The Alienist', 'Exorcist: The Beginning' involves the early years of Father Merrin, the elderly exorcist of the 1973 original. In this prequel, Merrin is a disillusioned Cleric who has abandoned Christ after his first-hand witnessing of the horrors of evil, here in the form of the advancing Nazi Regime who used him as a pawn in their sadistic games. Now a layman, he is hired by a mysterious faction of the Church to explore the recently uncovered ruins of a Catholic cathedral, inexplicitly built thousands of years before Christ. This leads to his first encounter with the demon Pizuzu, the bugger who went on to possess poor little Regan years later.Originally, the film was to be directed by the great John Frankenheimer, the master behind such classic films as the original 'Manchurian Candidate' and the creepy Rock Hudson vehicle 'Seconds'. Frankenheimer had success following Friedkin's lead with his rambunctious sequel to 'The French Connection', so hopes were high. However, this pairing of director and project was not to be. Shortly before filming, Frankenheimer had to be admitted into the hospital, which led to his unfortunate death. Undeterred, the studio brass (in this case Morgan Creek, which bought the Exorcist franchise from Warner Bros. and William Peter Blatty) actually had a rare creative idea: let's bring in Paul Schrader to helm it. Schrader has an interesting religious background: the product of a strict Dutch Calvinist upbringing, he was forbidden to see any films, and didn't actually witness his first movie until his 18th birthday. Escaping the confines of his Grand Rapids, Michigan homestead, Schrader relocated in Hollywood, where he became the successful screenwriter of such gems as 'Taxi Driver' and 'The Last Temptation of Christ'. As a filmmaker, his works of passion included 'Hardcore', the story of a strict religious man whose daughter has disappeared into the world of pornography, and 'Mishima', a spiritual look at the haunted life of Japanese writer Yukio Mishima. In a marriage of filmmaker and material, Schrader's religion-scorched past and the spiritually challenged world of 'The Exorcist' seemed like an ideal match.Of course, this doesn't take into account the concerns of actual profit-motives.When Schrader screened his nearly-finished cut of the film, the bigwigs of Morgan Creek shuttered. It was the Blatty incident all over again: another film 'artist' ruining any chance of box-office returns by giving a passionate, soul-searching account of the nature of Evil.Not taking any chances, Morgan Creek promptly fired Paul Schrader and sought out a filmmaker without the inconvenience of a personal vision to jazz up the final product. They uncovered Renny Harlin, the Finnish director-for-hire responsible for such mainstream romps as 'Die Hard II' and 'Deep Blue Sea' (itself a rip-off of 'Jaws'). Harlin proved to be an amiable replacement, discarding the philosophical aspects of the tale for a more commercially-viable 'homage' to the original shocks and grunts. Suddenly 'Exorcist: The Beginning' is a film filled with menacing computer-generated jackals, blood dripping in all the wrong places, desert sandstorms a la the recent update of 'The Mummy', corpses dropped from above on cue to make the audience jump, and more-than-enough references to Friedkin's original for moviegoers to checklist. Clocks suddenly stopping for no reason? Check. Menacing-looking Arabs in a foreign land banging on metal in unison? Check. A repugnant British drunkard getting his comeuppance? Check. A possessed person resembling Linda Blair with a ghastly face saying unspeakably lewd things in a coarse voice? Check. A horrific serpentine tongue from said possessed person? Check.You get the picture.Gone are truly tortured souls like Father Karras and Lieutenant Kinderman struggling with the concept of Evil. In these days of the 'With Us Or Against Us' philosophy-ethic, struggling with one's soul is being a sissy. Thus Merrin, while still tormented by his conscious from his past dealings, has been relegated to the role of super hero, a Super-Priest-In-Waiting. His black-and-white antics-a surly disposition, his refusal to call himself 'Father' Merrin, a reluctance to speak of his tortured dealings with the Nazis-set us up for his inevitable return to Faith. This is Hollywood Storytelling at its most basic. 'Exorcist: The Beginning' is chop-filled with disposable characters, grandstanding special effects (artificially generated by obvious CGI computer graphics), menacing music cues telling us when to be scared, and strategically timed jolts that inevitably mean nothing. Now, to be sure, there are ways of playing with clichés and still making a work exciting. A case in point could be the television series 'Rescue Me', starring Denis Leary as a tortured fire fighter. This show uses every cliché under the sun and still manages to be innovative and even moving at times. Why? Because it has love for its characters and faith in its storytelling. An audience is willing to go with a tired cliché if it is a means of expressing a person's inner life, and if the character on the screen is someone we can identify. Then the chestnut, tired and worn as it may be, becomes an extension of the character, not the reverse. Look at 'Training Day' with Denzel Washington, or Brian De Palma's 'Blow Out', or any of Quentin Tarantino's works.But all that requires intelligence, a cinematic conscious, if you will. Renny Harlin, though certainly an able and workmanlike filmmaker, does not possess such skills. He is a showman, no more, no less. And this is exactly why he was hired. Perhaps one day he will get his calling from the cinematic gods and make his masterpiece, but for now hokum such as 'Exorcist: The Beginning' will be his forte.Now there is talk that all is not lost and Paul Schrader's vision may yet reach the light of day: Morgan Creek has recently stated that they are planning on a DVD release for next year of both the Schrader version and the Harlin version, perhaps as a double disc set. They even hinted at a brief theatrical release of the Schrader film, which would be nice. But this is all speculative right now, and it really depends on the kind of box-office the Harlin-conceived forth installment generates. If the money men sense that they have a dying franchise on their hands, Schrader's film could be buried forever.Which would be a shame. Blatty's passion-play tale of demons and lost faith and the revelation of evil in a modern world deserves a better finale than computer-generated jackals and frights handpicked from the accountant's office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this movie isn't as good as the original exorcist. Did anyone actually expect it to be? I don't think so. This movie was good on its own.It was much better then part 2 or part 3. I liked that it had some decent gore. Its not a cop out for them to include gore. The original had gore. Projectile vomiting and the scene concerning the crucifix are all pretty gory. It pays some very good homage to the original as well. I liked the equivalent to the spider walk, when sara does it backwards in the cave. Altho it was obviously CGI it was cool that they thought to put that in there. Also the things Sara said altho some think cheesy ("Dont you want to f**** me anymore?) are accurate homages of how Pazuzu spoke in the original, saying the same kind of things. Skarsgard did an excellent job portraying Father Merrin. I loved the way that this movie played with our memory of the original. We knew (or thought we knew) from the original that Merrin had originally encountered Pazuzu when it possessed a small boy so it worked well as a twist that altho that is what most ppl did believe even the ones in this story, he and young Joseph know the truth. Very effective for people that like to think about movies instead of just watch them and pick them apart to say they are bad. Also Pazuzu sounded very similar and the look that Sara took on was very similar to Reagans. I like the way they embraced the original and tried to include it but were creative enough to go with there own vision and not just copy it. Bravo Renny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap thrills and an ending that did no justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sat down in the theatre to see this movie at 10 pm, I was hoping to get scared. I'm one to jump at things popping out at you and little else. In the beginning, I watched a boy get mauled by demonic hyenas, natives have appendages ripped off by the devil, and a baby being born dead and covered (inside and out) with maggots. Disturbing images, yes. Scary, no. It didn't make the movie good in anyway, except to freak out a few people and make them a bit ill.It wasn't a good film based on the fact you knew when everything was coming, and how it would be presented. Modern technology was obvious..too obvious. It's too bad. The whole ending was absolutely ridiculous. In fact, I laughed in the theatre. When Possessed-Sarah was running down a random stone hallway with her body convulsing and flapping in the wind, it was ridiculous. It looked ridiculous seeing her flap her arms around in the distance.Considering I went to get scared, I have to admit, in the beginning I jumped. The ending ruined it for me, completely.I did enjoy, however, seeing the girls run out the door saying "that was SICK. GROSS." in a disgusted voice. Hooray for cheap tricks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist the Beginning MUCH better than Dominion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who don't know- some call it the movies curse- this movie was actually made twice! First came Exorcist the Beginning a movie that was directed in the same mood as the Exorcist orgininal. When the movie was finished it was submitted to the studio for approval; however the studio did not like the movie! Instead they made the poor decision to have the movie re-filmed by another director.The movie was re-filmed and the result called Dominion was a complete and utter flop at the box office. Because of the flop, the studio decided to allow the first director to release The Beginning.On to the Movie- This movie was excellent in my opinion. Its not a fantastic Oscar worthy movie; however, where it stands strong is the fact that it incorporates much of the same lore, history and suspense that we saw in Exorcist. The original director should be praised for his efforts, and the second version director should be ashamed.You will enjoy this movie if you enjoy thought proking, suspenseful horror that utilizes much lore. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Further proof that bile-spewing critics would benefit most from exorcism...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a director as tone-deaf to subtlety as Renny Harlin, I must say his "Exorcist: The Beginning" is an impressive little prequel with even a hint of insight into spiritual conflict. You can say a lot against Harlin (most insist he's just another Hollywood hack), but his frenetic approach to film-making ensures an experience that is never dull, and his "Exorcist"--while over-emphasizing action and special effects (in the form of some very noticeable--yet not overly distracting--CGI) above all else, is an engaging spiritual horror flick and a worthy prequel to William Friedkin's 1973 film. The plot centers around Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard), a former priest who lost his faith during the second World War (recalled in chilling flashback), and now seeks a living in archeology; when commissioned by a mysterious Frenchman to retrieve an artifact, he enters an African village that quickly falls victim to supernatural happenings and odd omens, all revolving around the uncovering of a long-buried cathedral. Harlin's approach to storytelling runs contrary to the meditative method employed by Friedkin, but it is interesting how well his sledgehammer, 'damn-the-torpedoes' style works: the set design, lighting, and special effects are well-utilized, and there's enough creative gore splashed about to please genre buffs. The climactic sequence, involving an amped-up exorcism with facial contortion, spider-walking, and blasphemy-uttering, is both effective and affecting (thanks to Skarsgard's convincing performance). While some may consider Harlin's approach sacrilegious to those who came before, I found "Exorcist: The Beginning" to be a surprisingly worthwhile ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist: The Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review will be slightly more difficult to write than usual, as I have to admit that I have never seen the original Exorcist (1973), which is going to make a comparison between these two films rather difficult. However, I understood what was going on in The Beginning, so perhaps no prior knowledge of The Exorcist is necessary when going to see this film. Exorcist: The Beginning takes place in East Africa in the late 1940s, where a Christian church has been discovered buried in the desert. Ex-Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsg?rd), now an archaeologist, is hired to go to the church to find an ancient pagan relic which is supposedly buried there. Of course, everything goes rather pear-shaped, people (and animals) start acting very strangely, and it turns out that there's a demon (Pazuzu, the same demon in the original) that starts possessing people. This film is actually the third time it has been filmed; twice under the first director, and when studio bosses didn't like it they fired him and gave the new director, Renny Harlin, 10 months to re-write, shoot and edit a new film. And to be honest, it shows through ? there are scenes which are either a bit rushed, and others which don't really feel wholly relevant. Coupled with dodgy CGI this makes for a rather limp film.The main problem is the fact that the film fails to build up any real tension. It is instead filled with too many cheap shocks ? usually involving animals ? and this makes the film feel less like a true horror film. Cheap shocks are all very well occasionally, but the audience needs to feel the fear characters in the film feel, using the atmosphere and music of the film to create that effect. Instead, the audience was left being able to predict when the next "scare" was coming so that when it did come, it was neither truly surprising nor shocking. It meant, unfortunately, that the experience of watching the film actually became quite boring. It's not all bad, though. The film does start to build up momentum towards the end, with the exorcism itself quite gripping, and visually it is suitably dark, with blood-soaked walls, dark corners and eerie shadows all present and correct. Mention must also go to Stellan Skarsg?rd, who is excellent as the priest who has lost his faith, and must find it again through exorcising the demon; he brings much needed charisma to an otherwise hollow film, and without him this film would have easily lost a point or two.Rated: 6/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For someone who is not exactly a fan of Friedkin's so called classic,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>......the beginning (why not "the genesis" by the way?) another sequel (was it the fourth ? the fifth? who knows?) is not cause for celebration."The exorcist" (1973) represents exactly the kind of horror movie I hate.When I saw it in a Londonian movie theater with an American friend,my pal was shocked because I was laughing during the Blair/McCambridge frightening farces.Actually "the exorcist" was the beginning of the reign of the "horrible" special effects which would mar the horror and fantasy genre for two decades and more ,before "the sixth sense" "Jacob's ladder" or "the others" reasserted the excellence of the genre which "the haunting "(1963)"Rosemary's baby" "cat people" or "the innocents" (1961) had brilliantly pioneered.This last episode of the saga is more of the same.Archaeology and knowing religious theories do not delude for long.Special effects get once more the lion's share in the final segment and the unfortunate priest has got only his cross to fight against evil.But WHO IS EVIL?That's the question,cause it's primarily a whodunit.I wonder why the exorcists "writers" call Satan to the rescue when evil's involved.They should have a look at the eight' o clock news.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Bad as Some Will Lead You to Believe But Not Great Either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsg?rd) is summoned by a collector of rare antiquities and asked to find a mysterious statue of the demon Pazuzu in a poverty-stricken African village. Once there, Merrin participates in an archaeological excavation which unearths a Byzantine church. This mysterious temple dates back to a time before Christianity arrived to the region. But what's even more mysterious is the evidence which suggests that the perfectly preserved church was buried as soon as it was completed. Panic among the townspeople soon follow and evidence of a demonic force gives reason to suspect that something else was unearthed. Something powerful and evil.The original "Exorcist" was greeted with mixed reviews when it was first released during the Christmas season of 1973. However, that did not stop it from becoming an almost instant classic garnering several Oscar nods and praise from film buffs everywhere.The fate of its sequels on the other hand suffered the exact opposite. The first sequel "The Heretic" has been branded by many as the worst sequel in film history. An exaggerated claim but there is no denying that the film is inferior to the original. The second sequel "Exorcist III" received poor reviews and lousy box-office returns but has since developed a rather loyal following. "The Beginning" critically suffered the same fate. We'll just have to wait and see if time is as kind to this instalment as it was to Blatty's "Exorcist III"."The Beginning" is not that bad as a horror film. If you view this with your expectations set low, you may be surprised by it. I also think the film's main problem is having "Exorcist" in its title. I think people would have accepted this film and would have been kinder to it had it not been a prequel to one of the greatest horror movies of all times. If judged on its own terms, "Exorcist: The Beginning" has a lot to offer the horror film fan; Decent visual effects (less CGI would have been nice though), a good cast, decent make-up effects, some good cinematography, good production values and an interesting storyline. But I guess you can say the same about the first sequel - "The Heretic" and we all know how that one turned out. I guess execution is key and it is in the execution where both films lose it and collapse. I did find the demon (or demons) in this film frightening in certain scenes. We see it's grisly work throughout the village but it never really materializes. It also appears to be far more potent than in the previous films. In the original, the malevolent entity almost destroys the spirit of a little girl. Here we see it consume an entire town as well as its people.The film's biggest disappointment is in its weak and extremely cheesy exorcism scene. Without giving spoilers, the entire climax seemed rushed, broke no new grounds and it seemed like a pathetic attempt to copy the originals style. If shock value was what the film-makers were aiming for, they failed and the end result is a laughable imitation of the original film and the lame, sexual dialogue had no real purpose other than to try to achieve what Friedkin achieved back in 1973. Also disappointing is the unnecessary twist. It has become obvious that none of these movies, from the "Heretic" all the way up to "The Beginning", bothered in keeping continuity since the characters and time lines do not match up at all making this a very disjointed franchise.With that said, I found this much maligned prequel to be a somewhat enjoyable night at the theatre. It's better than many of its detractors would have you to believe but it is miles away from being great. It is on par with the equally panned "The Heretic" but inferior to Part III which is far more effective in its psychological terror, and this film would have been much better had they not fumbled the all too important climax.I recommend "Exorcist: The Beginning" to the casual horror film fan but it needs to be viewed with an open mind especially if you're a fan of the original film. If not, you will most definitely, religiously hate it.NOTE: There are 2 prequels to "The Exorcist". Renny Harlin's "The Beginning" and Paul Schrader's "Dominion: Prequel To The Exorcist" which fared a bit better critically. I recommend both films but rent before you buy because they are very different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a spectacular crap storm, all based on the reviews and user comments I've seen around here and I must say I am more than disappointed: I liked the film and found it very smoothly directed and acted horror flick.I think, that most reviewers are biased on the fact, that they like the original Exorcist, a trait I don't share. I've always thought, that The Exorcist is rather poorly made film, which has the best scenes in the end. In fact I think, that if this film would have been named something else than as a prequel of The Exorcits it would have much higher score. There was also this sorry thing that happened with the director, who originally directed the first draft of the film, Paul Schrader, who is considered to be an auteur and his fans took major offense, when he was sacked and Harlin directed his version of the film.The Exorcist was more intellectual film, or at least it wanted to be one. William Friedkin spent lot of time in trying to prove, that there are no daemons, only mental illness. And after illness was ruled out only choice was the daemon. Exorcist: the beginning has only disbelief from Merrin (Stellan Skarsg?rd). there is no technology to prove otherwise, only bitter, faithless man, who doesn't want to believe. And then there is the devil, who proves otherwise.As I said I liked the film. It's not the best film ever, but it is far from the image people give it in their reviews. In fact I liked it better than The Exorcist: acting and directing is far more better in this film.What else? I suppose, that if people, fans of the Exorcist and Paul Schrader, would see this a little more open mind, they might even like the film. It really isn't half bad and it certainly is rather good horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never seen a movie underrated such heavily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the Exorcist franchise I've seen recently and thus remember well only the original one (E1) and the last one (The Beginning, ETB). Didn't see The Dominion yet, so I will judge ETB on its own merit.After tons of negative reviews on ETB my expectations before watching it couldn't be any lower. How I was surprised! Story without major holes, no cheap boo's and clichés as was expected. Very refreshing and profound performance by Skarsgard and Scorupco. Spectacular and believable sets. Wit, tense, moody, atmospheric, captive. Almost nothing to complain about any movie, including an exorcist one. I was caught by that impressionist way of telling and filming the story - little strokes of feelings, small details, build the whole picture so you rather feel than see it. To illustrate, remember that naturalistic knocking off the cap with the barrel of the pistol before shooting man's head. Short lines like "things they did to me in concentration camp" with no further explanation needed, that short kiss building at once the whole sympathy between the two, even that alcoholic guy (before he dealt with flies). Even that awkward exorcism pays to the story ? yes, it is Merrin's first try with being him caught completely unprepared.Now let's tackle most popular points of ETB critic: - Too visceral? Come on, it's about pure evil, so what else could be expected? Had fun seeing dozens of reviews telling in the same paragraph that "E1 is classic horror" and "ETB is too scary". It's not scary, it's desperate, dark and pressing. - Not state-of-the-art CGI hyenas? Why care? It's only 5 seconds, and the it's not StarWars episode. They are not that bad, by the way.Moreover, I really wonder people saying that ETB doesn't stand to its original. Sounds heretic but still: - E1 scares cheap with rotating head, pea soup, even beloved demon's flash - E1 lacks action and depth in some parts - That performance by Von Sydow could be seen in many other his movies, no big achievement. Pazuzu, stopping pendulum, blasphemy, playing with light to mark good vs. evil, good dialogs, even tubular bells theme - everything in its place, so why complain? The only explanation I have is that people came for ETB to revive 20-30 years old emotions of seeing the first Exorcist, which is impossible by definition. Sure, there is nothing left to surprise in the premise of exorcism after 30 years of exercising it on big screens. Sure, we all became 30 years harder to amaze. Mark that the very same thing happens with almost any sequel - remember kicking of Matrix Reloaded. People wanted to be surprised again with the story already told in the 1st Matrix and thus missed the merits of the 2nd part. Well, that fancy ballad of greedy producers firing the old artist and re-shooting the whole thing by action flicks director also worked out undeserved negative prejudices towards ETB. Just check every negative review (ok, even if this nice tale is straightforward and true, what is Harlin's fault after all?). Judging is made easy - sure, how that "superficial Finnish sharks movie maker" could deliver? Believe me or not, he delivers with his very effort to avoid making cheap horror being visible, which should be rewarded by itself. Of course there are flaws in ETB. Some opportunities were spared like one with walking of Merrin and a boy (Josh?) through the tunnel with a lantern. The premise was ideal to deliver a scene to learn in cinematography schools. That weird battle of English soldiers vs. themselves and locals also left the taste of missed opportunity, although the idea, costumes, make-up and setting were great. The moon in the background of Merrin in the grave digging scene was an unnecessary cliché. Suicide of the officer could be justified better and many other things which could be done far better.So, my score is 8 comprised of well-deserved 7 plus extra mark for Harlin's bravery of daring and succeeding in new genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bad Beginning, A Good Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exorcist: The Beginning seemed like an entire different setting and completely off the original. In which case, it is. As an Exorcist film, it is the worst ever because: 1) It has NOTHING to do with the original and does not even have some clues toward the 1st. Nothing.2) While watching this movie, you start to think "How is this the beginning of the original? The only thing from the Original is Merrian." But, overall, the film was actually quite amazing. For the 1st time it does a real good job of scaring the crap out of you. But after that, it sorta gets old....quick. The acting is actually pretty good. The sound and music are really cool and can probably still scare you after you watch the movie.In general, for the beginning of a great motion picture, I say this fails bad. But as a movie, it did pretty good.7 out of 10 -TiptoeGecko</fullReview>

This film has plot and depth, and stunningly to the soul terror - such as when they first enter the ancient church and discover the crucifix hanging upside down - I don't get scared of things but that was just freakish, especially when viewed alone late at night.The ancient world, archeology and early Christian history may not be interesting to many, but come on! Step away from the MTV mindset for awhile. All those elements tied with all this plausible satanic evil are what make this film good. This film and the original Exorcist are the only ones worth seeing in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Badly Executed it Doesn't Deserve the Name **SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have no problem with hokey B-horror flicks. But if their going to put the "Exorcist" on a film they should at least adhere to the same standards as the original. This film was so badly executed in so many ways it was painful to watch. But, like any train wreck of a movie, it was also hard to turn away.Unlike the original, everyone in this movie speaks English--even poor Arab children and African tribesmen. That should have tipped me off to the rest of the film. But I still watched. Then we're to believe that a fifteen hundred year old church--which, by the way, had statues, alters and icons that were well out-of-period for a Fifth Century church--remained completely intact. We're asked to believe that a 40's era mission hospital in an African village had steaming hot showers. We're left with no explanation why there is only one patient in the hospital for the whole duration of the movie when, apparently, children were dying outside. Anyone who cared by was left wondering who the demon was but, truly, by that point in the film most people really couldn't care less.Most of all, we're left wondering how someone could give such a serious performance in such a silly film. Bad writing, very bad computer animation and complete absence of continuity left me feeling like the two past hours would have been better spent watching reruns of the final episodes of Charles in Charge.Oh yeah, no cheap Hollywood propaganda piece would be complete without the obligatory "White man killing 'peaceful' natives" motif. There was absolutely nothing redeeming about this film--pun intended. Whereas the very disturbing masochism scenes in the original Exorcist at least had thematic value, similar scenes in this film just seemed gratuitous. It was a cheap attempt to create a visual link to the original film and, to me anyway, gave it even less credibility to claim the name of the original.If you haven't watched this movie, don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the sequels, but not as good as original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course we know of this film's origins: from the project that would of had John Frankenheimer at the helm and Liam Neeson as the lead, to the "not gory enough" Paul Schrader version, to the one I'm reviewing now. While its history is more confusing than Memento, it is still a very good, somewhat underrated picture. A lot reviewers go into this film expecting the original, but have a feeling of being let down; I did not feel this way. This movie is way better than the sequels: the laughable Exorcist II:The Heretic and the OK, but silly Exorcist III. I'll start out with the gore; yes, the infamous gore. This movie would have been a rare NC-17 film, but even with the cuts, this film is quite gory. If you do not like rotting corpses or still born-ed, maggot covered babies, do not watch this film. The gore is not over the top; it is really realistic. Next is the story: this is an inspirational story--thought horror movies couldn't be that, huh? Yes, Father Merrin of the first film has lost his faith, but in a moment worthy of a whole book, he finds it. It flows well, no real pacing flaws or any confusing plot points. Overall, a very fulfilling story. The acting is very good for the short term notice filming of this film. The sound is good, but the music leaves a little to be desired (no Tubular Bells.) And the rewatchability is quite high.So, if you are going to watch this movie, watch it with an open mind. Don't expect the classic 1973 film.I give this film 9 rabid hyenas out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again the Hollywood producers are proved wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the Hollywood producers dismissed Paul Schrader's original version and hired Renny Harlin to direct it instead they proved two things. They are often wrong when it comes to picking good movies and that Renny Harlin shouldn't be allowed to make more films. He have never made a good movie. Here he manages to take a good story and good actors and make a very poor film. He uses blood, gore and easy scares desperate trying to make it scary but he fails totally. The acting in the film isn't good either but perhaps it's due to being forced to re-shoot most of the film with an uninspiring director. This is an example of why producers should't be allowed to interfere with the creative process. The only good thing coming out of this film is that it was so bad and did so lousy in the box office that the producers actually decided to allow Paul Schrader to finish and release his version of the film called Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist. See that movie instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was raised to hold my tongue if I had nothing nice to say... But this time I have to SCREAM!!! 1) Today's movies at $12.00 a pop, you want to think a little harder about seeing just anything. I read mixed reviews on here about it so I took a gamble and lost big.2) The original "Exorcist" is one of the scariest movies of all time. And besides that, it was a damn good movie, had all the right ingredients. Yet it's sequels and prequels or whatever you want to call them, don't even deserve to be mentioned.3) Let's start with the premise in "the Beginning". A very good idea that had a chance to be somewhat of a decent movie if done right but instead, it struck out looking on 3 pitches. This movie should've never made it out of the story room. One has to wonder how many decent scripts were passed over for this disaster.4) The original Exorcist (movie) happened to the girl next door while this movie took place mostly in Africa, where most people would never go. Kinda hard to be scared there, but with the right ideas, that could've been solved.5) The special effects, were terribly substandard. Period. 90% of the movies dialog was barely above a whisper with frequent "Smashcuts" of loud music with 3 second gore shots. Whomever invented this "effect" including all those who employ it should be severely kneecapped! 6) Cheap, trite, dry, predictable formula plot with gaping holes and no real twists. Problems were left unsolved and MANY things were unexplained. The movie starts out interesting then flat lines till the end. And the end was no prize either. After the first 7/8th's of this movie, it ALMOST had you routing for the devil! 7) The characters where VERY uninteresting. However, the main character did a decent job but as a show of respect to him and his craft, I will not mention his name here. I am guessing a man with his talents got side winded into this project by political forces beyond him. Therefore I am guessing that he probably wishes not to have his name mentioned with this mess.8) I could go on and on and on but I think by now you get the point. This movie was not scary, it was not even interesting. It was a waste. A waste of time a waste of talent but mostly a waste of money. Flops like this cost not only millions of dollars in this one movie but the loss of money for better scripts that could've been made into better movies, WITH THE SAME TALENT! *** If the subject of exorcism interests you, get the book "HOSTAGE TO THE DEVIL", by the Malachi Martin. Martin, was a Jesuit priest who took five separate exorcisms and detailed them (graphically). This book will grab you by the neck and spin your head around! I read the first three stories and had to stop. Too scary! I am going to read the last two stories on the steps of St. Patrick's cathedral in broad daylight just in case. You Hollywood producers can learn a lot from Fr. Martin's book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the slow, but powerful prequel to the head spinning, vomit spewing and vulgar ranting original THE EXORCIST(1973). Following World War II, Father Lancaster Merrin(Stellan Skarsgard)stands in remote Kenya haunted by tragic memories of war that has caused him to leave his faith and immerse himself in alcohol and the avocation of archeology. A mysterious find is discovered in the plains of East Africa and Father Merrin is drawn to the excavation of a church that appears to have been buried the day it was finished being built.Merrin befriends a young boy who is as frightened as the rest of the superstitious villagers that fear entering the buried church. Merrin and young Father Francis(James D'Arcy)enter the violated church. Merrin begins to regain his faith as he digs below the church's foundation to find a crypt and encounters the unspeakable evil of the demon Pazuzu. Evil possesses a young woman(Izabella Scorupco)and Merrin knows that a hellish fight is in order.The sensational gore and violence of the original is really missing from this film. A few scenes will bring about a jerk and a jump, but expectations will not be met. Also in the cast: Ben Cross, Alan Ford, Remy Sweeney and Julian Wadham.</fullReview>

Regan got the scars on her face from Holy Water being thrown on her...Sarah just appears in the next scene with them! OK. The film makers must think they are making this movie for Ritalin-addicted 10 year olds. Ridiculous, and that ain't the worst. I had high hopes, but as usual they were dashed....honestly, star-wise its about a two or three stars worth at most...you would be better-off renting something else besides this garbage.BUT - but if you're a big Exorcist fan like me you need to see it, so go blow your money and then come back here and slam it or love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist for the Slipknot generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is possibly the greatest horror film ever made. Released in 1972, it still retains the power to shock and disturb; other films have generated controversy since, but none have featured a 13 year-old girl masturbating with a crucifix and screaming about Jesus' cock. Seemingly influenced by rubbish Hollywood blockbusters Tomb Raider and The Mummy, Renny Harlin has directed an ill-advised prequel to William Friedkin's masterpiece (the power of cash compels him). This is The Exorcist for the Slipknot generation,Disillusioned by Nazi atrocities, Father Lankester Merrin temporarily loses his faith and becomes an archaeologist. When excavating in Africa, he is alerted to the site of a long-buried church to investigate strange occurrences; doors slam, beds mysteriously shake and sacrilegious images inspired by rubbish death-metal albums are unearthed. The plot is gradually possessed by the spirit of a Channel 5 action film. Father Merrin is implausibly reinvented as an Indiana Jones-style adventurer, with his cool, wisecracking dialog and dick-swinging walk. His "Merrin... Father Merrin!" payoff is cringeworthy. The conclusion unwisely evokes the exorcism of Regan MacNeil from the first film, albeit with an older, lankier embodiment of Satan; but somehow a middle-aged, menopausal woman, bleeding and swearing, doesn't seem particularly shocking or unexpected.Curiously, the initial script was written by Paul Schneider, apparently with a 'more cerebral, philosophical approach' to horror, but Warner Brothers, pessimistic about the box-office appeal of an intelligent, thoughtful film, asked Helin (Deep Blue Sea) to re-write the story with evil super-hyenas and comedy-tramps. Rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched "Exorcist, the Beginning". Which was only aptly named because for the first 1/3 of the movie, it felt like it was constantly the very beginning, in that absofuckinglutely nothing happened.I don't think even subliminally planted demons like in the original Exorcist could have made this movie scary.They pretty much took every cliché out there, and ran with it... Straight into a brick wall.I mean, you think that with two sequels to the original, that with a name as presumptuous as "The Beginning", they'd actually go somewhere with it. But no, the movie was essentially the equivalent of asking "Which came first, the chicken or the egg?" and then being shown a hen lay an egg, and then watching that egg hatch and grow back into a hen.Utter waste of time.

		<fullReview>It is safe to say, with this debacle, the Exorcist title has been exhausted. I hate to say it, but I had somewhat high expectations for this film. I went to two different video stores and almost purchased a copy (yikes, what a waste of $20 that would have been). I absolutely loved the original and thought, "Hey, its 2005, how bad could the prequel be?" TERRIBLE!!!! Just as I was about to write this review I sat and tried to think of one, just one, redeeming quality in this movie. Originality?-nope, acting?-nuh uh, effects?-guess again, script?-forget about it. In fact, I couldn't think of one thing what would justify a half-way decent rating. The only reason I didn't rate it lower is because; I SHOULD HAVE KNOW BETTER!!! Okay, as if poorly CGI'ed Hyenas ripping a little kid to pieces while everyone watches wasn't bad enough; they also decided to include a stillborn baby crawling with maggots and a toddler being blown to bits by none other the NAZI'S. Not only that but the sheer implausibility of the story is enough to make anyone with two brain cells say, "um, what?" Okay, so the Catholic Church built and buried an entire church, replete with marble statues and lithographs, then buried it completely?oh yeah did I mention it was 500 AD? Did they have shovels in 500 AD? GARBAGE!!!!! What ever happened to good old fashioned horror movies? Movies that didn't rely upon gore and terrible effects, but actually had some semblance of a plot, is that too much to ask for? I wish Hollywood stop spewing this trash and try to be original. Don't waste your time?I give it a 2.</fullReview>

Often when such graphics are generated the movement is very artificial and the viewers attention goes to that while the feeling he/she is supposed to have get's lost in the process.This movie is very disappointing for the people who are expecting something that gives them the same thrill as the first one or movies like "the ring","the eye" or the "grudge" because there is no comparing. Even so I recommend this movie because it will give more understanding to the "history" of the first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning it wasn't subtle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood studios don't have a clue about what is an original idea. Sure. They resurrect old hits from yesterday just to recover the money they lose with trends like idolatry of stars. True. Exorcist: The Beginning is a bad movie because is a prequel of an immortal classic and the main reason of its existence is pay the mansions of "big fishes" of Morgan Creek. Exorcist: The Beginning is not necessarily a bad movie.Sit in the director's chair is Renny Harlin well known for movies like Die Hard 2 and Deep Blue Sea. Harlin handled his career in a more than acceptable way with the exception of Cutthroat Island (a disaster-piece that we must avoid name in public). Most people yelled at the word of Harlin directing this movie "How they put a action director in a movie like this one???" By now the people that thought that way must think the same thing after the final results. But this is not a mix of action and horror. It is a horror movie that feeds back from the 1973 classic and has it own tone. Some may hate it, some may think it is fine. But ETB does have horror. But the way of approaching to genre is not subtle at all and maybe some people will be disappointed at that point.The film has its strong points in the virulent attack against Christian iconography, the suspense, great lead actors as Stellan Skarsgard and Izabella Scorupco delivering the goods, the absolute genius that is cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, music from Trevor Rabin (probably the best music heard in a horror movie since Goblin's tunes). The movie starts with a powerful and shocking flashback and takes some time to present the real conflict, this time is used to develop some subplots and dig in Merrin's past. The now infamous CGI is used in difficult camera angles, and not much else. And also the computer graphics are used to create some creatures, considering that they were used for one of the crueler and most memorable scenes (and this scene helps to fortify the strong and perturbing tone of E:TB) the use of this technology is justified . This film is closer to the original Exorcist than the sequels of the franchise, Part 2: The Heretic (by far the worst sequel of any kind) and Part 3: Legion (it had good ideas but lacked in surprises and grandeur).</fullReview>

But after I left the theater i found myself quit satisfied. The movie starts off very slow. The second half is much better.MY SINCERE AND HONEST ADVICE TO ALL WHO WANT TO MAKE CULT HORRORs Do not use special fx and cgi. Its just cripples the over all effect of the whole movie. Instead use good makeup and story. Blaire witch project, evil dead, exorcist and many other movies did not need these FX. Even if used they are unnoticeable.The whole story of exorcist tells you one thing. It was made for financial income. The studio must having a bad time and thought of harping on the Exorcist fame. Since the writing credits go to william peter blatty, i assume he was forced to write it for financial gains.Their are just so many things which are inexplicable and you would never know why it is so. Or some one here can please tell me. Why was she after the boy? what was so special about the boy? It could have been anyone. And since it was not the Boy. How come the hyena's did not attack him?Some of the humour and pun used was not needed. As far as i remember their is not a single line in the original which would make you smirk. every line should make the character stronger and tell us more about him. Yes characterization was crap. If you see Father merrin in the original is a completely different person than in this movie. Again you can argue that the prequel incident made him so. But i just can't relate him to the original Old Man Merrin played extrafabulously by Max Von Sydow.The camera angles should have been more realistic. In the original it was always shown from a viewable pov making it more realistic. and not some dynamic crane shots and zooms they should have been avoided in this prequel.The kid was used to have some relating factor between the original and this prequel. But he is no match to Linda Blair.there are just soo many cons in this whole movie. it just doesn't come to even being an average flick. Its just a wannabe.I don't think there's a reason anyone should see this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Underrated Effective Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was afraid this film would be somewhat too contrived and convoluted, as practically every sequel/prequel of every film (horror in particular) has proved to be. "Exorcist: The Beginning" defied my dismal expectations and delivered handily many edge-of-your-seat thrills, unfettered terror, and a genuinely creepy story. The gist of the plot is this: a former priest who has lost his faith is assigned to uncover mysterious articles and resolve tremors of a reserve in Africa. This is a plenty interesting story, believe me, as the film, rather than remaining stagnant, tepid, and devoid of horror, constructs some brilliant, genuinely horrifying sequences (e.g. upside- down crucified bodies, beasts brutally attacking little boys, raucous chanting to unleash spirits from possessed man, etc.). There are plenty of scares for this potentially silly and tedious premise to qualify as an effective and engaging horror. Admittedly, the ending is rather implausible (even for a film of phenomenons), borrows heavily from the original, and is quite predictable, regardless of how technically tricky the director devises it. Perhaps this might even be somewhat outdated for fans of contemporary "slasher" horror (which, in my opinion, should rather be classified as comedy), yet fans of the original "Exorcist" and moviegoers who can stomach the sordidness and extremity of true horror films will be pleasantly surprised, as was I, in this effective, chilling movie. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

It has a lot of parts that leave you wishing you brought and extra pair of pants to the theater with you. However, its a different kind of movie than the first and this can be good or bad, it just depends how you take it.First though, I thought some very good performances were turned in in this movie. Father Merrin, is one of the most solid characters I've seen even though sometimes he seems almost superhuman. The other characters are believable as well, but I did have a hard time with the young priest, he almost seemed out of place to me.This movie is NOT like the original. It is more of a horror picture full of blood and guts (literally) and uses a lot of jump out and scare you tactics. If you look at it like this, it is a success. I found myself jumpin quite a bit. But it lacks the psychological aspect that made the original so entertaining. There was not a whole lot of religion in this but it is VERY intense and I was on edge the whole time. I did like this movie and do recommend but have 2 complaints: 1.) like I said, it lacked the psychological thriller aspect of the original, and 2.) the music from the original wasn't in this one. But it is a good movie and will scare you, a lot. 6/10</fullReview>

In any event, Father Merrin returns to the big screen after 31 years. William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' has a brief reference to an exorcism in Africa performed by Merrin that nearly killed him. Was that the sole inspiration for this prequel? Whatever, that's not a bad clothesline for a story. The studio fired original director Paul Schrader and peed on his final cut, then gave action hack Renny Harlin some bucks to make it louder, bloodier, and undoubtedly a lot less intelligent.And it's not very good either. On the other hand, I seemed to have more...ahem...faith in this movie than others. It's not worth your money, but the mano a devilo sequence in the climax is crazy crap...and I enjoyed it. If you're going to make nutty good/evil movies, why NOT let it hang out? What we've got here is a Gothic-religious horror show. It's not very scary, but it ALMOST works as a Satan-bashing thriller. Clunky, yes, but not without appeal. The censors must have had fun rating this one. There's blood and gore dripping everywhere.So a younger Merrin (the stoic Stellan Skarsgard) does what he did for Friedkin in 1973 and tries to save a kid from the Devil. Satan's surrogates, the Nazis, put him through chilling psychological horrors in WWII. Just like Karras in the original 'Exorcist', he's lost faith. On a archaeological dig in Kenya, he encounters the supposed spot where Satan fell after the war in Heaven. Neat. Soon, it's Pazuzu versus Merrin in Round 1. We know who wins Round 2, so who do you think will win Round 1? Suspense...killing...me.Truth? It's trash and there's a cheap WTF reversal regarding just who's possessed. No major player from any of the other 3 'Exorcist' movies worked on this one. Perhaps they didn't want to be in a movie with such awful F/X. Harlin's 'Deep Blue Sea' sharks were foolish, but those digital beasts were still chilling. With hyenas that came straight from a Commodore 64, the beasts in 'Exorcist: The Beginning' are absurd when they're supposed to be scary. At least the movie gets to its base good/evil core in the hellish climax. And avert your eyes, Christians, because there's a sick upside-down free-for-all at the very beginning. At least 'Exorcist' fans might get something out of this. In fact, they might give the same "it could've been worse" review that I've just given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected, a fun ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about the disaster of a film Exoricst: The Beginning had become, with making the film twice, and having it's stars back off the production, I really thought this film was going to be a huge pile of junk. Then the kick ass trailers came out, and I got kind of excited. Soon after, the film is coming out in a week, and I hear that Warner Brothers has decided not to screen the film for press, which is always a bad sign. I decided the film was crap at that point. But yesterday comes, and critics reviews and audience reviews come out. The critics are giving it some of the worst grades of the year, while the average movie going attendant is saying the film is scary, creepy, and generally, just a good movie.So I convinced myself to see it, and I did. I'm still surprised at how good it is. Right from the very beginning, there's this amazing shot of a bunch of dead people all over the ground, for miles, and it's one of those cliché shots that starts of real close, and backs out. You know it. But it's really great.The whole films looks like that. I'm mean not at lot of that same cliché shot, although there were a few of those, the films just looks great. It takes place in the 40s, and looks it. But there was just something about it. The Gothic look. It's just awesome. The acting isn't anything special. It's not bad, not great, just acceptable I guess. The story is decent. It's been done before, but it was all right. It's pretty much about Father Merrin who goes to Africa to check out a church that had supposedly been built 1000 years before it's time. He finds some crazy things out, and some weird sh*t happens.It's a good time. It's visually appealing, and just fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first was a bit skeptical about seeing this type of film having any relation to "exorcism" but I went ahead and watched it anyway. Might I add that this film was really great and deserves a lot of extra credit for it's theme, actors and effects. When I first saw the original exorcist, it scared the boogers out of me, and then when this movie was on the market, I decided to rent the original again and just get a recap on the plot of the film. It was such a great horror film. Classic film! I'd be aware about bringing younger ones into this film, but I think some can handle it. I certainly would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good film and a something a little scary to make your hairs stand up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I need an exorcist to strike from my mind the pervasively wicked memory of this complete failure. Did it fail because it didn't live up to its namesake? Yes. Would it have failed as a lowly Lifetime Network kitchen movie? Yes? even if Valerie Bertinelli took the lead in glitter pasties.Allowing Renny Harlin to take the hallowed reins of such an impressive series (well 1 and 3 anyway) was as insensitive as casting Marky Mark in the unfaithful juvey comic book that was the remake of the Planet of the Apes. Renny doesn't 'do' English language, he does mindless action, he is a part of film internationalization. He makes films that the Japanese can watch even if no translation is provided. If he was still married to Geena Davis she would have had the female lead in this merciless piece of celluloid camel turd.What's more, hack Bill Wisher's derivative story (make a game out of naming the famous movies he stole scenes and major elements from-fun for the whole family) is so full of holes it whistles in a stiff breeze. That would be fine if I was watching Toxic Avenger goes Hawaiian or some such, but The Exorcist series has pedigree and deserved better than a script with no driving force. Almost nothing happens. Worse, in the original film father Merrin had previously encountered the devil (Pazuzu, dark lord of evil flying critters, whatever) and was a haunted man? Wisher drew the younger Merrin as being ALREADY haunted by his agonizingly never ending recollections of Nazis acting out a scene from Oscar winner Sophie's Choice, even before he'd encountered the devil in the first place, which kind of air balled the chance to show a character arc.Warm lighting, epic music cueing nothing in particular, and cheap thrills similar to 'CJOOC' (cats jumping out of closets) are only made worse when poorly layered CGI hyenas the size of steroid fed timber wolves make an appearance like some out of place Ray Harryhausen creatures from 60's Sinbad films.Before seeing this film I spoke with someone about William Friedkin's last minute decision to scrap the original Exorcist music theme in favor of Tubular Bells. That showed a subtle understanding for disparate elements aligning to create something unique and powerful. This 2004 filmic tragedy was weighed down by a score replete with typical Gregorian gravy, ambition less and formulaic to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No more simple minded muttering. This film is a very good, well done scary movie. It can be noticed, that the overall film-criticism does not do right and keep its filmographically righteous attitude. Perhaps the case of Paul Schrader has had some effects on that; but that is more politics than giving merits to a movie.Flick is pretty good, "well done", very good scary movie in its own genre;it keeps easily its suspense. bw IOL</fullReview>

Not even Vittorio Storaro's beautiful cinematography could salvage this travesty of a film. I heard people exclaiming, upon leaving the theatre, "That's the worst movie I've ever seen."

After about 30 minutes or so the movie gets going ! It will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end ! Also, the famous voice from the first one of the devil makes a return in this one and will make your hair stand stand up ! Defintally go out and see this ! There also a few parts that come off as funny and almost everyone in the theater will be laughing out loud ! And the special effects aren't to shabby either.

		<shortDescription>A complete mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Warning: Possible SPOILERS *** First my perspective:I'm not a long time fan of the original. It wasn't until the early 80's that I saw the Exorcist as a teenager. I liked it more when I saw it as an adult and really liked the re-release on the big screen. The sequels didn't do anything to make the impression better (though III had it's moments).That being said, this story of a disillusioned Father Merrin is a complete mess. After a poorly handled opening scene of a bloodied battlefield, we are given the basic rundown. It is shortly after WWII (1949 I don't recall for sure). An old Byzantine church has turned up in a part of Africa, and it has been dated to a time before Christianity should have reached that part of the world. Merrin, who gave up being a priest during the war because of atrocities he was a witness, and unwilling participant of have made him renounce his faith.What will happen to make Merrin return to the cloth? What secrets does this old church hold?It means that there will a LOT of cheap scares, bad CGI and matte painting, a couple of really gross set pieces and a final exorcism that has been injected with a bit of World Wrestling Entertainment style "pizazz". In other words, nothing scary or creepy, or worthy of bearing the name The Exorcist.The big problem is that the movie is trying to go in three different directions at once, and doesn't pick one path. Instead, it tries to be all things to all horror fans, and fails miserably at making anyone happy.It's not a psychological thriller, which both the original and III had to different degrees.It's not an all out gore fest, for those who love Romero, early Raimi and the such.It's not a sprawling epic that suggests an otherworldly evil that could threaten the world as a whole, either.In the end I came out neither scared, chilled or disturbed on a emotional level, which is why this is ultimately a huge failure as a horror film.It has to be said that Stellan Skarsg?rd did an excellent job as Merrin, even with a terrible script. None of the actors can be faulted here. Most of the blame lies squarely on the shoulders of the studio and the "writing team", and a slightly smaller portion rests with Renny Harlin.I knew that there was another version shot and subsequently scrapped by the studio. If that ever sees the light of day, it sounds like it would have been a much better movie. After all, studio did can it for being "too cerebral". Imagine that, a smart horror movie. I thought they gave up on that a decade ago (with few exceptions).Oh well, save your money.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chickens... and uncreative Studio Heads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "idea" behind this movie was a good one: Dive into Father Merrin's life before the final showdown and allow all of us to have an idea of what led up to the climatic battle. There are YEARS in here folks and all those years lead up to what we've seen in "The Exorcist".Now..if I was a studio executive, I'd say: "Nice idea." But I would also go into this knowing that NOTHING would match the original version. In knowing that, I would try my damnest to make a film worthy to be -- at least a companion -- to the original. Exorcist IV: The Beginning's problem isn't with Director Renny or Director Schrader ... or wonderful actor Stellan or potential actor Liam as Merrin or even (gasp) the script ... I find fault with the greedy, stupid, uncreative, money grubbing studio head(s), et al., which made a potential idea into a royal mess .... all for box office receipts.Yes, I am a fan of both the original film "The Exorcist" and it's book. And I am going to put forth a logical thought for all to consider:I remember when a great deal of people seen the original Exorcist ... their comment was that they HATED the opening Middle East scenes. Do you all remember that? Many folks wanted it taken out for they claimed "It didn't make sense" and/or "It was boring". But, it DOES make sense. It IS important. Look at the NAME of the film/book -- it wasn't called "Reagan's Life" or "Father Damien's Loss of Faith" it was called "The Exorcist". There IS a reason for that and it lies in that opening scene in the movie ... and the book.Okay -- 30 years later, here was a chance to actually explore this -- and this movie fell flat and went the way of sloppiness and FORMULA -- because the darned studio head wanted to make it "more horrific". Come on folks, join with me, and let's put the problem where the problem sits.I haven't seen Mr. Schrader's version (and I too would like to) but in saying that I am going to stand up for both Mr. Schrader and Mr. Harlin in saying just this: Directors need to be independent of money grubbing studio heads who want to CONTROL film projects. Shame on them!In 1973 when the original Exorcist film premiered, you had a Director and Screenwriter/Author who delivered a film with experimentation, real horror; a real conveyance of Christian Faith (pro and con), one hell of a hands on make up artist (Dick Smith) without the benefit of CGI, a post production crew that deserves very accolade they've received, actors who weren't household names that worked under interesting conditions to say the least... all which added to make the film get under your skin. Here you have a franchise interested in making money off the original name. No experimentation, nothing new. Just "bring in the bucks". How sad. Sad for Cinema. Sad for the idea of why "The Exorcist" was written and brought to screen in the first place.One more point I must make and that is my use of the word "Chicken". I call James G. Robinson Jr. a chicken because anyone who KNOWS the original Exorcist - Film or Book - knows this one thing about the Exorcist, Father Merrin: His initial contact with this..and the traveling bevy of souls..was with an 8 year old boy. I call Robinson a PC chicken for NOT doing what was laid out. In 1973, EVERYONE involved took a gamble (and subsequently got reamed!) for casting the 12 year old Linda Blair as a 12 year old possessed child. Yes, there was the lovely Eileen Dietz on hand -- but it was 12 year old Linda who DID a great deal of the project.Here, they chickened out BIG time which makes the film utterly disappointing, a waste of time and money, the time and efforts of two directors, and a wonderful actor as Father Merrin. Exorcist IV: The Beginning was a good time just waiting to happen ... and sadly, we're all still waiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me confront the terrible CGI, because it was just that. Terrible. The hyenas in The Exorcist were almost as bad as the wolves in The Day After Tomorrow. The dialogue was so dull and boring, I had to make up things for them to say so the movie would actually be mildly entertaining. Also, the scare factor... well... there was no scare factor. It was awful. I mean, I will give credit to the original Exorcist for being just a bit creepy. But during Exorcist: The Beginning, I just laughed whenever someone got killed. Why was this even released to theaters? It's like some really bad TBS made-for-TV movie. Compared to the original, this movie is a horrible embarrassment. Did they even watch this movie after they made it? I can't see how they did. Perhaps they were intoxicated?Wow. It really was one of the year's worst. I can't get over how bad it was. Renny Harlin needs to stop. Who pays him to make this garbage? I was really hoping one of those damn crows would fly out of the screen and peck me to death. I would have been a lot more satisfied with death. I didn't feel attached to the characters... In fact, I wanted them to die. I hated this movie, and I even went in with low expectations. It was trash.Laughable trash. If I weren't an atheist, I would think it possible that this film came straight to us from the depths of hell. I just want to save people from watching it, that's all. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a truly disappointing film. I enjoy movies very much and Exorcist is truly one of the great horror films. However this prequel did nothing to live up to the legacy. It's not too often that I actually go to the theater, opting instead to enjoy my viewing at home. I wish I had stuck with my formula. It didn't take long to realize that I was ripped off. I was most disappointed with the unnecessary use of CGI. I've seen better effects in video game graphics. There was nothing scary about this film. One scene did elicit a jump out of the audience. This was not out of fright but out of a well timed increase in the noise level. The dialogue was stilted and disjointed. The plot was nearly absent. There was no dialogue between Merrin and Pazuzu which I felt would have really made the movie. I had hoped that there would have been something that set the scene for the original, but no. Instead, this film merely pandered to the worst in film audiences by using foul language and sexual innuendo instead of looking to chill us to the marrow as the original so aptly did. Maybe I'm just jaded now because the success of the Exorcist spawned so many other films, but I don't think so. I had hoped for something original and frightening but was completely disappointed. If you want to be scared, go to the video store and pick up the original Exorcist and Exorcist III. You'll have an entire evening of spooky thrills for the price of this stinker. Oh yeah, and you won't have to put up with all of the idiots who feel the need to talk back to the screen and won't shut off their cell phones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING tonight, I have come to this conclusion.I want to see Schrader's version.This, the Renny Harlin version, is a boring Exploitive gore fest with so many stupid horror cliches it made me shudder, not from horrific shock, but from the realization that someone still uses those cheesy 80's horror film techniques. Instead of a well researched, and interesting piece that delves into faith, mythlogy and the occult, we get predicatble scenes of terror and gore, and pointless deaths of people in brutal ways. He also uses children in a manner in this film that is meant to shock, but it comes up very flat. This film was a disapointment, and it cannot even be mentioned in the same breath as "The Exorcist". It, however, can be mentioned in the same breath as "The Exorcist II", I think. I can't wait to see Schrader's version on DVD, just to compare the two. I don't think Schrader's film will be the Holy Grail, but after viewing this film tonight, I would like another option.1.5 Stars out of 4----- See it if you want typical horror scares, not psychological suspense thrills. ----------</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I did not expect this movie to be the masterpiece the original was, I did hope that like Exorcist III, it would be fun to watch. What I saw was a plot less disaster in which I spent the entire second half waiting for Bruce Campbell to step out from behind a rock. (I love Evil Dead by the way.) This film was completely flat, with the only action being lame attempt after lame attempt to shock the audience rather than being for the benefit of the characters or the story. (I did not witness any shock among my fellow viewers; many did laugh out loud at key moments though.) It is apparent that Renny Harlin took every foolish 80's horror movie stereotype he could think of and infused it with crappy special effects. It is hard to write this without using clichés like gratuitous, cheesy, contrived, or STUPID- as they all fit so well. I do have to give credit to the actors, especially Stellan Skarsgard, whose ability to act so well in the middle of this atrocious mess is truly extraordinary. So in conclusion, I highly advise against seeing this movie in spite of the acting- since Skarsgard is also in the Shrader version, let's all pick up the DVD to support him and hope for the best. (I truly believe it could be no worse.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw exorcist the beginning last night and although I really enjoyed the first hour and a half,the last part sucked and ruined the experience for me.There were some frightening moment sin the film and it seemed to be building up suspense until the exorcism part at the end.I was offended by how pathetic the twist in the story was making Sarah(the doctor) the one possessed instead of Joseph(the African boy),because from what I remember from the original exorcist film, it talked about Merrin exorcising a possessed African boy and it damn near killed him. I thought this new movie took the original one and just destroyed it. The way they showed the climax of Sarah being possessed was laughable and not scary at all.The fake looking special effects,makeup,and cheap looking contact lenses were a joke.It reminded me a lot of the movie "repossessed", the comedy from 1990 starring Linda Blair. It would have been a lot more exciting if they had shown Joseph transform slowly into the demon like Reagan in the original film.And then shown a very terrifying,powerful and frightening exorcism at the end that nearly kills Merrin.In this version Merrin doesn't even seem affected by it all.The performance was emotionless and not believable.The ending was so bad I nearly walked out of the movie.It's too bad because it had so much potential and started out really good.I liked everything else about it except for the incredibly bad exorcism of Sarah,and the dialogue of the demon was so cheezy that I found it an irritating way to end what could have been a great film.Now I can't wait to see the other version of this film that "Skarsgard" made when it goes to DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed in this movie. Yes, I agree I went in with high expectations, however these expectations were quashed 15 min into the movie. The graphics were done badly (for the most part), the gore in the movie was over played, and the use of foul language sounded corny.For all the hype that was created over this movie it fell seriously short. The story is good however the movie did nothing for the story. I feel that if you watch it blindfolded you might get better graphics from you own imagination. I was not aware there was another version done by another director but will be sure to get a copy hopefully this one is worth bearing the name Exorcist any where in the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No soul to steal (SPOILER -- BEWARE)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went with a group tonight and we ended up at "Exorcist -- The Beginning" because the two movies we intended to see were sold out. The "beginning" lacked entirely was connections between souls -- the kind of connections that, when Satan appears, are destroyed but still needed. That's what really resonated in the original.In "The Beginning", you don't get the sense that anybody cares deeply about what happens to anyone else. This diminished the power of the possession itself. Technically this movie had a dated look with sub-par effects. The beginning of the movie created interest, the middle seemed designed to see how many times loud noises could make you jump, and the finale was amazingly non-dramatic. If this were completely dissociated from "The Exorcist" franchise, I would give it 4 of 10; comparing it to the standard of the original, which is admittedly higher than a typical movie, is probably not fair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the least entertaining of all the Exorcist movies. I give it a C-. If it wasn't an "Exorcist" film it'd be C+. It wasn't horrible, but not very good either. The acting was decent enough but the movie overall didn't quite cut it. It's a real shame too, seemed like a good premise, nice sets too. But there was only 1 fairly disturbing moment in it. The score was okay but there was way overused defusing any scares that might have occurred. Also, when is Hollywood going to realize that digital effects just don't work, especially in a horror movie. Even "Exorcist II - The Heretic" was scarier (and that's saying something!). To me the first "Exorcist" movie is one of the best, scariest horror films ever, but in these politically correct times I doubt we'll see the likes of any big budget movies with that kind of visceral impact ever again. Leave your barf bag at home for this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kinda expected a lame duck prequel - judging from the trailers and the studio's refusal to preview it for movie critics. The director's name should have clued in everybody run to the hills.At what point did movie makers fail to see the difference between true horror and plain disgusting gore? I never understood movies like 'Hellraiser' and 'Event Horizon' where we were expected to be scared with all the gore. No - what it ended up doing was grossing out everyone in the name of horror.Harlin does not disappoint - true to form, he commits a 'hara-kiri' on Friedkin's masterpiece, forever (hopefully) putting an end to any other foolhardy director's attempts to resurrect this franchise!The movie is replete with painful scenes of children being horrifically assaulted - if he thinks this makes his movie scary - boy, where is Hollywood headed to?My advice - don't waste your money in the theaters or even renting this steaming pile of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And the sad thing is, I don't think that it's even worthy of pressing on a disc. The plot is completely ridiculous, and BORING. By the time you get to the scary( and I use that term loosely) part, you are so mad that you wasted almost two hours of your life, that you are wishing God would somehow give the lost time back. The acting was OK, but the script was a joke. They tried to use some low budget cgi green screen in the final scene where the main character is walking allegedly near the Vatican, except it looks so fake it makes the local weatherman on the five o'clock news look high tech. I heard that on the DVD they are going to include the other version they shot of this piece of crap. If it was worse than this, whoa. In conclusion, I think that the makers of this film should be blackballed from Hollywood forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disgusting and not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a big disappointment. I thought it was going to be somewhat like the original, but there was not a whole lot of suspense and it was way too gory. With the original, you saw the demon manifest itself in the girl and how this affected her mother; it was more about emotions than people dying violent deaths. I did not need to see a boy being eaten by hyenas (which seemed to take a very long time)and corpses being eaten by vultures. The story was kind of boring; there was no buildup and the movie was slow to get to the point and the ending was very cheesy. The best part was Stellan Skarsgaard. He did a very good job showing Father Merrin's pain from his past. I felt a lot of compassion for his character. On the whole, this movie is not very good. Renny Harlin did the original Exorcist a disservice. In that movie, you could feel the evil by just looking at the girl and the atmosphere; you didn't need gore. I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone involved with the writing of this film ever....oh, I don't know...WATCH THE ORIGINAL? Or maybe, perhaps, READ THE BOOK?! I'm a projectionist and watched the film last night to check the print for factory splices, bad reels, etc, and, as a fan of both the book and the film versions of The Exorcist, I was deeply disappointed with the absolute disregard paid to Blatty's work.The CGI was substandard, the compositing left a lot to be desired...I mean, this felt as if it should have been released direct-to-video or - if it weren't for the gore added in post - it could have almost been a TV movie.(How in the world did that guy get a leather impression of something that's buried deep inside the church, and has not been seen in a millennium and a half?)And the ending. The ending is the worst part. I won't spoil it for those gluttons of punishment who are still going to see the movie, but it is the least thought out, most moronic ending ever...and it doesn't help that it goes against what was already written or shown about Merrin's work in Africa.The always-incredible Stellan Skarsgard was perfect as Merrin...except, I was wondering where his accent went. I expected a thicker Swedish accent to match his countryman, Max Von Sydow, from the original.It seemed as though most of the crew was really working hard for the film. Too many extreme close-ups with no emotionDo yourself a favour...watch the original again. Avoid this drivel. Or, watch The Heretic again...by comparison, The Heretic is better (ignoring the flashy light hypnosis.) I don't know how Exorcist: The Beginning can get a vote tally of 7 point whatever when the movie hasn't even opened yet. The voters either work for Warner Bros or haven't seen the original film.Ugh. So bad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all that talk in 1973's "The Exorcist" about Father Merrin's previous encounter with demonic possession in Africa, it certainly wasn't going to be forgotten by the folks at Warner Bros. there was a potential thriller there. John Boorman covered some of that ground in flashbacks for "Exorcist II: The Heretic" in 1977, but this full-blown prequel should satisfy die-hard "Exorcist" fans, if nobody else. In post-WWII Egypt, Merrin has turned his back on the church and become an archaeologist; during an expedition in Kenya, he encounters demonic hyenas, a possessed child, ritualistic murders, and lots of flies. Working from a paper-thin script (which cobbles together images copied from the original "Exorcist", along with several other horror films), director Renny Harlin is reverent to the classic predecessor without knowing how to give his picture any personality of its own. Dark and dour, and weighed down further with perpetually glum and exhausted Stellan Skarsg?rd as Merrin, the film's incidental pleasures are purely unintentional. The director of cinematography goes positively bonkers with his close-ups of liquor and water glasses, and Harlin himself stoops to the lowest form of thriller clichés with fake scares, dream scenes, oozing sores, doors opening and closing by themselves, upside-down crucifixes...everything but the real "Exorcist"'s panache. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never wanted to see this movie in the first place, but I watched it with my roommate (who, oddly enough, wants to be a priest). As I expected, it sucked. There is not a single scary moment (unless you are scared by the 800 scenes of doors slamming shut), but there is plenty of gratuitous gore that is sure to leave you feeling slightly nauseous. It's about as meaningful and theologically challenging as "Cannibal Holocaust." Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow you to vote 0/10 stars, so I have to think of a reason it is deserving of 1 star. Well, the acting was good. And I will admit that the premise is intriguing (a church built on the spot where Satan fell to earth). With a completely different director and script, it could have been a good movie. It DID have these things, originally, but it sounds like Paul Schrader's version was canned because he attempted to make a movie with some actual depth. Since that sort of thing is frowned upon these days, the acclaimed director Renny Harlin had to step in and touch it up with things like a maggot-infested dead baby and repeated scenes of a girl getting shot in the head. Thanks, Renny. A little dose of bloody infanticide is just what was needed to make this movie more appealing.1/10 stars. Sick, disgusting trash that didn't need to be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is there another Exorcist sequel? The first movie is one of the greatest movies of all time, if one of the most unsettling movie (I haven't seen the original in over 10 years). The second movie has to be one of the worst sequels ever with good actors looking absolutely confused. The third one is underrated, but still not as shocking as the original. The fourth movie is somewhere in between. The actors are capable, but this movie has no really compelling reason to exist. The stories about the movie's troubled production are probably more interesting than the movie itself. The movie looks good and has its moments but by the end it has gone into self parody. There are moments that are funnier than Linda Blair's spoof Repossessed. If you lower your expectations, this might be worth two hours of your time. It is certainly better than the over-hyped Constantine. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got the chance to check out this latest Exorcist incarnation tonight and walked away disappointed. Why, you ask? Because cheap scares and ominous imagery pelted with a generous amount of gore just can't make up for a completely broken plot line. Scream did better than this, and with more style. I really enjoyed the original Exorcist, and can't compare any of it's sequels directly to it; it's just impossible. But even judging this film as it stands alone, it is very reminiscent of many other Hollywood films lately: there is no intelligence in the script. I really jump all over atmosphere and an actual plot line in a film, and this movie has both. But when time after time characters do completely illogical things, direct about-faces in personal motivations without any emotional signals of the difficulty of a given choice, when there are countless instances of cheap tricks designed solely mislead the viewer while having no reference to the world in the film, well, c'mon, now you're in camp territory, even cheese.If you like watching movies where the flick feels the need for "scare" music to make sure you know when jump, this might be a good choice. There are a couple of noteworthy scenes, but mostly gristle and blood. Gorehounds might like this if they can skip to the good parts on DVD.Exorcist III was much better. Try again. (Or maybe you should well enough alone.)5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Exorcist movie was a masterpiece. The two sequels were garbage.Needless to say, I approached this movie with a great deal of hesitation because of the sequels. I was pleasantly surprised to be presented with a movie that rivaled the original.I saw Stellan Skarsg?rd in "King Arthur" and thought he was a good actor. Having seen him here, I think he's great. In addition, he was excellently typecast as Father Merrir; it's quite easy to look at him and visualize a younger Max von Sydow. The special effects are understated, just like the original, and just like in the original, they are tremendously effective because of that understatement.An excellent prequel. Throw away the sequels and content yourself with just this and the original Exorcist movie and you can't go wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifyingly Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a listless presentation of just about every horror movie cliché ever written. I counted three occasions where a gust of wind blows out a lantern, and then when it's re-lit, the person holding it turns around and sees something "scary." Except its not too scary when it becomes a cliché within the movie itself. Now that's tedious.To be fair Skarsgard struggles gamely with this profoundly uninspired script, and actually manages to breathe a little life into his role as Father Merrin. But no one else is allowed to rise above the level of one-dimensional stereotypes.Of course it wouldn't be an "Exorcist" movie without exorcism, and all I will say about that aspect of this movie is that "better" special effects actually weaken its impact. In the original Exorcist movie, we were actually afraid that poor little Regan was going to get hurt, if not maimed, by her contortions, but now the possessed twist and leap about with the elasticity and casual abandon that only computer generated graphics can provide.Frankly, every entry in the Exorcist except the original (which was one of the best horror movies of all time) has been really terrible, and maybe it's time to drive a wooden stake through the heart of this franchise.By the way at the time of writing this review, there were 14 votes, giving an average rating of 7.9. I just can't believe this happened honestly, and it will be interesting to see how the rating changes.</fullReview>

But all the thrills get lame after a while by repeating themselves and at the end you don't care anymore if a bed is shaking or who's really possessed. Renny Harlin gave us great popcorn-flicks and even the amazingly flopped Pirate-Experience was absolutely entertaining (and ahead of time). With "Exorzist - The Beginning" he just tried to live up to the expectations of everybody and forgot to be, well, just himself. Workwise. One can watch it , but you forget it quickly, once the DVD is over.I wonder if Schraders Version will be out soon, so one can compare...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when Renny Harlin was a pretty decent director. Of course, that was only for one film, Die Hard 2. Since then, his movies have gone down the hole, fast and hard.The first two-thirds of this movie was really pretty good. Decent suspense, good acting (especially by Skarsgard, most impressive). But once you find out who's been possessed, the movie is about as serious as "Monty Pyton's Flying Circus". The Monty Python crew probably could have done better, now that I think about it.This movie had the potential to be something better, but Renny Harlin and the blood-hungry producers ruined it all. A horror movie doesn't need blood to be scary. Want proof? Watch the original Exorcist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that tries to use Christianity as an object to create cheap scares and jumps. Renny Harlin is a director who should be truly embarrassed by the product he has created. It is a film with zero substance, but uses disgusting style to create endless violence. These are the types of films that truly desensitize today's younger population. I don't want to sound like and old grandmother saying that statement, but it is desensitization at its finest. The movie has ridiculous cinematography for the subject it is exploring and a truly sad performance by Stellan Skarsgard. His skilled acting in this film shows that he is the only person trying to create a good picture. The Passion of the Christ uses great film-making to create a truly moving experience. The film uses hard violence to make an important statement. Then there is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre that also uses hard violence but for the sake of entertainment. Then there is the Exorcist: The Beginning, a film that puts religion into the middle of an unentertaining and stupid film and puts a hell of a lot of violence for the sake of having violence.Many films have disgusted me throughout my movie-watching career, less have offended me, but I have never felt both offended and disgusted with the same film. Thank you Renny Harlin for wrecking my day.ZERO ? *****(5) (If only I could give negative ratings!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Exorcist", it its day, was truly shocking. Nothing like it had ever been seen before.I watched the original recently with a friend. It's a well-crafted film, based on a great story. So, with that in mind, when this DVD 'prequel' popped up in the local video store, we rented it.About half-an-hour into this film, we were still waiting for it to happen...The central character is a former priest who was allegedly traumatised enough to have lost his faith. He comes across more as a somnambulist, than anything else.At one stage, I did feel a little sympathy for the priest. This was due only to the war-time flashbacks, but they were repeated too much and lost their impact. It was very difficult to become involved with the characters, or care much about them.I had a bit of a laugh when the ex-priest was outdoors talking to an army officer in sunny Africa, with vapor coming from their mouths (as it does in cold weather). They must've been freezing, dressed in hot-weather clothing in chilly Italy (where the film was actually shot).More than an hour into the film, we paused to get a snack from the kitchen. When we came back, we accidentally hit the 'stop' button twice, taking us back to the beginning. We decided it wasn't worth skipping forward to see the end.I cannot remember when I've watched a film for more than an hour, and just gave up on it! In fact, I think that was a first for me.Renny Harlin does not have Bill Friedkin's deft touch for this kind of film, and should stick to action and swashbuckling movies.I'd give this film a wide berth, unless you're an incurable insomniac and really need something to help you sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil You Say! Could It Be...Satan?!!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING (2004) ** Stellan Skarsgard, Izabella Scorupco, James D'Arcy, Remy Sweeney, Julian Wadham, Andrew French, Ralph Brown, Ben Cross, David Bradley, Alan Ford. (Dir: Renny Harlin) The Devil You Say! ? Could It Be?Satan?!!? The prequel ? the sequel's red-headed stepchild in the world of film ? has been kicking around for a few decades trying to gain the dubious respect it's more successful (read: lucrative) cinematic sibling has had in spades. The odds are always stacked against it in the sense that it has its built in audience but they have the inside scoop (i.e. they know the story of its characters before they do and know that the outcome ? no matter how perilous or challenging ? will be anti-climactic since the characters are already set in the original film that spawned its bastard child).EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING is a prime example in the fact that its 1973 precursor is vastly superior in its tale of the supernatural that set the gold standard in mixing chills, The Devil, spirituality, man's conflict with his own flaws (i.e. inner demons best kept at bay) and viscerally stomach-churning make-up effects. The huge box-office success and critical acclaim quickly led to a cash-in follow up: EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC (1977) which bombed and the barely registered 1990 chapter THE EXORCIST III (Trivia note: when this film came out I went to see it as part of a double bill at the drive-in which featured YOUNG GUNS II; both films were so boring I didn't even watch them. This, by the way, was my last trip to the drive-in to boot). Anyway I digress.So does the latest episode of the hindered would-be franchise with its settings in Africa where Father Mirren (Skarsgard, perfectly cast as the Max von Sydow role) circa 1949 is attempting to forget nightmarish atrocities from WWII as a priest who has lost his faith and wound up as an archeologist requested by a mysterious benefactor (Cross) to a dig that has unearthed a 1,500 intact church buried mysteriously in the sand. It is here he will come into contact with the demon Pazuzu (AKA ? Satan) who plagued his character in the first film by possessing little Regan, the Linda Blair character.Mirren meets a beautiful young doctor named Sarah (the exotically gorgeous Scorupco, best known as the 'good' Bond girl in Pierce Brosnan's maiden voyage as James Bond in 'GOLDENEYE') who is there to take care of the natives who've been infected with an unusual infection that has also riddled their chief digger Jeffries (Ford, best known for the malevolent gang leader Bricktop in Guy Ritchie's SNATCH), with some truly gnarly pustules oozing on his kisser.Also in the midst are a military outfit in cahoots with the Catholic church that young priest Father Francis (D'Arcy uncannily channeling a young Timothy Hutton) is assigned to make sure the proceedings at hand keep the religious artifact intact for historical preservation.Yeah, yeah, blah, blah ? get to the devil! OK there are several truly unnerving violent sequences including a homicidal hyena pack tearing a small child to bits (mercilessly yet off-camera in the final moments); a murder of crows apparently left over from THE OMEN flicks; two nasty suicides; pools of blood; bed-rattling (an homage to the first flick) and the usual over-the-top genre GOTCHAS! (i.e. lights going out; powerful howling winds; etc).The film has been in a state of limbo for almost two years due to many pre-and post production maladies including the sudden death of its first hired director, the late, great John Frankenheimer; Liam Neeson, the first choice to portray the young, conflicted Mirren balked at the last moment causing a stop in production for re-casting; second director Paul Schrader's finished work scrapped due to the studio fearing it wasn't scary enough (this supposedly will re-surface on the film's DVD release ? that is Warner Bros. is to showcase this version with the one released to the public); and many, many other tribulations that third director Renny Harlin ('DIE HARD 2'; 'DEEP BLUE SEA') had to overcome to FINALLY get the project released.To add insult to injury the film was not screened to critics prior to the release, which is always the death knell for a stinker. And sadly I'm hastened to admit the film is pretty bad.It doesn't have the visceral scare factor the initial film did nor does it sustain much interest in the fact that much exposition is given for the first 2/3rds of the film but Skarsgard is a fine choice as his fellow Dane von Sydow's tormented priest whose background we are given as to being a true baptism of fire thanks to another stock villain: the Nazis in flashbacks depicting their usual sadism.Scorupco is equally good and I've always had a thing for her (think of a more erotic Angelina Jolie and there ya go!) and the young Sweeney is very good as a small native child under the evil spell of the devil.But frankly the film is again not scary or foreboding enough to recommend but thankfully is not the turkey it was predicted to be even though Harlin overdoes some of the aforementioned tricks of the trade and particularly the climactic battles between the Africans who want the whites out of their village causing all sorts of violent acts.Hopefully we've seen the last of Pazuzu.</fullReview>

What were WB and Morgan Creek thinking when they fired Paul Schrader and hired this a-hole? If Renny Harlin's version was the good one why the hell did they even bother releasing this POS for? Don't go see this movie you will regret it and feel so stupid for parting with your money for this POS. Renny Harlin should be jailed for this worthless junk. It will not scare you for one minute and you will laugh at how awful it is. Renny Harlin you are an a-hole hack!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Idea but Dull Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exorcist: The Beginning is better then the second one but its worse then the third and does not come close of approaching the original. Long before Father Merrin tried to drive the devil out of Linda Blair in The Exorcist, the two had a previous encounter in Africa just after World War 2. Exorcist: The Beginning is a prequel that shows this early battle with actor Stellan Skarsg?rd playing the young preacher. The plot sounds interesting and it had potential to be really scary. However, this film has gone through a lot of rewrites and re-shoots and it shows as this movie is kind of a mess. It starts off slow and then it starts to pick up but the ending is kind of disappointing. The special effects look really bad and cheesy. Also some of the "intense" scenes just generate laughs. There were some scary moments but nothing special or really original. It was kind of predictable because there aren't that many characters. There are a lot of flashbacks scenes of children being killed though which is sad and kind of offensive. Renny Harlin did a decent job but he didn't exactly try anything new and it all seems similar to the first movie. The film runs for 113 minutes and that makes the film really boring and the pacing slow. The acting is okay, which is amazing considering its a horror movie. I had never heard of Stellan Skarsg?rd before watching this film and he isn't that bad. Also the setting is very creepy and they did a good job on that. Rating 4/10 a few scares and {if its the last one} a sad way to close out a franchise that should have never extended past the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary Prequel to The Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exorcist: The Beginning was commissioned when Morgan Creek decided Paul Schrader's Dominion: Prequel to The Exorcist wasn't shaping up to be a commercial success. Cutthroat Island director Renny Harlin was asked to create a new film based extensively on the same screenplay but including more blood and carnage which is what the producers felt the audience wanted. stellan Skarsgard plays the young Father Lancaster Merrin who travels to Africa and discovers there a mysterious church built to contain the demon Pazuzu and protect the area from his madness and thirst for violence. Exorcist; The Beginning was nominated for two Razzies; worst director and worst sequel but it's not THAT BAD. The climactic exorcism is a show-stopper that will have you glued to the screen even if the 90 minutes which proceeded it never manages to generate that kind of energy or interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check this one, that will be a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is cursed!" exclaimed movie-magazine headlines regarding Exorcist: The Beginning, but those dire warnings turned out to be exaggerated. Considering a tumultuous production history that actually did seem cursed, Renny Harlin's much-maligned prequel to The Exorcist is a surprisingly competent, serious-minded shocker filled with the same anxious foreboding that made the 1973 original so phenomenally effective. The story lacks focus and feels cobbled together (perhaps the result of its tortured development, which included the untimely death of original director John Frankenheimer), but Stellan Skarsg?rd is well-cast as Father (now Mr.) Merrin, a lapsed Catholic priest summoned to East Africa in 1949 to retrieve a demonic idol. He discovers a buried church, a vast underground cavern, demonic possession, and a legacy of carnage that preys upon guilt-ridden memories from his parish in Nazi-occupied Holland. Harlin delivers the gross-out moments that Warner Brothers demanded, but otherwise shows remarkable restraint while cinematographer Vittorio Storaro delivers doom-laden visual atmosphere. It's not the classic many were hoping for--not even close--but it's still a win-win scenario for horror fans, since it's rumored the unreleased and "abandoned" version directed by Paul Schrader will be paired with this film for its DVD release. Comparisons will no doubt prove interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor execution of cr*p script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS AHEAD** (though not spoiling much i can tell you)..this movie is pretentious and flashy, quick edits and scene cuts with a pathetic card-trickery approach to "who's the possessed character?". if you watch this once then watch it again and ask yourself why the characters did the things they did - the whole movie falls over.the "horror" scenes take it for granted that you will take it seriously. but this is SUCH a cr*p movie if you question it. if you have come to enjoy well written, acted, directed and scored horror movies (which are surprisingly still few), then lower your IQ to watch this.there are moments in this movie which have no relevance to anything:a worker inexplicably collapses and shakes, frothing at the mouth.. but why?we are at first led to believe the younger boy of two brothers is possibly possessed, but it is revealed (later in the movie) that he ISN'T at all. this left me wondering why he acted the way he did throughout certain scenes. it made no sense. examples: the boy watches with blank expression as his elder brother is eaten by hyena's. he's put into a hospital bed after he develops a fever, he then develops legions. whilst in his fever, he opens his eyes and stares, then rolls his eyes up and falls unconscious again. his liquid feed fills with blood and he shakes uncontrollably. his bed shakes violently. but why? he's not even possessed.the NOT-possessed boy appears in a doorway unexpectedly, and in a semi-trance proclaims at a dodgy old man: "he's coming for you!" - but forgets to pee himself immediately afterwards (see "The Exorcist" lounge party scene for further details..). the old man leaves and the boys nurse asks the child "what happened?" (what happened WHEN?). the child's response is "i had a bad dream" - hang on.. what about the 'he's coming for you' part?? where did the little prophetic proclamation come from?? is the kid psychic? no...and the possessed woman near the end was a recreation of something done in another movie 30 years ago.. that original characters name was Regan.. this time her name is Jill or something like that (i've already forgotten it's so inconsequential to anything). she still talks about sex. she quips: "you want to shove your **** up her juicy ****...". in this day and age, is that meant to be unnatural or evil? give me a break. this is pathetic. and the final exorcism scenes are just so cheesy.to top it off the grandiose music in no way matches the movie. the occasional ethno-voices are new-agey, the afro-chants generic. the sound effects are sickly rich, overly produced and too prominent in the sound-design mix. the choirs are too epic. the french horns, the strings, the dramatic fight scene score. is this an Exorcist movie or 'Lord of the Rings'?the core summary of this movie reveals its hollowness: a Hollywood demon torments an ex-priest into becoming a priest again. whoopee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist: The Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics give it one star, and I do agree that sometimes prequels can be a bad idea when they don't have enough imagination or story (look at Star Wars, more spectacle than story), and this is one of those mistakes. Basically this sees the young Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsg?rd, aka 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner in Pirates of the Caribbean) who has lost his faith, revealed in many flashbacks as being made to choose people to shoot in a German Nazi concentration camp. He travels to Cairo in Egypt, but is soon sent by Semelier (Ben Cross) to Kenya in Africa to an excavation unearthing an ancient church several centuries old. Later is when bizarre things start happening with the diggers and soldiers in the area, with possession, unexplained deaths and injuries, and all because they didn't realise that that digging spot is where Lucifer fell. For a while, you think the real cause for worry and possessed like Regan MacNeill before (or in this case, after) is Joseph (Remy Sweeney), but I wasn't expecting it to be Merrin's love interest Dr. Sarah Novack (GoldenEye's Izabella Scorupco). After this whole mess is over, the demon is exorcised, and Sarah is dead (suddenly bleeding from the back of her head), Merrin has returned to his faith, and donned that black coat and Fedora hat. Also starring James D'Arcy as Father Francis, Julian Wadham as Major Granville, Andrew French as Chuma, Cape Wrath's Ralph Brown as Sergeant Major, Harry Potter's David Bradley as Father Gionetti, Alan Ford as Jeffries and look out for X Factor auditionee James Bellamy as Joseph's friend James, the kid eaten alive by werewolves. The film was originally meant to be directed by Paul Schrader, but they thought his version was too "cerebral", so they replaced with Razzie nominated director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, The Long Kiss Goodnight)! For me the good moments, although ridiculous, are a baby born bloody and covered in live maggots, guys hands and legs breaking on their own and bleeding excessively, and of course, Scorupco as the Regan of the film, with white, scratched and demonic face with the devilish voice of Rupert Degas, and at one point (amusingly) trying to hump Merrin and doing a spider walk (like a moment cut out of the first original film). I can see reasons why the critics give it one out of five stars, and I agree mainly because this is an unnecessary film, and nowhere as good as William Friedkin's brilliant original, it has its tiny moments of interest, but they are only tiny. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel. Pretty poor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine exercise in religious Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard my shares of stories about this movie. I work at blockbuster, and one night I just wanted to watch... a scary movie with my girlfriend. The thing is, some critics loved it, while most hated it. I watched it for myself, only focusing on the movie and what I was watching.It is not bad. Acting is superb. Stellan Skarsgard does portray a tortured character quiet well, and Izabella Scorupco is not bad either. James D'Arcy is mesmerizing as a young priest, who is trying to get Father Merrin's faith back. Although, I was never a huge fan of Renny Harlin, other than Cliffhanger, I enjoyed his directing very much. The film overall was very moody and the opening shot that goes from a extreme close up to a zooming out wide shot is nothing short of gorgeous. There is a feeling of dread and hopelessness through out the entire movie. Cinematography is beautiful as well; all the sets are nicely lit, and have that brown/green/gray hue, abundant in earthly colors. CGI is what holds this title back a bit. For this type of movie, CGI is overused. Some effects worked, while others did not.Writing is good as well. We find out a great deal about Father Merrin through flashbacks scattered here and there through out the movie, whereas in Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist, we instantly find out what and who he is, where he comes from, what he did etc. (see my Dominion review).I was never a highly religious person,and I don't even practice my religion. I am a Muslim who has an open mind on whatever is thrown at me. This movie made me question my ways of life and my gave me an insight on religion. Mulsim, Jew, Christian, Budhist... whatever you are, you know there is good and there is evil, and bad things happen to bad people. It is how it is. It moved me, and it scared me.What are movies all about: today it's all about money, which Morgan Creek intended to make a lot of, and entertainment for people. Even though Morgan Creek wanted more money with this movie, which they didn't get, they got a thorough good vs. evil examination which people fail to appreciate. A good movie makes people question ideas and motives and why is the world the way it is today.So before you see this movie, forget everything you ever heard about it. Just watch it for yourself and let your mind be the judge whether it is a good movie or not.</fullReview>

Now about EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING, script wasn't that bad but the Priest (Hero) was shown a bit like superman who isn't scared of anything. He went into the old church at night with courage and no expression of fear on his face and the whole movie went like this. Evil that turned in the Lady (i forgot the name, she is the heroine) was little bit over sexual which was unnecessary really.

		<shortDescription>The one that should have gone direct to DVD instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The controversy of the Exorcist prequels is one of the most bizarre events in cinema history. As far as we know this is the first time that a studio fired a director after seeing their finished film, and hired a new director who brought in a new team of writers, but used some of the same cast and locations. Why? Because they thought Paul Schrader's version wasn't scary enough. I must say I agree that Dominion isn't particularly frightening, but unlike this film it's thoughtful, suspenseful, and makes a hell of a lot more sense than Renny Harlin's slick and gory, but mediocre and convoluted version.Pros: Pretty good performances. Gorgeous cinematography and locations. Plenty of blood and gore for gorehounds. A good, but unspectacular score. Some chilling moments. A powerful opening sequence.Cons: The biggest flaw is the story is muddled. You get the feeling the new script was written in a very short period of time. There's also a real lack of true scares. The film isn't dull, but the pacing does drag at times, especially in the middle. Some things, like the relationship between Merrin and the doctor, aren't fleshed out. People who've seen the original will recall that it was mentioned that Merrin's earlier exorcism was performed on a young African boy and lasted 3 months, but the one here is not like that. Continuity error? Or did Merrin perform a few exorcisms? Also, a couple of violent scenes involving children might turn most viewers off.Final thoughts: The second of the two filmed prequels was also the only one to get a theatrical release. Sure this version has eerie moments, but there are plenty of flaws to be found. Luckily for those not satisfied, Paul Schrader's version was released on DVD a year later. But that's another review.My rating: 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it because American audiences are so jaded, or was this work truly inferior to the original? I don't know if I know the answer to that question, but the end result is the same, regardless: I was not scared. The "Behind the Scenes" story to the making of this movie is torrid and tumultuous. Director firing, screenplay rewrites, more rewrites, and more problems; this production was replete with troubles from the beginning."Writer-director Paul Schrader (Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Auto Focus) has been fired from Exorcist IV: The Beginning after turning in a completed film, when producers concluded that the film did not contain enough violence." 25 August 2003 (StudioBriefing) "Exorcist: The Beginning, the bedeviled prequel to the 1973 horror hit The Exorcist, has run into new problems, with Morgan Creek Prods. and director Paul Schrader jointly announcing Monday that Schrader, who completed principal photography in February, is no longer working on the film. Schrader took over the project in preproduction when the late director John Frankenheimer became ill, but he and producers James G. Robinson and Guy McElwaine ran up against creative issues in post production." 16 September 2003 (The Hollywood Reporter) "Alexi Hawley has been tapped to do a rewrite on Exorcist: The Beginning for Morgan Creek. Hawley steps into the project to do a production polish for director Renny Harlin, who signed on to direct six weeks of reshoots after helmer Paul Schrader exited the prequel over creative differences. American Gigolo film-maker Schrader - who also scripted Taxi Driver and Raging Bull - had completed shooting his version of Exorcist: The Beginning when studio Morgan Creek insisted it needed more gore. Schrader, who saw the story as a "character-driven period drama", was sacked and replaced by Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master director Renny Harlin to give it a more bloody look. Harlin then started shooting the $54 million prequel from scratch." 19 November 2003 (The Hollywood Reporter) "Veteran director Paul Schrader is furious his axed prequel to 1973 horror classic The Exorcist will be released on DVD at the same time as its replacement - because he wants it to receive a theatrical release." 16 April 2004 (WENN) So now, there are effectively two totally different takes of this movie. Two totally different movies; not just versions, or adaptational changes done to a second copy, but two completely independent movies which are supposed to be released at the same time on 15 March, 2005. That is just one week before the blanket release of Star Wars: Episodes I &amp; II, two months before the theatrical debut of the much anticipated Star Wars: Episode III.While I call myself keeping up with the biz at least more than any casual fan, I must say that I've heard no publicity on this "lost" edition. We'll just have to wait and see.As far as the movie itself is concerned, the Renny Harlin version I saw in the theaters was dark and atmospheric. It was well written and decently enacted. It bore an appropriate musical score and it did effectively tell the story. But it was lacking. It was a bit limp and slow in places and just could not seem to muster the appropriate energy to achieve the buzz level it needed to do more than mildly entertain.I was waiting for the DVD release in hopes of a second viewing, but unfortunately, it made no difference.It rates a 5.0/10 from...the Fiend :.Normally, I don't do this but...I'd check this one out...Dominion: Exorcist Prequel</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a hard movie to rate.When compared to:"Dominion:Prequel to the Exorcist",this is masterpiece.Let's start with the positive points.very stylish,visually more appealing.a fair bit of substance.much more suspenseful than "Dominion".this piece was much more character driven.Merrin's,motives were more clearly defined and more plausible.there was much more action than "Dominion".the characters were more believable and thus more sympathetic.The movie was also very atmospheric with an undercurrent of unease permeating it. the music was used to good effect,as well.this movie was not without its flaws,however.in fact it shares one failing with "Dominion".that is,the poor cgi,in this case hyenas,and a sandstorm that did not look real. the Church looked like a miniature when shown in a long shot of the sand rolling over it.the demon at times looked cgi,not real in its movements,kind of jerky.the demon looked like a carbon copy of the one in the Original "The Exorcist".whether this is intentional or not,I'm not sure.one scene in particular was very derivative of again the original,with the demon spouting blasphemous obscenities at the priest.in a way this kind of makes sense especially if this is the same demon that Merrrin is to meet years later.i did like the last scene showing Father Merrin walking away,wearing i believe the same garb he would wear years later,when battling the demon (or a different demon)again,a powerful scene.the only complaint i have within this scene is that it is clear the buildings are not actually there.either Stellann Skargard(Merrin)is walking in front of a green screen or the buildings have been painted in. this diminishes the impact the scene could have had.i also have to mention that the movie very gory at times,sometimes revolting in its use of maggots and such.however,i would have to say "Exorcist:The Beginning is watchable,even compelling at times.i sensed something could happen at any time and did not want to leave my seat until the movie concluded. a strong 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Renny Harlin must be the master of second chances. Even though he has several times churned out absolute crap, once even bringing an entire studio to it's knees, he still gets to continue making movies.I didn't expect much from "Exorcist: The Beginning" really. Knowing the background with the studio deciding to bring in Harlin for more blood and gore didn't exactly raise expectations either. The original cut has subsequently been released on DVD and now i see many people rating this one as the superior version. Surprising perhaps, but it's maybe a testament to the fact that Harlin has some talent after all. At least when it comes to fulfilling the studios wishes.I must admit that i'm no huge fan of the original Exorcist-movie. The whole concept of possession is not very frightening to me and i see the original movie as something of a novelty. Sure it has value as a classic film and there are effective scenes in it, but i can't say it had much of an impact on me. When comparing that movie to this one, this comes out as a light-weight. There is very little of the serious religious questions from the first movie, there is a lot more action and buckets of blood. But saying that this is movie is a light-weight is not saying that it's ultimately inferior in every way. What lacks here is mainly the belief that was in the first movie, a belief that said "possession as a concept is so frightening that we need very few bells and whistles to go with it". Here though the film-makers realize that the spinning head and projectile vomiting has been seen before and is probably far too weak for the jaded modern audience. So here we have dismemberment, Crucifixions and stabbings just to make sure.The movie looks good. The cinematography is nice, the camera-work as well. The effects are a mixed bowl but generally work well. The actors are decent, i always enjoy Skarsg?rd and the rest are not bad. The movie does become silly at times, and the whole possessed-thing and fighting the devil feels less than satisfying. And while the original Exorcist-movie might have had a unique thing going, this movie just treats the exorcism/possessing-thing as another horror-genre gimmick. Sort of like the "little-girl-with-hair-in-her-face" from Asian horror.I guess it's a very open contest whether you will like this movie or not. I found it to be passable modern horror with rather loose ties to the original movie. The acting is above par, the effects are OK and while it does become rather silly in the end it was a lot better than most of what passes for horror these days. I rate it 6/10.</fullReview>

None of the Exorcist movies were extremely fast pace, but this last installment is slow even by Exorcist standards. I mean, not much really happens for over an hour of the film. Allot of yakking about how a Nazi murdered a little girl right in front of him and that's why he started questioning God in the first place. Yak, yak yak. I really do not care. Finally something happens, then the fun begins. But it still kind of falls flat. I say that this is the worst of the Exorcist movies. I give it 6 STARS.</fullReview>

Besides the movie making no sense lots of the violence was unnecessary. It just shows how far people will go to satisfy the public's need for violence! Not to mention people's insatiable needs for sequels, prequels, etc. If this film was to garner pity for Father Merrin and explain how he gets to meet Regan then it has failed miserably. If anything, all this film shows is how easy it is to turn from God when things get at their worst and to never stick your nose in things that you shouldn't!

		<fullReview>'The Exorcist' is, in my opinion, the most brilliant and effective horror film ever made. Even the scenes that were cut and reintroduced in 'The Version You've Never Seen' work. The question is, was it a story that warranted a sequel or a prequel? Hard to say. I think each attempt has come at it with the right approach in not attempting to duplicate the original. 'The Heretic' is easily the worst of the bunch, but perhaps the most innovative. I like where it TRIES to go, but it fails in every respect. 'Legion', which was author William Peter Blatty's ACTUAL sequel to his original novel, is actually a good film. Not great, but I personally enjoyed the hell out of it. I loved the character Lt. Kinderman in both the 'The Exorcist' novel and original film, and was glad that it was in his direction that Blatty geared his continuation.That takes us to the prequel, 'The Beginning', focusing on the life of Father Lancaster Merrin long before the events in the original 1973 film, and his initial encounter with the demon that would eventually take his life. Again, we have a good approach, but the result rivals 'The Heretic' for one of the worst sequels/prequels ever made. There are great ideas introduced into the story, but in the end I was left with nothing. Not only has this film failed to capture the essence, ideology, and philosophy of what made the original so great, but the CGI effects look like something right out of a Sci-Fi channel original movie and detract terribly from the film when one is trying to approach it seriously. The film completely collapses at the climax, and all I was left with was disappointment.Stellan Skarsgard was great as Merrin, and it's only around his troubled character that the movie in any way succeeds. I haven't seen Paul Schrader's version, but it has to be better than Renny Harlin's. Harlin's a pro when it comes to cheesy action/horror films, but for anyone having seen his previous films to think he could handle something so monumental as a prequel to 'The Exorcist' is laughable. However, I suppose I really shouldn't have been so surprised to see cartoon hyenas and cartoon demons with his name being on the credits. I mean, I would never be so petty as to judge a film solely on its FX unless I believed that that was the director's intention, but is there ANY logic behind using CGI hyenas when it can't be THAT difficult to just get real ones and have your film look a WHOLE helluva lot better? I thought I was having 'Lion King' flashbacks, for God's sake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was skeptical about Harlin being the director from the very beginning. In my opinion he's never really made a good movie. I haven't seen the original and its sequels but if this is the state of a modern horror movie , then i really have to say "BAH!" .There are some good scenes in this movie, the continuous nightmares of the priest look really heartbreaking and touching. It's just too bad that this movie was totally spoiled with stupid clichés and on the top of that, with a bad director! Mr. Harlin is well-known for his b-class (c-class?) action movies and he was supposed to direct a horror movie. Everything doesn't add up? Really? Sometimes this movie fooled me to think that it's quite good, but actually when i started thinking about the scenes jumping from a gory scene to another without any feelings to it... It just doesn't seem to scare at all, does it? This movie is just too obvious and generic. The end of the movie is just such a cliché that you could just cry. Was this supposed to be a comedy or a horror movie or a very bad and silly action movie!? It changed to comedy when that possessed Sarah says that "You want to stick your **** up her juicy ***". It was totally inappropriate for that current situation. It was supposed to BE A HORROR MOVIE. I was waiting for something really frightening.Don't bother to watch this, watch the original movie and its sequels instead. I'm just ashamed that Mr. Harlin is from my country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK directing, bad script as opposed to OK script bad directing (mild spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen both films: this one and Paul Schraeder's first attempt - you can look for my comments on Dominion under that title.Renny Harlin won't blow you away here with clever directing, original thinking, command of atmospherics, good use of cast. Oh no, he'll have none of that in this film. Instead, he'll do a passable job, make a film which you can sit through and finish your popcorn.They hired him to replace Paul Schraeder. Now Schraeder's film lacked directorial ability but the script was at least half-way decent. So when the studio decided to hire Harlin, why did they junk that script in favor of this one? The script is downright juvenile, as though it were written by a bunch of spotty faced teenagers thinking: "hey yeah, let's do that because everybody thinks it's cool". Seriously, aside from the starting premise (which really came from Schraeder's script), this film has absolutely not a shred of originality.I can understand what the studio thought would make a more sell-able film. The change of female lead is nice - she has a lot more physical appeal. Oh, and it never hurts for the studio to toss in something offensive to the catholic church. But frankly, there's nothing in this film that makes it re-watchable.Maybe that's the real curse of the Exorcist. The first film was so good, it's not enough for the rest of the franchise to be so-so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unemployed Critic Nailed It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will never understand why, with a franchise as powerful as 'The Exorcist', a film as seriously lame as "...The Beginning" was not jacked up to scare the hell out of the audience as we expected. Although this film was shot beautifully and the actors were adequate (Skarrsgard was very good in his understated interpretation) it very much bordered on the boring. Yes, there were BOO! factors to which Unemployed alluded but nothing to make me go WOW! Yeah that's what we are waiting for! The ending is muddled,, and if you read those 'boards' for this film you will understand why this film did very little domestic B O and probably did not return the production budget and marketing (P &amp; A) costs. Understandably so. I understand Harlan's rep (as well as the other directors Unemployed mentioned) is that of one with no friends as he, as I hear it, is a total a**. For what reasons I do not know but remember they USE to say that about Michael Mann who is now a director/writer/producer whose projects I cannot wait to see, whatever it is he is up to next ( like Scorsese). This film is not worth watching if you expect anything but background as to (father) Marin's beginning that Von Sydow carried through to wonderful heights in the mind blower "The Exorcist".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw Exorcist- The Beginning, and I must say I was disappointed. I saw the original Exorcist awhile ago, and even though it wasn't the best movie, it did have some very nice touches that this movie tried to copy without success. For example, when Sarah becomes possessed, she has the same scars as the girl did in the original Exorcist, for no apparent reason. These facial accents worked very well in the first movie, but really didn't in this one. Another thing that I really liked about the original was the occasional flash of a demonic face. The face appeared several times throughout the movie, and was used very well. In The Beginning, they try it once, with a lame blue face showing up once in the corner of the shot. This happens near the end of the movie, when Merrin explains to Joseph the procedure of the exorcism. If there are any other appearances of a demonic face that I missed, please let me know. This scene didn't make much sense either. It takes two devout priests, who both die in the end, to tame the demon in the original, yet a priest returning to faith and a young boy recently recovering from a seizure manage to get rid of the demon in a matter of minutes in The Beginning. I could talk about this movie for a long time, but my comment would just make less and less sense. Overall I give it a 4, with my advice to the creators being- try a little originality, it worked back in '73.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An ex-priest is paid to go to a dig in Egypt to find an ancient religious artifact. The British have found a buried church in the desert. When he(Merrin) gets there, he meets a strange kid, a woman who runs the clinic, and natives. The natives tell a story of a plague that wiped out the whole tribe many years ago. He's warned of an evil and explores the church and finds a passage that leads below. My question is where did the birds and flies come from. How come no one asks because it doesn't make sense that they are just living in this buried church. The natives tell Merrin that the lead digger went insane. He goes to visit him in a mental hospital only to walk in on a gruesome finding. The strange boy and his brother are attacked by hyenas; however, the hyenas only go after the brother. This is where the bad computer effects come in. The dogs are all CGI and look so fake.Then there is the gory discovery of Jeffries body. And Merrin digs up the graves to learn the truth. One relavation that didn't make sense is Merrin learns the nurse, Sarah, was the wife of the man who went insane. I mean, why wouldn't someone had said something sooner. They would have.And at the end when we see the possessed person, she does look like Courtney Love after a long night out on the town.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was tense enough. It has loud noises and scenes to make you jump. Plus there's lots of gore, which I like. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: Exorcist IV: The Beginning (2004) Director: Renny Harling Cast: Stellan Skarsgard, Izabella Scorupco, James Darcy Review: The first exorcist flick is heralded by many as one of the scariest horror movies of all time. And with good reason, its based on a real life story, it has great performances, incredible special make up and visual fx and is just plain blasphemous and has total disregard for all things considered "holy" by many. The subsequent sequels where very different in their own ways, each director giving the film its own twist. Exorcist II: The Heretic was a laugh fest and a mess of a story with a lot of laughable moments, even going as far as having Regan, the little girl from the first film having a "mind meld" with a priest via some phony technology. Exorcist III: Legion was a well made, well acted spooky good time, with great performances by George C. Scott and Brad Douriff.Now comes Exorcist IV: The Beginning a prequel to the events of the first film. Did it live up to our expectations? Well first off, this films production was filled with many problems right from the start. Paul Schraeder had filmed a version of the film which the producers hated so they decided to film an entirely different film with a "hipper" director and more CGI. The result? Read on.The film is supposed to be a prequel to everything that happened on the first three films. It has to do with a church that they have uncovered somewhere in the middle of Africa. They send an archaeologist/ex-priest called Father Merrin to see what they have found. When he gets there he finds that all the people of the town are scared of the church and say that its cursed. Strange things starts to go down, people disappear, hyenas attack and kill people. So Father Merrin and Father Francis must go inside the church and uncover whats causing all the strange occurrences in the town.Upon hearing the news that Renny Harlin was going to be directing I was a bit concerned. After all, Harlin is known for making highly commercial films like Deep Blue Sea and The Long Kiss Goodnight and even some real commercial failures like the mega disaster that was Cutthroat Island. So right off the bat you know this fourth entry into the Exorcist series was going to be different. Did Harlin take advantage of this opportunity to make a good film? Well Id say both yes and no.First off, the thing about the Exorcist films is that they have this somber, serious tone to them. Never for a second do you feel like you are watching a cheap horror film with the exception of the Heretic which has some really stupid moments. Parts I and III were very serious films that relied more on scaring you from a psychological level. They don't mean to frighten you with effects or boo scares. What gets you about those films is that you feel like the events happening could have happened and have a very real feel to them. With Exorcist IV: The Beginning what you get is a nice looking film with lots of cheap scares and many a horror film cliché.Had this movie not been called "The Exorcist" it might have received a warmer welcome, but as it is it begs to be compared to the first....and therein lies its downfall. Its not in the same ball park as the other films. Yes it has demons and possessions, but its too clicheish in many scenes!You can practically see Harling saying "ok this is a horror film, lets make the lights go out and have her walk around in the darkness with a candle!" This might have worked fine on any other type of horror film....but on an Exorcist film it feels totally out of place. It cheapens the whole affair. And the exorcist films have never been about being cheap.OK, now lets try and hit some of the good things about the movie. The cinematography is excellent, the colors look beautiful, lots of yellows and browns. Id say that on a technical level the film worked. The art direction was very good, specially those sets inside of the evil church. But on the downside of the technical side of things....those CGI hyenas sucked! For the love of god Hollywood! When will you realize that animals (specially dogs or monkeys) are the worst thing to use CGI on!Something thats supposed to be scary, is suddenly turned into something that totally takes you out of the film. The movie has its moments. Certain things are pleasing to the horror fan, for example there's a few gory bits. There's some cool things going on with the demonic possession of an African child and there's a way awesome sequence that involves an exorcism performed on such child. But unfortunately these cool moments are hampered by the god awful finale.Was that a laugh inducing finale or what? Not for nothing but I honestly felt like I was watching Scary Movie 2. That bit with the possessed girl on the bed. The dialog spoken by that demon was so hilarious! It didn't sound scary at all! Remember those moments in the first exorcist film when you first hear the demons speak from inside Regan? Well here it feels like a joke! I guess you'll have to see it for yourself to fully understand.The film is too cartoonish, not scary and kind of fun in a cheap sort of way, I'm guessing that you could have some fun with it if you lower your expectations.Rating 3 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why must Hollywood screw up a classic film with horrible sequels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Exorcist was a horror film classic, and the scariest film i've ever seen in my whole life. I sat in my living room at 2:30 in the morning and watched that movie, and it scared the hell out of me. I had very mixed feelings about this movie being good at all, because of the bad reviews it got from critics. Let me just get it out in the open.This movie sucked big time. I was really let down and disappointed that it couldn't be decent. I fell asleep during the first hour of the movie, and it took me three times to finish it. I saw it at the theater, and I walked out the first time, because it bored the hell out of me. The acting is really bad, the scary scenes are not scary, the plot is stupid, and the script contains some of the most awful dialogue i've ever heard in a horror movie. If you're looking for a good horror movie to scare you, then go see the first Exorcist, but never put your hands on this junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor prequel which doesn't pay anything to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read all the backstory to this movie I was really quite curious to see how the second attempt, but first release, had done, especially before the firs movie was released...second! So just to fill you in, if you didn't already know. Paul Schrader of Taxi Driver fame completed the movie and screened it to the Studio idiots Executives. They didn't like it, with a vengeance. So they sacked him and hired Renny Harlin to remake it with more gore than psychological terror. So that is how I came to the movie, knowing this history and that the Harlin version had been subsequently panned by the critics.From the opening scene I was concerned, the huge swooping camera across the bloody battlefield had me thinking of action movies straight away, and that had been one of my concerns as soon as I knew Harlin was the Director.However, to give Harlin his dues, he managed to pull back from that and take the movie down a few paces, holding back with any blood and gore scenes we were expecting. He kept the pace slower and the Merrin character more introspective, building him and revealing his past slowly. Of course he was more than ably assisted by both actors Stellan Skarsg?rd and Izabella Scorupco.Still I felt that we were slipping over the glossy side of the story and a lot of the little touches that were so apparent in the original movie were either too much or too little here. Harlin couldn't quite grasp the subtlety that the story required.The scene that is supposed to show the torture that Merrin foes through to fall from the priesthood is lost. It turns him more into a callous and cold character and the scene doesn't hit the intended mark. That was pretty much the entire film for me, not quite hitting the mark. Moments were overcooked or underplayed and ultimately lost.The final battle between Merrin and the Demon comes down to a series of setups that ultimately seem contrived and give the impression that the Demon can do no more than slap and push. Not that scary.That said, the scenes are wonderfully lit and sets look very realistic. As for the actors, there is little doubt that both Skarsg?rd and Scorupco are the shining stars, and hugely overshadow everyone else in the movie.The DVD doesn't really do the movie any favours either. With a very short feature on the making of, which is really a few short conversations with a few of the cast and director.There's an audio commentary from Harlin which although interesting, fails to address the history of how the movie came to him, although to be fair that is probably the best thing to do in that circumstance. Just to ignore the history and talk about the movie as a separate entity.What does come through is that he only had a small and fixed budget with ten months to write a script and produce the movie, and that was with a fair amount of CGI. No small task, and if looked at with this knowledge then there's a certain amount of respect to be derived there.Finally the DVD comes shipped with the trailer that does appear to be from the Schrader version. Interestingly it does seem to carry more of the Exorcist feel with slow, creeping scenes, reversed speech and alike.Overall this version is worth a rental to see, and I'm sure it's going to be interesting to see it pitched against the Schrader original prequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy frights for a Friday night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Exorcist: The Beginning" has NOTHING to do with Friedkin's masterpiece. I mean the story doesn't even fit very well with what we were told in (awful!) "Exorcist Part 2". Anyway, all of you will know the issues about the making of this movie: first they (THE STUDIO) hired Paul Schrader (renowned writer and director) to get the project off, but they didn't like what Shcrader made (some say he made a deepest movie, with no easy frights and no bullsh*t), so they called a mercenary to make the movie more commercial. The results: they only used 10 minutes of what Schader filmed. And what do we have in "Exorcist: The Beginning"? Well, as I said before, we have tons of easy frights, tons of flesh and blood, and we even have a "clon" of the possessed girl from the original movie... Two hours of all that. It maybe entertaining for a Friday night (though the ending is quite ridiculous), but what annoys me of this film is the Paul Shcader's incident. I really want to see what he filmed. Great decision to put Stellan Skarsgaard in the skin of Max Von Sydow's character (as a younger man). I think Skarsgaard is the new Von Sydow... God, what a voice! He's way too good for this kind of stuff. As for the girl, she's very like Michelle Pfeiffer: a pretty face.My rate: 4.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Cinematography, wonderful foreshadowing; scary if you have half a brain in your head.I can see why people wouldn't get "it", because they are looking for "The Exorcist". In the "70's" that movie shocked people beyond belief. Now we have a generation immune to everything &amp; looking to have the same thrills that the original gave to us. Sorry guys, this is a thinking person's Exorcist &amp; if you went in without a knowledge of Fr. Merrin, then you probably didn't like it.However, if you didn't expect a re-tread of what has been done (and realize that every movie doesn't have to be slasher to be good); You may enjoy the path that has led the good father to Exorcise Young Regan in the original film.I think this film did poorly because we are now in a world of young souls. Anyone that can spend a few moments thinking about what is happening, instead of anticipating what happens in the future films will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I'd never really seen Stellan Skarsgard, except for in "Deep Blue Sea." I thought he did a spectacular job as a young Father Merrin. Basically, in this prequel, Merrin is a drunk who is haunted by experiences in the second World War. He is asked by a rare items collector to get a mystical item in Africa. Well, weird things start happening at the base for the dig.Over all, I'd give this movie 9/10. There are some gory parts in it, but it's no worse than the first, second, or third. James D'Arcy does a wonderful job as another priest at the dig. I will buy this movie at some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beginning again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film begins with a chilling premise: a totally intact church is found, completely buried under the sand in Africa, and the church seems to have been buried soon after it was built. Some interesting items are found in the church (and I won't say what they are). The history of this church is a true mystery, and initially I was interested and caught up in this film. The beginning was a terrific set-up. Then this film degenerated into extreme grossness: blood, mangling, graphic attacks by hyenas, plus maggots and other insects and all the slime you could stand. I don't understand why contemporary film makers believe that grossness equals horror. A horror film does not need to be horrible. After about an hour of this, I decided I had been grossed out sufficiently, and I stopped watching.There is some recent encouraging news: Paul Shrader had originally made this movie, which apparently had too much thought content and not enough grossness, so the producers shelved Shrader's film and got Renny Harlin to re-shoot the entire thing. I hear that the Schrader film, with the same cast, will be released in the near future (mid-2005). I am not declaring the Shrader film to be a masterpiece in advance of seeing it, and it might be just as bad as Harlin's wretched film. But it could hardly be much worse, and it is probably safe to assume it will not be nearly as gross.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay I admit it, I am one of the very few people who never found The EXORCIST to be that great of a movie, I mean sure, it had a lot of spooky things in it &amp; the acting was great, but I could not figure out what all the fuss was about. This time rather than dealing with another sequel to the franchise, were dealing with a prequel, which details the early life of that old priest from the Exorcist, FATHER MERRIN, when he is in Africa, where a buried church is discovered in the desert, which in time causes all sorts of supernatural occurrences &amp; all fingers appear to point to a little African boy whom always seems to be around when these occurrences happen, could he be possessed by the devil or are all these occurrences just a plain coincidence?. Although this sequel lacked some of the eeriness of the original, I felt it was a much stronger, a much better &amp; more of a real sequel to the original than parts 2 &amp; 3 were. It's not dull like the second &amp; it builds more suspense &amp; supernatural occurrences that was missing in 3. The first film is referenced many times through out the film &amp; the last half of the film is pretty suspenseful, with Merrin reclaiming the faith he lost after WWII to combat the possessed entity that has manifested itself in his would be lover. &amp; there are several neat plot twists in the story (Including the neat twist towards the climax when Merrin found out who really was possessed) Fans of the series should find this entertaining. Much like the last three though you have to sit through a lot of talk before getting to the action, but hang in there.*** (stars)</fullReview>

I think you have to see it really it does have a really good twist and when you see the demon puzuzu at the end it is pretty rough and worth watching because either way you look at it disturbing or funny you will find it entertaining.i surely did! so don't take notice of people who have bad comments on it its got everything you need in a movie good acting good story and a good twist! give it a reasonable 6/10</fullReview>

I personally would give the exorcist and eight out of ten because this movie was entertaining and well thought out.

		<fullReview>Some might say The Exorcist (the original) was the patriarch of modern horror. It was unlike anything anyone had ever seen. It was dark, disturbing, downright evil with visions of things never before seen on screen. Things have changed, there isn't much that hasn't been seen on screen so it might be tough to try and relive any of that original horror that The Exorcist gave us. Even it's two immediate follow ups did a decent job (thanks mostly to cast--the amazing Max Von Sydow, George C. Scott, and the return in the second film of Linda Blair. The films always held a dark edge giving us a true feeling of evil. That was many years ago and with the change in film, could it ever be brought back, the style and fear of demons? YES YES OH YES!! Renny Harlin who in fairness has done some great films, and also some bombs manages to somehow perfectly capture and preserve the heart and soul of the Exorcist films and deliver quite possibly what I consider to be on par with the original.Exorcist IV: Beginnings takes us to a younger, disturbed, torn up, lost of all his faith Lancaster Merrin (Sydow's role from the original.) Merrin has had his faith shattered as well as pieces of his sanity and is haunted by the memories of the Nazi cruelties to children and families in WWII. He is called upon by the Catholic Church to venture to East Africa and oversee an archaeological dig of great importance. They have uncovered an underground church which many of the staff of the dig will not go near. They believe a great evil is lurking beneath the surface. Amidst rumors of former spiritual battles during the crusades that wiped out entire villages, and mysterious deaths and happenings, Merrin discovers he is up against something he had lost all faith in. He is up against an ancient evil that is determined to stop him in his tracks.Who could possibly take over the shoes of Max Von Sydow and present his character, The Exorcist himself as a young, strong willed character. Probably only one person could pull it off Stellan Skarsg?rd, a man who has had numerous roles throughout his career and portrays Merrin's tortured soul, his quiet, harsh personality and his realization of faith perfectly. He even manages to look like Sydow in certain shots.This installment of The Exorcist still manages to shock, it's very dark, very gritty, you can taste the sand in your mouth. The scenes are brutal and violent and often pertaining to young kids which shocks as did the original. The final face off, exorcism is astounding and nail biting even moreso than the original. Overall this film blew me away, it's a must see for fans of the series. It's the best sequel hands down and as I said on par with the original. Check out out!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie centers about Priest Merrin (Stellan Skargard) who's assigned by Vatican to solve the enigma upon a buried church and built on Turkana (Kenya) . He's helped for other priest (James Dárcy) and a nurse (Isabella Scorupco). They will have to take on Lucifer and evil forces . The fight will be terrible . The final showdown between the starring Father and the devil is terrific and spooky .This is a horrifying and startling story about possession with usual poltergeist phenomenon caused by the supernatural demon . From start movie to finish the screams , chilling frames and the scary scenes are unstoppable . This prequel blends terror , suspense , horror , shocks , strong emotions and lots of gore . The picture has violent shots , as a child has been eaten by African dogs or another one making himself savage acts , for that reason the film is rated ¨R¨ , because of the violence and crude murders are extreme and isn't apt for boys , nor squeamish . The original Exorcist (by William Friedkin) film spread a wave of demonic possessions movies that continues unbated today , such as : ¨The changeling¨ , ¨Amytiville¨ series , ¨Darkness¨ ; besides the sequels as ¨Exorcist II¨ (by John Boorman) , ¨Exorcist III¨ (by William Peter Blatty) and prequels ¨Dominion¨ and ¨The beginning¨ . This rare film not for squeamish and is inferior to ¨Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist¨ by Paul Schrader , being shot at the same time , remaining Schrader's version for the market video . Nice acting by Stellan Skarsg?rd , he is playing a younger version of Max Von Sydow's character from The exorcist (1973) . Skarsg?rd is nearly a decade older than Von Sydow was during the filming of the original movie . Special effects , colorful cinematography , creepy music and intelligence by director Renny Harlin , all combined to make it an acceptable film . The motion picture achieved success in the box office but inferior to the first Exorcist , but more than Exorcist II (John Boorman) and Exorcist III (William Peter Blatty) which obtained flops . Trevor Ravin music and Vittorio Storaro cinematography are excellent . Rennie Harlin direction is middling ; however , the flick will appeal to terror and Exorcist series fans . Paul Schrader was originally hired as director of The Exorcist : The beginning (2004) , but Morgan Creek ultimately rejected his "psychological thriller" approach, saying it was "commercially unmarketable" . The decision was made to extensively rewrite and re-shoot the script, re-cast several roles , add new roles and give the director's chair to Renny Harlin . Schrader's version was originally supposed to be released direct to video, as a bonus feature on the DVD release of Harlin's version . Although is a prequel of prior movie , it's one the highest earning horror picture of the last years . Rating: 5.5 /10 . Passable .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Exorcist: The Beginning" takes a look at the character of Father Lankester Merrin, before his exorcism chronicled in "The Exorcist." Stellan Skarsgard plays the younger Merrin, and we see how he lost his faith, his first brush with evil beyond this world, and what turned him back to the Church. He is brought to East Africa in 1949 to investigate an out-of-place church and the strange goings-on around it. Skarsgard puts in a good performance, with subdued dignity. The whole movie gives off a strong horror vibe, and will make you jump at the smallest noise you hear. There is plenty of blood and gore, and creepy moments, with packs of hyenas, flocks of ravens and swarms of flies. Of course, it's hard to top the original "Exorcist." This movie comes rather close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't live up to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creating a sequel to a film with such a pedigree as The Exorcist is fraught with danger. Creating a third sequel could be construed as insanity. Twice before filmmakers (including the original's own author, William Peter Blatty) have attempted to recapture the magic of William Friedkin's seminal original, but to no avail. With Exorcist: The Beginning, director Renny Harlin has taken a shot at the prize, and while what emerges isn't horrible, it falls far short of grasping the golden ring.The production history of Exorcist: The Beginning reads like horror movie in itself. Originally launched under the direction of John Frankenheimer, it passed to director Paul Schrader when Frankenheimer fell ill, and eventually died. Schrader shot his film, edited it, and delivered it to production company Morgan Creek, only to have them decide it wasn't what they were looking for and shelve the film in it's entirety. Enter Renny Harlin, who has directed an entirely new version of Exorcist: The Beginning (although there is some report that Schrader's version may make it to DVD eventually, a move that even Harlin has publicly supported), filled with more visceral scares and material than what Schrader reportedly had delivered.Exorcist: The Beginning is a prequel to the 1973 film, set in 1949, it opens in Cairo, where former priest Lankester Merrin (played by Max Von Sydow in The Exorcist, and here by Stellan Skarsgard) is busy drinking his life away.A stranger (Ben Cross) approaches Merrin and offers him a significant sum of money to involve himself in a dig near Nairobi, Africa, where a Christian church has been discovered buried beneath the sand where none should be. Merrin accepts the offer and journeys to Nairobi to find the dig in a calamitous state. Many individuals have disappeared, the dig's lead archeologist has gone insane and been committed to an asylum, the dig's head, Jeffries (Alan Ford), has been stricken with an unusual facial ailment, and upon entry to the church, it has been found to be desecrated, with the statue of Jesus Christ hanging upside down. Merrin, who is tormented by the memories of horrors during World War II, dismisses the local African tribes accusations of a supernatural evil, as he has lost his faith in anything other than himself, but cannot turn a blind eye when strange things occur all about him as he attempts to discover the origins of the church, assisted by the dig's medical doctor, Sarah (Izabella Scorupco).To say that Exorcist: The Beginning is stylistically 180 degrees from the original film would be to state the obvious. Where The Exorcist drew some of it's power and suspense from it's average, everyday surroundings that made the film almost feel as if it were a documentary at times, Exorcist: The Beginning feels fabricated. The film looks like a Hollywood movie, filmed on soundstages, with visual effects that range from passable to abominable. The movie doesn't really feel real, and as such we are constantly pulled out of the experience by it's lack of verisimilitude. That being said, Harlin and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond do create some strong atmosphere at times that creates a creepy feeling, but they are never really able to overcome the film's very Hollywood feeling.Harlin, who's last venture into horror film-making was 1988's Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, and screenwriter Alexi Hawley try to create a mood of dread and unease, and occasionally manage to pull it off. However, their suspense is of the typical, oh the lights went out, let me scramble through a dark room variety. The Exorcist kept you in a state of unease by not following typical horror trappings, by setting the film in well lit environs and featuring a soundtrack that was almost non-existent; in The Beginning the standard horror clichés are in full effect, from the typical non-scare followed by a real scare, to the dark, haunting music during creepy scenes. I suppose no one could exactly match The Exorcist, but with the title attached, you come to expect something the film is just not able to really deliver. On the acting front, Stellan Skarsgard is a standout as the depressed fallen priest Merrin. If there is a really strong bright spot in this film, it is him. He embodies the character well and makes us feel the pain of the horrors he witnessed, and regrettably, was a part of during the war. Merrin's fight for faith is very reminiscent of the character arc of Damian Karras from the original film, and provides some new resonance to the character in that film, but the material is a little underdeveloped here, and would have been a good central point of the film, as opposed to a peripheral one here. Most every other actor in the film is acceptable, but nobody is going to win any awards for their work in this film.One thing that seems very unnecessary in this film is it's copious gore. This is perhaps the bloodiest horror film I have seen in some time, and the material is mostly off-putting. Harlin seems to have not picked up on the fact that blood and gore does not equal suspense, only revulsion. At moments it might be appropriate, but Exorcist: The Beginning overdoes it a bit too much at times.So is Exorcist: The Beginning a good horror film? In moments, yes, but there are not enough of them to garner a recommendation. If you really want to be scared, pick up a copy of the original The Exorcist on DVD and give it a spin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why did they do it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrible, just terrible. To be honest I was never looking forward to seeing this in the first place, well not this version of it anyway. I was as shocked as anyone to hear of Schraders dismissal as only weeks earlier Mark Kermode had seen a preview of his version and stated that this early cut looked on par with the original. I'm just disappointed that they made a good idea into such a terrible film. I was looking forward to the background story of Merrin, what we got was nothing. A third rate middle aged Indiana Jones. There was no background apart from the lame Nazi story. The ending is tacked on and looks it and you can't help but laugh at the Exorcism, especially since he drops the bible in the church and finds it again, in the cave 30 feet below. Avoid it at all costs. It now makes you want to see Schraders version even more, I read that he gave a copy to Blatty who loved it. What can you do. They can't make horror films anymore. The most interesting thing about it was the way it borrowed from films that The Exorcist inspired. The Flies ( Amityville Horror ), the Doctor bleeding ( Carrie ). Please, wait until it comes on TV, it's not worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it with you's. This film was great. all you are doing is comparing it to the exorcist, now cmon if you do that then whats the point in watching the film at all. the only reason the first exorcist film was brilliant was because that kind of thing had never been done before and it was a shock to everybody at the time. I bet that if the exorcist was released today it wouldn't get the same reception that it got in the 70's. It's a fact that most people who watch the film now laugh at it and think its funny not scary. The Exorcist the beginning won't scare todays generation cause its a case of "been there, seen that" but it is interesting none the less. So give the film some credit. It had genuinely good actors that were pleasant to watch and it had a great storyline that kept you glued to the screen till the very end. Yes it was quite gory at some parts in the films but some people like that kind of thing. To be honest i think the film would have been fine without the gore because its not the gore that the audience wants its a good storyline. I think that stellen was very good as Lancaster Merrin and he looks a lot like him as well. Thumbs up for the casting and i thought it was nice to watch the relationship between Merrin and Sarah but it was a pity what had to happen at the end. So to finish if people had the same attitude to films that i have they wouldn't slate them as much. 9 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stellan Starsgard is the only positive aspect of this film. (Personally, I don't understand why an actor of his caliber works so frequently with Harlin.) He does the best he can with what he has. If not for the awful writing, I could totally see him as the Father Merrin Max von Sydow gave us in 1973. Instead, he merely comes across as a shadow of that Merrin. Granted, his version is a younger, spiritually conflicted version Merrin, but you still have to stretch your imagination a bit to accept him as Sydow's Merrin.Izabella Scorupco is horrible in everything I've seen her in. In my mind, she has such a bad reputation that she stains any movie she's in. GoldenEye is the only thing I can stand to watch her in.Among other things, Beginning is completely bereft of its archetype's depth. Whereas the violence in the Exorcist was as a result of the story, it seems reversed in Beginning. In true Hollywood horror form, the plot revolves around the violence, making it thin and boring.I'd really like to know how Renny Harlin's mind works, because I just can't visualize someone looking at this movie and saying, "I think this is a great prequel to a classic." Beginning and The Exorcist are completely different movies. It's almost as if Harlin was trying as hard as he could to make the two movies as different as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame or what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And there I was, all excited and hopeful that someone would make a decent film based on one of my all-time favorites. How could it be worse than "Exorcist II, The Heretic." Guess what: That was Oscar-caliber compared to this profoundly horrible waste of two hours that I'll never get back. It's hard to believe anyone actually thought this movie was worthwhile. Even if you're a fan of gory, gratuitous violence, how about at least making it look real? I actually said to myself when those hyenas showed up, "Wow, a group of computer-generated, fake hyenas." The movie is strewn with computer-generated, fake creepy things. The swarming flies were particularly laughable. If you see it, you'll know what I mean. Aside from that, this movie failed to provide a single spooky moment. The occasional loud noise was as startling and effective as my sister jumping from behind the wall and yelling "boo!" back when we were kids. Save your money. There are so many better things to do with $8.50. Tossing it out the car window would have at least made the finder happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie of 2004 (so far)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's getting harder and harder to be a Renny Harlin fan. Every time I think he's hit rock bottom creatively and is due for a comeback (Driven) he makes a movie that is somehow even worse (Mindhunters). Now comes Exorcist The Beginning, which makes the dreadful Mindhunters look like an Oscar contender by comparison.I was really looking forward to this movie but, in retrospect, I should have known better. It's not that Renny Harlin can't direct horror movies--he previously made two that were entertaining, Prison and Nightmare on Elm Street 4, it's that his fun-house style couldn't possibly be a worst fit for this kind of material. Whatever words one might use to describe the original Exorcist, fun probably isn't one of them, but Harlin isn't able to generate the kind of gravitas necessary to create a "serious" horror film, let alone one that makes its use of Nazis and the holocaust seem like anything other than a regrettably tasteless plot device. When the exorcism finally comes at the end Harlin directs as if he's making another Elm Street movie, and if he can't take this material any more seriously than Freddy Krueger, how is the audience supposed to?Renny Harlin was born to make Jerry Bruckheimer movies. He should be directing popcorn flicks like Long Kiss Goodnight and Die Hard 2. He needs to go back to what he does well and stay away from scripts that don't match his talents, meaning pretty much anything where the emphasis is on drama or character psychology rather than action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another piece of crap we are fed!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, to all you out there that think this was better than the original, you can thank yourselves that pieces of crap like this make it to the theaters. This movie was all over the place and the nerve of the director to use parallels linking this movie to the original is a damn shame. The two movies don't match up and you are left saying what the eff? The Nazi's had to show up in this hit too, oh boy. I am so sick of seeing Nazi's in movies where they don't need to be, it does nothing but take your mind off of what is at hand. Linking them to Satan further strengthens an all ready weakened and pathetic following anyway. On a lighter note, you think throughout the whole movie the kid is possessed and it turns out this broad who was earlier married to a Nazi (of all people) is the one who is possessed (stupid is as stupid does). So the kid is just in shock and the fake ass embarrassing looking hyenas just didn't care he was there? Dumb and Dumber 3 the return of some serious crap!!! The make-up artist must have left this movie also with the make-up kit, the helpers, and did I mention the make-up? They really left the sanity behind (in the whole movie really) because the 1973 make-up was far more realistic. Oh man, I gonna end it here because I am rambling like this piece of crap rambled on and it's em- bare-assing to have done this anyway. I give it a four because uh, um, thee uh um, the movie sucked!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good casting, original premise could have been more promising. The execution was deplorable. If I would have not known better, I would think that this is a vatican propaganda movie. The 1st exorcist didn't make sense, but was still very entetrtaining. As for this one, I was left wondering, is it the devil or a demon and what does it want? OK, being possessed is scary but what does the demon want to achieve?So people die, and the ending is obvious, but the plot simply couldn't keep me interested. It is a shame because the actors featured are not very well known in Hollywood although there was a superb cast. But even the best actor cannot make something entertaining when it is a stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Father Lankester Merrin has had his share of evil. In a post World War II, and living in Cairo, Egypt, Merrin travels to Turkana region of Kenya by the request of a collector of rare antiquities and asked to participate in a British archaeological excavation in the remote area.While unearthing the land, the excavation team discovers an ancient Church dating back to the 5th Century when religion was not present in East Africa. In other words, it shouldn't be there. The collector wants Merrin, an Oxford-educated archeologist, to find an ancient relic hidden within the church before the British do. Merrin agrees to find this ancient relic. But within the Church is something much more sinister, more evil than anything Merrin would ever imagine. An evil, just waking to be awoken. When they finally begin searching the Church, strange things begin to happen. The local Turkana refuse to go into the Church, only making things worse.Instead of things getting better, things only get worse and worse. Eventually, things begin to result in madness, death and murder. Merrin begins having flashbacks of his World War II atrocities. Dejavu for Merrin. Having this horror being all too familiar. Innocent children begin dying, but to Merrin, the horror has yet to begin. In the land where Lucifer fell, Merrin will see evil's true face. What makes this film work is that, well, at times it's scary. Strangely enough, it's usually when nothing happens. When Merrin searches the church etc.There are a lot of graphic and rather disturbing scenes in this movie, which upset me when I first saw Exorcist The Beginning. The musical score helped the horror aspect of the film. I loved it. Before seeing this film, my expectations were so low, I expected absolutely nothing. So hence, I came out wanting to see this movie again for one reason. I loved it.It's the best sequel, at some point in time it will get the respect it deserves. Stellan Skarsg?rd portrays Father Merrin, and does an excellent job. Now that I've the movie, he seems to be the perfect Young Father Lancaster Merrin. Also, Izabella Scorupco stars as Sarah, Merrin's love interest. Her performance is quite bad. She almost seems to be changing accents throughout the movie. It's very annoying. It doesn't take away any of the shock, horror or disturbing subject matter of the movie that just appeals to me and why I loved this movie.***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I came out of the theater, I did not hate it but I did not like it either. I felt something was missing. The problem with this film is that it is always going to be compared to the original. In the original, you have a focus on a child and the problem of the possession of the child by a demon. You have strong characters surrounding the child like the mother, the priest, and the police officer. Other than the child, you could really get into each of the characters.That is what is missing here. You do not feel for the characters. One of the characters here was a former Nazi concentration camp survivor but I felt no sympathy for her. ********possible spoilers************It is around late 1940's and a former priest, who is now an archeologist, is approached to lead an expedition of a church found in Kenya or some African country that should not have a Christian church. He takes the job and goes to Africa where he meets a village doctor who is a former Nazi concentration camp survivor. Like her, he has troubled past where he was a priest in town controlled by the Nazi's. His church harbored Jews and the Nazi's found out and the Nazi's were going to kill all of them unless he chose the people among the harbored group that be killed. He does so and as a result, loses his faith.It seems the church is built over a site that was the place where Satan landed when he was cast out by God. During Roman era, the Christian emperor ordered a church to be built over the site and have it buried. The record of this place was stricken from all Christian records because of the great evil it caused to the Roman legions that was sent there, namely, they turned on each other and all were killed except one priest. Fast forward to modern times and a priest in Vatican finds one letter in reference to it and leads an expedition to it in the early 20th century but some have died, disappeared or is in an insane asylum.....*****************end of spoiler*************I could go on but that's about it. My suggestion is to wait for it to show up on your local videostore.</fullReview>

So the movie was not horrible, it was not super but there were some interesting ideas that were unique.

		<fullReview>WHY? Why do we need to see this? it's very bloody and just nonsense. This is a perfect example of how a production company just cares about one simple thing $$MONEY$$ now when I first heard about this film, I was surprised that the director/writer that was first involved did not in vision this film as a gore fest, instead in vision more of a intense psychological thriller, of course the "big wigs" thought differently "how can we make a profit if there isn't any gore and gruesome images? no one will see it" which is wrong. Take AVP for example, yes even though it had it's problems, it was more of an intense film rather then a gore fest orgy and it exceeded it's production value. It's scary anyways when you don't see all the blood or violence because it leads to the imagination, as the example of Se7en... even though there was some disturbing images in the film, we never saw the gory details of the killings, it was left to your imagination which makes it more intense and scary. I was disappointed by this film because of the following. Too bad the production company don't see or understand this, all they think is more violence, gore, sex language the more money they make nd what's the point to this film anyways, why do we need this??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This director is either sloppy, lazy or both. I found myself reeling in horror, not from the story but instead, the mess the director made of it.  From the opening scene, I noticed all of the soldiers were crucifed upside down. My problem with this scene comes from the nicely cut and square planks of wood which the crosses were made from. Did they have lumber yards in 500 A.D.? Nit-picky? Maybe, so I moved on with the movie. Next thing that I was confused on was why would the director choose to go with cheap scare tactics which are best left to slasher movies? Terrible. Then the excavation scene. If the place had been sealed for 1500 years, where did all the darn birds come from? Previous to this scene, there wasn't a bird to be seen. Nice touch. Leeches? In a desert? Must have got them from the hidden seven-eleven in town. My biggest problem comes from the director and writer being so lazy as to instead of building a twist out of logic or from the story line, they lie to you by making the doctor the possessed one.Why would the doctor be running around her house scared if she was possessed the whole time? Don't you think someone in the dig would mention she was married to the lead excavator who went nuts? Lame. Even if you remove the Exorcist title, this steamy pile it would be hard pressed to make even a small impression among the other B horror titles at the video store. Forget saving the doctors soul, just save your money. It should be on cable by Christmas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I really liked the original Exorcist...who didn't, but what gets me so mad are the people who decide to do prequels. First off, thanks to George Lucas, prequels became ever more popular...and you know what, I kinda do like prequels ONLY IF they actually do what they were meant to do. For this prequel, I have to say there was many the opportunity to really makes those who just didn't quite understand the first 10 minutes of the Original Exorcist make sense. They needed a stronger backbone for the Devil's church and the little statue the priest holds in his hand in both the original and the prequel. I understand now why the priest had once lost his faith, and why he was determined to help the other priest in the original. So overall, i would see it if only you really were in to the Exorcist...otherwise, wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where tobegin. It's awful, it is not in the least bit scary and relies on 'shock' violence mainly against children. It's plot was weak and barely about being possessed or being excorised. The acting was abominable, but the icing on the cake was the lamer then ever special effects. Flies on the screen actually looked like flat black spots, wild coyotes or hyenias were laughable, and one oh-so-dramatic sceneof butterflies flapping their wings was ridiculous. I've seen better effects in pop- up books, no offense to the makers of the pop-up books.I can't believe Crap like this makes it to the big screen. This movie is offensive in it sheer stupidity and anyone involved in the making of this film should beashamed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As somebody who grew up with nightmare of Linda Blair, I am happy to say that I've found have a cure. ETB!While Herretic was wholly unwatchable it still had those creepy scenes with Linda that still freaked me out and just the thought of her in that ghastly makeup is enough to keep me awake at night. This film however, was able to entertain me for awhile before putting me down to a nice sleep. For that, i can never hate this film. It has "exorcised" my Linda Blair nightmare by offering a by the numbers spooky lullabye that will forever rank up there with Jason X for Most calming chiller. While it didn't have all the laughs that the Jason series has, this did not hurt the film in my eyes. In fact, it helped me slip into my slumber with the all the ease of warm milk. I enjoyed seeing Stellan take on the Devil (and the SS Briefly) as Father Merrin, as did I like the careful plotting by Mr. Harlin whose lack of attention to detail and plot made this film so much easier to ignore. All in all, if you're like me and want to get over the anxiety caused by Freidkin's original, but can't sith through Heretic, this is the film for you.AD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, having only seen the original Exorcist twice a while ago, I didn't really know what to expect with the prequel. This movie seemed as much a suspense as it was horror. It got you so spooked that even when there was just a moderately loud noise you couldn't really help but jump in your seat. I liked that it kept the gore/explicit possession stuff at a reasonable level. It was really only rated R for maybe six or seven scenes.The acting with Father Merrin was right on, Stellan Skarsg?rd was perfect for the role. He conveyed Lancaster's stoicism that we see in the original movie perfectly, though it is not fully developed because of his younger age and when he does show emotion it was just right for the moment, he plays his character faithfully, and I can think of no one better to have played the role. I was really glad to see that James D'Arcy acting again after Master and Commander, though his character in this was slightly underdeveloped, he was there to get things doing, but for periods of time disappeared until the end when he died. The only real complaint I had was the very end when the girl suddenly started bleeding out of the back of her head and died. It happened so quickly and it seemed like it had no real cause, other than the fact she had to die so Merrin would go back to being a priest instead of being happy with her. But on the whole, I loved this movie and would gladly go see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist: The Beginning (2004) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a slight way this Renny Harlin film was actually something of a workable prequel to the original EXORCIST, and not as bad as I feared when it was announced that the first version (DOMINION: A PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST, by Paul Schrader) was scrapped. What happened was, the studio felt Schrader's DOMINION was too tame and not biting enough, so they rushed Harlin into shooting BEGINNING instead. Having now seen both versions, neither is a good movie but I'd give the edge to this one.Does anyone really believe an Exorcist sequel/prequel has a fair chance of being approached on its own terms, let alone equaling the classic original? Hell, no. EXORCIST 2 was indisputably an abomination, and the very good EXORCIST 3 only later gained the proper respect it deserves after it was denied upon its release in 1990. Harlin's edition of THE BEGINNING is a serious story of Father Merrin's earlier years in Kenya as he struggles with his faith while encountering the infamous demon for the first time. As Father Merrin, Stellan Skarsgard is quite intense. I really enjoyed his characterization of a confused and tortured younger version of Max Von Sydow's priest. One who has turned his back on God and is haunted by unrelenting and horrific Nazi memories. A feeling of pure evil permeates throughout the movie, and there are some effective shocks and unsettling moments to be savored along Father Merrin's path to find his way to God again. The film is not without its flaws - there are some very bad and obvious-looking CGI effects (the hyenas were appallingly fake looking), and an unfortunate silly surprise climax which tries to pay homage to the original Linda Blair classic, but just comes off as stupid as well as cartoonish. These satirical antics with a victim swearing in demonic tones have a potential to produce unintended laughs, but I wouldn't only blame the movie for any humorous reaction; after all, we've been over-saturated for years with possession spoofs on television (SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE) and in films (SCARY MOVIE, REPOSSESSED). It's highly unlikely that anyone could take the sights and sounds of a demonically possessed person hurling obscenities while performing tricks seriously anymore. By the way, the "twist" wrongly contradicts details of Merrin's first exorcism as already chronicled in THE EXORCIST.</fullReview>

This fourth chapter of the Exorcist films is without a doubt the second best. Exorcist the beginning is well paced with great acting performances. Those who rated this film anything below a 5 are just absurd.

		<shortDescription>Not as terrible as critics would have you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, let me start off with this. I didn't like the original Exorcist. I found it to be mostly hype that didn't live up to its name. I know most people rank it as one of the scariest, if not THE scariest movies of all time. Therefore, my tastes are obviously a bit different from most people, which seemed to result in me having a different reaction to The Beginning.I thought it was quite impressive. I thought the CGI was extremely cheesy, looking like a movie from the early 90's. But at times, certain scenes (scenes without the terrible CGI, of course) were absolutely beautiful. The lighting and angles come together to create a great atmosphere.Story wise, I found it rather intriguing. It wasn't Academy Award worthy, but it was definitely entertaining, and that's why we all go to the movies, right?Acting was top notch from the main character and several supporting characters. The only problem I had with the acting was that the film didn't allow them any more room to shine.Overall, this is a good Summer movie. If you go in expecting too much, you might be disappointed. But I don't think that most people who are fans of the original film could ever be satisfied in that same way ever again. So take what you can get instead, a solid, if sometimes wavering, movie that commands much more respect than it is currently receiving. Thanks for you're time if you read this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't enough that Renny Harlin damaged Geena Davis' career with the aptly named "Cutthroat Island." With Exorcist IV, he has a new love: jarringly extreme closeups. Perhaps counting facial hairs beat counting plot and pacing problems. Stellan Skarsgard and a good cast ably convey what they can with the script. At least in "The Exorcist," Linda Blair's sexually charged comments caused viewer gasps; here, the audience roared with laughter at similar dialogue.Exorcist: The Beginning easily beats Exorcist II: the Heretic, a travesty sunk by locusts and Richard "I love my voice" Burton. This new one trails Exorcist III which featured George C. Scott and Viveca Lindfors and a few brilliant moments (the fixed-camera hallway scene) amidst some horrible missteps (gee, Brad Dourif can sing in Michael-Jackson-soprano). I do hope the DVD contains Paul Schrader's version so the viewer can second guess Morgan Creek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blew me out of the water. Going into it i was unsure if it was going to stack up to its earlier counterpart, but i was pleasantly surprised. The writer of this movie must have been seriously disturbed as a child. The script is fantastic and the movie all together is flawless(the cgi was a bit shotty, but was forgivable). The conflicts in the movie add even more suspense to this already suspenseful movie. Father Merine has lost his faith in God and anything supernatural and throughout the entire movie is looking for a logical answer for everything that is happening around him. This film also had one of the most disturbing scenes i have ever seen, with a young child being mauled by a pack of hyenias. It was brutal. But this movie is a great compliment to its cult classic sequel. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the Exorcist movies. I love the book by William Peter Blatty. I think Father Merrin is a great character and I have been looking forward to this film for a very long time. I was not suprised by the attacks that this movie got by a lot of critics and I can honestly say I did not agree at all. I LIKED THIS MOVIE A LOT! I thought it was scary, well acted, very well paced, and very good overall. If you are an Exoricst fan then I recommend this movie! THe only real complaint I have is that it did not have the catchy exorcist theme music that is in parts one and three although it is used in the trailers. There are some very scary parts in this movie. I think Renny Harlin did a good job directing and I am very curious to see Paul Schrader's version if it ever gets released. So overall I would say Exorcist:The Begining is an 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of problems for anyone who dared to take on this movie such as how do you do an Exorcist without just doing the first one again? How can you surprise us if we already know how it ends? How do you deliver on the CGI-fed audiences expectation of something wow if there is no monster (this is all about possession after all).Renny Harlin did a great job and almost pulled it off completely. There are scenes of shock, violence, gore, sadness, humor and some good plot twists. This movie could not be expected to deliver the punch of the original Exorcist because so much has happened cinematic ally since then. However, it is spooky, scary, nasty and fun. As it's a horror film, er, what more do you want?The only thing I wasn't thrilled about, that others have also commented on, was some genuinely crappy bits of dialogue by the demon and the oddly edited ending that kind of stumbled a few times, but still got there in the end.All in all the film delivered. It just could have done with some work on the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie and spent some time surfing online reviews. Most of them seem to compare it, understandably enough, to the original and find it lacking on a variety of levels. I just don't agree. Exorcist: The Beginning grasped my interest from the opening scenes to the final frame. The lead actor, Stelan Skarsgard, so vividly and competently captured the character of Father Merrin (played originally by Sydow) that I was blown away -- it was like watching a young Sydow in every respect down to his voice. The story was a brilliant, masterful one that took the necessary time to create a rich, interwoven tapestry of characters and history, and kept me guessing at every turn. For outright horror, the movie requires a patient, adult attention span and ultimately pays off with one of the most disturbing, eye-covering climaxes deep beneath the African ground that I have ever seen. Congratulations to everyone behind this film, whereas you have not seemed to please the attention-deficient crowds that can not stand an intellectual tale or a horror film with literary substance, you have certainly done justice to those true fans of what made the original Exorcist such a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, the studio wanted gore, so ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always sad when the studio has the biggest part in the making of a movie, this is prime example of what happens then. I'd rather don't put the blame on Harlin totally, like so many of you want to, but I would point my finger more at the studio. Like one critic elsewhere said, this is what happens when you do a whole movie as a re-shoot.When this project was first given the green light John Frankenheimer was supposed to direct it, but sadly he passed away so in comes Paul Schrader. When the first rough cut was done the studio deemed it unfit to hit the theaters, simply because it was not boring and didn't include enough gore. So the studio kicks Schrader out and get's Harlin in to do "re-shoots" and somewhere along the way these re-shoots turn into re-shooting the whole movie ! with the studio wanting more and more gore and violence.I can only say that this movie is rather good given the circumstances, when a director has a) a script he is not familiar with, b) a crew he is not familiar with, c) extremely short time to do this movie, d) the budget is not what is needed for a "fx" movie, e) ... so the extremely sucky cgi, and f) the studio breathing on his neck calling almost every shot. It could have been even worse than it is.I am not a horror fan as such, but have seen quite anyway, this movie is comparable to Exorcist 2 &amp; 3 easily, even better at times, so if you happen to like gore, I'm sure it's right up your alley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bitter aftertaste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The general events of the story, which led to the beginning of the 1973 movie, quenched the thirst for those of us who wanted to know how it all began. For those of us who hoped to see an extension to the subtle crafty style from the classic, you'd see that half the time, the other half was made of formulaic modern-day horror/suspense/action sequences. While one moment the film chilled your spine with the psychological and historical build-up of the demonic entity, events where you could feel the presence of evil, the next moment practiced cheap shock trickery, such as music that would tell you exactly when to be scared, and the typical fearless and clueless female character who would curiously look to get into harms way.Aside from a couple actors who looked out of place, overall the acting was satisfactory, but somehow the lack of chemistry between the actors made it feel like they were still strangers to each other by the end of the movie. And the dialogues went along insipidly with the motions.I look forward to some sort of a director's cut, where the style can be more consistent. It was still enjoyable and worthy of a watch, especially for the sake of a closure, and a few scenes were outright shocking and applausable, but be prepared for a bitter aftertaste and the feeling of being yanked from different ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exorcist: The Beginning (8/10) stars Stellan Skarsgard as Father Lancaster Merrin. Merrin, for those who have not seen the original Exorcist, is the priest who shows up at the end of The Exorcist to save the little girl. We are aware of Father Merrin's past battle with the demon known as Pazuzu. In "Exorcist: The Beginning" we get to see Merrin and Pazuzu's first encounter.The movie takes place in East Africa, maybe around Saudi Arabia or somewhere like that. Anywho, people begin to uncover a church that has been buried beneath the desert sand. A lot of other junk happens that was really creepy.For those who don't know, here is how I rate movies. 2/10 is for story line. 2/10 is for scenary and effects. 2/10 is for acting. 2/10 is for directing. 2/10 is for writing.Exorcist: The Beginning gets one point taken away from effects because the demon at the end was too computerized. It also gets a point taken away from writing because of: "Pazuzu: What's wrong Merrin? Don't you wanna f*ck me anymore?" and a few other lame lines said by the demon.This movie scared me for one main reason: I am a Christian. Because of that, I have faith in God and fear of Satan. This was a really scary movie because of what it was about. So if you like painful sequences that you can hardly bare, blood, and evil demons, this movie is for you.</fullReview>

There you have it: a movie that started with a good premise and decayed into a boring, rigid, Spielberg-like formula flick.The problems don't stop there: the CG effects were appallingly sub-par and the "scary" bits were nowhere near as menacing as poor Regan's ordeal in the original movie.I saw the first matinée this morning with a few friends who took the day off with me. I figured that maybe, being an embalmer, I've become desensitized to bizarre imagery. My buds told me, 'No, it's not you. That was boring'.If you want scary, stick with the original 'Exorcist'. It scared the holy hell out of me when I was a teenager and I never tire of watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of why it's probably best not to dance with the devil ensues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Folks, last time I checked (which was about 10 minutes ago), this isn't exactly a prequel to The Princess Bride. This is a prequel to a movie that involved a demon-possessed girl who spewed more vomit than Robert Downey Jr. on a 24-hour alcohol/cocaine binge and whose head did a 360 faster than Billy Joel's car plowing into a neighbor's house. Still not sure how that didn't snap her neck, but I digress.This is one twisted, creepy, make-you-turn-away movie. I'm warning you right now, if you can't take graphic and disturbing images, then this isn't for you. Listen up: a guy cuts his own throat, a little boy is mauled by hyenas, a little girl is shot in the head, a still-born baby is covered with maggots, Michael Moore is shown without a shirt on, getting' the picture yet? We're talking disturbing, violent images.As you can probably surmise, unless reading comprehension's got you down, there is quite a bit of gore. But thankfully, that's not where all the scares come from. I thought some of the creepiest moments in the movie came from what I like to call "snapshots." Little things that happen quickly, and you have to be paying attention to catch 'em - a shadow flys by the top of the camera, a face materializes in the dark but then vanishes, Fran Drescher's laugh emanates from the back right speaker, small details of that nature that are very subtle but really add a lot to the atmosphere.And the dark atmosphere is a big part of this movie. Now I don't scare easily, so for me I'd say the movie is more creepy and tense than it is scary. Not once did I have to run to the bathroom and change into the extra pair of boxer briefs that I brought with me. I guess I'm just at the point where a woman walking down a dark corridor with a candle doesn't frighten me that much. Unless that woman is Rosie O'Donnell and she's not wearing any makeup and that light is shining her face big and bright on the screen. Then I'm running for the hills. Scenes like that provide plenty of tension, and I might be coaxed into jumping a couple of times, but it's not the kind of stuff that has me whimpering like the president of the chess club on prom night.On the down side, some of the CGI is a little unpolished. For a minute I thought it weird that Joan Rivers had a cameo in the movie. I was quite perturbed until I realized it was just a fake-looking hyena. The scene with the demon-possessed human crawling backwards on the cave wall was pretty cool though.I also thought the story could've been fleshed out a little more. The setup is great, although not overly original, and the movie tensely pulled me along, forcing me to constantly wonder what the purpose of the church was. Plus, I really like the whole idea of "this is the area where Lucifer fell." But then the story just leveled out and never really advanced from there. The demon possession doesn't truly come into play until the last act, and it would've been nice if in the midst of all his taunting, the demon had taken the time to make reference to the war in Heaven. Maybe say a few things to make himself seem really ruthless and cold-blooded. Instead, the demon busts out the one-liners as if he's auditioning for a stand-up act on Letterman. You know when half the audience is inexplicably clapping and cheering DEMONIC TAUNTING that something has gone dreadfully wrong.Ah well, it's all minor stuff. This isn't the smartest horror movie in the world, but it's a crowd pleaser, and if all you want is to kill some time with a few good scares, then it delivers.Word of advice: if at all possible, I recommend seeing this movie in as empty a theater as possible. Maybe wait a couple of weeks after the release or grab some friends and catch a midnight showing in a safe location. The theater was packed when I saw it, and it really took away from the experience.People were laughing and talking during really dark, tense scenes, and one dude behind us snored the entire time. I had to restrain myself from breaking out some jiujitsu. Plus, whenever something scary would happen half the audience would scream and then laugh hysterically for the next couple of minutes. It was very distracting. This is just one of those movies where it's best to watch it with a handful of friends in a nice, quiet setting. In other words, find a screen showing Catwoman and ask the manager if he'll switch reels for you. THE GIST:If you're easily repulsed, then avoid it. But if you're really in need of a horror fix, then Exorcist: The Beginning should satisfy. Guys, this is the perfect movie to take your gal to, especially if she's a little skittish. She'll be grabbing your arm as if it's Johnny Betts' arm, but I'm afraid she'll be able to easily tell the difference. Don't take it personally though.</fullReview>

It is horrific, gory, scary and it fills in all the backstory for the original while having you cringe and cheer along the way. Let's just say a Father Merrin superhero might be viable. You will recognize the demon by words and deeds.The girl seated next to me kept her head in her hands the whole time saying - Oh F@#$ Oh F@#$#. Minimal cheese, cool story. Won't give stuff away but it's Indiana Jones meets Satan.Isabella is hot in the movie and hotter in a real life and Stellan kicks demonic butt like a tormented Russel Crowe with a cross.And true to the 1970's movie there is ample juxaposition of flagrant unholy activity and unspeakable blasphemy. ( Well no crucifix masturbation so you can take the kids but close and truly gross and horrific so be prepared with "earmuffs and eyemuffs" every once in a while.)Damn good adventure and scare and fans of Father Merrin will see why taking on Regan in the seventies really was a comparative walk in the park.Look in the 70's the idea of possession was new and therefore made an impact impossible to make today but frankly this movie is BETTER. Don't believe me? then watch this then rent the 70's version. You will be surprised. Take care and say a prayer just in case....

It goes beyond predictable.The hero is the usual cynic we get in 99.9999% of action films, and this one is over the top. The director tries to get us to buy into this character with the usual trite devices, and we just don't care.This would've been overused even 40 years ago.We get the usual and predictable gore and violence, and are not impressed.We never can really buy into the plot, the characters, or the logistics of what happens. We know the good priest will fail, and the cynic will succeed, because that is Hollywood. But the writing never even comes close to giving any credibility to this. It probably could have been done, but it wasn't done. Poor writing, and of course, since the director has the last say, poor directing.</fullReview>

Toss in some Nazis, like any junk movie in need of an easy villain. Stir in a climactic sandstorm, for thrills. What's that? Did I hear someone say "I love colonial occupation/war sub-plots?" Toss some of that in too. Harlin actually seems to think that more is more. This movie keeps escalating to larger and larger scales, in complete ignorance of the directness that made the original so effective. So here come the plot elaborations and twists. Don't forget special effects (people kicked across the room) and tricks we've already seen eleven thousand times. For good measure, green-screen the living crap out of it (The archaeological dig seems to be occurring in the weird landscape seen behind Mona Lisa.) In places where the green-screen budget was already spent, there are backdrops at least as fake those in Rebecca (1940!!!). By the end, this production is a mockable, stupid, over-plotted, inept chunk of unscariness.The idea of a buried church in a place and time it shouldn't be might have been compelling in the right hands. But nooooo... Instead, my butterfly collection is making me kiiiiiiiill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if there were no other exorcist movies ever thought of or created until this one, this movie would still not be very exciting. its a good movie to give as a gift to someone you don't like. Every scene has the main character drinking alcohol, drums, yelling, it goes on and on. its a great movie to watch if you want to get a good laugh. The cover is more exciting to look at than watching the movie. The phrase "god is not here today priest" is not only said like 4 times, but said in different accents. Its almost like the wiggles should be singing in between scenes at least that would be more interesting. if you see this movie, god help you, and don't have any sharp objects near you or they may magically appear in you arm or chest. Good Luck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>never has a horror sucked so bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is without a doubt the absolute worst horror movie i have ever seen in my life.lets begin with the totally unnesscessary and cheesy cgi bats,hyena's,and fly's.now combine that with a movie that thinks it is being scary simply by being gross.this film focuses far to much on gore most of it being cheesy and fake to scare it's audience.the possessed girl is about as scary as samara in scary movie 3 and the cgi animation to make her body jump high and crabwalk looks absolutely friggin ridiculous.100% not scary and 100% pointless,and stupid.every time a scary scene arises they ruin it by trying to show gruesome deaths that turn out to be just horendous.not only are the death scenes overly bloody and violent but there is absolutely no sign of how or why there bodies ended up where they were.oh and if the hyena's attacked an innocent kid why would'nt they attack merrin when he was in the graveyard uncovering the mystery.if you don't wanna waste your life i advise not seeing this jumbled up thrown together piece of garbage.for those of you wanting your intelligence insulted then enjoy excorcist the beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put off watching this film for over a year, and ended up wishing I hadn't bothered at all.Very, very few films am I not able to sit through, but this was one of them; I began fast-forwarding at about the 40 minute mark.The inverted crucifixes featured in the film could represent its plot - it's all upside down, nothing short of a mess. The stereotypes featured in the film could actually be classified as dangerous.The end, when it *finally* came, looked like it might offer some smidgeon of consolation for my wasted time. However, the tired dialogue that was used only served to make even this scene mundane, lifeless.Not even worth renting. Try and catch it on cable, particularly if you have insomnia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an action movie - not a horror, and not an Exorcist prequel. The female lead is too pretty, everyone else too forgettable, the make-up too obvious, the editing too fast, and the plot too confusing. It feels like one of these dime-a-dozen horror movie remakes, but Exorcist was the filmmaker's horror movie, the thinking man's horror movie. This is 2 Fast 2 Furious on an archaeological dig.And the hyenas!!! They don't work in either prequel. One hopes this movie will disappear, for our sakes and Harlin's. Harlin is a fun director, but the Exorcist isn't supposed to be fun. It is supposed to be morose. It is hardly his fault, though. The book about this 2 prequel experiment is probably already in the works, and, like the films, few will buy it. Schrader's version's themes, without knowing it, actually speak for the whole process: you can't win - you can only try to minimize the damage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very creepy, sequel, and it's the best sequel in the series!.it's constantly creepy, and it manages to get under your skin, and, some scenes made my jaw drop open!. It's very interesting, with great special effects, and lots of exciting scenes, to keep you watching. All the characters are very cool, and The finale is great, however, the effects on the Hyenas are terrible, with way too much CGI, and it drag a little bit in the middle, and i would have liked to learn more about what happened in the beginning, but still it's a great sequel, that i enjoyed quite a bit. It's a great sequel, and i highly recommend it!, i am looking forward to checking out the Paul Schrader version but i really liked this version. The Direction is very good. Renny Harlin does a very good job here, with some jaw dropping camera work, some awesome camera angles, he is constantly adding creepy atmosphere, great visuals, and some other fantastic shots, plus he kept the film at a great pace!. This movie is loaded with blood and gore!. We get quite a few bloody gunshot wounds to the head,tons of bodies crucifix ed upside down,gory looking foot,lots of very bloody gunshot wounds,faces are slashed,EXTREMELY bloody battle sequences,impalings with spears (ATF),hyenas rip a kid to pieces,gory stabbings,cut off arm,a couple of guttings,tons of gory impalings, an impaling, in the neck, with blood spurting,a few bloody slit throats,severed heads,guy blows his brains out,fingers broken backwards,slit wrist, hands cut on glass,very gory corpses,leeches, suck the blood out of someone,swastika carved on someone's chest, little girl gets shot in the head(seen quite a few times),nasty/gory scene involving a baby,tons and tons of blood,vaginal blood, and there's even more lots more!. The Acting is very good. Stellan Skarsg?rdis awesome here, as the main lead, he is very likable, convincing had good chemistry with Izabella Scorupco, and is just a wonderful actor!, perfect choice to play this part. Izabella Scorupco is beautiful, and does fine here,with what she had to do, and had good chemistry with, Stellan. James D'Arcy is pretty bad here, and very bland, and didn't convince me as the priest. Remy Sweeney, is fine as the kid, but didn't have much to do. Ben Cross was only here to collect a paycheck, not much of a part. rest of the cast is fine. Overall i highly recommend this sequel, it's vastly underrated!, i can't wait for the Schrader version!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie. Very BAD horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on pay-per-view and it confirmed what I suspected, the reason why I opted not to see it on the big screen. As a movie, it was extremely well made. Vittorio Storraro's cinematography was superb, as were the sets, costumes, cast, efx, etc etc. Were this not a "horror movie" and a sequel and a b.o. flop, it may well have racked up a slew of Oscar noms. As a movie it was very well done. As a horror film, it was pathetically lacking. Lacking scares. Lacking horror.Once again we have a big Hollywood player with clout (Rene Harlin) "slumming" in a genre that the tinseltown powerbrokers just do not get. With Michael Bay and Jan de Bont cranking out mega-million dollar productions with zero scares, it should surprise no one that Harlin was given the reigns of a sequel to one of the greatest and scariest movies ever made. The writers cannot be blamed for the failings of this movie. There were plenty of opportunities in the script, but Harlin demonstrated a complete lack of ability to deliver the scares. Horror and comedy both live or die by timing. Set-up and delivery. George Romero is the master. Wes Craven, when he's not actively trying to fight being a horror director, has it. Ridley Scott has it. Tobe Hooper had it, early in his career. Spielberg had more scares in any one of his early TV movies than are found in all of the Bay-de Bont-Harlin megabuck "horror" flicks. A handful of independent writers and directors have proved that they have it, but are religiously ignored by the idiots cranking out these expensive failures.No genre suffers more in the Hollywood system than horror. For horror fans, this movie is yet another insufferable insult.Until the agents and producers do their homework and start reading and analyzing the comments and online reviews of actual horror fans, who understand the genre in a way the Ivy League execs and professional critics never could, there is little hope that the genre will ever reach its potential in the Hollywood system. Thankfully, there are very satisfying horror films coming out of east Asia. Even the remakes are better than homegrown American horror films.</fullReview>

The director should have not wasted his time on trying to make another sequel to a great American classic film. People who see this should be warned before they go to put it in their DVD player. Boring is the only word for this movie and if they come out with another movie like this the person who makes it will not be very smart.

		<fullReview>Boy am I glad I went to see this movie during matinée hours. If I'd paid full price for my ticket, I'd have been pretty PO'd."Exorcist: The Beginning" takes a one line reference from the original "Exorcist" and attempts to make an entire movie out of it. In this prequel, Father Merrin arrives in Africa as an archaeologist, his faith in God having been shaken by the horrific acts of the Nazi's during World War Two, which he witnessed firsthand. But his faith is put to the test when he meets a young boy who may be possessed by the demon Pazuzu, and a young woman named Sarah who is attracted to Merrin. Despite a strong and atmospheric opening and a great, creepy set inside of an ancient church, this movie falls apart pretty quickly. I don't think it meant to be silly, but it is nevertheless. CGI beasties, a maggoty baby and a very laughable final confrontation with the naughty demon are all very difficult to watch with a straight face...which is a shame because it looks like the actors were doing their best to turn in good performances. Considering the by-now famous production problems this film suffered, I guess I should have considered myself warned. This film isn't scary, nor is it intelligent. It's just a mess.Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never really found The Exorcist very scary, really. It was more a thriller in my mind - perhaps because I'm not catholic or religious. However, I did find Exorcist: The Beginning much creepier and a lot more gory. I really enjoyed getting the info on a lot of the details that were never revealed in The Exorcist, namely Father Merrin's history. I had always wondered what was up with that little stone "thing" Merrin had in the beginning of the movie.I did feel this could've been a much scarier film but all in all very entertaining. A good twist or two as well. For those fans of The Exorcist I'm sure you'll enjoy the prequel if for nothing else than the background of the exorcist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsgare) is haunted by the choices he had to make at his parish in Holland during World War II. Someone killed a German soldier, and a Nazi officer had the people of Father Merrin's parish lined up in the street. He told Father Merrin, `that God is not here today,' and then he proved it by killing the people of his parish. Father Merrin's faith was tested that day, and he could no longer call himself a man of God. Merrin is in Cairo wandering the world in search of the truth in a bottle. He is hired by a collector to remove an ancient relic from a Christian Byzantine church that was discovered in Kenya. After the church is excavated from the sand, strange things begin to happen to the villagers, and the British soldiers. Merrin finds a hidden cave beneath the church, which ends up being the place where Evil was born on earth. Father Merrin finally finds truth. If you saw the first Exorcist, you can watch this one with your eyes open. The Exorcisms scene in the cave was the only scary part of the movie.

		<fullReview>I have a hard time understanding horror fans because I'm such a big one myself. I am however not a huge exorcist fan although I found some genuinely creepy moments in the third. I am however a fan of artist Renny Harlin. Say what you will but his films rock (Deep Blue Sea, Long Kiss Goodnight). His direction is always taut and intense and he manages to make the most unbelievable stories beyond entertaining. And boy does he pack the thrills into this puppy. Laced with slight humor, decent performances, cool spfx and an intense and suspenseful storyline. The film follows a pre Exorcist Father Merrin and chronicles his first encounter with the Demon Pazzuzu. To give anymore away would be unfair. And the folks at Warner have done a nice job keeping the film's secrets under wraps. I can't imagine there being abetter version of this film so I'm gonna say they made the right decision. The new chapter of the Exorcist series outdoes the rest. Yes I know thats a sacrilege to most, but there it goes I said it. The movies is just good, scary, fun!!! But people I guess will always find reasons to complain, I'm not sure what they went in expecting. But I definitely got my money's worth. Good Story, Great scares!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, the very best film experiences are sometimes the ones that are the hardest work. If you don't work at this one, you'll be stuck at the John Carpenter level. But if you do...Consider it this way. Some movies are made by fundamentalist Christians as part of their battle with the devil. These depict a battle with the devil, in fact the very same battle. Even though I'm an unbeliever, by my very act of watching, I become a weapon in that battle. Pretty terrifying if you think of it, especially if you believe in created realities (which you must when you watch movies).It doesn't matter if these fundamentalist movies are bad, in fact it is better because you maintain your dual perspectives: in the movie and aware of watching it. And in any case, with Pat Robertson's billion dollar film school, these will get better. Indeed, many people thought Mel Gibson's film was competent.Now to this movie. We have one film, the original "Exorcist." It is thirty years in our past and twenty-five years in the future of the main character. We know, but he doesn't. That's always in the background, that one layer of reality.Then we have another film, the one Paul Schrader made using this same crew and sets. It is made from the perspective of the priest. It is cerebral, based on human needs and weaknesses. It is humanistly cinematic. We don't see that film, we only imagine it (which we can readily do since Schrader's imprint is heavy on Hollywood). Another reality.And then we have the film the studio bosses remade. This one is made from the perspective of the devil. It is cinematic ally evil: lots of fetid maggots, implied Crowley-like perverted sex (only meekly implied), requisite Nazis, simpleminded natives (borderline in the racist stereotypes here), thickheaded Brits and scheming, lying priests. Each of these vie for control of the narrative.So we have a struggle for narrative control within this one movie. We have the larger battle between the priest's movie (which we can only imagine) and the devil's movie (to which we give money and energy before it even starts). Us as a weapon in that battle as well.I cannot image anything more horrifying. Doesn't matter if it is poorly done or not. This is real.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

The only reason i even watched the whole movie is that i was having a laugh at all the ridiculous and pathetic attempts to make something scary. Every time there was gonna be a "scare" you could hear the music building up the tension, and i sit there and wait for it and......boo? no, every time it ended up in a big laugh at the pathetic attempt to scare. I watched it almost half an hour ago and i still giggle about it. For a laugh this movie is OK but as a horror movie it just has to be the biggest failure....ever.I could go on wasting my time describing how pathetic this movie is, but it's just not worth any more of my time, i write this just to warn others not to waste their time on this joke for a movie.

		<shortDescription>prequels are absolutely worthless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both of these prequels are absolutely worthless pictures, they detract from the brilliance and realism of the first film, which is a superb endeavor. They suffer from an inability to commit to serious script writing, story and funding, what they have created instead is an extremely "dumb downed" version that should have never been made at all. It is obvious they were made for the "MTV generation", as they do not notice the subtle errors which have been egregiously made. Sub-par acting dominates each of them, stilted corny dialogue, written by the inept writer for the masses, Caleb Carr, douses any suspense at all. The film stock also detracts, as it appears that reality is only an imitation, take for example some shots of a cave, they appear to be well lit and inside a fake set, the church itself resembles a piece of plastic, the statues are styrofoam, and the CGI is offensive to the eye. The original was actually filmed in Syria in historic ruins, which added to the mystery, you will also notice that nothing is really "believable" such as what you found in the films from the 1970's, the faces of actors are clean or have some fake blood or dirt smeared on them and the lighting is too bright. The costuming is even worse, and black workers speaking on equal terms to the whites is only rewriting history to explain the storyline to dumb audiences. Plainly, these are some of the worse films that I have ever been forced to see, they should only be watched for their assumptions about how greed has permeated the film industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Exorcist: The Beginning" really isn't that bad in the series.**SPOILERS**Working in Egypt in 1949 as an archaeologist, Father Merrin, (Stellan Skarsgard) is asked to find a rare artifact in a dig. When the Vatican hear of this, they offer him another assignment instead: a ruined church found buried in Egypt. Accompanied to the site by Sarah, (Izabella Scorupo) Father Francis, (James D'Arcy) they find the church, but Merrin quickly finds that it is much older than it should be. Almost immediately afterwards, strange events begin plaguing the campsite, Merrin is convinced supernatural forces are at work. As the hauntings around the camp continue, they begin to believe that Merrin maybe right.The Good News: I was actually rather impressed with this one. While by no means a great film, it isn't that bad either. This is certainly a gorier film, and is actually quite bloody. Most of this is in the final battle, which delivers some nice gruesome gore in decapitations, stabbings, slicing, and much more, as well as periodically happenings as well. It's most gruesome scene is that of a chilling animal mauling. The jump that precedes it is quite classic, and is totally unexpected. The film has a great many scenes that features the goings-on at the campsite, which are the best scenes in the movie. Many of them are quite creepy, and while not exactly original, they get the job done of getting the viewer creped out. A lot of them could be seen coming, but it's the overall package that works, as all of the events coming together that do the job. All of the happenings do a great job of building an atmosphere of evil. It's a nice look for the film, that it has this and still manages to pull off some nifty gore effects when needed to.The Bad News: This film just doesn't make any sense. It's all implications in here, as nothing is really explained as a matter-of-fact. It's quite aggravating when things get out of control and nobody tells why. It's the main reason against the film, but it isn't the only one. The fact that it's ending is so closely inspired by the first one that it's amazing no one was sued. He may have wanted to homage the first one, but this one goes all the way to out-and-out plagiarism. Mainly, these are it. The rest of what everyone didn't really like about this one never really bothered me all that much.The Final Verdict: Don't ask for too much understanding of the plot here and you should be fine. It certainly isn't the greatest horror movie ever, but it wasn't trying to either. It was just a little fun flick that centered around demonic possession, and it's not a total waste. Give it a shot, it isn't that bad.Rated R: Intense demonic themes, Graphic Violence, Brief Nudity and some language</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Horror, The Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any filmmakers presumptuous enough to make a prequel to what is arguably the most beloved horror film of all time sure as hell better know what they're doing. Those responsible for "Exorcist: The Beginning" most decidedly do not, for this is a trite, tiresome film that never comes even close to duplicating the power and imagination of the 1973 original, settling instead for run-of-the-mill suspense sequences and more devil-on-the-loose clichés than one can shake a crucifix at.The film is set in Kenya in 1949, where a church has recently been discovered inexplicably buried for 1500 years. Merrin, a former-Catholic-priest-turned-archaeologist (and the Max Von Sydow character in the original "Exorcist"), is called in to investigate this perplexing phenomenon (the church is a surprise because apparently Christians didn't send missionaries to that part of the world till many centuries later). As soon as he arrives there, bizarre occurrences begin to happen - animals act strangely, people disappear without a trace, furniture moves by itself etc. - implying that Satan himself may be alive and well in the vicinity.Rather than employing either originality or inspiration, "Exorcist: The Beginning" instead dutifully trots out all the requisite devil-movie clichés it can lay its dirty little hands on: the ex-cleric undergoing a crisis of faith, who, nevertheless, finds himself doing battle with forces he no longer believes exist; the original head of the investigation, driven to madness by evil forces, who now spends his time locked up in an insane asylum drawing pictures of devils and demons ad infinitum; the representative from the Vatican whose sole job it is to make the Church look good even if that means engaging in cover-up, deceit and subterfuge. Director Renny Harlin can't bring any of this to life, mainly because his style is so redolent of the hundreds of other such films that have appeared since the original "Exorcist." The predictable phony scares, the red herring dream sequences, and the electric power going out at the most inopportune moments all combine to make the film little more than a compendium of cheap Satanic thriller clichés. Even the digitized special effects are generally unconvincing and second-rate (particularly bad are the man-eating hyenas who, ironically, make US laugh instead of the other way around).As most people probably already know, "The Beginning" is actually the SECOND filming of this particular story. The first, directed by Paul Schrader, was, reportedly, too slow-moving and "unscary" for Warner Brothers execs to consider releasing. They then hired Harlin to completely re-shoot the script, with a couple of different actors in key roles. I haven't seen the Schrader version (entitled "Dominion"), but it is generally considered the finer of the two by those who have. There's a Tinsel Town irony for you: the poorer version is released instead of the better one, then it bombs at the box office anyway. Only in Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist: The Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exorcist: The Beginning is an existentially-moving, excellently-performed portrayal of Father Lancaster Merrin, whose faith had given way to skepticism, disillusionment, and despair, upon having encountered some of the worst evil in the human soul!--That is, until, ironically enough, this same faith had been restored--by what Sarah had well-described, and experienced herself, as the clearest view of God--from Hell!!! Or, as Burt Lancaster said, during one of his most passionately fiery sermons, in Elmer Gantry, "How do I know there's a mercifully loving God? Because I've seen the Devil plenty of times!" Ordinarily, Satan takes care of one such as Father Merrin with the assistance of creatures such as Father Barre, from Ken Russell's The Devils, and their cleverly-disingenuous capacity to emphasize, in the words of Barre, "That what you see here is, not dignity, but pride, unrepentant pride!" . . . It's tragically and understandably characteristic, particularly with relation, ironically enough, to the goodness of human nature, to view the greatest evil in it as well, as virtual "proof" that there cannot possibly be any God, consistently at all, philosophically speaking, with even such a possibility, let-alone the most woundingly shattering experiences of its actual reality to help burn in the point more completely, sentiently as well. But, when Satan finally unmasks his supernatural qualities, for all the world to see (Revelation 13:13-15), it will be for the well-calculated purpose of further bolstering Father Barre's position; which too many prefer to believe, anyway, despite the perhaps equal number of agnostics whom Satan shall thereby help forfeit to God in the process (Revelation 7:9-17)!!! . . . When Satan makes his very identity as well as existence so undeniably clear (which is why he "hides" himself, as a generally, modernly, agnostically "civilized" rule, but not to those already primitively superstitious enough to be more effectively, unedifiably manipulatable in the opposite way; just as Pharaoh's magicians, in The Ten Commandments, only "helped" him to believe, even more firmly, that he must have been "really on to something!"), it is impossible for any coherently thinking person to avoid, not only concurring with Burt Lancaster, as, again, the dynamically though simplistically, negatively misunderstandable Elmer Gantry, when he also similarly said, to his good friend, so superlatively played by Arthur Kennedy, that, "If there's a real hell, then it follows there must be a real heaven," but also neutralizing rather than enhancing Satan's effectiveness. Even Roddy McDowall, in Fright Night, quite glaringly as well as "amusingly" serves to illustrate this point; in conjunction with the slickest, most dynamically-animated vampire I've ever seen, played so masterfully by Chris Sarandon! . . . Although, where, again, even "civilized" people go, allegedly true tales such as The Amityville Horror continue to successfully abound; at indulging one of Satan's favorite pastimes, of convincing people, quite unscripturally, that particularly the murdered dead really do haunt their houses! It's not just intellectual ignorance which causes people to miss the mark, even when they do encounter anything "miraculous," but the basically instinctive will to unholiness (Luke 16:29-31) (James 2:19); even if that will can no longer avoid having to indulge itself, within a Christian frame of reference, by conveniently mistaking Satan's miracles for those of the real God. . . . Of course, the most tragic irony of all, which remains seriously unaddressed in the film, and, thus, even more cleverly because "implicitly" denied in the process; would perhaps have also at least "implicitly" come into somewhat clearer focus, if not, much more likely, prevailingly, overshadowingly, the very opposite (as Rome's very ability to "drive out" the Devil, in his most conveniently, nakedly, and yet even quite "cooperatively untransparent" form, had been so "clearly, undeniably confirmed!"), in terms of Satan's most cleverly sinister capacity to deceive, had the setting of the story been--Rome--rather than Kenya!--II Thessalonians 2:1-12--Galatians 1:6-9!--Revelation 2:12-15--II Corinthians 11:12-15!!!--And numerous other passages which collectively fit together into the most amazingly scriptural pattern!

		<shortDescription>Why bother making another disaster???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was talked about being made, it was somehow clearly stated that it will take place many years before the original Exorcist took place. Also it was said that it will be based on the flashbacks of Father Merrin that took place on The Exorcist 2. Now, what the hell does everything that happened in this film has to do with those flashbacks from the second Exorcist film??? Here is Father Merrin doing his first exorcism on a girl, not a young African boy, like the flashbacks. Which makes me believe that probably that exorcism with the young African boy from the second Exorcist, was his second encounter on Africa with Pazuzu.Overall, this one is not much of a disaster, since it does has its scary moments, but it still left a lot of questions unanswered.If there is ever another Exorcist sequel, please make sure whoever makes it watch the original plus the sequels and try to come up with an excellent plot this time and also, please, have Dick Miller back on the special effects and make up chair...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prequel to the legendary Exorcist might not scare as much as its 'predecessor' did in the 70s, but it does an excellent job of giving an explanation for the Exorcist which doesn't stretch credibility.Stellan Starsgard (Good Will Hunting) is Merrin, a priest who lost his faith, who's assigned to investigate the possible existence of a mysterious artifact within a church in Africa whose existence isn't understood by anyone, including the Vatican. No one knows who built it, or why, so Merrin heads in to investigate despite having no faith in religion any more. Suffice to say the church is centre of an apparent air of evil which hangs over the area, and the local tribesmen refuse to enter it, but the more the investigation thickens, the deeper the evil seems to be...This is basically a horror story with extremely religious connotations and overtones, obviously enough given the nature of 'the sequel', and it does a great job of getting the balance between scripture/evil/devil narrative, and plausibility accurate. Obviously it's not the most believable story in principle, but in execution it honestly never seems that ridiculous, a fact aided by uniformly good acting.The direction is fast and furious, but defies the usual Hollywood fare of being a dumb gorefest without any intelligence in the picture. Indeed, without giving much away, the movie is a heck of a lot better than I had expected from it. It retains the biblical powerhouse qualities of the 'sequel' but adds a touch of finesse in terms of overall intensity aided by some nice special effects and convincing makeup.It may not quite leave the legacy of its older brother, but it more than warrants viewing.</fullReview>

All I want to say is "This Movie was very good and I was very surprised by the Average Rating on here!".Stellan Skarsg?rd as Father Merrin was absolutely Fantastic and he really is a great actor. Not to forget Izabella Scorupco who plays Sarah. She was also very good but I know shes brill because I've seen Reign of Fire and Vertical Limit. There are also many, many great supporting roles. I cant really fault anything Renny Harlin did in this Movie. Cracking Film that should be seen not just by Fans but by casual Horror/Thriller Watchers like myself! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has to be the most horrific ever! I jumped up and down all the time. And even though I don't usually scream, I must admit that I did... The effects were amazing! the sound incredible! and the main Swedish character outstanding! I kept telling myself: "Its only a movie", but it didn't seem to help. I couldn't calm down and in 1 and a half hour I was totally pumped with adrenalin. And then when it all ended, you were left back, totally exhausted, feeling like the king of the world, because you made it to the end.I don't know why people rate this film so low??? Maybe people ran out of the movie too horrified to go back and see the rest and then just gave it 4. Maybe they were too scared???Maybe the film was so so so so so so scary that people found it bad!? Anyway this it is without a doubt the most freakiest film ever!!!I give it 10!!! Frederik</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello,For anyone who is in love with the first Exorcist as much as I am how happy you must be to have seen this film. I went in to this movie with low expectations(as you have to do with todays horror films) and came out extremely satisfied.One thing about this film that I was curious to see, was whether they were going to scare you with disturbing images,as they did in the first. Or do the typical "jump from the shadows" scare tactic. Well, if you saw this film you know that they did both,and a beautiful job at that. I felt that the majority of the film was "jump from the shadows" method, witch is fine, but I think that disturbing imagery was what allowes the first film to scare the hell out of you still thirty years later.Anyways, Loved the film,loved the special effects, so happy they did the spider walk again. Could not be more pleased with this film. Later</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously this movie didn't even even come close to the original, but all in all it was a good film. Every scary scene had my heart racing and wondering what was around the corner. I really liked how the movie was very very dark. It made you feel as if you were there in person, and it really gets to you. I thought the story was very well written and the flashbacks were very intense to say the very least. Being a fan of the original I know what this franchise needed and this is exactly that! The only flaw that I found was the CGI effects. They came across looking too fake at times, but all in all it wasn't too bad. But the film was very well written and directed. Its a must see!!!Great work Renny Harlin!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most unique series in the history of the cinema still surprises over 30 years after the world first experienced William Friedkin's original masterpiece in 1973 as "The Exorcist" had people running from the theaters and to the nearest church. The commercial and critical success would lead to arguably the worst big studio movie ever produced in 1977 ("Exorcist II: The Heretic"). The original writer (William Peter Blatty) rubbished the sequel, but came back in 1990 with a sequel of his own ("Exorcist III: Legion"). Although his original text did not even have an exorcism, he was pressured by the bigwigs in the studio to add one. We were left with a near-miss that had lots of potential but ultimately was only minimally successful. Friedkin and Blatty would argue for nearly three decades over the original product and a version we had never seen before hit the movie houses in 2000. While critically inferior to the 1973 release, the craze was back strong as the film was a box office smash some 27 years after it was born. Thus another installment was inevitable. But what if, just what if there were two movies made? Two prequels in other words. Could it be possible? Well of course the law of average says no, but when it comes to "The Exorcist" there is no law, no average. The subject matter has always been beyond science, beyond superstition, beyond the cinema and beyond the human imagination. "Exorcist: The Beginning" is actually a very strange footnote in cinematic history due to the fact that the original prequel (Paul Schrader's "Dominion") was panned by the studio and received unfavorable reviews from test critics. The powers that be panicked and re-shot the entire concept with a different script, a different director (Renny Harlin) and many new primary performers. Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) has lost his faith and given up on the priesthood after atrocities in his native Holland by the Nazi regime during World War II. He is approached to look for an artifact on an archaeological dig by a shady collector (Ben Cross) in Kenya. It seems that there is a church that was built by the Byzantines during the 5th Century at the outer limits of their empire. The church is anything but normal though as anti-Christ aspects are abound. The Vatican has also sent a priest (James D'Arcy) to investigate the exotic locale. A doctor (former Bond Girl Izabella Scorupco), a guide in the early stages of what appears to be leprosy (Alan Fox), an African tribal leader (Eddie Osei) and a British military commander (Julian Wadham of "The English Patient" glory) make up the key players surrounding the highly mysterious scene. Soon supernatural happenings occur and it appears that a young boy (Remy Sweeney) is the cause for the disturbances. Is the demon Pazuzu inside the youngster and creating the chaos? "Exorcist: The Beginning" has been laughed at and criticized by the masses, ultimately dying quick at the box office. However, there are some real strong elements to this misunderstood film. Friedkin's version worked because it was deep and complex. It was a sociology, psychology and spiritual lesson to us all. That is where the first two sequels failed. I never did understand what the first sequel was about and the second one was more of a supernatural cop thriller. The focus here goes back to Merrin and we learn everything we need to know to understand this highly enigmatic character. The movie is full of stomach-churning scenes and shocking images, but there are also questions raised about man and his relationship with God. It also deals with unsubstantiated racism, sexism, clashing cultures and the human curse we all possess to react on impulses rather than thinking situations out. The whole point of the series has always been that if you have that little void that can be compromised spiritually, it will be with dire results. Harlin, never known for movies with much heart or emotion, does the best work of his life here. The film is smart, innovative and intriguing. This is a highly fascinating movie that is not a masterpiece by a long-shot, but I understood what the film-makers wanted to do. If looked at from a certain angle, "Exorcist: The Beginning" conveys a strong central view that the original film had and even Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" possessed. Spellbinding, hypnotic, symbolic and intelligent. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Exorcist: The Beginning" is a better movie than you would think. This is a good, grown up psychological horror movie. Let me start out by saying I am a big fan of all the "Exorcist" movies, and after seeing the trailer I really thought this movie was going to be bad. I was very pleasantly surprised. This movie has one big thing going for it, a very different story. I was happy to see that there was no "head spinning" or "pea soup" scenes. They took the idea of "The Exorcist" and took it in a completely different direction. I don't think this movie is a classic, but with the crap horror movies that get made these days, this one stands up very well. I rank it right up there with the under-rated "Exorcist III". Overall this movie will please all horror fans that like to use their minds. If you're looking for a slasher, this isn't it. I can see that it has become popular to go on line and rip movies, and this movie doesn't play to those 18 year old kids. This is a grown up horror movie, and if you let it get into your head, it will scare you. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Introduction for a Classic Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1949, in Cairo, Egypt, the archaeologist and former priest Merrin (Stellan Skarsg?rd) has a meeting with Semelier (Ben Cross), the representative of a millionaire that is interested in an antique piece hidden in a circa 5 A.D. buried Christian church discovered in East of Africa in a British colony. Merrin lost the faith in God in the WWII, when he was obliged to select ten victims for a Nazi officer, and accepts the work. Together with the Catholic Father Francis (James D'Arcy), assigned by the Vatican to investigate how a church could be mysteriously built in a place 1,500 years before the records of the first church in the area, they travel to the spot with the authorization of the British command. They meet with Dr. Sarah (Izabella Scorupco), a woman that was brutalized by the Nazis in the war that is responsible for the local hospital, and while investigating, they realized that the church was built to protect the area against an evil force, which has been released along the excavations.I liked the "Exorcist: The Beginning". The story satisfactorily explains the origin of the character of Father Lancaster Merrin of the classic 1973 "The Exorcist", a decadent man who faces an evil force after losing his faith in God and returns to his path of "Man of God". Stellan Skarsg?rd has an excellent performance; the story and atmosphere are good; the special effects are only reasonable, specially the hyenas attacking the boy, which is not convincing. I am not fan of sequels, but this one worked very well, in spite of the non-favorable reviews in IMDb. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Exorcista: O Começo" ("Exorcist: The Beginning")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, opening night at midnight. Any better time to see the movies? Especially horror movies. Maybe that's what got to me, because I am a little surprised by the rating of 4.7. I thought this had to be the best Exorcist sequel. The first is the best of course, then "the Beginning", then "The Herotic", and the third one come in place. That's just my opinion.This movie scared the crap out of me. I was screaming and so was the other audience members. A group of teens walked out saying "This is too scary for me, man!". Of course it could of been a joke but I doubt it. There was more than a few screams and jumps. The ending gets to be more great than the beginning. So, give it a chance.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exorcist: The Beginning (2004) * 1/2 (out of 4) Prequel that's all over the place. The attempt is nice and the story works better than I expected but Harlin's direction is all over the place and it's clear the guy can't tell a story to save his life. The first hour is deadly slow and boring but at the hour mark I really started to enjoy the film until the final exorcism where it fell apart again. The stylish, MTV look of the film took away any chance for suspense and the CGI effects were really bad. The effects in the original film hold up a lot better than this. If this prequel did one thing it made me appreciate the original a lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING (2004) and, while I can say that it wasn't as totally worthless as I had been led to believe - or had fully expected, this being a Renny Harlin film after all - (certainly not so outrageously bonkers as Boorman's EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC [1977], thankfully) it still wasn't anything to write home about. The plot line sounded promising enough and the slow build-up during the first hour or so (echoing the original film to a certain degree) kept the interest going...that is, until the special effects took over - and what little psychology there had been got thrown out the window!The cinematography, unsurprisingly, is the best of it and particularly the scenes shot in the buried church. The CGI effects and obligatory 'demon-on-a-rampage' climax were laughable, however, and the overall epic/blockbuster 'look' (as opposed to the more intimate settings of, at least, the first and third entries in the series) made it feel closer in style and effect to those despicable 'revisionist' MUMMY films made by another multiplex-catering hack (and a studio which, like Warner Bros. in this case, ought to treat its horror legacy with far greater respect)!!One thing I feel that this entry lacked above all else (beside the inherent craftsmanship and intelligent writing) when compared to Friedkin's 1973 original and Blatty's remarkable-but-compromised THE EXORCIST III (1990) is the mixture of awe and dread which they inspired in the viewers - enabling in this way a genuine 'shaking' of the faith, whatever their disposition. As for Stellan Skarsgard, I never for a moment believed him as a younger version of Fr. Merrin as personified by Max von Sydow in the earlier film: he simply came off as too aloof, even in his cynicism, and by the end there's little sign of his subsequent authority and experience, virtues supposedly acquired through his clash with evil here...though the less-than-memorable, not to mention all-too-brief, 'confrontation' offered by the film, I guess, is mostly to blame for that deficiency!In any case, I'm really curious to watch Paul Schrader's alternate version and I hope it gets a theatrical release over here too in the near future...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I didn't like the original 1975 original movie. I expected a lot when it was advertised as the most thrilling horror film of the all times. But what I got was a boring stupidity. I even remember sleeping during the climax of the movie. When I heard there is a prequel to this movie in production, I thought it would be another crap. Even though I went to the cinemas (it was the first film I watched in 2005 more specifically January 2nd). I just wanted to know how they are going to place that ridicules origins into the past.Exorcist The Beginning (Spoilers******) Prequel to the original, this film traces the story of Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsg?rd) several decades earlier. In 1944 Holland, Merrin is forced to make a decision about the fate of several villagers - a choice which will haunt him for years to come. Years later while serving as a missionary in Kenya, he's brought in to find out the truth about what's happening to a group of native villagers after a strange Christian church is uncovered by an archaeological expedition. Inside that church lies a dark secret, and will give Merrin the greatest challenge of his life.The movie is far from the original but Stellan Skarsg?rd makes it to be in touch. He did a brilliant performance especially in those flash back scenes in Holland. Plus it's a story from William Wisher the co-writer of Terminator 2nd. I was amazed to know that he got the chance to rewrite the birth story of Exorcist. It's a great one from him after his T2: Judgment day.All in all it was a director's movie. Renny Harlin got another one to work his 'confused' twisted talent, this time in a new way. He brought me some of the Best and the Worst movies (Cliffhanger &amp; Driven, respectively). What ever people say, I like this Guy. He has done tremendous effort to make this as a bolder chapter in Exorcist franchise. A good example is the opening scene. His ability to blend visual effects within the story line was marvelous.This movie did not give the usual unforgettable scenes but give some good memorable ones.The flashbacks of Father Merrin in Holland where the Nazi soldiers murdering the innocents. Forcing the Father for pointing out the people, the chief aims his pistol towards a child and says "God is not here today, priest". This one scene makes this movie a better one than the old crap. A good film from Renny Harlin. And all the NON/HARDCORE Exorcist movie fans who expect sissy frightening and child sexual violence from this movie, sorry flocks this is totally not for you; Go and watch some illegal child pornography, you Psychos.!I give this movie 8 out of 10.</fullReview>
