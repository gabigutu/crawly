		<shortDescription>Not Amazing, but 100 Times Better than Exorcist: The Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this a couple of nights ago at a media screening in New York. There are no spoilers in this review.Just to preface this, I am a HUGE fan of the Exorcist. It is the greatest horror movie ever made, and perhaps one of the greatest films ever made period. With no major expectations, I saw the Harlin version last year just hoping for a somewhat scary sequel movie. I cannot tell you how irritated I was by it. I was so annoyed that I actually wrote a letter of complaint to Morgan Creek Pictures demanding my money back. What bothered me the most is that Exorcist: The Beginning made no effort to keep the same aesthetics as the original. The 1973 classic had very little gore or special effects. It was more about strong directing, good sound editing, and building mood and atmosphere. Harlin's version, on the other hand, was more of an action movie along the lines of The Mummy or Van Helsing, only with more R rated thrills: loads of gore, loads of special effects, none of it the least bit scary.Well, once I found out about the Paul Schrader version I became obsessed with wanting to see it. From what I heard it was more in the spirit of the original Exorcist and more of a "thinking man's film". Plus it was written by Caleb Carr, author of one of my favorite novels: The Alienist. I was even more excited when I found out they were releasing it in the theaters this year.So onto my review...I wasn't exactly "blown away" by Dominion, but it's 100 times better than "The Beginning". It at least maintains those aesthetics that I described above. It's not a straight up horror movie, there's probably only 2 or 3 real scares in the whole film, but those scares are far more terrifying than any of the cheap fun house type thrills that Harlin's version has to offer. Although the big scares are minimal, there's loads of creepiness in the movie. It manages to make you feel uneasy the whole way through. I didn't have a hard time falling asleep that night, but I did wake up in the middle of the night kind of bothered thinking about some of the weird images that were burned in my brain.From the beginning, what I liked immediately is that it was kind of grainy and looked like a 15 or 20 year old movie. There was something old fashioned about the style of film-making which made me feel like I truly was in Africa during the 1940s....much more so than the other slick Hollywood version. The cinematography is excellent. Much like a David Lynch film, you need to see it on the big screen because there's so much detail to enjoy that can be missed on a small television screen. My favorite scenes revolve around the archaeological expedition of an ancient temple buried in Africa. As they're exploring the catacombs under the temple, there's some bizarre faces carved into the rock. They don't jump out and say, "boo!" but they creep you out as your eyes discover them on their own terms.I definitely took this version much more seriously. It's a very emotional film: many scenes managed to make me feel upset, bothered, unsettled, and sometimes even disturbed. Even simple scenes like people getting shot were so much more upsetting in their treatment. It also was successful in getting me to think about god, religion, and faith the same way that the first Exorcist did.Of course Dominion does have it's flaws:-Some of the acting could have been better and I can understand the need to do some recasting. The Nazi officer in the beginning wasn't the least bit intimidating. And Father Merrin's assistant Father Francis had sort of a Keanu Reeves quality about him. That's probably the biggest advantage that the first Exorcist has over this film. When you watch that movie, the actors are much more convincingly terrified. And that's what makes a great horror movie. Fear is a learned response. If the viewer is convinced that the actor is scared, then he/she gets scared, too. There's no substitute for good acting, not with all the special effects in the world.-There's very little special effects in this movie, but the few scenes that do have CGI are really bad. There is no reason to use computer effects to portray animals such as jackals, cattle, scorpions, etc. Get the real thing or use puppetry. This movie did not need special effects.-The ending climax scene, the confrontation between Father Merrin and the devil, could have used a little bit more intensity. I felt like he got through that scene much too easily, considering that in the first Exorcist, one priest died and the other was brought to near death during the exorcism. Stellan Skarsgard didn't even break a sweat! William Friedkin would have worked him to the ground. This scene kind of reminded me of a Star Trek episode.If you are at all interested (and are still reading this), these are my personal letter grades to the Exorcist films I have seen:Exorcist (1973) A+, Exorcist: The Beginning (2004) F, Dominion: A Prequel to the Exorcist (2005) B-Although not perfect, I think 75% of Dominion was salvageable. There was no reason to scrap it and make an entirely different, much worse version. With some minor changes, Dominion could have been raised a whole letter grade into a very scary, very respectable, and probably very successful installment into the Exorcist franchise and at much less cost, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is fantastic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go into this film thinking you are going to see twirling heads and pea-soup you are going to be disappointed. If you go into this film with an open mind you will be pleasantly surprised by the depth, sophistication, spiritual drama, and sheer craft involved. There is meat to this picture. I think the artists involved rightly avoided trying to best or even mimic the original and instead focused on dread-- a creeping sort of existential dread-- instead of cheap, quick scares. You don't jump in your seat with fear, but you walk out of the theater feeling unnerved and it stays with you. Unlike most of the American popcorn horror flicks being made today, this film lingers in your head long after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore "Should have gone straight to video" review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another reviewer claims this film was just "Exorcist: The Beginning" with some "extra footage" added. Anyone who has been following the history of the production of this film know this is not the case.This is the film that Paul Schrader shot and edited. The studio was unhappy with the results, fired him, and brought in Reny "Die Hard" Harlan to re-film it. The resulting Harlan film tanked at the box office, so Schrader was given permission to fully finish and release "Dominion" as a separate film. If anything, this is a chance for film fans to see the "Exorcist" prequel they had been promised before the studio big-wigs stepped in and brought in a hack director to "bloody it up".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid. Unexpected, effective film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exorcist: The Beginning was an ineffective film that contains everything I hate about current genre films: impatient editing and storytelling, lines of dialogue that stop just when some characters are about to actually say something, bombardment of CGI visuals and some seriously unnecessary gore effects that are akin to the movie-makers hitting the audience over the head with a Warner Brothers iron anvil normally reserved for their cartoon characters. What a nice surprise it was to finally see DOMINION on it's (unfortunate) limited run. Here is a movie that doesn't assume the audience is too stupid to actually sit down and take a story in without excessive music video stimuli. Here is a movie who's build-up is effective and will have many working hard to shake the uneasy feeling that, indeed, evil IS everywhere. There were some story elements from "The Beginning" that made no sense whatsoever. In this film - all is presented clearly, thoughtfully and much more unsettling (but it really hits you when the film comes to its climax). There is a scene in "The Beginning" where some crazed hyenas savage a character to shreds. Their appearance was curious and not presented as necessarily crucial to the film other than for one scene. In this film, just one look from them and you know right away they add to the whole atmosphere of the film. They are an ever present danger not only to the surrounding location but the always present evil watching humanity just out of sight and ready to attack when one is most vulnerable and alone. Another sequence featuring Father Merrin and Nazi soldiers is given a very clever, diabolic twist and adds MUCH to the notion of how the Devil deceives and tricks. In the other film, it's a scene where you know only that "this is what torments Father Merrin" - and that's it. Which is how this movie plays against Renny Harlin's "The Beginning" - an easy sell to the masses (it STILL didn't work). "Dominion" is a crafted piece where one single shot holds more story information than a 30 second sequence rife with vulgar, over-the-top digital effects. See this version - especially if believe that The Exocist story is actually more effective today than it EVER was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Shrader's exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was among the lucky ones to see this film in Brussels too. Are you going to like this film or not ? Well it all depends on what you expect. As a horror film fan, for me there is no doubt : no one will ever make a better Exorcist film as William Friedkin's original. They can make 100 more exorcists, the 1st will remain the reference, it was innovating in many ways. Exorcist 2 took its best horror sequences from the first one. Number 3 was a cop movie. Now we have numbers 4 and 5 with the same story and even the same actors sometimes. So where is the difference ? I saw them both but I did not expect to see a better movie than the first. It is probably why I liked them both. So if you prefer horror, well see Harlin's one, it is a decent successor. And if you like Paul Shrader' s movies, I don't think you will be disappointed with his version, witch is softer but deeper. But please, as he said to the public before the film : forget everything you have seen about the exorcist movies before and watch the film with a open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unequal to the Oiriginal, but Much Closer in Spirit Than 'Beginning'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made of the peculiarly Kafka-esquire journey of 'Dominion': originally in the hands of the late John Frankenheimer, the 'Exorcist' prequel project was turned over to Paul Schrader, director/screenwriter best known for dark, gritty, existential dramas such as 'Taxi Driver,' 'Hardcore,' and 'Auto-Focus.' Schrader delivered a film allegedly close in spirit to the original, but the suits were unsatisfied, feeling that the film they'd been given lacked the necessary frights to please the current audience for horror films. As has been amply explained, the original 'Exorcist' was itself much less a horror film than a psychological drama, spare of excessive fun-house shock value, but the audience has changed--younger, dumber, and trained to expect cheap thrills--and the decision was handed down to re-tool the film to add more special effects and gore. Schrader refused, was fired and replaced by Renny Harlin, who re-shot the film almost entirely with a significantly revised story, several new actors and characters, and a decidedly less cerebral approach. But Schrader's film was already in the can, and horror purists and Exorcist junkies were left to wonder what might have been--if, for once, there might be a sequel/prequel that made genuine efforts to add to a story's mythic tradition rather than merely to exploit its notoriety to sell tickets and popcorn.At last, we are able to weigh in on 'Exorcist prequel: take 1,' and while it certainly doesn't capture the original's aura of terror and dread, 'Dominion' reminds us that the most frightening terrors are in the subconscious and the imagination, and offers a more patient and believable glimpse into how Father Merrin first encountered the demon that would later find its way into a particular corner townhouse in Georgetown.Schrader's direction--aided by the camera of legendary cinematographer Vittorio Storraro--is patient but not without scope. They frame the African hill country beautifully, and while things at times seem a bit too clean and tidy, I didn't consider the film 'slow.' Skarsgard's Merrin is essentially the same character as in 'Beginning,' and while he isn't inadequate, his performance may be a bit too restrained. As in the Renny Harlin cut, we are told that Merrin has left the priesthood out of guilt and anger at God over a particularly horrific confrontation with man's inhumanity to man in Nazi-occupied Holland near the end of WW II. More is made of this back-story in 'Dominion,' but Merrin's crisis of faith seems less palpable and torturous than that of Damien Karras in 'The Exorcist,' so that his re-conversion to belief doesn't register the expected intensity. Gabriel Mann appears as Father Francis (due to schedule conflicts with the re-shoot, he was replaced by James D'Arcy in 'The Beginning'), and his tender, almost androgynous demeanor makes him an endearing and appealing character. Clara Bellar appears as Rachel, a character entirely written out of 'The Beginning' and replaced with a sexier version of the same, played by Bond girl Isabella Scurupco. Bellar is more believable as a nurse in East Africa, and her back-story creates a connection with Merrin, but she still seems a bit out of place (though certainly far more appropriate to the story than her counterpart in 'The Beginning'). Julian Wadham reprises his role as a tormented British Major, to strong and believable effect. The climactic confrontation with Pazuzu is entirely different in this film, and far more believable (and chilling). Nevertheless, there are some inconsistencies, and the framing of the exorcism scene lacks the intensity of the first film's, largely because the audience is never adequately introduced to the victim. A big part of what made 'The Exorcist' terrifying is that the audience is given the opportunity to watch the full transformation of a sweet, affectionate child into a bile-spitting, profane shell for a malevolent spirit. 'Dominion's victim is never fully introduced, and thus, the audience has less of an investment in his exorcism. In the end, however, this film far exceeds the quality of the amusement-park silliness of 'The Beginning,' and while it's not likely to break the bank, it is certainly the most respectable of the films based on Blatty and Friedkin's original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beats the "hell" out of Harlin's version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched DOMINION last night and found it to be excellent. The difference between this film and the Harlin film are like night and day. I love the slow build and the character of Cheche. Schrader delivers a film that not only comments on the balance and choice between good and evil, but also a great statement on colonialism. The only bad part is the choice of Gabriel Mann as Father Francis. Boy, he is awful ("Satan...is...here!"), especially when he is working of Skarsgard.But I can totally see why the studio panicked. Say what you want, but THE EXORCIST has become synonymous with vomiting, spinning heads and little girls cursing and I think that is what a majority of the audience expects or wants (based on my former dealings with customers at a video store and some heckled filled screenings). This is as far from that as possible and had they released this version, it would have died faster than Harlin's version or Blattey's own THE EXORCIST III (another film I think is brilliant but plummeted 60% its second week; yes I am a former box office nerd).Regardless, this is a horror film for anyone who wants to think. If you want spinning heads, cursing and vomit, go for the Renny Harlin version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong story concentrating on Merrin. Rich characterisation and a more subtle story than the Harlin action adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the second made but first to release Exorcist - The Beginning, the Renny Harlin version of the movie, I was very keen to see the original movie which the Studio saw and then scrapped, the Paul Schrader version.This I managed to do during the Edinburgh Film Festival 2005, and actually with paid tickets I managed to even get to hear a Q&amp;A with the Director, which in itself was extremely interesting. For now though, let's look at the movie.It's really hard to watch this and not do any comparisons with the Harlin remake, and with so many similar scenes, the same actors and a very similar story I found it almost impossible not to. In doing so you realise how weak and one dimensional Harlin's version is, the and depth of character and their development just adds so many layers to each of the characters, giving them a much more human feel and making you connect with them rather than just watch them as you did with the Harlin movie.Subtlety, dialogue and development are the keys here, things which were drastically missing from the Harlin version, and instantly you see the differences. The opening scene with Father Merrin and the Nazi's is the first strong example of the difference in style and Schrader handles this wonderfully. The single scene builds the Nazi character much thicker with some uncertainty of the Priest, whereas the Harlin is shown as a stock Nazi character. You also understand the root of the crisis in faith that Merrin has come to, and through this single scene it hits you just as hard as it did he.It's this that I felt was the strongest part of the movie throughout, the characters richness and depth, and the fact that you could see them as real individuals and connect with some part of them. Merrin in particular is the real focus of the movie, and the analysis of his crisis, his faith and who he really is.The following of the second, younger Priest in Father Francis, played well by Gabriel Mann, mirrors for Merrin the faith and hunger that he had as a young Priest, and watching his own slight crisis in faith provides an interesting viewpoint for the audience. Not only to understand what Merrin went through, but to watch Merrin witness this himself.Stellan Skarsg?rd plays the character superbly as well. There's so much more restraint in the performance with inward pain and anger, he's superb to watch and really does make you feel as though he carries a tortured soul. The slow climb out of the crisis to the fight back against the Demon is played slowly and with a lot of passion. It's the moment when Merrin relives the Nazi slaughter and his second choice that shows us who he really is as a person, not just as a Priest. Comparing the two performances of Skarsg?rd together is, as Schrader said, an example of a masterclass in acting. In fact the whole two movies are a film students dream.Another excellent character was Major Granville, very well played by Julian Wadham. He was far stronger, richer and deeper than the Harlin version, and his scenes were a lot more believable and striking than the Harlin version which had him going mad over his butterfly collection. Here he really plays a man getting out of his depth and letting events overtake him, and he has a superb scene in the village which provides with a strong connection to Merrins past.A couple of things that stuck out in the movie but were then understandable during Schraders Q&amp;A, were in the CGI and the famous flash of the Demon face. The face flash, which was so subtly done in the original Exorcist movies, was hugely prominent and did not hold with the subtlety in the rest of the movie. Some of the CGI was also poorly done, and during a sweeping camera shot across the front of the buried chapel the CGI rocks moved together as they tried to hold with the camera shot, the first appearance of the hyenas was also poor, showing as pure CGI and not looking in the least bit real.The script for this movie is very good, and in stark contrast to the Harlin version. This has less blood, more story and characterisation, and much more concentration on the personal battle between Merrin and the Demon. It provides a much more intelligent and subtle story building characters and the plot to a much more satisfying climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"God isn't here today."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dominion is a genuinely interesting and ambitious film that doesn't quite make it despite being superior to Harlin's enjoyably unambitious schlocky remake. More a drama about faith than a horror film, it's not even remotely chilling and in the hands of the director of the awful Cat People remake it's attempts to throw in a few shocks (or "trying to make the cow look like a horse" as he puts it on his heavily vetted audio commentary) simply don't work any more than the crude dream imagery straight out of a 40s noir ? he's just not interested in that sort of thing. He's much better at more human acts of violence: the suicide scene is a vast improvement on the terrible version in Harlin's film without the unnecessary supernatural trappings, while a pair of apparently arbitrary murders are all the more jolting for their human origin and the rationale behind them. For all its failings, the film is far from unsalvageable, and the decision to junk it and completely reshoot it with a new script, director and, in many cases, supporting cast seems a major over-reaction.It's also surprising just how little crossover there is between the two films ? not just the respective scripts and the themes, but how little footage was pressed into service on the remake (barely two minutes, most of it establishing shots and a brief deleted scene). It's also clear that the film is still uncompleted. The cgi is terrible and all too obviously unfinished and the score suffers from being performed on synths rather than by an orchestra, which gives it a demo/temp track effect that doesn't always help the film, but the biggest problem remains the direction. While co-writer Caleb Carr's complaints about Schrader having no visual sense are frankly bizarre ? it's by far his best looking movie and certainly his most cinematic ? he's unable to rack up much tension, particularly in the finale. Much of this seems to be due to his inability to inspire his cast: with much of the film played in long takes, many of the supporting players aren't up to the script and clearly aren't getting enough help (the wildly inadequate Clara Bellar suffering more than most in the role taken by Isabella Scorupco in the remake). While there isn't a performance as bad as Alan Ford's in the Harlin version, and a couple ? particularly Julian Wadham and a superb Ralph Brown ? are actually considerably better than the remake, the moral escalation of the very well-written prologue loses much of its power due to a flat performance from Antonie Kamerling's German officer. In Schrader's hands, it doesn't matter because we don't care because the performances don't convince us that it's real. Curiously, the sequence is much better handled in the Harlin version, where it's both better staged and more effectively utilised as a recurring flashback.On the plus side, he has a much better sense of time and place than Harlin. Whereas the remake looked like a glossy modern studio picture, this does have an old National Geographic visual quality that makes it look like it was actually shot in post-war Africa. The British troops, so cartoonish second time round, are much more convincingly of their time here, adding a surprising note of authenticity.The script is fairly intelligent and ambitious on the big themes but does drop the ball on the clumsily sketched relationship between Merrin and Rachel, with the audience having to take too much on faith with no real grounds: at times it feels like the actors are still waiting for another emotional scene to be written but are completely in the dark about its content. Similarly, it doesn't always deal with the issues it raises and, as with all the Exorcist follow-ups, it falls badly in the "we need an exorcism" finale. For once the film really does need to end with an exorcism, but when it strays outside the temple the shoddy cgi Northern Lights and Bellar's looney face just render the footage laughable. However, the substance of the Satanic threat is more interesting than conjuring tricks here, emphasising the great deceiver's nature as the father of lies, tempting not by offering future riches but by erasing the mistakes of the past that cause such torment.The catalyst is once again a possessed youth, in this case a crippled albino outcast who finds himself being cured by the demon. Naturally, the young missionary immediately mistakes it for a miracle and the boy as proof of God's love, before painfully learning the error of his ways, leaving Stellan Skarsgard's disillusioned Father Merrin to exorcise the boy and confront his own more personal demons. Schrader makes less of the battleground ? an elaborate ancient church deliberately buried in Africa hundreds of years ago ? without ever making it enough of an intimate story to compensate. But when it works, it works well, and it constantly holds your interest. Not quite a failure, not quite a success but certainly worth digging up.Even if you feel like giving up on it, make sure you watch the ending, where Schrader takes his obsession with The Searchers to new heights, lifting its final shot for a wonderfully outrageous homage as Skarsgard walks out of the door in a perfect imitation of Wayne's body motion to wander forever between the winds?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A metaphysical treatment of the story. Thoughtful and intense. Horror is implied in this film... you don't get beaten over the head with it as did the Harlin film. Schrader has always been a master at atmosphere and story over shocks and thrill rides. This is a thinking man's horror flick. You don't find many of those anymore. Remember the original "Haunting". The horror is left to the imagination. That always makes it much more scary. Remy Harlin's film was over the top, which is what the suits at Morgan Creek wanted. When monetary considerations come before artistic considerations, you usually get schlock. Paul Schrader made no such compromise... which is why he was canned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schrader's Rapture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schrader's version actually feels like it came before. there was nothing in Harlin's action movie version that looked like it took place before 2004. The most immediately noticeable difference in this version and Exorcist: the Beginning, is that it makes sense, though it is almost the same story. And, as a bonus, we actually care. Schrader actually had a "take" on the material. His vision, as is typical of Schrader, exalts old Hollywood, which is ironic considering he was canned for not being Hollywood enough. Everything from the cinematography, to the cast, to the effects, feel like it might have actually been made in the forties when it is set. The cast is infinitely superior to Exorcist: The Beginning. Gabriel Mann, in particular, stands out. Sarsgaard is back to his old self. Pop-star Billy Crawford is a far more appealing and believable martyr than the child and Geena Davis/Saffron Burrows look-a-like possessions in The Beginning.The make-up and effects are going to get bashed, but they too seemed as if they were meant to be intentional artifice. The characters' faces are clear and bright, instead of dusty, as they doubtlessly would be in that environment, and Cheche's bronzed, angelic demon god, covered in toe to bald head in glitter is obviously make-up, but he looks painted, like the androgynous rapture art covering the walls of the church. One has to admire Schrader for changing the make-up concept from Friedkin's original, which Harlin's version copied directly. One EXTREME slow motion shot is beautiful, as is a glittering dissolve. The skies during the climax look like the backgrounds of every store-bought portrait of Jesus or the saints, a high school photo day backdrop, or a Cecil B. DeMille movie. Either way, they make this film feel aged - in a good way. One brief shot is the fluorescent green of an Italian horror, and the dream sequence brings to mind Hitchcock's SPELLBOUND. Both Paul Schrader and Renny Harlin got screwed in this deal. Morgan Creek clearly didn't want either of the men they hired, and didn't believe in either vision. Had Harlin's done better business, Schrader's would have disappeared. Now, they release Schrader's to make up for the disappointing box-office of Harlin's, but they don't advertise at all, and they release it the same weekend as REVENGE OF THE SITH. They obviously want to fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing! 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I received a bunch of screener DVDs from a mate of mine. Dominion: A Prequel To The Exorcist was one of them, but I held off watching it because of a few bad comments and reviews that I had read - I'm glad I did, but not because it sucked. After watching some really bad films, today I sat and watched this. Dominion: A Prequel to The Exorcist renewed MY faith that there is hope for more amazing films like this. Dominion follows Father Merrin (who has lost his faith because of an incident with Nazis) on a dig in Africa, were he has uncovered an ancient church with a crypt (used for sacrifice) underneath. A crippled boy named Cheche is being helped by local doctor, Rachel, is effected when he crypt is opened, and his ruined arm and leg start to get better while everything else around them gets worse. Merrin must renew his faith and save the boy.This film has it's flaws, but so does The Exorcist. The only problems I have with this film is the FX and dialogue. Yes, I know it seemed impossible, but some of the dialogue (not all, only a few little scenes) were cheesier than Sarah's dialogue.. "Dont you wanna f*** me anymore?".. and this is coming from some of the lead characters. The special effects are worse than the Harlin version too. But I cannot really comment on that much, since I read Schrader did not have enough money to complete everything.The rest of the film had me glued to my seat feeling uneasy, just like he original Exorcist did to me. Stellan Skarsgard is so much more deep and realistic as a person than the hero Merrin he was in Harlin's version. Clara Beller was fantastic as Rachel, she was also a lot more real than the sex object Sarah was in Harlin's, and I felt for her more than Sarah (Even tho Izabell was great as Sarah, she was just too basic). Gabrial Mann was also fantastic in this film and he was much more involved than the Francis character in Harlins, and less cheesy, but more of a wimp, which makes him a more caring and likable character. When I read that a pop singer was going to be the possessed boy I was a bit worried, but this guy has a great future ahead of him. His performance of the crippled boy was touching, and as the Demon he is also amazing and does a really good job. This film is very different to the past Exorcist films. But that is not a bad thing. This is not Exorcist 2 The Heretic. This is realistic and makes me feel something I have not felt since I first watched The Exorcist. The possession in the film is like nothing I have ever seen. It is like a total reverse of the cliché Linda Blair look. The Demon isn't ugly and yelling disgusting things. He is more of a sexual god (it sounds weird, even funny, but trust me it is creepy as hell) who tempts people into joining him. At first I thought this was a bad idea, because people expect to see an horrific person screaming bad language, but people need to realize this is so much better than that cliché rubbish. This is not your average horror film, so keep that in mind if you expect to see one. There is gore, but its got style. It isn't random killings like in Harlin's. This film has a meaning, this film has a soul. I read Schrader said that you can't make a film better than the original, and I agree, but you can make one just as good, and he did.Now I am going to watch this amazing film again, so see you suckers (who are still waiting to see this) later! :PDJpout.</fullReview>

As usual he adds more depth and atmosphere than a thousand "screams" or "i know what your naughty neighbour did" Do yourself a favour crazy-gal and stick to the less demanding fair showing at your local multiplex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the Renny Harlin version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a keen fan of the exorcist series ever since the first movie came out. And I have to say the Director's cut pleased me much, however Exorcist: The Beginning by Renny Harlin did not follow the original movie's path at all. It's one of these modern Horror stories based High pitched sounds and sudden predictable events. When it comes to this one, it is not the case. The storyline is a bit slow in the beginning but like many other movies it is essential for the whole thing to wrap it's self up. I was pleased to see that the 'cave of snow', which is a sign of Renny Harlin being Finnish, was not includes in this story line, although the both movies are essentially the same, there are key differences that makes everything a whole lot more enjoyable. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating psychological horror film, very strong but with a rather disappointing ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I must say that I didn't see the Harlin version of the film so I can't compare. Somewhere I can understand that the producers were not really happy with the work Scharder delivered. They probably expected a pure horror film with lots of physical horror, thrills and FX.Finally what they got was a typical Scharder film (isn'that a bit normal when you hire the man as director?) about a priest having to cope with guilt and his lost in faith. Sure Scharder inserts 'supernatural' elements in it such as possession and exorcism but the horror remains psychological and becomes very rarely physical.The describing of the psychological hell father Merit has to undergo (when he find himself in the dessert right after the second world-war which was very traumatic for him, as we see in the overwhelming first scenes) was really very strong. It gets under your skin.Slowly the element of possession comes in (a young local boy) but Schrader remains focused on the internal Battle of father Merit. He struggles with himself, with his faith, searching for redemption: will he be strong enough to face 'the demon'? The film is very strong in depicting all of this and when inserting subtle but very convincing horror elements in to the story we know we're in for a (hopfully) strong climax.SPOILER - But the climax is rather disappointing. At this point Scharder switches from psychological horror to physical horror (the final exorcism scene). Apparently aware that he's making a horror-film after all. I've not really a problem with the modification of psychological horror into (more mainstream) physical horror: the original Excorcist uses the same 'formula' very convincingly.But the final exorcism scenes here aren't convincing at all, the special effects aren't believable at all, they rather look cheap and therefor this scenes really are a rupture with the rest of the film which actually looks great.So Scharder delivers a very strong, captivating, strange and fascinating 'horror-film', cleverly building up to a climax. And there the film goes wrong. Really a pity because the film could have been a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Dominion about three weeks ago and I'm still thinking about it. It's not the greatest movie ever made but it still was quite good despite its flaws (such as the lousy special effects).Does Satan influence humans to do evil? Yes, at least in the movie he does. He plays on anger and fear. He posses the young deformed native man but in a way he possess everyone and uses their anger, fear, and guilt against them. This is what made the film intriguing. I also loved the idea of the church being built over a pagan site to keep the evil at bay. Churches have been built over pagan sites maybe not for that reason but that made the film quite interesting as well. As Roger Ebert put it the "film takes evil seriously." You don't get that too often in horror films and in most American films. The film is not a jump at and scare you thriller it's scary in an intellectual way and that does not happen too often in films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Schrader began work on Exorcist: Dominion after the ailing John 'Island of Dr. Moreau' Frankenheimer left the thirty million dollar production and took to his deathbed. After the enormous success of The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen the studio intended to follow up with a prequel to relaunch their sporadic franchise and pinned their hopes on Schrader who was nominated for an Academy Award for Taxi Driver and screenwriter William Wisher who is best known for Terminator 2: Judgement Day. The story follows an emotionally scarred Lankester Merrin who travels to Africa as an archaeologist to investigate a church from the 5th century and how it came to be buried there predating the arrival of Christianity to the continent. The Studio fired Schrader from the project after executive screenings determined the film was unmarketable. Renny 'Cutthroat Island' Harlin was brought in to refilm a formal prequel called Exorcist: The Beginning based on a similar screenplay concept which ultimately recouped some of the investment but was met with poor reviews. Morgan Creek allowed Schrader to finish his movie with $35,000 allotted for special effects and left him on his own to score the film. The final cut, retitled; Dominion: Prequel to The Exorcist faired better with critics including Roger Ebert who wrote: "Dominion is not content to simply raise the curtain on William Peter Blatty's classic The Exorcist (1974) but it is more ambitious: it wants to observe the ways Satan seduces man.". It's not a great film by even Scraders' admission but it's a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting, and writing, and direction is astounding. The tone is a perfectly timed building of mystery and dread, and the opening scene is quite frankly unforgettable. I will say nothing here to avoid spoiling it, but for an actor who has just one scene the soldier who dominates that first Merrin confrontation was more terrifying than Christoph Waltz in "Inglorious Bastards". It wouldn't surprise me if Christoph secretly drew inspiration from him. It is truly shameful that the studio had an entirely different film shot in this ones place and then left this unfinished for so long, releasing the far inferior "The Beginning" directed by Renny Harlin. The special effects let "Dominion" down where because funding for this version was pulled, the director (Paul Schrader) went on to finish it anyway, with some crude FX shots. Underneath the shots that remind you this is a movie, is an immersing masterpiece waiting to be realised. Sadly it never will be, but I know it is under there. And I will always praise how close they came to it under the circumstances that the studio put them through. What a cast. What writer. What a director.</fullReview>

People who didn't enjoy this film are more occupied with the shock of the original "The Exorcist" and not as much interested in the story. Because, really, this is a very well-made and thoughtful movie. It surely doesn't deserve the biased criticism it most often receives.

		<shortDescription>Exorcist: The Beginning/Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you don't know the story with these movies, here it is: Morgan Creek films hired Paul Schrader to direct a prequel to The Exorcist, after director John Frankenheimer left the project, presumably due to health reasons. Schrader finished shooting, and presented a rough-cut to the studio. They hated it, and Schrader was fired shortly afterwords. Director Renny Harlin was brought on to make an entirely new film from a somewhat re-worked script, most of the same cast, and the same sets. His movie was released as Exorcist: The Beginning; it got terrible reviews, and was a box-office failure. After this, with some pressure from Schrader, and, I believe, an online petition, Morgan Creek gave Paul Schrader a minimal post-production budget to finish his film, and gave it a limited theatrical release as Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist.It's an interesting position for me to be in with these movies, because I am a fan of both directors. Both of them have made some of my favorite movies - I love Paul Schrader's sexualized Cat People remake, and Renny Harlin's The Long Kiss Goodnight is a shining example of a great dumb, but not stupid action movie - and they both have areas in which they excel. Though, it would be difficult to find two more different film-makers. Both movies focus on Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsg?rd, Max von Sydow's character from the original film), who is going through a crisis of faith (much like Father Damien Karras in The Exorcist) after an incident in a Holland village during World War II, where an SS officer forced Merrin to choose which ten people would be killed for the murder of a German soldier. Merrin is on an archaeological dig in Africa, when he uncovers a thousand year old Christian church which, unbeknownst to Merrin, was deliberately buried to trap the spirit of the demon Pazuzu (the chief antagonist of the Exorcist series).Both movies show the strengths and weaknesses of their respective directors. Schrader capably handles the dramatic and story driven scenes, but his film never really inspires any sense of dread, his climax lacks any real tension, and because of the low budget, the CGI effects are some of the worst in a feature film since that Dungeons and Dragons movie with Jeremy Irons. Thankfully, the CGI shots aren't that abundant. Renny Harlin, however, does give his film a more frightening atmosphere, and there are some scenes - particularly one involving assorted lepidoptera - which make you squirm. But, Harlin's character scenes all descend into clichés and histrionics, and he has an annoying habit of shooting too much of his scenes in close-up, which detracts from the drama. Both movies also feature cinematography by the great Italian cameraman Vittorio Storaro (The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Last Tango in Paris, Apocalypse Now) who's lighting you can literally almost feel on your body as look at it.All in all, even though it is a lesser horror movie than Exorcist: The Beginning, I have to give the edge to Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist. Both movies feature more drama than horror, which should automatically give favor to Schrader. Also, Dominion is simply closer in tone and spirit to the original film, which is something that any prequel/sequel/remake should strive for. However, I do recommend watching both movies, preferably back-to-back, as the experience does give one a unique insight into how much impact a director has on a film.Final ratings: Exorcist: The Beginning - ** (out of four) Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist - *** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Harlin's in many ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure everyone by now knows the story of how Paul Schrader shot and cut his version of an "Exorcist" prequel and delivered it to Morgan Creek studios only to be told it was "commercially unmarketable" and fired from the project. Then they hired Renny Harlin, mostly known for action films, to come in and make his own bloodier, more visceral version that would appeal more to mass audiences.It's a shame that the studios today are all about the profit and not the quality. While Harlin's "Exorcist: The Beginning" may have appealed more to mass audiences (and by mass audiences I'm talking about those who can't handle an intelligent story that takes time to build and need blood and guts every 10 minutes), but Schrader's film is clearly the winner in terms of quality here.This film is far more subtle than Harlin's in-your-face version. Until the end, there aren't even any real "scares" to speak of. Don't get me wrong, the movie IS scary, just don't expect the cliché "jump scares" that are accompanied by a loud jolt of music, or someone sneaking up behind somebody. The scares in this one come from a purely psychological angle as the film works to get under your skin, push your buttons, and unnerve you greatly.This version is a much more mature effort that works through creating layered characters and a good story. Harlin's version was like a cheap, plastic knock off of the real thing.Now what exactly is different about the two films? Well most of the actors are the same, though the roles are altered just a tad. The sets are the same. The *basic* story is the same. The real differences come in concerning the possession victims. Harlin's theatrical version centered on a young village boy being the object of possession, treading a very familiar route we've all seen before. Schrader's "Exorcist" takes a different route by turning the tables around: instead of the possession victim getting physically and mentally weakened as the demon takes over, the story focuses on Cheche, an afflicted young man that actually becomes better as the possession takes over his body. To watch Cheche miraculously heal from a surgery in a matter of days and see his strength and mental capabilities growing is truly unnerving. I found the character to be more interesting than even little Regan Macneil in the original movie.The acting is about the same in terms of quality, though with Skarsgard giving a much subtler performance this time around.Alas, the film is not without faults. There is some god-awful CGI thrown into the film (I can't decide if it's cheesiness was a result of the movie never being finished properly or if it was just that bad) and the ending feels somewhat anticlimactic. The showdown between Merrin and the demon is what this movie is all about, yet something about the entire sequence just doesn't sit well. It's not "big" enough. It doesn't have the weight it should considering it IS the main focus of the movie. And it all came a little too fast. The pacing of the film just doesn't sit quite well. By the time the shite hits the fan, we're almost at the end, and Merrin goes from disbeliever to Bible-thumping exorcist in way too short of a time period.Perhaps more work could have been put into Merrin's character. The film is okay as it stands, but more work and a little more background would have been great.No matter what though, this one is still loads better than that crapfest Harlin put out. A much creepier, less in-your-face, subtler film that gets under your skin and reaches you on a level not one of the sequels has done yet. It's a shame the ADD-riddled audiences today can't handle a mature film like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this film,it's not often that the same movie is made by two different directors.Dominion stars the talented Stellan Skarsg?rd as Lancaster Merrin,an ex-priest scarred by his experience in Nazi Europe.A Nazi commander killed villagers in his parish to convince Merrin to tell him the murderer of one of his men.Merrin never forgot and left the priesthood because of it.He is now on a dig in Africa unearthing a 500 year old church.Merrin notices a retarded child named Cheche come to the dig site every day.One night Merrin finds the child severely wounded and brings him to the doctor Rachel Lesno.Father Francis comes to assist on the dig.Once they enter the church they notice odd things,the Church looks brand new and it is more of a shrine to Michael the Archangel.Upon further investigation they find a passage way to a satanic worship site directly under the church.The British army who is funding this operation come to protect their prize.Two of the soldiers are found murdered,and the Colonel goes ballistic killing the natives.The natives believe Jesus Christ is the killer,a friend of Merrins bring's his dead child to him."Is this how the Lord treats his servants" Merrin immediately responds "Yes" Meanwhile after a risky operation Cheche heals all most instantly.Francis says he is the only miracle in this area,after a while it is clear that Cheche is in the power of the devil.Francis tries to perform a baptism and is thrown by the demon within Cheche.Merrin goes to the Chruch to discover the doors are covered by heavy stones and Rachel is still inside with the devil.Francis is murdered by the natives,before he dies he tells Merrin he must find his faith and perform an Exorcism.Schrader's Exorcist prequel is far more interesting than Harlin's. All though Harlins has better special effects and better actors,Dominion has one important thing that Exorcist the Beginning lacked,the threat of true evil.The special effects are laughable and look like a direct to video picture.However the film's story is solid and compelling. Merrin is more of a tormented figure here,and he is tempted when the devil tells him he can take his past away.Schrader's film is slow paced at times,but all in all it is what an Exorcist film should be a story about the battle between good and evil,not a splatter film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fearing Evil, Once Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most everybody knows by now the story behind directors Paul Schrader and Renny Harlin concerning their Exorcist prequels. Firstly, I have never seen the Renny Harlin version, nor do I care to. I was extremely surprised when Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist turned up at my local video store last Tuesday. With credits such as Taxi Driver and The Last Temptation of Christ, I was excited about watching Paul Schrader's newest film. The 116 minutes of the movie left me speechless from beginning to end, as well as, afraid. Dominion, like The Last Temptation of Christ, is a film that digs deep into the core of Christianiaty, providing a strong spiritual battle between good and evil. Only this time, Dominion shows us a world of evil where all we have to hold on to is faith. Stellan Skarsg?rd plays Father Merrin, a man who buries his guilt and has lost faith in a God who he believes is absent. He leaves the church to pursue archeology in South Africa, and finds a church that was built for a demon, and still haunts the surrounding area with evil. When it has been determined that a civilian in the colony has become demoniacally possessed, Father Merrin realizes the only hope for the life and eternal soul of the colony is an exorcism. The film did have a low budget for special effects, but it does not distract it's viewer from the deeper message it brings out. Dominion also brings us something few movies have, it puts the fear of evil into us through psychology, rather than subliminally. Dominion also brings us to a more personal level view on evil, if our deepest guilt could be forgotten or our most darkest past could be changed to live a life without regrets, would we do it? William Friedkin's The Exorcist is, without a doubt in my mind, the scariest movie ever made, and if you have never seen it, I highly recommend you do. Paul Schrader's Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist may not be a horror movie to scare us visually, but it successfully puts the greatest fear into us through our thoughts, hell. Overall, Dominion is a near masterpiece, yet no where near the 1973 original. But then again, what is?</fullReview>

What did they thing Renny Harlin would give them that Paul Schrader hadn't? And if WB wanted a summer kid-flick-hit, what would make anyone with the power to sign a cheque think Harlin could do it? This Paul Schrader version is wonderful. It's intelligent, and probably the only follow up in The Exorcist franchise that succeeds on more than a monetary level. I'm not a Harlin fan - he directs without vision. But I think from a purely academic stand point, it will be interesting to pair up both versions - Paul Schrader's and Renny Harlin's - of this movie on DVD and see the differences of where an insightful director will go and how a limited director doesn't even how to get there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a massacre by the Gestapo Nazi during WWII , in postwar (1947) a young Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) goes East Africa . Merrin is a parish priest from Holland with archaeological bent , he realized six archaeological digs since the war . He's listed still as a displaced person . There finds a simple Jesuit , father Francis (Gabriel Mann) who studied his works at the Maryknoll center . Francis is quite an admirer of Merrin , he about to begin missionary work in the Turkana district , he thinks may be they could help each other . It's found a dig in right west of Lake Rudolph in the Turkana district a church is early Christian which makes for quite a mystery given its location . A Cardinal is concerned that the exploration of this significance is conducted by a priest which is temporary in sabbatical and with no faith . Architecture church seems to date to the fifth century when the Byzantine empire had adopted Christianity by then but they never got this far south but the stones look new but they should be badly weathered by the wind and sun . Church has representations about battles on the walls and ceiling of angels (Saint Michael) and demons (Satan) . In the location Merrin encounters a Jewish Polish (Clara Bellar) and a British detachment ruled by a nutty Major (Waham) and a sergeant (Ralph Brown) . A little boy is possessed by harmful spirit and father Perrin confronts against the demon Pazuzu and he makes exorcism to save a young boy from dark forces...... This is a terrifying and startling story about possession with usual poltergeist phenomenon caused by the supernatural demon . Nice acting by Stellan Skarsg?rd , he is playing a younger version of Max Von Sydow's character from The exorcist (1973). Skarsg?rd is nearly a decade older than Von Sydow was during the filming of the original movie . Special effects , colorful cinematography (by Vittorio Storaro) , creepy music (Trevor Ravin , Angelo Badalamenti) and intelligence by director Paul Schrader , all combined to make it a good film . The original Exorcist(Friedkin) film spread a wave of demonic possessions movies that continues unbated today such as ¨The changeling¨, ¨Amytiville¨,¨Darkness¨ ; besides the sequels as ¨Exorcist II¨ (by John Boorman) , ¨Exorcist III¨ (by William Peter Blatty) and prequels ¨The beginning¨ and ¨Dominion¨ . This rare film not for squeamish and is better than ¨Beginning¨ , being shot at the same time, remaining Paul Schrader's version for the market video . Paul Schrader was originally hired as director of The Exorcist : The beginning (2004) , but Morgan Creek ultimately rejected his "psychological thriller" approach, saying it was "commercially unmarketable" . The decision was made to extensively rewrite and re-shoot the script, re-cast several roles , add new roles and give the director's chair to Renny Harlin . Schrader's version was originally supposed to be released direct to video, as a bonus feature on the DVD release of Harlin's version . Although is a prequel of prior movie , it's one the highest earning horror picture of the last years .</fullReview>

The lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to "explode soon" from all the crazy happenings. There was, in fact, nothing in the movie to make that line relevant.

Many people slate it for taking place in only a very few places. These would be fine complaints to a large budget film - but the studio was more interested in funding the Renny Harlin version of schlock horror "exorcist" than helping Paul Schrader to achieve his own superior idea here. Left largely out the dry, he did its best.A film must be rated against its circumstances. And for a low budget film that defied it's original studio to be made and come out such a well written and well acted piece, is enough to be forgiven for minimal sets and dated effects. If anything, the fact they pushed on and their dedication is clear in every shot, makes me appreciate their efforts even more.Not just a film about faith and good battling evil, but about faith and an independent director battling the studio.

		<fullReview>"Dominion" definitely explains why the little girl in "The Exorcist" became possessed. Considering that a relic from this site was in the house of (what was in real life a little boy) the possessed proves the power of imperil to be transferred through objects. This is why it is so important to discard old items that can carry imperil that may transfer on to new owners of such items. Imperil (that which puts one in peril) can actually lead to possession. In this case, the imperil of the sacrifices with the reverse altar to Christianity and the satanism linked to these activities actually conjured a demon. There is literally no such thing as a good demon, demons are all fallen angels. I suggest that if you believe you have been exposed to objects of imperil discard them immediately. Additionally, items that have been exposed to Saints can literally have light infused into them and cause the opposite effect: exorcism. I suggest that to clear areas of imperil or heal loved ones afflicted by Negative forces you gather what information you can on the subject.

		<fullReview>I consider myself a huge fan of the original Exorcist. I even liked certain elements of the lackluster sequels. When you compare this version to Harlin's version, it is obviously clear that Harlin's is a much stronger film. I rented this movie with high hopes. I enjoyed Harlin's version and thought it was the coolest thing in the world that the studio actually released the alternate original version of the film. How often does that happen? Sounds cool but its not...When you think of the Exorcist, you think of one of the best in the genre. You think of something unnerving and scary. You also look for some of the visual and psychological horror that was so well executed from the first movie. Dominion has none of these elements. It is neither scary nor unnerving. The script is horrible and with a few exceptions the acting is just laughable at times. The pace of the film drags on to no end and the conclusion is no more involving than playing tic-tac-toe.If you are debating which version to watch of the recent prequel story, go with Harlin's. While it is far from perfect, it at least holds some of the essential elements reminiscent of the classic Exorcist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good to finally see, but ultimately disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to see this film for ages, even before seeing the terrible Renny Harlin version. Renny Harlin!? What the hell were they thinking? I missed it on its limited cinema release, but eventually saw it on DVD, and as much as I want to say that I enjoyed it, I can't. I can honestly see now why they weren't happy with the final product, but to completely re-shoot it, and to hire a director like Renny Harlin, is just madness.The main problem I had with the film was the complete lack of atmosphere, and that should be the main thing with an Exorcist film. There was no feeling of fear or any creepiness in the film at all. It was all very bland.It's good to be able to compare the two films. Harlin's version is a Hollywood dumbed-down horror action film, while Schrader's film is a slower-paced, thinking person's version, but unfortunately lacking in any real horror moments.I really was hoping I would have enjoyed the film, but I have to be totally honest and give my true opinion Overall I would rate the film 6 out of 10, maybe even 5 out of 10. The Harlin version would be less than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, after seeing "Beginning" I thought why the hell they burned Schraders Version and did that poor one. But now, after seeing "Dominion" I deeply understand this decision. Even they got it not much better.Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good moments, but a really boring story-telling and some major plot-holes are killing this movie.I thing the Exorcist-story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see. But there is so much little of it in the movie. The effects are really bad - not even TV-standard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Lack of Faith but of Guilt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know the story by now: Morgan Creek wanted to make a prequel to "The Exorcist" and hired to Paul Schrader to do so. After delivering them his movie, the studio dismissed it for not being gory enough. Renny Harlin, esteemed filmmaker of "Cutthroat Island" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street 4," was brought in to completely reshoot the film. After Renny Harlin's excretal "Exorcist: The Beginning" was unleashed on the world, to critical savaging and public indifference, Morgan Creek figured they may as well release Paul Schrader's original cut. Given the unwieldy title, "Dominion: The Prequel to "The Exorcist,"" the film's art-house release made slightly less money and received only slightly better reviews.The two films follow the same general outlines. Father Merrin, his faith shaken by atrocities seen during the war, goes to Africa as an archaeologist. A church, made in the wrong century and perfectly preserved inside, is dug up. The British army and the local tribe come close to trading blows. Aside from these elements, the two films play out in very different ways. In "Dominion," Merrin discovers a deformed, crippled child on the street. After the discovery of the church, the boy's condition begins to improve miraculously. This is the possessed child. The boy's condition plays out against the two armies coming to blows and Merrin's crisis of faith.In "The Beginning," the British army and the African tribes go to war because of an ill-defined cloud of evil floating over the area. It was dumb. In "Dominion," the conflict between the two armies is an issue of religious difference and imperialism. The African tribesman associate Christianity with the British army. The head general murders a girl without reason. The film draws explicit parallels between this scene and the Nazi atrocities seen at the beginning of the film. In response, the tribesman murders the young boys interested in Christianity. In response, a convert actively wonders if this Christianity thing is worth it. There's no amorphous cloud of evil spreading its influence over the world. Instead, the events that happen are born out of men and their weaknesses.Most fascinatingly, "Dominion" tackles with the cost of evil. In "The Beginning," Merrin's crisis of faith is the result of what happened in the war. That film didn't go any further as to why. In "Dominion," Merrin's sin is not a lack of faith but of guilt. He lives with what happened every day and it weights heavily on him. During the exorcism, the demon promises to take Merrin's guilt away from him. The film shows faith as a burden, as having to live with and deal with the things that happen to us. Evil is not a vague, grand idea. Instead, it happens because people do not care and walk away from their conflicts. This is a surprisingly profound idea to find in a horror movie, much less a horror movie prequel.Unlike the music video style gore of "The Beginning," "Dominion's" effects are much more subtle. The film does not attempt to replicate the shock value of the original. There's no swearing, green vomit, scarred faces, or bodily contortion. The only visual call back to the original "Exorcist" is brief appearances from the Captain Howdy face. When possessed, the boy's condition actually improves. His limbs straighten, his broken bones heal, his body grows strong and vitalized. This is a clever visualization of the film's theme of guilt and imperfection as something that makes us stronger. The confrontation between Merrin and the demon is not a series of shocking special effects. Instead, it's a battle of wills.That Morgan Creek would dismiss "Dominion" for being non-commercial and "not scary enough" is not exactly surprising. The film's biggest weakness is how slow paced it is. This is a character based movie. There's only small amounts of gore in short burst, such as a stillborn child or the torn apart bodies left inside the church. Instead, the movie is much more interested in its philosophical ideas. Therefore, it's never exactly scary and never generates any visceral thrills or shocks. Aside from an odd nightmare sequence, the film isn't attempting scares at all. Also, I'm afraid to say, both versions of "The Exorcist" prequel feature CGI hyenas. I guess somebody thought that was a good idea? Even if it is flawed, "Dominion: The Prequel to "The Exorcist"" is an intelligent, extremely well thought out film that wrestles with and presents some fascinating ideas. The performances are strong and the visuals are well constructed. Paul Schrader made a thoughtful continuation of "The Exorcist," one worthy of the name. It probably wouldn't have set the box office on fire but that still doesn't justify the existence of that Renny Harlin abomination.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, you NEED to watch both versions in order to GET the whole story and see effects worth seeing.I don't know which is worse, to make two versions of the same movie, and have them both fall short, or to have waited 30 plus years to get the story in the first place.Either way, if you're an Exorcist fan, I highly recommend viewing both versions to get the whole picture.It's neither worse, nor better than the Remy Harlin Version, and rates a 5.0/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently had the chance to view "the other EXORCIST prequel", that was replaced with EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING for theaters by studio heads (Though I really don't see why they actually did this? I thought it was a pretty good) &amp; although the film failed to match the other prequel's scary &amp; suspenseful climax &amp; a few other key supernatural scenes (Though I suppose my comment &amp; view could be argued) it overall made for a very interesting watch, now like in pretty much all the EXORCIST films, you have to sit through loads of scenes with people talking, but once the film gets going, it makes for a very interesting watch! the film also stuck more closely to the EXORCIST in terms of continuity, where Harlin's version contradicted the first film, where it had a nurse &amp; not an African boy possessed, needless to say the climax failed, the demon that possessed the boy wasn't scary looking &amp; really did nothing interesting &amp; he was to quickly defeated at the climax, the ending had none of the scares or suspense of Harlin's version, still it was fun getting there! both films are very interesting to watch &amp; compare with each other &amp; should please fans of the genre, especially of this series, neither one is as strong as the original, in terms of content &amp; scares, but the really good cinematography, landscapes, directing, acting, writing &amp; special effects &amp; suspense, not to mention the interesting characters, make this an interesting watch. As in terms of which is the better prequel, that's for you to decide, since there is a split in fans point of views, some think this is the better version &amp; others thinks Harlin's version is the best, I personally thought Harlin's version was better in terms of supernatural aspects &amp; scares, but think this one is better in terms of story. *** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've wanted to see this since I found out Paul Schrader was directing, he's a fantastic director in his own right and one of the great screenwriters of all time. I was so disappointed when news started to filter out that there were issues, that the studio didn't think it was marketable, and then all of a sudden, the director sacked and the hack Harlin brought in. Being a huge Exorcist fan I saw the abomination that was "The Beginning", it was on a par with Sommers Van Helsing, in stupidity and unnecessary gore, the original Exorcist didn't rely on special effects, it was psychological it got under your skin, especially if you had any faith. I'm glad to say that Schraders version fits snuggly next to Friedkins original, it takes its time in the setup, it creeps under your skin with a swelling sense of dread that something is wrong with this place. The acting across the board is top notch, understated and believable. The effects let some of the scenes down but after reading that the director was only given $35,000 for post production, I'd say he did a bloody good job with what he was given. This film was never going to be a box office smash, times have changed, but it would have been successful, with it finding a DVD audience as well, if this could have been completed with proper post production and promotion of the film. It's respectful to the original film and its audience, not everything needs to be displayed on screen, the imagination is a far scarier place if manipulated correctly, the new breed of horror directors seem to forget this and paint by numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoughtful and engrossing new chapter in the 'Exorcist' legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people just don't know when to quit. A movie has a profound effect on people and often times it's milked for all it's worth. This can be a blessing and a curse. Sequels to beloved films aren't always a disappointment, in fact a lot of times they're very satisfying. But in the case of some movies it's near impossible to make even a decent sequel. Why? Maybe because some films simply don't need one. Maybe the story was finished and a sequel would only tarnish the memory a little.Such is the case with the 1973 classic 'The Exorcist,' a film that shocked the world and things would never be the same. It told an interesting story and it told it exceedingly well, but it wouldn't end there. Warner Bros. wanted a sequel and got their wish four years later, but with disastrous results. Thirteen years after that William Peter Blatty adapted his sequel novel 'Legion' to the screen and though it turned out to be a better film than it's predecessor it too failed to make a big impression on the world as the original had. It is considered by many to be not only a great sequel, but also a great film on it's own.It has ties to the original story, but has it's own to tell. This appeared to be the last we'd see of the 'Exorcist' film series, but this would not be the case, at least for a while. After a successful re-release of the original film there was again talk of another installment in the series. This time it would take us back to the beginning and show us Father Lancaster Merrin's first encounter with the demon he would face again in Georgetown years later. The production was troubled from the start and the result was two versions by different directors and writers. One would get a theatrical release and the other would go straight to DVD the following year. Which one is better is up to viewer.Pros: Performances are fine. Excellent score. Nice photography. Intelligently written and directed. Some of the effects are quite good. Some really powerful, and often frightening, sequences and imagery. Moves at a good pace. Riveting from start to finish. Production design is a job well done.Cons: Some painfully bad CGI. Not Paul Schrader's fault though, but the studio's. The horror aspect of the film could have used more emphasis. The final battle is a bit disappointing.Final thoughts: Despite many problems along the way, the 'Exorcist' series has continued, but not always successfully. It's a shame that they didn't at least give this a theatrical release after Renny Harlin's 'Exorcist: The Beginning' finished it's run. It's a truly remarkable film and fascinating look at how a man lost and regained his faith. It's also a very different film than William Friedkin's movie in that it's more subtle in it's horror, though not without good shocks. Therefore it might not be for everyone, but if you're looking for a horror film that's smart and takes it's time to develop things then look no further.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is The Better Prequel Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Morgan Creek Entertainment decided to go ahead with making a sequel to The Exorcist, it gave the directing reins to Paul Schrader who specializes in making films about guilt, sin, and questions of faith. What the producers got from Schrader, they deemed unsatisfying and assigned another director to re-shoot and direct a version to release to theaters due to the fact this version lacked enough gore and violence. Ultimately, this film is the better version.The film begins with Father Merrin's brutal dilemma during the Holocaust in 1944 Holland. A Nazi officer charges Merrin with selecting ten individuals for execution as punishment/payment for a murdered Nazi found with a kitchen knife in his back. Merrin lives with regret afterward and finds himself leaving the active priesthood behind internally, if not formally. Later, he makes his way to an archaeological dig in Kenya where evil confronts him again face to face in the form of a possessed tribal youth.Stellan Skarsgard plays Father Merrin in workman-like fashion, remaining somewhat distant through most of the film, and we don't really get to know him until strange things start happening. When they eventually do, Skarsgard is drawn into the existential dilemma of going back to the event in Holland and reliving his choices in order to alleviate his guilt. Ultimately, he discovers man can not hold God responsible for choices other men force him to make. The conclusion is not entirely satisfying, but it is ambitious in the sense that it restricts itself to answering the dilemma rather then creating a special effects extravaganza.The film was racked with budget problems, and the expected special effects are kept to a minimum considering the subject matter. Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is magnificent at times and disappointing at others with too much natural sunlight. The soundtrack is creepy at times but left in the background and is unobtrusive. Gabriel Mann is weak as Father Francis as is Clara Bellar as Rachel, the clinic's doctor. The story advances deliberately in conjunction with Schrader's purpose of illustrating Father Merrin's psychological conflict. It's a bold attempt to tell the beginning of The Exorcist but decidedly a less than commercial effort. **1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfying horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dominion" has been a nice surprise. I honestly expected something much worse, given all the bashing that this film has been subjected to.Set in the late 40s in an African village under the British Empire, this movie tells the story of Father Merrin years before the events depicted in "The Exorcist" and Merrin's first tete-a-tete with the devil. On its own -which I think should be the prominent way to judge any movie-, it is a perfectly watchable and entertaining horror movie, with good acting from Stellan Skarsgard, and the rest of the cast doing an okay job. The main character is the most interesting one, as we get to see his past and his moral struggles -not too original in the character of a Catholic priest, but still interesting.Now for the comparisons. "Dominion" never reaches the atmosphere and the scariness of "The Exorcist", but since the latter is regarded as one of the best, if not the best horror movie ever, it seems a little far-fetched and unfair to expect the same from the prequel. "Dominion" does, in fact, manage to build a very creepy and gloomy atmosphere, and this is, I believe, its main accomplishment -in fact, the ending does not live up to the tension and the creepiness set during most of the storytelling. However, it kept me interested throughout all of the running time, and the ending was all right also.As to the second inevitable comparison, that to "The Beginning", this one is definitely much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better of the two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to have seen this one in the theater. (It played in most markets for only one week, but for some reason it was booked for two weeks in Sacramento.) Of the two versions, I felt that this one had a deeper story, better character development, gave a clearer depiction of Father Merrin's motivation for performing exorcisms, and touched on the duality of human weakness and strength.It is a shame that the studio all but abandoned this film when it was so near completion. As a result, you will see relatively poor CGI. However, it is remarkable that director Schrader was able to bring together a cohesive and coherent story. And he did not resort to an excessive back-story, allowing a degree of mystery to remain unexplained.I agree with those who feel it is not on a par with the first film (minus the over-the-top scenes); however, if you can put that aside it will give you a better understanding of Merrin and I think you will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something profound about this film that can really let you believe that this story will continue in The Exorcist. The core of this story is the spiritual and philosophical conflicts that are depicted in many layers through the film, and the presence of Satan as well...The way evil is portrayed is irrefutable, but so is our vocation to fight it, this way we see Father Merrin as a true archetypical hero, fallen but willing to rise and to win; his fall and the way he arises made the storyline, the way it is narrated makes literature, and this makes you question about the evil that occurs every day and the acts of redemption that do as well...All of that with a lot of good scares, disturbing images and excellent acting, which is so much more of what I got from watching the other version of this film in which I only got scared of child-eating hyenas and possessed women...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched the other version, I was unsure what to expect when viewing this, as there must have been a reason why it was initially unreleased, but was pleasantly surprised to find a well paced, nicely photographed, supernatural chiller, much more classier than 'Exorcist the Beginning', despite telling essentially the same story. Minor faults aside, such as some obvious digital effects, the basic storyline remains the same, despite some character changes, like the crippled teenager, but it unfolds much better, and the location work, as opposed to studio interiors, gives it a more epic feel. Although giving in to the commercial demands of an Exorcist movie with some gory effects, for the most part it was very absorbing and kept the viewer engrossed until the satisfying ending. It's a shame this version was not given a wide release theatrically instead of its trashier replacement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark, tense, and sometimes creepy. A more complex plot about the origins of "The Exorcist". "Dominion" focuses on the life of Father Lankester Merrin and his first encounter with the Demon Pazzuzu. This movie is very different from "The Beginning" so don't expect excess of CGI, wooden performances (except Skarsgard), and a mediocre resolution. "Dominion" focuses more on plot aspects and character development. The three main characters are of course, Father Merrin, Father Francis, and the tormented but mysterious Cheche. We learn the most important aspects of their life and their connection with the forth-coming encounter with Pazzuzu. Father Francis (played perfectly by Gabriel Mann) is in charge of teaching Catolicism through Catecism in the only school near the area. He has only two students. Cheche is somewhat a mystery because the audience cannot tell his direct involvement with the discovered church of Satan. But the in-depth study of Father Merrin is the best feature of the movie. We learn how and why he lost his faith and how at the ending, he recovered it when he needed it more. He has a tormented past but through a surprising love interest and other aspects he becomes a stronger human being in the spiritual field. The final encounter with Pazzuzu is truly great and very tense. A great scene and way better than the ending from "The Beginning".I truly recommend this movie for those who are interested in knowing a little more on the "Exorcist" movies; this one tries to explain half about them and succeeds in my opinion. Great performance by Stellan Skarsgard and better direction by Schrader.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of you probably know the story behind this movie: the studio hired Paul Schrader to make a prequel of "The Exorcist" and once he finished it the executives decided that the audience wouldn't like it. So, the hired a mercenary and made him filmed the whole movie again and change the most of the cast. Obviusly the final product was nothing but rubbish and the takings weren't that good. Now, many of us wanted to see the Schrader version, and let me tell you that it's no big deal. It's actually darker and more dramatic than the one they released for the cinemas, but it's nothing to write home about. It's not even a horror movie, for it deals with the inner fight of Father Merrin and his doubts about the existence of God and stuff.What's more remarkable about "Dominion" is the presence of Stellan Skarsgaard (what a voice!!) and the photography of Vicente Storaro (although some effects at the end of the film are not very classy). In short: it's a better film than the one the producers re-made, but still it's not what I expected from Schrader. It looks that he copes better with urban stories than with angels, demons, etc.*My rate: 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Reader's Digest journey to Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to wonder why such a talented writer as Paul Schrader, who has successfully scrutinized the psychologies of humans in his previous films and scripts, embarked on such a terrible journey with this story. To make a film takes up many years of one's life, so why waste it on such drivel? The money? Because you need a career kick start? Laziness?This film is mainly set in East Africa and follows the 'weird' events surrounding an archaeological dig. If you took White Mischief or even Hercule Poirot, as made for ITV, and added spooky content, with dire melodramatic music and paper thin characterization, then this would be Dominion. It is Death On The Nile with a god slant. Schrader seems lost in a story that cannot make up it's mind as to what to say. On one level, it is taking a very superficial look at colonialism in Africa and the effects of the missionaries on the indigenous population, then peppers it with a love story between the priest (Skarsgard) and a girl (Bellar) supposedly bound by the horrors of WW2, and then there is the atrocious portrayal of Africans as ignorant superstitious bush dwellers with their mouth piece being the English speaking Jomo (Aduramo) who acts as the 'black lackey' who can fill them in on what the "fuzzie wuzzies" are saying. Jesus H Christ! All set to TV drama music! It is the sort of film my great grandfather would have enjoyed, but i bet even he would have found it rather anodyne.The opening scene set ,supposedly, in Holland with a cliché German SS execution dilemma where Father Merrin has to choose as to who will die is the motor for the film;s horror. Does God exist? if so then he would not be so cruel... But his guilt is so ham fistedly explored, that there is no tension or even desire to revisit that dilemma. I would not even say that the film is nicely shot. Well exposed maybe, but there is no motivation behind the camera as to where it is placed, other than to push the plot forward mindlessly. Friedkin's camera was inquisitive, curious and scared. It knew what it was looking for, as did the script. As a film maker, one has the choice to choose the moments in time, and the place with which to view events, in order to involve an audience into one's own curiosity to a story. A great film tries to understand the fragility of being human. And we don't need bad CGI hyenas (or monkeys, Mr. Lucas - THX 1138 remastered) to put fear into our bones. The human fear is the fear of the unknown, the fear of our existence, and that is a very private and special fear that most filmmakers today are choosing to ignore. Travis Bickle could have told you that. One day a real rain will come, and wash films like this away....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, I've been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie. I actually put my shoes on, got in my car, burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental place AFTER reading said reviews and paid the requisite 4 dollars and change to rent this thing. I'm telling you, this one's not worth the minuscule kilo-calories spent on lifting one's index finger to switch channels on a TV remote. I even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the tell-tale signs of a pedigree dog-pile. These presented as clinical symptoms of a director who is a. going senile or, b. is only marginally interested in the film he/she is obligated to create. I saw similar deterioration with John Carpenter's string of ridiculous caricature's over the past number of years.Here are a couple of scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest is having a disturbing dream...supposedly a harbinger of nastiness to come since he seems hell bent on opening the archaeological feature which houses the demon. The dream is a goofy collage of disjointed images right out of the Twilight Zone's stock footage. A ticking clock careens through the dream scape's blackness implying, what?, the unfathomable mystery of Time?....big deal! A disembodied head, painted in demon features with convenience store quality Halloween make-up, flickers back and forth in a convulsive frenzy. Every time I see this effect, a big fat rip-off from Jacob's Ladder, it pisses me off. This, in itself, almost instantly discredits a film. The whole build-up of the archaeological dig itself is laughable. Everything is so obvious...so tired and over-wrought...the only possible response is boredom. At one point in the dig, the priest comments on finding the statues of Angels surrounding a sarcophagus...they're all pointing down toward the crypt with their weapons. He queries "Look at these surrounding statues....It's as if they are holding..something..down!" This is supposed to build tension...critical mass..but it doesn't even come close! How can there be suspense if you treat the audience like a bunch of morons having to EXPLAIN the suspense as you go along. The imagery is over-done in the first place but the added comments only add insult to injury in my opinion. Soon thereafter, the tomb is "decorated" with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium (another shameless rip-off of The Keep, btw). Who, for crying out loud, did the make-up effects for this film??! The blood actually had that pinkish quality one might see in 70's Tromaville flicks. At this point I became almost convinced that they simply forgot the make-up and had to go to Wal-Mart in the interest of time and money.DON'T listen to glowing comments on this one! I'll be keeping a suspicious eye on Schrader too. Looks like it might be time to hang up his gloves. Perhaps a close friend will offer a gentle admonition to quit while there's still dignity in memory of films gone by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrid movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was not, by any stretch of the imagination, entertaining. The acting was forced, especially by Bellar, and the writing was convoluted. This film should've been shelved by Morgan Creek. Just a hodgepodge of bull and offers no value at all to the movie goer. The original "Exoricst" was out of my mind as I viewed this film. I've given this film EVERY chance it deserves to "be good". This motion picture's direction was doomed from the first shot. The cinematography was as poor as the acting/writing/directing. I can offer NO positive comment on such a disaster of a film. I urge you to NOT see this film. Continue with your assessment and memories of "The Exorcist". I enjoyed "The Exorcist II: The Heretic" more than this film. At LEAST Linda Blair was attractive to watch. This film, please....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This highly unusual true prequel to "The Exorcist" is well made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is set 26 years before the original 1973 film. This tells the tale of a younger Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard), who lost his faith in god. After the unpleasant incident with the Nazis, three years earlier. An ancient church has been unearthed in East Africa. Merrin is been hired by a British general (Ralph Brown) to join the archaeological dig with a priest by the name of Father Francis (Gabriel Mann). Strange things are slowly changing to the worst, when Villagers and Sereval other people have been acting strangely. An young man by the name of Cheche (Billy Crawford), who is been possessed by a demon. Which this demon is buried over a thousand five hundred years ago inside the ancient church. Merrin has to regain his faith to battle the demon and finding redemption for himself.Directed by Paul Schrader (Affliction, Auto Focus, Cat People-1982) made an flawed but oddly compelling prequel to "The Exorcist". Schrader take over the direction of the late-John Frankenheimer. Which Frankenheimer was the original director of the film and actor:Liam Neeson was originally cast as Father Merrin. Producer:James G. Robinson, owner of "Morgan Creek Productions" wasn't happy with Schrader's cut. Robinson felt his version wasn't scary enough to entertain an mainstream audiences. Which Schrader's version is low-key, psychological drama with elements of horror. Which Robinson decide to re-filmed the entire film with director:Renny Harlin. Which Harlin's version is much more commercial but flawed and somewhat unintentionally gory horror movie.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.00:1) transfer and an fine:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an fairly interesting commentary track by the director, which he talks about the film production and the troubles, when he has made this ambitious prequel. Skarsgard is extremely well cast in the cast and he gives an different dramatic performance than he did in Harlin's version. Celia Bellar also co-star as Rachael. The film has fine performances, some creepy scenes, strong production values and good camera work by Vittorio Storado (Apocalyspe Now, Dick Tracy, The Last Emperor). Schrader's Dominion and Harlin's The Beginning will make an interesting double bill. Especially, those who study movies in film classes. Schrader's and Harlin's do have the same story but both told in different style and in their own unique brand of direction. Skarsgard, Brown, Isreal Aduramo, Andrew French, Antome Kamerling, Julian Wadham and Eddie Osei reprises their roles to Harlin's version. Written by William Wisher (Terminator 2:Judgment Night, Judge Dredd, The 13th Warrior) and novelist:Caleb Carr. Univision. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best installment since the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as cinematic explorations into faith are concerned, "Dominion: Prequel to The Exorcist" might be one of the best--a straight-faced meditation on spirituality, the perils of faith, and the price of redemption. Unlike Renny Harlin's for-hire prequel, director Paul Schrader (most well-known for his collaborations with Martin Scorsese) does not shortchange the religious fulcrum of his story for action, gore, and special effects; he also manages to not turn the film into something overwrought and preachy. "Dominion" begins with a WWII prologue (alluded to in flashback in Harlin's version), and quickly jumps to the African excavation of a buried Christian cathedral. Simultaneous to this, local mute cripple Cheche's (Billy Crawford) sores and broken bones begin to heal, all attributed to acts of God by young Father Francis (Gabriel Mann); Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) is torn between his haunted past, his loss of faith, and mediating bubbling conflict between British soldiers and the local tribe. Not only does Schrader present a clash between faiths, but cultures, as well; the friction that the Americans and British foment is just as suspenseful as the more pressing spiritual issues (true to its title, there is a climactic exorcism, very thoughtfully presented). While distinctly lax on the edits and extremely unsubtle techniques employed by Harlin (which, to be fair, worked for his prequel), Schrader creates a character-driven atmosphere of dread and hope through the fear of human weakness (Merrin's struggle is more tangible and effective here). "Dominion" is very seldom less than captivating, and the first descendant to proudly stand alongside the 1973 original in terms of sheer cinematic quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Dominion' a far cry better than 'The Beginning'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of 'The Exorcist' series, I went to see 'The Exorcist-The Beginning' in 2004. While I enjoyed the movie while watching, I can't say that I was impressed with it in an overall sense. It didn't really live up to my expectations. I was expecting more drama and thrill, like that of the original 'The Exorcist', and instead I wound up with an in-your-face blood-and-guts movie. I felt that it was an insult and embarrassment to the other 'Exorcist' films.I happened to stumble across 'Dominion- Prequel to The Exorcist' in the local video store last year. I didn't know anything about the movie, had never seen it, and had never even heard of it. Nevertheless, I bought it anyway. When I finally saw it, I thought, "Why didn't they release this version in the theater?" It was a far cry better than 'The Beginning'. More personal, more dramatic, yet adventurous and thrilling enough to keep me on the edge of my seat.Stellan Skarsgard, while great in 'The Beginning' was incredible in this version. I also thought that the character of Rachel, played by Clara Bellar was more appropriate for the storyline than the character of Sarah, played by Izabella Scorupco. Both are great actresses and did great jobs, but I liked (and could relate to) 'Rachel' more so than to 'Sarah'. I also thought that Gabriel Mann carried off his role as Father Francis much better than James D'Arcy in 'The Beginning'. Mann brought 'life' and personality to his character in way that D'Arcy did not. Billy Joe Crawford was incredible playing Cheche. The storyline of this movie involving the character of Cheche was much than the one involving the character of Joseph in 'The Beginning'.In this movie, unlike 'The Beginning', you could really experience the emotions, the inner struggles and the personalities of the characters. The storyline was simpler, easier to follow and just plain BETTER, thanks to the work of Paul Schrader. Blood and gore is fine in some horror movies, but not so much in 'The Exorcist' series, which have always been about thrill, spirituality and drama. 'Dominion- The Sequel to The Exorcist' offers all of this. TWO THUMBS UP for 'Dominion'!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, Schrader's take on this story made so much more sense to me than Harlin's. While watching Harlin's Exorcist: the Prequel last weekend and perusing info about it at IMDb, I became aware of the controversy surrounding Schrader's original and decided that it would be interesting to see how the two compared. Boy, talk about night and day! Harlin's a decent action director, but he should stick to blowing up things and leave the reasonably intelligent storytelling to others. I don't think my next comment is much of a spoiler, but just to be on the safe side, consider yourself warned. One of the things that makes Schrader's version so much more interesting to me is the irony between the actions of the SS lieutenant at the beginning of the story and later, the British major. It's a chilling contrast and the scenes that make that irony so compelling are completely missing in Harlin's version. Watch them both (preferably Harlin's first, the way I did, and then Schrader's) and see if you don't agree. Less gore, more thought provoking. After watching Dominion, I didn't feel like I'd been bludgeoned with gratuitous CGI and violence.</fullReview>

Besides the movie making no sense lots of the violence was unnecessary. It just shows how far people will go to satisfy the public's need for violence! Not to mention people's insatiable needs for sequels, prequels, etc. If this film was to garner pity for Father Merrin and explain how he gets to meet Regan then it has failed miserably. If anything, all this film shows is how easy it is to turn from God when things get at their worst and to never stick your nose in things that you shouldn't!

		<shortDescription>Why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of Dominion after seeing Exorcist The Beginning and was extremely disappointed. Reading the comments in regards to Dominion's scene structure, music, and FX, I was impressed to hear so many rave about how it delved into the roots of the original, similar thematic background scenes for the flashback's (Black background, slow-motion). Damn were they wrong. The acting of the co-stars were brutal, line delivery was a train wreck on set, and the story was no better than that of 'The beginning.' The only positive aspect to the film was it's fleshed out details, so it was easier for the audience to follow. When I say why bother, I mean, why screw with the original? Yes, it does happen where in a sequel will surpass it's original, but it's almost an impossibility for a movie of the exorcist's magnitude. And unlike other films, I believe that was the goal of Dominion; to surpass The Exorcist. In short, don't see it, it's a waste of time and money. There are a million other excellent films circulating your nearest blockbuster. If you're looking for a cult classic, check out The Omen, or The Amityville Horror, hell even Poltergeist delivers more of an enlightening and frightful experience. Not that this movie was intended to be a true horror, but it's not even a rich plot line, it's just drave. If you're looking to be disgusted, check out House of a 1000 corpses, not the devil's rejects, or Saw, Saw II or even Scream! Haha. Just find something else if you're looking for a good scare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing "The Beginning" and thinking that it self-destructed towards the end, with all those pseudo-horror action sequences,I then learned that Schrader had already shot an earlier version of the film which had been dumped for not having enough scares and action scenes.Finally, I saw it on sat. TV today, and was much more impressed by Schrader's more believable version.At least you can see a definite connection between this and the original flick. Though it seems to be a happy ending, we all know that it's going to be "see you again a few decades later in Georgetown time", and this movie clearly creates a nice segue into the first one. Let's see the score is now: First One- goodHeretic- badLegion- bad beginning-badDominion- OKI rate it as just OK, because Schrader could have put more atmosphere and chills in it, while not destroying its verisimilitude like that Remy dude did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original &amp; The Remake equally bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching "Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist," try not to think too hard about why there are two movies floating around with much the same cast- if you do, you might learn the true, terrifying secret behind the reason this film was made in the first place: no place to go with sequels, and no real reason for another exorcist movie aside from the pure exploitation of the original.Apparently Paul Schrader asks that viewers keep an open mind and forget everything you saw in the original. In that case, my first observation is that Merrins 'transformation of faith' in this "prequel," or in fact even in Harlin's "Exorcist: The Beginning" is so obviously a rip off of Karras' 'transformation of faith' in the first film. Now it may be fair to say that religion as a "profession" may encounter people losing their faith all the time, however you never get the sense from Merrin (from "The Exorcist") that he ever had the same specific battle of faith that Karras was going through- and I can't help but think if we're looking at a consistent storyline, that sort of shaken faith and the advice to overcome it would be something that would be shared.In this film, man of the world Merrin ventures to Africa to help excavate a buried Church. His purpose there, given that he seems to have an almost acidic like loathing for the Church is a mystery, but for whatever reason he is in charge of the excavation while a young Priest named Francis (he is just way too cute to be playing a priest) sets up a missionary school for the local children.With the uncovering of the Church, some very creepy things begin to happen: a freakishly gaunt looking boy appears and receives treatment at the local clinic, cows become carnivores, and a baby is born still born and covered in maggots. These happenings create a conflict between the excavators and the local tribe who wants the church re-buried; it eventually culminates in a confrontation between the British Army and the local tribe that threatens to unleash a wave of death and suffering.Of course, that is far more "complex" than this movie is. Just how bad is this movie? Well, the possessed boy Cheche is portrayed by a Filipino actor. Wait a minute...isn't the movie set in Africa? Wouldn't you expect that in a remote tribal region of Africa, you would find a primarily racially homogeneous group aside from those missionaries who come and try to serve the people? Of course, apparently the demon Pazuzu goes through a change of voice and demeanor in the original film because here he sounds younger, is less vulgar, and much less terrifying.There are some interesting visuals in this film, which is why it gets 2/10- the exact same score I gave "Exorcist: The Beginning" for the exact same reason. It makes you wonder why they made the second when this train wreck had already been made. Better yet, it makes you wonder why they decided to release this film as if it was a completely separate film and not just the "failed" creation. Releasing it on its own disk was very crass in my opinion, and smacks of the kind of milking the audience that should really clue would be viewers into what demon is possessing whom!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched both prequels: Renny Harlin's The Beginning and this one. Frankly, I sympathise with the studio here. Schraeder's prequel had a fairly intelligent script but awful directing whilst Harlin's had a brain dead script and fair directing. What does a multi-million dollar studio do? Bust its money on both lousy films.I think one reason to watch both films (other than a severe need to empty your guts) is this - it gives you an insight into how important the script and direction is.Schraeder's script has got a nice sub-text. But it needed a keen director to get a better performance out of the cast. Gabriel Mann's Father Francis as about an ineffective performance I've seen, Clara Bellar is under-used, even the excellent Stellan Skarsgard seems confused, muted and not sure as if he belongs in this movie.Worst of all, the horror's not really scary at all. Maybe it's us being jaded and all after years of shock horror and cheap tricks by other films but this one has nothing approaching a scary scene. There is simply not enough attention to atmosphere and under-utilisation of film design.At least Harlin's version is the usual drivel you expect a B grade horror film to be. This one belongs in the can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary film watching opportunity!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first instance I can recall in which two directors are given a chance to make the same film with the same principal actor. So "Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist" and "Exorcist: The Beginning" count not only as prequels to the original Excorcist, but as remakes of each other!I definitely recommend seeing both films. This is an exceedingly RARE opportunity to discover what it is about how a director shapes the fabric and flavor of a film. Watching a sequel or prequel or remake of a film puts the viewer to the task of deciding whether the film succeeds at continuing the story line and the history of the characters. It is the rare sequel that exceeds the original, transcends the qualities of its prequel and elevate their genre. Others fall flat and embarrass the memory of the films they are supposed to continue. Remakes, on the other hand have a different set of expectations to satisfy. A remake has to try even harder to validates its existence. Some succeed in this and not only honor the original, but stand as their own films. Others remind us of the elusiveness of a film's successful quality. Even a shot-for-shot reconstruction like Gus Van Sant's "Psycho" hammers home the fact that you can't make a cat by pulling a cat apart and gluing the pieces back together.Comparison: Renny Harlin is fairly masterful at large scale action / adventure flicks, but this is what eventually undoes "Exorcist: The Beginning". The fight against evil in the end turns into a ridiculous chase / monster fight. The devil looks ridiculous and laughable, like a rip-off of the girlfriend vampire from the end of "Fright Night". I hadn't seen anything that cheesy since the giant Tequila worm in "Poltergeist II". In the end, story totally collapses on itself and ruins such a great setup.Paul Schrader's great successes as a writer and director have been intimate, intense character studies of people under tremendous emotional and spiritual pressure. This is the great success of "Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist". It's not "BOO!" scary as much as very unsettling and creepy, although there are still plenty of suspenseful moments and surprises.Schrader's handling of the material was far more subtle than Renny Harlin's. Which, I think, makes this film much truer to the -ahem- spirit of the original Exorcist. At the same time, there were parts of Harlin's film that I thought were very effective and I missed them in this version.We are so invested in Father Merrin at the end that we fear he will succumb to the temptation offered by the devil. And the devil, embodied by Cheche, played brilliantly by Billy Crawford, is so dangerously seductive and sly in this version. He offers Father Merrin the opportunity to undo the event that lead to his loss of faith, but at what cost? In the end, the potential to yield to evil feels much more potent and frightening in this film. It left a stain on my consciousness that I tried to shake for quite some time.I wish studios would keep up the practice of paying to make more than one version of a film. Sure, the marketing is a nightmare, but you would have more happy viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychologically superior to Renny Harlin's version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsg?rd) travels to a dusty town in East Africa and participates in an archaeological excavation which unearths a Byzantine church. This mysterious temple dates back to a time before Christianity arrived to the region. But what's even more mysterious is the evidence which suggests that the perfectly preserved church was buried as soon as it was completed. Panic among the townspeople soon follow and evidence of a demonic force gives reason to suspect that something else was unearthed.This feature was the original prequel to "The Exorcist" but apparently it wasn't shocking enough for studio executives. For this reason, they ended up asking Renny Harlin to take over. The end result was the much maligned but mildly entertaining "Exorcist: The Beginning". Admittedly, this version is not as graphic as Harlin's but "Dominion" has other qualities that are superior. First, since this version concentrates more on the story than scare tactics, there's more character development. One of the stand-out performers here is Gabriel Mann. His portrayal of the other tortured priest is gripping. So likable is his character that he steals every scene he's in. Stellan Skarsg?rd also turns in a good performance but it's due largely to his imposing presence than his acting since he does nothing here which he hasn't already done before and his face is devoid of expression throughout. But the man's charisma commands our attention. Even when he's not saying a word, we are drawn to his character. While Mann takes us in with his words, Skarsg?rd does it with his presence."Dominion" is not as horrifying as the 1973 original but if you let yourself get too involved with the events taking place, it may end up affecting you more than you thought it was capable of. What we see more of here, is the diabolical, murderous deeds of man. The opening segment for instance, involving Merrin and the Nazi's is unpleasant and disturbed me to the core. The grisly scene is replicated in Africa years later. We clearly understand why Merrin loses his faith in God. There is a similar scene in Harlin's film but it's repeated so often throughout that whatever impact it originally had is lost.The victim of demonic possession in this story also differ's. For those who have not yet seen either of these movies, I will not give spoilers. However, I will state that in "Dominion's" case, it does not really contradict the original film's story, at least in regards to the characters. I cannot say the same for Harlin's picture. Another aspect of Schrader's account that is dissimilar is in the make-up effects. In Harlin's interpretation, the possession make-up resembled that of the original "Exorcist". The victim of possession had the same facial scars and characteristics. In "Dominion", it does not. The exorcism scene, visually, when compared to Harlin's version, is not as grotesque (or as lame) but this exorcism disturbed me more. The demon played more with Father Merrin's head. It was less destructive physically but not emotionally. While watching the other prequel, I wanted more shocks yet when watching "Dominion", I did not. Schrader set the tone to such a different level, that cheap shocks would have changed its tone completely. It would have seemed out of place. While "The Beginning" is gorier and plays more like a typical contemporary horror movie, Schrader's version is more psychological. It does not rely on cheap thrills to torture it's main character and its target audience. For this reason, I proclaim it the winner.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the other one, still not up to much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the Renny Harlin version first - boring, blood-soaked, and dull. I had higher hopes of this . Still the same great actor playing Merrin (and he is outstanding in both movies - he deserves so much more than this). It seemed more intelligent and deeper than the other version. The performances are better, relying on subtle characterisations rather than the glossy, superficial performances of Harlin's version. The special effects are dire - really, in 2004, there's no excuse for such terrible effects. Not when the original Exorcist's effects are so successful.But what really disgusted me was the anti-British sentiment. This was present in the Harlin version too, but I expected that this film, supposedly more intellectual, would rely less heavily on it. In fact, it's worse. The accusation that the British Museum's directors are all thieves. The implication that the British are no better than Nazis. British soldiers that seemed to have been lifted from the 1850's, rather then the 1950's.The hatred for the British that permeates this film sours and cheapens it.And the portrayal of the African natives aren't much better. They're portrayed as backward, violent, vicious people, who refuse medical help, kill the innocent to 'save them from Christian evil' and who, in the opinion of the director, could be vastly improved by throwing away their own religion and becoming Christian (and probably wearing shoes and living indoors too). In fact, the implication that all religions apart from Christianity, no matter how ancient, are evil, is insulting.I suggest - don't bother watching this. Watch the Exorcist, and pretend neither of this dire, pointless, badly-made, prejudiced films exist</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every employee at Morgan Creek should be taken out into the courtyard and flogged for burying this movie and letting Renny Harlin unleash his worthless Exorcist prequel on the world in its place. There are certain ideas and concepts that are just meant to be movies, and doing a prequel to the Exorcist is one of them. I really can't understand how anyone could possibly screw up the story. Even Michael Bay should have been able to make a good Exorcist prequel. But Renny Harlin did the impossible, he made a bad Exorcist movie and all the while they had Paul Schrader's version hidden away in a closet.Now, this is not a great movie, and it doesn't live up to its full potential, but it's not as much of a crime against nature as the version that was released theatrically. If the producers had actually supported Schrader and helped him trim this movie down a bit, we might have had the prequel we were all hoping for.For anyone who doesn't know the saga of the Exorcist prequel, I will give you the Cliff Notes version. Warner Brothers and Morgan Creek decided to make a prequel to the Exorcist that would basically be the story of a young Father Merrin and how he came to be the Exorcist. Yes, I thought to myself when reading about this... good idea, finally. They hired Caleb Carr, a novelist best known for his book the Alienist, and Paul Schrader a director who's best known for writing Taxi Driver. Okay, now I was starting to get excited. Paul went and shot his movie, but ran into problems when he screened the movie for Morgan Creek and the big brains decided that it was too long and not scary. Caleb Carr started screaming that Schrader was destroying his words. They fired Paul Schrader and brought Renny Harlin in. Renny reshot 90% of the movie and put his hack fingerprints all over it. That was the version that was released theatrically with a pretty dismal box office response.Meanwhile, Paul Schrader's version languished on the shelf until recently. This movie follows the same basic premise as the Renny Harlin version. Father Merrin suffers a crisis of faith after being forced to watch as Nazis massacre an entire village. He's in Africa and he discovers an entire church that has been buried in the desert. But while the plot line is basically the same, the two movies couldn't be more different. In Schrader's film, Merrin is a tortured man who's struggling with complex issues of faith. In Renny Harlin's film, Father Merrin is more of swashbuckling archaeologist like Indiana Jones. That's basically the difference between the two movies. One is a drama, and one is an adventure. The problem is that neither film is really a horror film. Schrader's film, while certainly more brooding and esoteric, is not that frightening. The possessed boy in DOMINION is nowhere near as scary as Regan was. That might be because there isn't really any identifiable threat in the movie. We all know that Father Merrin is going to survive whatever hellish experience he goes through, because he shows up in the later movie. So, since we know our main character is going to live, there's not a lot of peril in the movie. We are able to disengage from it and never really feel frightened or worried that Father Merrin might not make it out of this experience alive. This is a flaw that should have been handled in the concept stage. This is not a fault that can be pinned on Paul Schrader. In fact, I think Schrader did everything he could with the material he was given. It's still a flawed concept, and the producers obviously didn't give Schrader any money for CG because the hyenas in this movie look like they came right out of a video game. That's the only reason that I didn't give this movie a higher score, and it has nothing to do with Schrader or his direction. It has everything to do with a poorly conceived concept and a lack of care on the part of the producers.The saddest thing about the Saga of the Exorcist Prequel is that Morgan Creek and Warner Brothers missed a great opportunity and we, the horror fans, are the ones who suffer for it. This movie is definitely worth a rental if you are a fan of the Exorcist series, and if you felt betrayed by Renny Harlin's movie. This will ease the sting just a little bit for you. I don't know if I can recommend adding this movie to your collection, because it still has some problems. Despite the fact that none of the fault can be pinned on Paul Schrader, this movie still ends up getting a C+ in my grade book. It's better than Renny Harlin's, but still not as great as it could have been if the producers had stood behind Paul Schrader from the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not the script...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but the director at fault here. The actually plotting etc isn't too bad, though there are some unconvincing lines throughout. No, the problem is the utterly banal and pedestrian direction with no pace, no feel of suspense or the fear of the original, and poor all round production values. The lighting was awful, the sound non-existent, and was there actually any music at all? As a Sunday afternoon film it was poor, but bearable. As a prequel to a great horror film, it was appalling. Schrader: hang your head in shame (it's no wonder Morgan Creek wanted a completely new film - though I wouldn't say a hack like Renny 'explosions are good' Harlin was the best choice!!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there a thinking alternative to gratuitous shock &amp; gore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(maybe contains very minor spoilers in terms of discussion of the psychological ideas) This thoughtful but laborious rendering of this prequel to the famous horror film is by a director who has made many excellent movies, including Auto Focus, Cat People and American Gigolo. His project was canned shortly before completion, being deemed not gory enough, and an alternative director and script used to make the main theatrical release. Whether a labour of love or a vanity project, Schrader eventually completed his original movie, which obtained a very limited cinema release.Going back to the time just before the end of the war, a 1944 Father Merrin is told to choose ten prisoners to be shot by the Nazis or else see them all killed. The guilt of what he does haunts him. A few years later, working as an archaeologist in British East Africa, he comes across a Christian building, perfectly preserved since the day it was buried. A young priest is sent to watch over the excavation and Father Merrin. Something else is buried underneath the crypt however.The Schrader prequel focuses largely on theological wresting of good versus evil, though it seems at times in a somewhat confused way. The 'source of evil', when revealed has trappings of the Christian 'devil' ? the horned god ? rather than any Egyptian or Moroccan deity. Apart from tossing folk about, the only evil connection with it seems to be evidence of human sacrifice ? something that was common in many religions but not the Pan and Priapus cults on which the Christian image of Lucifer is modelled. These were mostly associated with freedom, especially sexual freedom, of which the Roman Catholic Church disapproved. When robbers come to a bad end, the script notes that the characteristics of their demise follow Christian, not Pagan, symbolism. Apart from some levitation and teleportation, the possessed being's most dramatic act is to allow someone to 're-write their past' and, by objective contemplation of possibilities, free them of guilt. In other words, doing the job of a saviour (as a good psychotherapist might) rather than a devil.The villagers also note that all the evil that befalls them started with the arrival of the devout young priest sent to keep an eye on Mirren, which adds weight to the 'Catholic Church as evil' theory (an amusing angle to take when watching the Exorcist later by the way, as it continues to follow Mirren about); although the tribal rituals resemble Roman Catholic Communion rather than any tribal ritual that might have been extant in African religions.Schrader, at the interview after the film's UK premiere in Edinburgh, admitted that Dominion doesn't have a 'horror premise' ? in other words, an innocent victim that is preyed upon and then rescued. This, he says, is why the film had to be re-written (rather than just altered) to suit the horror-and-gore -focused financiers. Sadly, although it is more thought-provoking than the average sequel/prequel horror-flick, it doesn't have a strong good-versus-evil premise either."Sometimes I think the best view of God is from Hell", says Rachel, who hovers on the fringe of providing a nebulous Mirren love-interest. The best horror story writers are not those that base their ideas on a Calvinistic upbringing ? they are those who have got to know their own secret hell or, by careful research of the psychodynamics common to many cultures and so part of our collective subconscious, can fudge it reasonably well. Certain symbols, names, root-words, religious rites, are common to so many cultures they are probably an expression of our psychology ? JG Fraser, the great anthropologist was one of the first to realise this, and many writers since, from Edgar Allen Poe to Clive Barker, have successfully used that fact to create realistic horror stories. However terrible having your film canned might be, Schrader is still too lacking in personal experience of the hell department to make a film about it that is anything other than unconvincing and laborious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better The Devil You Know...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly risible movie. A cross somewhere between a Hammer Horror and a Carry On movie, Schrader has crafted a truly awful piece of cinema. My first thoughts after about three quarters of an hour were that it looked like a cheap made-for-TV movie, and the dreadful CGI effects merely compound this. The art direction is woeful, everything looks brand-spanking new, and the sets are so clichéd. Schrader's direction is clunky and uninspired, but worst of all is the acting from Skarsgard and Mann. Skarsgard chews the scenery for two hours whilst Mann seems to think he's in some Merchant Ivory epic.Two hours of my life wasted. This film should not be thought of as anything to do with Friedkin's masterpiece. It is a travesty that quite rightly the studio attempted to shelve. If people think this is better than Exorcist: The Beginning I'm just glad I haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into watching this film with an open mind and low expectations. Studios never wanted this to see the light of day? It can't be that bad right?Well, I have seen this and I cannot believe how bad this film is. note: spoilers are probably in here.. but trust me - you don't want to see this film anyhow.. But for those who care, be warned..================================================1) it is poorly written. NOTHING essentially happens in this film! it is essential Mr. Merrin walking around for two hours. 2) it is confused. On one hand it wants to be artsy, but then it gives us some of the most cheap gore scenes I have ever seen! (more on this later). It wants to condemn Christianity on one hand, and yet be a film so full of faith that it wants to be cataloged in Seminary for priests to watch. It wants to be a horror film but provides no scares 3)Satan - the devil himself - is nothing but a pretty young boy whose total powers are to a) turn his face white, b) throw people against a wall, c) shoot bugs out of his mouth. Honest - that is it!! Worse, when he talks he is the only one who makes any sense in this film! And he is dispatched quietly by waving a cross in front of him. That's it! That is the BIG confrontation! 4) some of the WORST special effects I have EVER scene. I can't believe people would complain about the cgi hyenas in Harlin's version if they would have seen the crap in this film. the cows were hilarious!! I have seen graphics on my child's game boy better than this. 5)what was with the cheap gore shots? nothing happens for ONE HOUR and all of a sudden you see a close up an arm being opened up. Or a shot of that hilarious cow tearing an animal apart. Did they think this was supposed to be scary? yeesh.there was not one moment where I was a) interested, b) cared about the characters, c) scared, d)spooked out.At the 30 minute mark I was looking at my watch. At the one hour mark I wanted my money back. At 1.5 hours I was clenching my teeth and hands holding back my desire to eject the movie and/or throw something at my TV. At the 2 hour mark I was so incensed I wanted to fire the director and hire someone else to rewrite and re shoot this travesty and try to salvage SOMETHING out of this mess!oh wait - that's exactly what the studio did!Renny Harlin is a genius. You hear me - a GENIUS for being able to make a decent film out of this monstrosity.I used to think that producers and studio executives really shouldn't get involved with the creative process of film making. But after watching this and knowing they only released this film under pressure from ignorant people (like myself) who couldn't believe it could be this bad, I have renewed respect for them.This film was never released. It escaped.Well worth missing...How ANYBODY can give anything more than a 1 for this film is beyond my comprehension.. But to each their own.Still, this needs to be in the bottom 250...</fullReview>

The story was weak. The directing was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and it shows. I've watched it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming feature. But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be left well alone. Anyone wanting to know what the best sequel to The Exorcist was should read 'Legion', penned by Blatty it has to be the best follow up to an original piece to be committed to print. Sadly, it did not translate to to screen very well and I doubt if it ever could be. As for Dominion, Beginning. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

Not needing lots of naughty blood and guts and people screaming while the audience is thinking about where to go for dinner after, it gets pleasantly involving the further in we get. You'll be as scared as you want to be. They have given you things here to be scared of, alright. The story and tone fit remarkably well with The Exorcist (especially the new cut with added footage), so if you enjoyed that you will probably like this. Also very interesting to compare this with Exorcist: The Beginning. Wouldn't hesitate to put this in a theatre, where it should play very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of the "Exorcist" story, this is a must see. As for the film itself, it was disappointing in some ways.The story fills you in on Father Merrin, the horrors he witnessed in Nazi Germany, and his previous battle(s) with evil. But director Paul Schrader meanders aimlessly through a story that could, and should have had a much larger impact. CGI was used in a few scenes that completely kill the credibility of the story.Some scenes were very well done, such as the inside of the "church". The style of filming as well as the cameras used did help a great deal to give the feel of a post world war 2 time frame.I'd love to see this part of the "Exorcist" story remade by a director with some passion for the story itself. It's VERY well written.</fullReview>

I really didn't find The Beginning scary more as disturbing and upsetting.

The end was a little creepy but all in all I was more upset by the movie. So now I will watch Dominion and let you guys know what I thought of it.

		<shortDescription>This movie is possessed - by boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story isn't really exciting. You just sit there and watch. There are some slightly interesting scenes, some supposedly shocking ones (uh, a dead newborn full of worms - how terrifying...), a few funny lines (even though I doubt that they were meant to be this way)... but nothing special. All plain and ordinary stuff. Not even the effects are well made. Especially the hyenas looked really cheap.In the beginning, we see a scene from Father Merrins' past. Even though it helps understand, why he lost his belief, it doesn't seem to play such an important role. It's not like you ever wonder yourself, why Father Merrin acts the way he does. Then comes for a long while pretty much nothing important. At the last third of the movie, a young man (Cheche) gets possessed by an evil spirit. It doesn't act very evil, though. It even warns an unexperienced priest (Father Francis), not to touch it with anything holy. The second time he tries it, that evil spirit throws the priest onto the statue of an angel with such force, that you hear every bone in the priests body (and probably his spine, too), break. Nevertheless the young priest stands up and walks away to find some book, in order to drive away the evil spirit. They must have messed something up. It's Cheche, who got possessed and thus gained supernatural powers, not the priest. A few scenes later we see that hard to kill Father Francis again. This time, he is spiked with arrows like a hedgehog. But no big deal, of course. Seriously, that priest must be the incarnation of Archangel Michael himself. Gimme a break...What started out like an average movie, evolved to a disappointing waste of time. Dominion is hardly worth being watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The serious one......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At an archaeological dig in Africa, Father Lankester Merrin has his first encounter with the devil incarnate. Merrin has focused on archaeology, rather than spiritual matters and is intrigued when a church buried beneath the sand is excavated. Inside, he finds many signs of devil worship. To a great extent, he has lost his faith and is particularly haunted by events during the Nazi occupation and the impact of his decisions had on his parishioners. When the devil occupies the body of a young patient in the village hospital, Merrin risks his life to save him....So this is the other version, the one i was actually excited about more than Harlins predictable, cheesy, horror that made it to the big screen? Paul Schrader has an amazing talent, but none of it is shown in this lame duck.I don't really care about the connotations about westerns or the fact that this has some very good performances from the leads, the fact of the matter is that the story is very poor, and it's just boring to the point of wanting to turn it off.Warners should have left the Exorcist franchise well alone after the first, but they had to keep getting that little bit of money from it by re-releasing the same movie or making other versions.the one version of this was for the young horror/gore obsessed teen, who is used to movies like Haloween Resurrection and want to just forget about everything for ninety minutes.This version is supposed to be for real lovers of film, and it's just offencive stuff. probably the first subliminal major film release for two different versions of a film for two different classes of people.Give me Harlins version any day, at least i can laugh at how bad that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second look: DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: 'Dominion' just doesn't hold up. When I first watched this on HBO, I found it somewhat of a disappointment. While I was given a cleaner perspective the second time, I wasn't at all rewarded in subsequent viewings. 'Dominion' delves deeper in the story than Harlin's noisy, overcooked version. Unfortunately, it's neither better nor worse than that film. For though it's more cerebral, it's also more boring and the effects, scare tactics are cheaper than ever. Paul Schrader, instead of spilling more blood, coped for more plot and story, to explain the situations more. Stellan Skarsgaard is given more time to act as a cynical Father Merrin. Unfortunately, nothing hardly ever happens to the film. Basically, it's the same film all over again. The film's message of regaining one's faith stay true, but the rest of the film grow tired real quickly. The battle between Merrin and the demon in the climax is mainly composed of groans and sermons, nothing really exciting. Even Harlin's 'Beginning' had a more thrilling climax. This doesn't sure help when you only have a penny's worth of special effects. Being a fan of the original William Friedkin blockbuster, I was particularly interested in DOMINION, but unfortunately, that didn't last. Then again, I guess this is film wasn't meant to be for everyone. Worth a peek, but there's no real need to see it. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>prequels are absolutely worthless pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both of these prequels are absolutely worthless pictures, they detract from the brilliance and realism of the first film, which is a superb endeavor. They suffer from an inability to commit to serious script writing, story and funding, what they have created instead is an extremely "dumb downed" version that should have never been made at all. It is obvious they were made for the "MTV generation", as they do not notice the subtle errors which have been egregiously made. Sub-par acting dominates each of them, stilted corny dialogue, written by the inept writer for the masses, Caleb Carr, douses any suspense at all. The film stock also detracts, as it appears that reality is only an imitation, take for example some shots of a cave, they appear to be well lit and inside a fake set, the church itself resembles a piece of plastic, the statues are styrofoam, and the CGI is offensive to the eye. The original was actually filmed in Syria in historic ruins, which added to the mystery, you will also notice that nothing is really "believable" such as what you found in the films from the 1970's, the faces of actors are clean or have some fake blood or dirt smeared on them and the lighting is too bright. The costuming is even worse, and black workers speaking on equal terms to the whites is only rewriting history to explain the storyline to dumb audiences. Plainly, these are some of the worse films that I have ever been forced to see, they should only be watched for their assumptions about how greed has permeated the film industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilt and the demon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a rare opportunity to watch two movies made from a similar script with many of the same actors. To cut a long story short (you will find it more detailed elsewhere), Paul Schrader shot "Dominion", then Renny Harlin shot "Beginning" using only a few minutes from the already existing footage, so it really became a new movie.Now for the cast of "Dominion". Gabriel Mann plays an innocent priest who does not expect anything terrible, he just wants to start a school in the middle of Africa. Clara Bellar as Rachel the nurse takes care of the possessed boy Cheche (Billy Crawford). None of these 3 actors appear in Harlin's version where we get a possessed woman (Izabella Scorupco) and a smart "pro", pardon me: young priest, straight from the Vatican (James D'Arcy) who has received all the information about the buried church in advance. Stellan Skarsgard as the priest who has lost his belief during WW II appears in both movies.What makes "Dominion" (8/10) a better movie compared to "Beginning" (6/10)? "Dominion" has food for thought. It picks up the subject of guilt, guilt that we all have in us more or less, and that enables the demon to attack human beings. "Beginning" has a lot more gory effects (the hyenas tearing a child to pieces etc.), swarms of insects and a spoonful of obscenities (too obviously imitating the original "Exorcist" movie), but do they really serve a purpose? "Dominion" works more careful with its characters, the relationship between the priest and the major of the British troops is properly developed, and we really suffer with the young priest when he becomes a martyr in "Dominion", whereas we don't really care when he's quickly killed by the demon in "Beginning". Don't get me wrong, "Beginning" has a few advantages, too: a better photography and effective shocks (the French discoverer of the church in the lunatic asylum!). But it really is the care for its characters that makes "Dominion" the better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil You Say ? Redux!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DOMINION : THE PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST (2005) ** Stellan Skarsgard, Gabriel Mann, Clara Bellar, Billy Crawford, Ralph Brown, Isarael Adruamo, Andrew French, Antonie Kamerling. (Dir: Paul Schrader)The Devil You Say ? Redux! Last year Warner Bros. reluctantly released its much troubled prequel to THE EXORCIST ?EXORCIST ? THE BEGINNING ? directed ham-fistedly by hack Renny Harlin who obliged the studio in its request for a more 'horrific' tale then Paul Schrader's original film contracted instead which now has the unique situation of begrudgingly releasing Schrader's scrapped version after it tested well in some festivals and was much abuzz among Internet bloggers and critics alike wondering just what Schrader had in mind (read: art house hooey) or in fact a genuine psychological terrorfest.Well sadly it is a mélange of both and not quite either for that matter.Schrader reportedly had filmed an entire production that was more or less ready for post-production when he was given the boot by Morgan Creek (WB's partner in crime here) when they realized his was a more 'brainier' take than a visceral chiller and after Harlin's mess was less-than-enthused both with the critics and the audiences it seeked, Schrader didn't keep quiet about how he was manhandled by the studio and was determined for his brainchild to see the light of day (or light of screen as the case may be). Essentially the story line is the same as Harlin's take ? circa 1949 in the British occupied post WWII Africa desert with Father Lankester Mirren (Skarsgard again remaining true to form in both versions) facing demons both literal and metaphorical (the latter again in more elaborately detailed flashback in a "Sophie's Choice" consequence with the Nazis that will haunt him for years to come. Mirren has spurned more or less the Catholic Church as a priest and is on a sponsored dig to excavate a 1,500 year old church inexplicably buried in the middle of nowhere. Here he is faced with several hurdles including his past and a young deformed villager named Cheche (newcomer Crawford) that the rest of the locales consider him bad news. He finally is able to gain Cheche's trust to be cared for with the help of a Holocaust survivor, Jewish nurse Rachel Lesno (Bellar). Also on hand is novice priest Father Francis (Mann) whose gullibility will be the death of him when he insists Cheche be baptized despite the fact that , well Cheche is in fact possessed by ? THE DEVIL!!!! So what could be so terrible in the fact that Schrader's version was scrapped you are asking the proverbial $64,000 question? Well frankly it's boring, pretentious and dull but it is ably acted, has some stunning cinematography thanks to veteran d.o.p. Vittorio Storaro (who pulled double duty on both versions - as well as many of the production's crew for that matter), excellent make-up by Fabrizio Sforza and Jake Garber; and provides a little more insight to the good Father Mirren's troubled soul here more psychologically than resorting to blood and guts. Schrader ? with a screenplay by William Wisher and the novelist Caleb Carr ? has always probed the inner psyche and moral underbelly of man in many of his works (i.e. RAGING BULL &amp; THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ) in the duality of man (yin-yang et al) and Skarsgard in fact remains in a state of resigned apathy with a shadow of faith and hope amidst the calamity he is encountering (and eventually his character will rescind to in the '73 classic film). It may not have been necessary to release the film (perhaps just packaging the two editions on a special DVD) but it does go to show that despite two filmmakers takes the franchise has been exorcised of any cinematic curiosity for future franchise endeavors; the well is as dry as its metaphorical deserts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost As Bad As a Root Canal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look this film up, you can read a wealth of information about how terrible the initial reviews were for it. It was re-released under 'Exorcist: The Beginning' which was essentially just a different edit and a desperate attempt to salvage the whole project. If you're a fan of the original 'The Exorcist' don't feel drawn towards this film as the two are unrelated. In fact, William Peter Blatty, the author/screenwriter of it, said that watching Exorcist: The Beginning was his "most humiliating professional experience." I love horror films and am totally open to anything low budget or a little odd. This is both with dire acting, scripting and special effects. I'm surprised it managed to reach the vote it did on IMDb and can only presume there are some very vocal die-hard fans out there. The film is poor in almost every way imaginable and my sincere advice, avoid like the plague!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the most feeble attempt at commemorating a classic American film icon such as Friedkin's legendary horror masterwork "The Exorcist". There is virtually no trace of cinematic merit to this work; all narrative storytelling elements are lost in an unrelenting Neverland of wishy-washy horror movie Hell, and every shred of visual panache that would typically warrant it "worth seeing" is subdued by shamelessly cheesy and/or ineffective post-production technique. I reserve a personal respect for Stellan Skarsgaard, but after witnessing his portrayal of Father Merrin in this hackneyed rendition of a truly compelling contribution to American cinema's character inventory, I can only hope that his incentives for accepting the role were fueled entirely by unavoidably tempting financial propositions and/or an unignorably persuasive Berretta to the dome. If there are two hours of your life that you truly wish to pollute with talentless cinematic banter, then by all means.. see this film. Otherwise, rent Friedkin's original and pretend this horrendous recap never came to fruition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on DVD without having seen the Renny Harlin version. My comments are based on the movie as it stands - without reference to the circumstances under which it was made (except to note that the synthesiser score and the poor CGI were probably knocked out quickly just to enable the movie to be released).Is it any good? Not particularly. I have no doubt that Schrader wanted to make a thoughtful, challenging 'philosophical' movie rather than a blood-and-thunder horror film. What he actually made was a plodding, somewhat dull little movie, in which each small plot point is painstakingly established and all its ideas are at once tendentious and undercooked.The opening sequence, with its echoes of 'Sophie's Choice', simply sabotages the rest of the movie. This is real evil and it comes from the minds of men, not from demons and devil-possession.The subsequent story is simply a diffuse re-run of Regan's possession without the gaudy trappings. The demon spreads its influence throughout the village. Merrin is having a crisis of faith and is slow to react to the threat that has been unleashed. He eventually recovers his faith (which is not surprising, given what he witnesses) and attacks the demon with 'Bell, Book and Candle'. It goes away. All this takes an unconscionable amount of time.The performances are generally poor. Skarsgard in particular had me grinding my teeth. To show this is a 'serious' movie about important issues, he mopes around looking depressed and delivers every line in a sort of guttural whisper.For all its pretensions it is simply a bloodless re-make of the Exorcist. If it had been given a general release, Morgan's Creek would have lost a packet. By re-making it they seem to have lost two packets.The simple truth is that the Exorcist was a stand-alone movie that didn't need any sequels or prequels. I have no doubt the Harlin movie will be a bit livelier (how could it not be?) but will be equally redundant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, boring entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist" is an incredibly slow and boring film.**SPOILERS**Years after a traumatic event in WWII, Father Lankester Merrin, (Stellan Skarsgard) decides to join an archaeological dig in Africa with fellow priest Father Francis, (Gabriel Mann) along as chaperon. The workers start experiencing strange traumas, which concerns Merrin as their's no evidence of anything that would cause it. When they finally uncover a church buried in the sand that goes against all known religious designs, Merrin becomes increasingly concerned over their being there. As mysterious coincidences plague the people on the dig site, it eventually leads Merrin to believe that evil has been unleashed, and all of his faith is needed to fight it off.The Good News: As far as this goes, there really wasn't a whole lot to like about this one. The film does present evil in a very dignified manner, which is a stark contrast to the other types of films on the subject. It presents it in a manner that would actually be accustomed to, and it is relatable to most people. The devil manifesting itself in a human guise is an issue that must be dealt with on an individual basis, and the struggles provided are more realistic and human than in most of the other films. It's a great method of involving the viewer into the film than ever before. That is something that is greatly appreciated. The film also has some great moments towards the end in the church, and never really loses it's focus. Aside from these, though, there really wasn't a whole lot.The Bad News: There's a couple of things wrong, but the biggest and hardest criticism is it's far too slow. This is a drama-centered story if there ever was one, and what makes it even worse of a crime is that it's a dull drama to begin with. The story is intense, but nothing else is. Had this been made in the vein of being entertaining, then it could've worked, but the overall gist is that of something boring and very slow to get going. This is an intense crime right there that severely knocks it down the rating scale, and quite heavily. Also not helping it is it's storyline makes little sense. There is an attempt to explain everything, but it's buried behind so much psycho-babble that trying to get it out is almost incomprehensible. It rarely kept it's rare moments of potential, but quickly left that as if unable to think that it can carry it along and reverts back to the spiritual side of things. It got old and wasn't all that special to begin with. The CGI in here is another disappointment, as it looks incredibly fake considering the rest of the film looks so good. It was told they were supposed to be a threat, but there wasn't that much to them. This is only the start of things wrong with the film, which is too long to list here. It's just a really bad film.The Final Verdict: There really isn't a lot top like about this one, but it has enough fans to merit a looking over. There may be something of interest for some, but there may be a lot of wandering around waiting for something to happen. If you like psychological horror rather than over-the-top gore-fest then this is a recommended viewing, but the same goes for those who like a lot of action and no pretenses.Rated R: Violence, some language, child killing, children in danger and intense religious themes</fullReview>

Boring, slow and bombastic were the words I thought I would ultimately use to describe this version.Finally, one summer day when I'm not feeling my best I decided to watch this on HBO on Demand. I just finished watching and I still feel a tightness in my entire body. This was everything that the Renny Harlin version wasn't... a truly well made, thoughtful and freightening film. It works on every level. It also challenges our beliefs in good, evil and human nature. If you saw the Renny Harlin version, which I did, this is not the same film and in summation a far superior film. Take the time and watch it, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I found out that "Beginning" was a rip off of this film, I got upset, WB and Morgan Creek said that the film would not take off, that it wasn't time for that film yet, then they go and make "Beginning"...Huh? If the film would not take off why hire people to make the EXACT same movie, with the same person playing Father Merrin, and then not give credit where credit is due? Someone at Warner Bros just wanted a bigger paycheck I think. It reminds me of when they asked Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Clerks 2)to re-work a script for Superman Returns (at the time Superman Reborn) he wrote the script (while in pre-production of Dogma)met the producer Jon Peters (Batman, Wild, Wild West) and when they optioned Tim Burton (Batman, A Nightmare Before Christmas) to direct, Burton said he wanted t o bring in his won writers, so Smith got canned, Superman Reborn then became, Edward Scisorhands, and just this summer with a script very similar to Smiths, comes Superman Returns, with guess who as the producer :-O Jon Peters! After seeing Dominion and Beginning, hands down, Dominion is A LOT better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The way it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to go into the details about production but essentially there were two completely different versions of Exorcist: The Beginning made, done by 2 different directors. There was this version, which was released straight to video, and the one that was released in theaters, which was directed by Renny Harlin (the man behind the Die Hard franchise). The Renny Harlin version was poorly done and was made to appeal more to the masses, meaning cheap scares and gore and gross-outs. Not what the Exorcist is supposed to be. Not only that, but it had a twist on the ending that created a major plot inconsistency when placed in the Exorcist time line. This version was the movie the way it SHOULD have been. It was eerie, and scary in a way that you felt right in your bone, and most importantly, it fit right into the Exorcist time line without creating any inconsistencies whatsoever. And to think that this movie almost never got made because the studio execs thought that the Renny Harlin version (which turned out to be a box office tragedy) was more of what the Exorcist should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist Schrader style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to state first off that I haven't yet seen Renny Harlin's treatment of the Exorcist prequel, I wanted to check out the flick that got the shaft first. Overall I thought it was quite the decent film.It's pretty slow moving but it builds atmosphere and tension quite well. It has a crackling opening scene which explains well why Father Merrin starts to loose his faith and concentrates on archaeological diggings somewhere in Africa. Once the evil is unleashed director Paul Schrader concentrates solely on mounting tension which culminates with Father Merrin performing his first exorcism.Although blood and guts are completely MIA the film still managed to be creepy and very suspenseful. Stellan Skaarsgard gives a good performance as Merrin and the British officers I thought were also quite excellent in their roles. Unfortunately the same can't be said for the other two big supporting actors Gabriel Mann and Clara Bellar, the pair not having a good day at all.Dominion mostly relies on the viewer's imagination to fill the gaps instead of graphically demonstrating the horror and for the most part it's very successful. It's only in the very end that the film falters; in the exorcism itself. A potentially horrific set piece is too watered down and relatively tension free, it's the only place in the film that looks completely rushed.Now all that's left is to view Harlin's version and decide for myself whether the studios messed up big time or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better of two evils</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a avid fan of the original exorcist I was at first excited to see that prequel was coming out about the first exorcism involving Father Marin. But as we know now then came the waiting. Then came the decision to scrap the version by director Paul Schrader and re shoot the whole movie with a new cast, new script and director. I won't go into the reasons for this now but I would have to say that Morgan Creek and Warner Brothers made the wrong call. After watching both movie back to back, first Harlin's the beginning. Then Dominion I have state that Sharder's version comes closer to being something worthy of being connected to the original Exorcist. Harlins suffers from trying to scare us with a few shocks and thrills. The wild hyenas tearing apart a young boy while providing a quick shock compares in now way to Scharders building up of the school room massacre. Sharder takes the time to let you get to know the characters what they are feeling and what they are going through. Which is why when the children say they came to school because they thought Jesus would kill one of them if they didn't, you get a bigger picture. You actually feel sad for these children. And then to have them all killed right after was a amazing job at story telling. Also I liked the twist on the actual possession. Instead of becoming this hideous ghoul that was characteristic of Linda Blair in the original Cheche becomes the opposite. He becomes healed. Smooth skin and able to walk with perfect hands arms and legs. It is easy to see that What Cheche is becoming is the devil himself. The fallen angel Lucifer who would always see himself as perfect. Also where Harlin fails the most Schrader stands out and that is the realism of the movie. Harlins version is hardly believable with you watching saying to yourself OK that made me jump but I don't have to worry about it because that would never happen. What made the original exorcist scary was that it was done with so much realism that you can believe that this can really happen. While watching Dominion you get a sense of watching a movie that is based on a true story. While that is not the case Scharder succeeds in doing what every director hopes to do. Make a believable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, after having seen Exorcist: The Beginning, this movie seemed a bit confusing at first. I thought I was seeing a prequel to the latest Exorcist installment, but in actuality this movie is a different version of what happened before the original Exorcist. The acting of the cast was good, especially that of Stellan Skarsg?rd, but other than that this movie did seem a bit lifeless. The computer animations looked awful, the storyline itself was a bit dodgy and full of holes in this movie. It seems as though there is a more Christian influence to this movie as well. In all, it feels like a watered down version of the recent Exorcist: The Beginning. It barely compares, as I did like the previous versions' directing style a bit more. It felt more dramatic and alive. I suggest you do watch this version before watching Exorcist: The Beginning, I think it would be easier to keep to an open mind more that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is disgraceful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, like "The Beginning", is breathtaking for all the wrong reasons. If, like me, you approached this film with the hope that it would inspire deeper feelings than just cheap pantomime-style surprise, you will be hugely disappointed. The original film "The Exorcist", i believe through its lack of over-produced music and its inspired use of natural sounds generated an unexpected air of reality to even the most far-fetched scenes. The unrivalled mood of "The Exorcist", in my view, is largely as a result of the low-church environment that it is set in. Both the soundtrack and the sets used in "Dominion" are excessive and rather than generating atmosphere detract from it. Less really is more in films of this nature. (A hackneyed example of this is Blair Witch). I have no idea how expensive it must have been to create the set for the inside of the church in this file, nor to animate the hyenas. Both are equally artificial and destroy any sense of atmosphere generated by the actors. Skarsgard has, in my view, demonstrated in "Ronin" that he is capable of playing the role of the broody and enigmatic type. However, his abilities are stretched too far in this film and the support they receive does nothing to elevate them. Supporting actors are second rate across the board; they reek of straight-to-video. In simple terms, this film is not worthy to be associated with the original film in any shape or form. It relies upon yet another poorly devised prosthetic storyline which does nothing but disable the impact of the original film. One criticism i may have levelled at me is that i make too much of the fact that this film calls itself a prequel. Judging it as a stand-alone production would result in an even lower rating. The only great questions that this film leaves it viewer pondering are: What force it is that drives the movie industry to produce garbage like this? Is the subtle artistry employed in the making of the original film a thing of the past? Are the creators of this film so patronising as to think that audiences would find their film thought-provoking and genuinely spooky? Call yourself a prequel to a masterpiece and expect to be judged with scrutiny. I have left many stones unturned, but take it from me, this film is appalling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironically the best Exorcist Sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dominion presents something of a paradox. As a horror film, it fails miserably. Dominion is not even remotely scary. Naturally, one expects a sequel to the Exorcist to remain within the same genre as the original, and this film will no doubt draw criticism for its sudden jump (especially when you consider that Dominion is far from perfect, and is not in the same league as the original Exorcist.) The downright distractingly awful special effects will, no doubt, draw fire from even admirers of the film. The hyenas effect especially breaks the reality of the film with their awkward and unnatural movements ? they literally do not look like they belong in the frame. Fortunately, the hyenas play a minimal role.And I wasn't impressed with the overall quality of the image and sound as though Schrader didn't have the means to completely finish the post-production ? whether this is the fault of Schrader or the studio, I don't presume to know but I have my suspicions.Dominion may not work as a horror film; however, it does contain numerous scenes that work beautifully as a part of a drama. Strangely, though, while the individual parts work wonders, it doesn't quite work as a whole. Almost, but not quite. Nevertheless, I have to emphasize that Dominion is still powerful and moving, featuring some excellent and intelligent dialogue scenes that showcase a deep understanding of human consciousness punctuated by the wonderful cinematography (compliments of Vittorio Storaro). Unlike typical Hollywood, it stands upon the basis of its story and its characters.Dominion features rich and colorful characters in this film, and I fell in love with how the film never lost focus with the human side of the story. It drew me in right away in its opening sequence where Merrin is faced with a decision destined to haunt him for the rest of his life, a decision that shakes his faith in the Almighty. My sympathies were completely with him as he pleaded with the Nazis to not have to choose ten people to die so he could save the lives of many more.The sequence ends with a hauntingly beautiful composition that demonstrates Schrader's proficiency as a director: Merrin is looking towards the camera and pointing behind him to the next victim. We zoom in on Merrin, his face that of a man emotionally torn, while we hear the gunfire of the subsequent murders. We don't have to see the gunfire, we don't have to see the bloodshed. It's all in the eyes and on the face of father Lancaster Merrin.This scene is not only great in itself, but it's an accurate sample of the film as a whole. Dominion relies more upon suggestion than explicit imagery, which is made especially apparent if one takes the time to view Exorcist: Beginning as well. On a similar note, most of the ties back to the original Exorcist come in the form of references featuring logical variations. Specifically: the statue of Pazuzu. Harlin was content to replicate the statue from the first film, while Schrader's statue takes into account the new location and the cultural differences of the men who would have carved the statue.The most notable exception is the "Captain Howdy" face, which is more or less ripped directly from the first Exorcist film.Subtle even in its suspense: one of my favorite moments in the film (probably the most suspenseful part in the movie): Father Francis has lost hope for reaching this community and takes comfort over the sick boy who is miraculously healing faster than he should. Francis takes it as a sign of God's work, but we know the demon has possessed him and it is the demon's power that heals. Father Francis, oblivious to Pazuzu's presence, prays over the boy's bed, leaving the audience to wonder how long the demon will tolerate his prayer.And even though we know Merrin survives, it's still unnerving and suspenseful to see him rush to the rescue without the Rite of Exorcism and without faith in God ? like watching someone making a grave mistake. The original Exorcist implied he faced this demon before and conquered, but the question still remains how? We know Merrin has to regain his faith, but when? Schrader channels the suspense through the anticipation of what must happen before the end of the film.Likewise the payoffs lack fanfare. The film's climax lacked adrenaline. But I couldn't help but admire the subtlety and restraint. Merrin finds his faith on his knees in prayer. His preparation for the inevitable showdown is shown in a simple scene where he unpacks his long stored ceremonial robes, stole, the Roman text, and he lays them out upon his bed. And interestingly, the scene plays more like Merrin rediscovering an old, recently rekindled, passion than a man preparing for confrontation. The final images show Merrin walking outside the settlement into a dust storm, one day to emerge from a taxi in Georgetown under a street lamp.I've seen too many sequels that try to up the stakes, up the suspense, up the action, and up the adrenaline. I've seen too many sequels forced into an artificial formula and completely forget about its own story. Dominion is content to do only what it needs to tell its own story. It's underwhelming in comparison to its predecessor, yes; however, that's what makes Dominion unique and memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better BEFORE the studio got their fingers into it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the original Prequel to The Exorcist before the movie studio decided that a psychological thriller (like The Exorcist, considered one of the greatest horror movies ever made) was not marketable. Therefore another prequel was subsequently made called Exorcist: The Beginning which still featured about half the same cast and was shot on the same sets. One of the biggest changes in my opinion is the replacement of a dark haired Clara Bellar with the blond bombshell Izabella Scorupco.This version of the movie has a young Lancaster Merrin fighting the forces of evil in a much more metaphysical and psychological fashion when he is called to investigate the discovery of a completely buried church in north Africa that should not be there. The fun starts from there when little things begin to suggest there are otherworldly forces at work. This movie is by far better than the remake and if your going to watch only one, this is the one to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is How a Film is Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to pick one-director-over-another--Paul Schrader or Renny Harlin--the answer would be easy: Paul Schrader, every-time. Paying-audiences seem to agree, noting the flop of the studio-version of this story. The conceit that Producers (generally Executive ones) know how to create decent-films is a dead-one. Have I seen the Harlin-version? Nope. Will I? Yes, I want to do the rare-comparison that this sequence-of-events has brought us--a rare one in Film-history. We get to see the "what-if" scenario play-out, and it is exciting for everyone who loves movies.The Schrader-cut: It is excellent, and very human and interesting. Is it horror? An emphatic "yes"! Taking a page from psychological-horror, and examining the human-condition's inherent-evils really was eerie, this is an unsettling-film. Noting Schrader's oft-mentioned Calvinist-background, it should not be a surprise that he paints a world that is evil at all-levels. Of course, this is true. If you have an iota of consciousness, it's clear that violence and brutality exists everywhere, be it emotional or physical, and nature surely has no sentimentality. Schrader has numerous examples of this at-play in his film, and it is unpleasant (because it's supposed-to-be). Great cinema addresses the human-condition. This film does that.And so, does this film amount to a good-addition to the "Exorcist" canon? Absolutely. It's a film that is finally as-serious in the approach as the first film by William Friedkin was--and both comment on evil being universal and eternal as part-of our lives on this rock. Somehow, this wasn't "commerical"--as though Producers know what everyone wants to see at any-given-moment. If the same people had been given the job of choosing to green-light the original Exorcist, it's unlikely it would ever have been made. Also, it should be remembered that the original Exorcist's production was plagued with cost-overruns due to Freidkin's approach, which was to get-it-right. This is a well-crafted film that will reward audiences with repeated-viewings, it is an important-film that will last. A visual-feast that ponders the immutability of evil, as well as a great-addition to a troubled-franchise!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is awful in a different way than the execrable Renny Harlin version. There is no scene you can point to that convinces you why Paul Schrader had to make this movie. He's made some real junk before, but it's shocking to see a Schrader movie that invokes no ideas whatsoever. To pretend like this has depth (and that was the reason it was suppressed) requires completely broken sense organs. Schrader can mark 2005 as the year he finally sold his soul completely, and eradicated the very last spark of intellect in his movies. Not helping things, is Gabriel Mann as Father Francis, who weighs about 95 pounds, has a distractingly sunken chest, and is off-putting in his over-emoting and sincerity. He is a very poor actor, and I was rooting for the earnest, whiny runt to get it good. Catholic overdramatics are the whole show. The possessed figure this time is silly and poorly dubbed. If you can't do better than Regan in '74 you really should skip the movie. Schrader is too much of a visual pornographer (pretty surfaces) to get anything out of this. All the sets, which are supposed to look eons old instead look like they were constructed one week earlier, then scrubbed clean again, an hour before filming. Skarsgaard goes for a contemplative evening walk at one point and passes multiple bright, sparkling clean brick walls that look exactly like a cheap set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really difficult to say something good of "Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist" considering that "The Exorcist" is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. And try to add something great to the background of an iconic character such Father Merrin is absolutely ridiculous. Forget about Renny Harlin's movie and forget about this one. William Friedkin is, was and always will be the story you must remember and watch over and over again. Although William Peter Blatty author of the book and the first film claimed to have enjoyed the film directed by Paul Schrader, I must say that this disappointing effort adds almost nothing interesting to the series and to the career of the person involved with it.Similar to "Exorcist: the Beginning" (2004) Father Merrin is played again by Stellan Skarsgard and again his first involvement with exorcisms begun during an archaeological expedition in Africa inside of the ruins of an ancient church. Suddenly strange events starts to happen and faithful Merrin tries to comprehend all this things. The vantage of this film towards the one released in 2004 is the good dramatic moments, involving Merrin and Father Francis (Gabriel Mann) quest for faith. The horror was very boring, nothing scary or memorable to see, and that is the biggest problem of the film besides some exaggerations concerning too much summary executions that happens throughout the film (the script proves a point with that but sometimes it's just too repetitive and annoying). Performances are okay, Gabriel Mann is very good in every scene he appears (very sexy dressed as a priest); Stellan is not much likable during some scenes but dominates greatly during the last moments. Morgan Creek the distributor of this film should be ashamed to release this film and the other one directed by Renny Harlin, it only trashed a good franchise and added nothing meaningful to it. Boring experience. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The born scene is the same on both movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the Exorcist, and on the last days I've seen all sequels from the very weak part 2, to the weak part 3 (with a good ending).But when I saw the "Exorcist: The Beginning (2004)" and on the same day "Dominion: Prequel to Exorcist (2005)", I could help but noticing that the scene where Sabituana gives born to a death baby where used on both movies! I mean, if on the last movie, Dominion the goal was to make a better movie than "beginning" (which they got it but not much better) why use the same footage? It is really stingy, as most of people that will watch Dominion had seen the Beginning.Dominion tries to improve where the Beginning failed, and although it's better on some aspects (some characters were eliminated, good choice), it still lacks of the terror environment of the first Exorcist. The impression that I have is that they could make more 10 sequels and it would fail in all times.Why don't just repeat the recipe? The Exorcist is perfect, but like in Dominion they try to make new ways to show the devil, and they always fails, the end is very weak, this "buda devil" is laughable, and don't scary not even my grandma...If you are a fan of Exorcist, you could watch, but with the spirit of seeing a good B-Movie and nothing more...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clunky, a far smaller Exorcist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father Merrin assists a team of archaeologists who unearth a church. At first, Merrin resists the idea that supernatural forces are in play but an encounter with a demon inside a boy may change his mind.Dominion is the Prequel to the Exorcist (1973), the story is engaging, however like Harlin's Exorcist: The Beginning it's doesn't capture the tone of the Exorcist and feels more like a TV movie.The story of Dominion is very interesting, probably more so that the above mentioned Harlin's version but isn't as technically pleasing. It just can't getaway from that television look, the script is clunky, the sets are not dressed very well and the lighting is poor. The acting is more theatrical and the lack subtle cuts make it feel a far smaller film.Opening scene of the film is certainly very effective as Merrin faces the Nazi's. Nevertheless, it does have other faults especially the CGI effects. However, Ralph Brown as Sergeant Major is very good (and his screen time is sadly limited in Harlin's version).It works more as psychological horror but there are too many distractions to engross you, again like 'The Beginning' what makes this film interesting is the fact there are two films that utilise much of the same story, sets and actors. Watch only as an exercise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was lame. Poor cinematography, poor direction, bad script and editing. It has a strong cast who are all wasted -- and the proof of this in watching Renny Harlan's version, which has most of the same cast.Renny Harlan's film is superior in every way. I recommend watching both, however, to see what a difference a good director can make. You may read that this film and 'Exorcist: The Beginning' are essentially the same film, and that they share the same footage. They don't share much, really, aside from the sets and a few key set-up and transition shots. They tell a very different story, and each has a completely different tone. Harlan's is quite epic in scope, and quite scary, while this film stays local to the small cast and has the feel of a PG-13 drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Directing and Non-Adhesive Story lines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I have read so many well thought out analysis of this movie and seen it constantly compared to Exorcist: The Beginning. Now, while they are virtually the same movie, they have a few added rolls and some of the actors were changed out for the better. The woman who played the nurse in this movie wasn't as good of an actress as the woman in the new movie.Now, let's move on to the directing style of this movie. It was very interpretive in some parts and very direct in others. There is a scene where Merrin is losing his mind in a dream sequence and there is a weird, floating clock involved. This was completely lame. Now, the scene where the soldiers are stealing the gems and then you see them in the next scene dead, it was obvious and way too direct. If you have seen Exorcist: The Beginning, the same thing happens but without the theft. We still understand that the Church killed them, making the scene absolutely pointless. Also, the lighting was poor and so were the angles and the cuts. They ruined the flow of the movie and this all falls on the shoulders of the a director who is essentially just not up to par.Now, the storyline has so much potential, and I personally think that can be seen in the Harlin version. This version had no reason for why Merrin was at the dig, he is just there. Let's chalk it up to bad movie magic. Now, Merrin is also not as rounded in this film. You don't get the chance to see his struggles with his decision and how insane it has driven him.In my opinion, this movie was a building block to a better film in Exorcist: The Beginning. It set the foundation and paved the way for a truly traditional Exorcist movie. So, my opinion is, if you want to see the best version of this movie, go watch Exorcist: The Beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is certainly better than Renny Harlins awful Exorcist the beginning. It has an uneasiness in it, but it loses it at the end, i think it strengths lie in its dream sequences, tremendous one with clock, Father Merrin his face covered with bandages and demons face shaking with frustration and Evil. Also the nature of things going wrong was powerful, slowly and windingly things get more awful, the cattle eating hyenas, the maggot covered babe, the British captain going off his head are all interesting and disturbing developments, but the scene at the end in the church is over too soon, i was expecting an epic battle between Good and Evil instead its a bit of a damp squib the nature of the possession is so far detached from Friedkins original that it just dies and anyone who loves the original will be disappointed, amidst Martyred priests, crucified and beheaded soldiers, warnings from Doctors it all becomes a bit of a shambles and very disappointing. There was/is? a great story about merrins original encounter with the Demon, sadly this is not it, but its at least more thoughtful and provoking than the Exorcist the beginning</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still has way too many problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a ton of hoopla determined to have this version of the Exorcist prequel to be released. It was said to be a lot more psychologically intriguing and genuinely more scary than "Exorcist: The Beginning." Well, here it is, and the answer to whether it is any better is a matter of opinion. The only thing I can make out clearly is that this movie is not very good, at all.Some critiques: The film has a wonderful concept and story that are very much engrossing and stand out as a positive note in this movie. The film centers around a priest who has to deal with his questioning of Catholicism while mysterious forces surround a newly excavated, ancient church. Like I said, good premise.However, like in anything, it's not just about the idea, but how the idea is presented. The movie feels overly long in certain segments and too vague in others.Another major problem is that many of the characters are very quickly (and poorly) drawn. The young priest seems too scared and vulnerable to be in such a hostile environment. The Chief of the British troops undergoes a change of heart that is completely out of character and feels completely out of place with the pace of the film. Also, I hated the treatment given the tribes people in the film--it makes what may be their sacred rituals and condenses them into "spooky" omens of the devil. Along with these script problems, you also get major acting issues. Mainly, the nurse, the young priest, and all of the British cavalry are severely limited in that department--that leaves Father Merrin as the only good source of acting.Next up is the special effects. Apparently, the movie studio didn't want to spend any money at all on this movie, especially since the previous one was so terribly received. This results in hyenas looking ridiculous, snakes and cows that look like stuff made on a 1995 mac computer, and a devil who pales in comparison to any of the previous "Exorcist" work (including the original's). Basically, the CGI in this movie is worse than a badly conceived, low-funded, early 1990's SciFi network TV movie. It's harsh to write this, but it is SOOOOO true.And finally, the film suffers the most devastating blow of all: It's not scary. At all. Not in the least. There are a few moments when lighting and situational aspects could have made the movie more tense and taught. But it doesn't explore those aspects, and instead, gives us a movie that tries to be what it inherently isn't. The beauty of the original "Exorcist" was that it gave us a truly creepy theological background paired with scary action on-screen. It was masterful. Unfortunately, this movie focuses too heavily on Father Merrin's problems without giving enough time to the demonic issues and the stomach-turning chills that we sorta expect from this genre. So, just to repeat myself: not scary! After all this, you might be wondering why I gave this movie five stars and not zero. The short answer (after all this writing) is that the premise is just too good. The movie makes one point that is just heartbreaking--what would a good man do when he is given the worst choices in the world? And what would have happened if he could relive that moment and change his actions? And while this is truly the heart of this "Exorcist" movie, it would have worked better as a drama rather than something half-parading as a scary movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 2005 "Exorcist" is so similar to the 2004 one, the fourth part, that I thought at times that I was mistakenly watching the same movie again. The only difference is that this fifth part is duller. Very dull.This horror film contains all the no-nos of the genre. It's far too long with its 110 minutes. The look of the movie is utterly bland, and there is no atmosphere to speak of. Almost nothing happens in the first half-hour, and very little much else in the entire movie. There is more focus on the dull non-horror sub-plot regarding a brewing war between the tribe and the military than on the religious stuff.When "Exorcist II" came out it was hard to imagine that anyone would ever make a worse entry in this very uneven series (only 1 and 3 are good), but I have to say that this monotonous piece of crap achieves that feat. At least the second part has some camp value, whereas this fifth part is just DULL.Have I already mentioned that it's dull? You have been warned...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no point in arguing over whether Dominion surpasses Beginning when the reality of the situation is that both films were absolutely terrible. We're all fans of Exorcist on one plane or another, so how can anyone honestly stand by this film? In Exorcist we have the struggling between demon and human form that lasts the entirety of a film?the demon spirit and Regan's human soul grapple throughout the film and at no point does the demon overcome completely, it's still fallible with partially human form. We also have to consider the fact that in Exorcist father Merrin (the same character that was in Dominion, but much older: for those who are a little slow) was so at his end in this situation that it actually killed him, the situation being a possessed girl who's tied to a bed and doesn't present any extreme levels of threat other than to herself. Now in Dominion on the other hand, the writers and directors apparently thought that in the prequel they would have a demon overcome a body and turn into a powerful alien-like creature who appears and disappears at will as well as throwing men across church rooms and knocking them over by tilting its head. That's okay, because father Merrin waltzed in and exorcised him with ease?but after having done all this, several years later he dies trying to save Regan, who has no such powers. Yes times do change, for the worse. I think everyone just wants to like this film for a personal glorification in going against "Hollywood," well this is the last place to start. For all who think this film is any good, check out filmmakers like Jim Jarmusch or Ingmar Bergmann?they will make you realize that there are great films that aren't Hollywood? just Dominion isn't one of them?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid film ?? There is no doubt in my mind that those reviews come from members of the production or their family... Let me resume it: it's a lame, low budget remake of Exorcist: The Beginning, only made without any sense of direction or story. A real agony to watch, and a complete waste of time. The only horror come from having to endure it. I mean... who makes a retell of the same film, almost identical, a year later of Exorcist: The Beginning, but trying to make it un-watchable ? Beats me. Why Stellan Skarsg?rd agreed to make such a trash of a movie, is a mystery to me. Exorcist: The Beginning is not a great film, but is a decent try. Its entertaining. Dominion is the worst exorcist movie ever made, and one of the lamest excuses of a movie I have ever suffered, ranking very high among the very worst films I have watched in my life, and I have seen thousands.

		<fullReview>First off: THIS IS NOT the EXORCIST: BEGINNING with extra footage, as stated. I couldn't wait to see Schrader's prequel to the Exorcist. I hated the Harlan version so much and was disappointed as I read Schrader was fired when his version wasn't liked by the studio heads. He's a talented director (and writer...perhaps he should've re-written this!!!!!!!!???!!).You can tell, by watching the film, that it may have been plagued from the start (rather than only in post). 90% of it doesn't have the feel of a Schrader movie. I don't want to compare directors. I just feel that this film had a lot going for it but fell short because of studio interference. Instead, it's on par with the Harlan version.There are some solid scenes but they all seem rushed and lacking style. I dunno. I feel like someone was rushed through a production and not allowed to make the film they wanted to make. You have to be pretty stupid to not give a director like Schrader full run. With some tweaking, and more time given to the director and his crew, this could have been a worthy installment of the Exorcist series. Oh, well. Whine whine whine, bitch bitch bitch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dominion of boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the making of Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist is, in the context of film history, a fascinating one. Begun under the aegis of director John Frankenheimer, his untimely death left the production without a director. Enter Paul Schrader, screenwriter of the infamous Taxi Driver and later, a director in his own right. He completed a screenplay with novelist Caleb Carr and screenwriter William Wisher, filmed the production and delivered it to production company Morgan Creek, which found the film underwhelming for what they were looking for, a standard horror film. Instead they received what was reported to be a psychological thriller, which Morgan Creek quickly shelved. Enter director Renny Harlin, who altered the screenplay with screenwriter Alexi Hawley, and filmed his own version, which was released in 2004 as Exorcist: The Beginning.After the critical and box-office failure of Exorcist: The Beginning, Morgan Creek eventually decided to let Schrader's version the light of day, with a limited theatrical release in May of 2005 and now a general DVD release. So, after all the time given to speculate as to Schrader's vision, we are able to say without doubt that it is . . . boring. Paul Schrader had never directed a horror film before Dominion, and it seems that he shouldn't immediately jump into another one after what is on display here. There are some interesting ideas in Dominion, that's for sure, and it's hardly without merit, but it also counts as one of the dullest horror films I have ever laid eyes on.For those who have seen Exorcist: The Beginning, much of Dominion will be familiar. The film opens in Holland in 1944, where Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard, who would also essay the role in Exorcist: The Beginning) must watch, and in a way, participate in the murder of ten villagers at the hands of the Nazis. Three years later, Merrin is the head archaeologist at a dig in Africa that has uncovered what appears to be an ancient Christian church buried under the ground where none should be. Father Francis (Gabriel Mann), a local missionary assigned by the Catholic Chruch to the area, desires to determine the religious significance of the discovery, while Merrin, on sabbatical from his duties while dealing with a crisis of faith, is wary of him. The local British army attachment is instructed to protect the church, but trouble begins brewing between then and the local tribe, and a physically deformed boy, Cheche (Billy Crawford), appears, and is cared for at the local settlements, while healing from various wounds much quicker than expected, leading us to suspect he is not all he appears to be.Dominion, at it's very core, is a meditation on faith. Father Merrin has lost his, Father Francis is finding his tested, and the local villagers find it the root of all evil. Schrader and his screenwriters aren't afraid to tackle many of these issues head on, and at times, Dominion is interesting from a intellectual point of view. However, this is also supposed to be entertainment, and as that, Dominion fails miserably. The film unfolds at a lethargic pace, taking seemingly forever to get anywhere. As a horror film, Dominion is even worse. Sure, I don't expect every moment to be scary, but some suspense, unease, or even atmosphere would be welcome. There is none of that in Dominion. As photographed by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and designed by production designer John Graysmark, Dominon is about the flattest looking horror film I have ever seen. While being set in the wilds of Africa certainly doesn't easily lend itself to the normal environments that a horror film should populate, Schrader, Storaro and Graysmark have done little or nothing to produce a disturbing or threatening environment, or even a very lived-in one. The sets look antiseptic and fake, the lighting seems flat and without mood or atmosphere. Harlin's Exorcist: The Beginning also lacked verisimilitude, but at least he tried. Schrader seems to have set out to not even try to make a horror film (he wouldn't be the first big-name director to take a stab at making a horror film while claiming to not, fearing being associated with a perceived ghetto genre). There is no sense of dread or unease to this film at all, and when the standard Exorcist elements make there appearance, they have been well-telegraphed and lack any scares at all. There is hardly a moment in Dominion that is unsettling in the least.Performance wise, everyone in Dominion seems capable, but nobody really stands out. I felt no attachment to any of the characters, even Merrin. They are just there to move the plot forward, nothing else. The film's central conceit of Merrin finding his faith again is also half-resolved from my point of view. There is nothing compelling to make me really believe it.So, when all is said in done, the double shot of Exorcist: The Beginning and Dominion: Prequel to the The Exorcist, are snake eyes, with neither being an example of film-making at it's finest. Perhaps Hollywood should learn a lesson or to and stop making lame sequels to famous horror films, we will all be better off for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Contest w/Dominion &amp; Beginning Box Office $$ Proof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what the people who liked Dominion and not Beginning. I personally thought Dominion was a real waste of time and money. Box Office sales should have proved that. I just finished reading a comment be another viewer and he really trashed Beginning while praising Dominion. Some of his/her comments didn't make much sense. He/She says "There was no reason to scrap it and make an entirely different, much worse version", unless Dominion went into production first and then not completed only to be picked back up and then finished after Beginning was released, I could have swarn Beginning was released first! Then towards then end of his/her comments, the faults that were listed alone were far worse then the good comments listed. Of course the first Exorcist did use a lot of special effects in 1973 as Beginning did. What sequel made over 20 years later didn't try to add more special effects to go along with the times. (1973-2004) ie See Star Wars. Maybe I am a little bias because I saw Beginning first. But I really do believe that it was a much better movie. I understood more why Father Merrin lost his faith being made to point out these people one by one. That Nazi officer in Dominion couldn't even scare the little kids acting in the movie! Box Office $41.8 million compared to $0.2 million for Dominion should tell the story! Someone was spending money to see this.</fullReview>

First, let me say that I was one of the few who actually quite enjoyed Exorcist: the Beginning, and my reasons are posted in a review of that film. Watching Dominion, I had hoped for the more subtle, intelligent film I had been hearing of on the Internet for months, and even bought the darn thing instead of renting it, certain it would be a keeper. Well, the CGI was some of the very worst I have ever seen -- and I once thought the hyena scene in Beginning was bad -- the scenes in this film make that one look like A+ work. The female lead seemed hand-picked from a high school drama class, and climax -- WHAT CLIMAX? Okay, I can understand the need to go against the flow and present a possession completely other than what might be expected, but this was ridiculously bland and totally unfrightening. I sat in total shock when the movie ended, and now have a much greater appreciation for Exorcist: the Beginning. Overall, I would have to admit I am frustrated by both on some levels, because what is a fantastic story has not been fully realized in either movie. Exorcist: the Beginning, however, took much greater control of the story, where Dominion seemed to languish in obscure dialog and silliness. Not to ignore the quality of production, I will say that I had hope for the first hour or so -- it's just that the movie ultimately ends up flat on its face. I turned of the TV feeling like an episode of The X-Files might have treated the storyline better than this version.2 stars out of ten only because it began with promise. Unfortunately, it fell flat on its face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, let's all agree, Harlins version clearly was a superficial, special-effects bravado more than anything, and if it had any entertainment value at all, it was to be found in the holly-go-lightly Indiana Jones-meet-a-demon-way it was executed. And of course, this goes without saying, this meant:"Please leave your wit at the door, transform to automaton-mood, and we'll surely show you what Follywood is all about! Enjoy, retards"! What then about Mr. Schrader? Had he somehow managed to create a masterpiece, forcing Follywood to perspire violently, knowing that there were no chance in hell that their core, brain-dead, spit-licking audience would be willing to spend their pennies on anything requiring signs of independent brain-activity? As we all know, Renny Superficiarlin, was hoisted in to rectify the situation, to give the retards their due. And beholding the nothing-behind-the-veneer outcome of that job, I was actually looking forward to watch Schraders original version, as it was strongly reputed to take a more psychological approach, and ergo to have more depth to it. Well, saw it yesterday, and despite people claiming it to be a masterpiece, all I can say is: Far from it! What I liked about the film was Schraders willingness to not rush things up, to actually create long, brooding shots, instead of being a Barflin, and think that quick, snappy, MTV-editing somehow should be able to convey a creepy atmosphere. Unfortunately, brooding shots alone don't automatically make for evil atmosphere, and however willingly Schrader was intent on creating something sinister(If that's not the case, why make a film with this theme?), some beast to stir in your soul for years to come, he didn't quite make it, I'm afraid to say. First of all, Clara Bellar is clearly eye-candy, and it would all have been hunky-Dory if she was cast as the mute doctor, then we wouldn't need to hear all those wooden lines. Pretty talentless, yes. Second, it is hard to think that in all of Africa, it was impossible to get hold of some real cattle and hyenas. And because of this despicable laziness, the result is hyenas that look like cozy fuzzballs, and cattle that look as real as a drawing by a five-year old. Oh, the wonderful world of CGI!! Third, to bad that the boy that played the possessed looked more like a harmless mongoloid with crooked teeth than anything else. Granted, after the transformation into baldness, he fitted much more into the role of the fallen angel, and it was actually refreshing to see that Schrader chose a different angle as to how to portray someone possessed. Instead of Blairs stew-spewing, frantic, rotten face(Which is also quite nice!), he portrays him as the great enticer, and here he has a coldness about him that is wonderfully inhuman and detached. But the question begs to be asked; if Cheche is supposed to be a native, why is it that he amazingly appears to be Philipino, and the rest,Africans? Did someone decide to adopt him? All in all; I like the pace of the movie, the way it is shot, I like the fact that much more emphasis has been put on creating dialogue with depth, and I like the fact that the film has some semi-dark moments. But, and I don't know how many times I have said this, in a horror film(especially) atmosphere is absolutely essential, and somewhere along the way Schrader completely forgot this, and sadly got this result in return.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dominion: Prequel to The Exorcist (2005) *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have nothing at all against Paul Schrader. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my very favorite films. But some horror movie fans were in a premature uproar when his original version of the EXORCIST prequel (DOMINION; this one you're reading about right now, as it turns out) was scrapped by Warners, and when Renny Harlin was substituted to spruce things up and make a new version that was "more scary". In my opinion, some viewers were prejudiced and became automatically juiced up for hating Renny Harlin's take on the subject (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) before the first frame of film was ever even unspooled for them to judge. And I ought to know; because I myself went into the theatrical premiere of BEGINNING with stubborn arms folded, and prepared for the absolute worst, which I was sure had to come. Imagine my surprise when I found Harlin's BEGINNING to be much more serious than I ever could have conceived, with a good performance from Stellan Skarsgard as a young version of Father Merrin, who was struggling with his faith in God. It wasn't a great film by any means, but it was nowhere near the garbage I had prepared myself for, well in advance, sight unseen.Well, now I finally HAVE seen the true garbage version - and it's Paul Schrader's DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST. It was relentlessly talky, uninteresting, and insipid. Stellan Skarsgard's troubled priest was nowhere near as interesting as he had been for me in Harlin's film, and the actor himself not as good in the part. For all those who pointed out the obvious CGI effects in BEGINNING, guess what? They're here in DOMINION as well. Remember the silly ending in Harlin's rendition (which I'll also agree tainted the rest of that movie)? Well, you're going to find that this ending from Schrader isn't a hell of a lot less lame.Let me also say that I resent the nonsense that's been presented by those who appreciate this film better than Harlin's, by saying that we're "retards" or "cannot appreciate subtle film-making". As a person who despises Stephen Sommers' MTV-fashioned MUMMY of '99, and being a true fan of the very suggestive and discreet old horror films of the '30s and '40s, I can assure you this is not the case with me. At least there was "some" degree of terror and Exorcist-type goings on in Harlin's BEGINNING; this one here is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge even for the most certified of insomniacs. It's going to be quite interesting to hear horror fans try to convince themselves that DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST was as good as they'd already made their minds up for it to be in advance; just as they were already pre-disposed to lambasting Harlin's BEGINNING the second they learned Paul Schrader's name was getting soaked with the White-Out. * out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting ideas, lousy movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Dominion to be a lousy attempt to continue the success of the story. The original movie was a story about evil, and how it can infiltrate our lives.Schrader's version is lacking in evil. Viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of dread, fear, or even foreboding. Harlin's version offers evident evil, shows violations of the church's sanctity, and builds a convincing story that is plausible, given Father Merrin's background. Schrader's story leaves one wondering exactly what happened. Dominion does not evoke the emotions of the viewers to empathize with Father Merrin, and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was troubled in the first place.Anyone interested in seeing a sequel which lives up to the original should see Exorcist: The Beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Story, Appeared Unfinished/Unpolished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off by stating that I enjoyed both versions of this movie. I think the two versions show how important a director's vision is. With that said, the Paul Schrader version of the Exorcist prequel is much more subtle than the Renny Harlan version. I found Harlan's more entertaining, but Schrader's more interesting.The thing that hurt this movie the most was definitely the special effects. The hyenas set a really bad tone for the movie right from the beginning. The effects were awful. I was surprised how unpolished the special effects were and how unintegrated they were. The climax scene had some overlooked flaws. Some of the lighting appeared to be right out of a USA network movie or TV show. The possessed character was not frightening at all. The whole sequence at the end looked like it was made with 1980's computer graphics. Its really hard to be afraid of something if it looks so blatantly fake.Another thing that hurt this movie was the supporting cast, especially the female lead. Her performance was not up to par with Stellan's.Paul Schrader told a good story and he better explained the personal crisis of Father Merin. From a storyline standpoint, it's a much better film than the original. Paul Schrader focuses too much on Father Merin's personal crisis. The other part of the film should be about drawing fear of the devil at the same time. The original is great because it was able to tell a good story and evoke genuine fear. Paul Schrader went for more of an aesthetic appeal and wound up with a drama with absolutely no reason to fear anything. What should have been "scary" moments wound up as labored segues to his storytelling.The music did not help matters either.Overall, I can see why this was scrapped. Though Harlan's version does not have the quality storytelling, it was more polished and did a better job of evoking some fear, though small. Harlan's version is not without major flaws as well.I expected a horror movie first and drama second. Schrader's version only gave me the drama and no horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dominion is a let down, Beginning was way Better!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to see this movie for the fact we get to see the original version and also the hype behind it. Well, I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking but I can tell by the high 10 votes on this movie all is not what it appears...... First of all, Paul Schrader knows nothing about exorcisms and it shows. I'm not talking the green soup stuff, but I am talking about the genuine fear,scare and intensity of it. This movie is not scary at all and Satan is the biggest wimp. I like the idea of how he approached Satan but there's barely any dialogue between Satan and the priest. I read that John Frankenheimer had pages of dialogue between them which Schrader cut out and it shows. There is no explanation of how the boy gets possessed. Satan has no personality or depth at all. Nothing happens for the first 50 minutes to show the boy might be possessed. The possession part almost feels like it doesn't belong at all and it's so short. How could Satan be so easy to expel??? After seeing both movies, I must say that I have more respect for Harlin for having to come in and clean up this mess of a movie. His version is so much better and intense. To me, if you could put both movies together using 70% Harlin 30% Schrader and add the dialogue from John Frankenheimer between Satan and the priest, you would have one truly amazing movie. Too bad, but I'm sure ego was involved. I understand while the studio execs rejected this lame version, I would of too.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just watched one of the worst films I may have ever seen. Schrader is not a director, certainly not one who should be allowed to direct a film with elements of horror, tension, style or good acting (apart Skarsgard)Regardless of the effects (truly terrible) the story is interesting, but the way its presented is just shocking. From the artless camera angles to dreadful performances (Clara Bellar and Billy Crawford who is hilarious) flat cinematography and the final piece of goth rock over the final credit this film is an utter mess.For once the studio was right to junk it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter trash! Enormous disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's movies, so it was with sheer excitement I was able to attend at the "Rolling Thunder" screening at the Parisian french cinemath?que with surprise movie on the 17th Dec 2004. Of course the surprise movie was The Exorcist and most people were there for that (I was too). The film was then finished but the score, so P Schrader used excerpts from The Return of the King and some other movie I forget (Was it Conan?). Anyways, apart from that the movie was finalized. The happy few there (maybe 200 people) were told to please not write about the film on the internet or magazines since it may have jeopardized its chance of getting selected to the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the film, then came the realization that the film might not get selected for the Festival because of its quality : Never in my life had I experienced such a feeling of awkwardness in the audience as people went from being skeptical to plainly laughing out loud at the pity-full spectacle. I couldn't believe how low the author of Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction had sunk.Forced over-the-top acting thorough, stupid ending, black and white moral, awful FXs, worst take on Christianity from Schrader ever, not even suspenseful, just boring as hell (no pun intended) and unsurprising at all! Some good locations but sadly miss-used or at least not fulfilling the initial hopes! In the end I was 100 times more satisfied by the Schrader penned Rolling Thunder and wished my 2 hours back.Don't believe the hype, even the John Boorman movie is more exciting and original. Oh, and the Billy Crawford casting, the poor guy does his best, but what where you expecting? He's now part of the small club of worst casting mistakes ever! I give the movie a 1/5 just because I didn't leave the room, but I should have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>majorly anticipated, major disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile. After finally getting the chance to see it last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's "Exorcist: The Beginning" look good, but "Dominion" does just that. No wait...it makes it look like a GREAT film. Perhaps I got myself too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the let down. After all, the idea that Warner Bros. was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction. Plus, I'm a huge fan of Stellan Skarsgard, and in true fashion he gives a great performance, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. On the other hand, the supporting cast in this film is abysmal. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - blank stare, and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous tone, while Gabrielle Mann's Father Frances is just ridiculous. The effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This movie brought about more stifled giggling than anything else, and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three-seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whimper, it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either. I could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers, but frankly I'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things I'd love to say.The saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give...a story about a priest who has lost his faith and then regains it after coming to terms with his troubled past...had huge potential, especially with Skarsgard as leading man. Unfortunately for us, that potential was wasted. Go and see this film only if you're really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version, but don't expect to see a good film or you'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, be content with the version first released and move on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie in world premiere at the Brussels Fantasy Film Festival, everybody here knows the story about the canned version and replacement, I haven't seen R Harlin's version so I can't compare. The feeling before the movie, was because the fans were so shocked we have to like Schrader's version, well it is hard to do that. Let's skip the sfx that couldn't be finished in post production.First it appears to long and tedious sometimes, OK if we put on the side the editing problem (let's say he couldn't work on that either).The best moments are schrader's moments, psychological tension, the prelude piece and the ....SPOILER..... massacre of the children in the school...for the rest u go from unrealistic situations (the beggar is possessed,violent but the priest leaves the nurse alone to go and get his book, helloooooooooo) to yawning and stupid (the final battle completely uneventful).I saw it once thats good, but I wont see it again...always Not a good sign for me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know about you but i go to horror films to be scared and this was anything but scary, the movie had several chances to be truly scary and failed miserably EVERY TIME! Several of these supposedly suspenseful moments were haunted by some of the worst cg you will see this year, perhaps decade! I mean when i say the cg looks like daytime TV, I'm giving daytime TV a bad name, I've seen better stuff on the sci-fi channel. Who i really feel sorry for is the actors,(that they have their names attached to this film) they did a good job, i cared about most of the characters and i felt that their performances were quite good, but that was not enough to bring this movie out of the gutter. Whats really amusing is the reuse of some of the sets, if you have seen "exorcist: the beginning" it will be easy to spot the reuse of some of the buildings. However what i thought was the worst thing about this film, even above the cg problems was the main demon, he was just not scary in anyway, his form, the way he talked, he was extremely bland. all in all this movie was a horrible experience and i would have walked out of the theater if it weren't for my wife wanting to see the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader's The Exorcist: The Beginning at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films. With all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipated.The director was there and so were most of the stars (except Skarsgard).Unfortunately the movie sucked big time. It was a real disappointment for me because I'm a huge fan of both Shrader and Friedkin's (RIP) original 1973 film.What was wrong with it? Most of it actually. The FX (you would think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so badly rendered!), the editing (no real pace or rhythm), the acting (only Skarsgard at times could convince). The script was a, IMO, set up to explain the African scenes in the original film. So the movie had the feel of a set up scene only it contributed nothing.The only thing that I did like was Vittorio Storaro's cinematography although I've seen better from him (Apocalyps Now).All of the time I was thinking this was just a rough cut, a work in progress. And that, given the (well known) circumstances, is probably what it is. But that doesn't change the obvious problems with the script.I had the chance to meet Schrader (very briefly) but I didn't have the guts to tell him what I thought of the film and I was so nervous (this is the guy who wrote Taxi Driver for Christ sake!!) that I forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his Taxi Driver script...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Help! Once again, Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. I rearranged a vacation so that I could see this "world premiere." What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an Exorcist film? Lofty intentions are fine, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babble, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting subject. But an Exorcist movie needs more! The relentlessly draggy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production. Who is this movie for? I didn't bother seeing the Harlin version, but at least they apparently tried to deliver some sort of visceral thrills.The Exorcist series has been quite strange. The first film was excellent, but every sequel has been unloved and pointless. Why do they keep making them? I suppose Schrader made it so that he could get a lot of money. But why should we go?</fullReview>
