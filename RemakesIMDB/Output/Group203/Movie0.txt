		<shortDescription>A sci-fi Wizard of Oz from a kids perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie to be viewed from a serious perspective. But even sci-fi aficionados seem to have been losing their sense of fun over the years, which may be why this remake has been panned so badly. The whole movie is viewed from a young boy's dark imagination, right down to the ridiculous Mr. Potato head aliens. Even the camera angles are taken from child's height. And within the bizarre dream world of adolescent fears and disempowerment springs forth a really fun movie. Within this context, the remake of Invaders from mars remains true to the 1950's genre with some tongue in cheek. Relax, grab some popcorn, and warp back to the 50's, when your imagination didn't have to be fed with a spoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sci-fi cheesy fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually LOVE this movie! I think it's one of the best remakes I've ever seen. When I recently found it on DVD, I purchased it on the spot. To me, this movie is just plain fun. I love the way the boy has to tell the school nurse (The unique Karen Black) about the things he's seen, and she doesn't quite know what to make of this seemingly clearheaded kid. Then, when she sees a bit of evidence for herself, she needs to just take a leap of faith and sneak the kid out of the school. I find it so intriguing, because I always try to imagine what a person would really do in a situation like this. Imagine you're a school nurse, and a kid comes in telling you a spaceship landed behind his house, and now something's wrong with his parents, his teacher, his friend and her father. Of course, you would probably not take it too seriously. But, then, if you actually saw something that seemed to corroborate his story, how would you handle it? What would you do? Even the nurse questions whether she is doing the right thing, The bottom line is she just had to follow her instincts, and something was telling her that things were not right. Imagine really being in that predicament. And imagine if you chose NOT to believe the kid and chalk it up to his imagination. Of course this story wouldn't really happen, but what if it did? That's the point of movies - to make you imagine these wild, unrealistic situations as actually occurring. We are meant to suspend our disbelief and put ourselves into the characters of the story. In my opinion, this film unfolded exactly as it really could have in real life. The nurse taking that chance, believing the kid, meeting him after school, investigating the site of the landing - all the elements that eventually lead up to her discovering the truth for sure. The chemistry between Karen Black and her real-life son, Hunter Carson, is great. They were the perfect team. Laraine Newman and Timothy Bottoms are alternately funny and amusing, then creepy and frightening. And Louise Fletcher as the teacher is a riot! She's just classic. When she says to Karen Black, "You've got a lot of nerve, sister!," I lose it every time. I don't know how someone could not enjoy this movie. I am not a big sci-fi fan, but I put this top on my list of all-time great entertainmnet. No, It isn't Oscar worthy, but I don't need every film I see to be ABOUT SOMETHING. Maybe I just want to sit back late at night with some popcorn and put myself in another place and time. This one does it for me every time I watch it. It's almost like it gets better with each viewing. Don't listen to naysayers. Watch this Midnite Classic at midnght. I don't think you should be disappointed, as long as you aren't looking for it to make a statement about life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the 80's: The remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars (1986) was a remake of the 1950's science fiction classic. Tobe Hooper slightly reinvents the original and updates the storyline. The story revolves around a strange alien craft that lands in a field. A young boy spots the craft but no ones listens to him or takes him seriously. Soon everyone around him begins to act very cold and strange. What can be the cause of this? Maybe the strange spaceship that landed in the abandoned field is causing this? Well it was the 80's.Tobe Hooper made a very surreal and cool film. The special effects are excellent and the direction is on par. The acting is somewhat uneven. But the dialog and photography makes up for it. I enjoyed this movie when I was in junior high school and I still enjoy it to this very day. Another great film from Tobe Hooper.Just don't take it too seriously. The movie is part homage and part remake of the original film and others like it that were made during the fifties.Highly recommended.Karen Black co-stars as the school nurse who believes the kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great update of a classic film which both looks good and pays tribute to it's predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of remakes, not at all. I don't see why films that were good in the first place need to be 'updated'. Perhaps a bad film with a nice idea would be worthy but most remakes, especially these days are just cashing in on the success of the original and usually doing a bad job to boot.Invaders From Mars is one of the most famous of the Classic 50's sci-fi films along with Forbidden Planet and War Of The Worlds. It's certainly the most disturbing of the era with paranoia and fear seen from a child's perspective along with some memorable imagery!The big surprise about this remake is that it's actually good. Really good in fact! Of course it's not perfect but it set out to do a task and in my eyes succeeded!I think one of the best things about the film is how it looks. The locations and sets are fantastic, the set of the alien space ship interior and tunnels are superb as are the locations such as the sand pit. This is all the more baffling when you consider that it's made by Canon, a company famous for uber cheap budgets and cutting corners but it certainly doesn't have that feel here. Being made in the 80's the film has that certain warmth to its feel that seemed to be present in films of that era. There is a remarkably strong Spielberg vibe to the whole film mixed in with a good does of John Carpenter from around the same era. Tobe Hooper does a great job with plenty of nice sweeping wide angles crossed with claustrophobic horror type shots and situations and some nice recreation of the iconic scenes of the 50's original such as the fence going over the hill. There are also plenty of snippets of trivia from the original film hidden here and there throughout the film which is a great tribute and obviously shows the film was made with love.Of course it's not perfect, the acting is hammy in parts which sort of ups the cheese value a little but on the whole it's pretty average and doesn't stray much into 'cringe' territory.A special mention and combined criticism must go to the Martian creatures themselves. Stan Winston's workshop created these beasts and although superbly made and animated they seems to not know whether to be scary or goofy, looking formidable with their huge teeth and grunts one might be scared stiff if they didn't look like a giant testicle from the side on.These are minor flaws though in a film that has so obviously been made with a passion for the subject.I love both versions of this film and I honestly think that more people should give it the credit that it is due!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was a child 'extra' in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie itself is pretty campy and you can't expect a whole heck of a lot out of it, just some cheesy 80's sci-fi fun, but what stands out for me was that I was an extra in this movie and got to experience the making of the movie first hand! I remember, I was in elementary school and got the opportunity to be in this movie. The first day that I participated was at the school scenes. At first I was one of the kids that was playing outside in the yard and then I was one of the kids walking in the hallway of the school. I can't recall if I was in the classroom, I haven't seen the movie since right after it came out and I just ordered the DVD so I'll have to check it out.The other day that I was on set in a state park that was in Malibu, CA where they filmed several different scenes. One of which was a yellow school bus with kids/drones on it. I was in that bus, just staring forward with no expression, as per the direction from Tobe Hooper.It was a fun experience and my first time ever in the movie biz so I'll always have a special little place in my heart for this movie. Good times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been better considering the talent involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1950s, Science Fiction movies were all the rage. Some were about aliens, others giant mutant bugs. When you watch a lot of them today, they're pretty cheesy. However, there are a few standouts that are still pretty effective. The 1980s saw a small resurgence of these kind of films. Sometimes homages work out rather well, sometimes not. By the mid-80s, Tobe Hooper had really made a name for himself. This remake of the 1953 film, was a collaboration between him and other great talents including 'The Return of the Living Dead' creator Dan O'Bannon. Unfortunately, what should have been a slam dunk is instead nothing special.Pros: Above average performances. Pretty good score. Some quite good special effects. Never dull. Excellent cinematography. A few creepy moments.Cons: Little we haven't seen in other films. Lacking suspense and tension. Uneven pacing. Inconsistent tone. Somewhat underwhelming final act. An ending that's been done before and is more a cop-out.Final thoughts: 'Invaders from Mars '86' was a favorite of mine as a kid. I remember it freaking me out back then. Some childhood favorites hold up years after their release. Well, I'm sorry to say that this isn't one of them. Has enough going for it to be OK, but you get the feeling not much effort was put into this.My rating: 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: Invaders from Mars (1986) Director: Tobe Hooper (the man!) Cast: Karen Black, Hunter Carson, James Karen Review: Tobe Hoopers resume includes many great films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Lifeforce, Poltergeist)...and many so-so ones (Spontanious Combustion, The Mangler). Invaders from Mars the re-make of the original alien invasion flick from the 1950's is one of his good ones. Not great, just good.Early on in the film an alien spaceship crashes in David Gardners back yard, slowly but surely everyone in town starts acting weird...soon David must be the one responsible for stopping the aliens from conquering his home town...and maybe the world! This movie is a remake of the 1950 original, and just by the simplicity of the story you can tell that. It has that simple, light hearted, almost innocent feel that the movies had back in those days. But Hooper adds his only brand of weirdness and surrealism to the film that makes it feel like its some sort of nightmare you might have had while falling asleep watching midnight alien invasion films on your TV. Its the type of movie in which people start acting not quite themselves and you get that " something is wrong here" vibe going on, not unlike Invasion of the Body Snatchers.The aliens look great thanks to Stan Winstons always excellent work. But I must admit they do seem kind of harmless. They don't seem like they could be a threat. I mean yeah they got huge gaping mouths with rows upon rows of teeth...but they feel dumb and stupid. For example they have these big ass laser guns attached to their noggins...but they get overtaken by the us army in the blink of an eye? Still, they look cool. Specially their leader who looks like a huge giant brain that comes out of a slimy worm-whole type of thing. If you ask me he also looks pretty harmless....but who cares! They are supposed to be evil! And they are trying to take over earth! Kill them! The sets are awesome, the interior of the the ship is great looking, it kind of has an organic look and feel to it. But it always beats the hell out of me why aliens from mars would have disco lights inside of their ship. You kind of get the feeling that at any moment an alien DJ is going to pop up and spin a couple of cool tunes on his two turn tables and a microphone. Anyhows, the over all effect looked cool so I ain't complaining.Obviously production values ain't the real problem with this flick. Its sets and creatures are awesome looking.The acting is what hurts this film a bit. Karen Black and the Kid just didn't do it for me in certain scenes. The kid sucked as an actor which explains why we probably haven't seen much of him in any other movie. His dialog was to robotic. Like he just read it and blurted it out without any actual thought or preparation as to what he was supposed to be going through in the scene. Sorry dude, but facts are facts. The only actors worth mentioning are the evil teacher and James Karen as General Wilson kicking alien ass all over the place.Invaders from Mars is the type of film you want to show your little kid brother or cousin or son if you want to start him into horror. It goes in my collection right along side other great kid friendly horror films as The Monster Squad and The Gate. Give it a shot.Rating: 31/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical, creepy 80's sci-fi with a 50's scent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper has had a spotty career -- to put it mildly. His "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one of the best horror films ever made. His follow-up, "Tourist Trap" aka "Eaten Alive" aka "Starlight Slaughter", is atmospheric in a PRC sort of way but dumb and cumbersome. He also had a hand in "Poltergeist" (nothing to be ashamed of) and directed the beautifully art directed "Texas" sequel, a dumb, idiotic mess, unfortunately. He also signed his name to "Spontaneous Combustion", "Toolbox Murders" and that rotten thing about a killer washing machine. His "Invaders From Mars", however, is just magical sci-fi with a 50's scent. The atmosphere Hooper conjures, with the help of ace cinematographer Daniel Pearl (who shot both "Texas" and its remake) and production designer Leslie Dilley beautifully captures the creepy, pulpy essence of the original "Imvaders", another art direction triumph.The immortal Karen Black is sublime in the lead role and young Hunter Carson is totally believable as the boy who cries "Wolf!" In fact, Master Carson should have been crying "Mr. Potato Head!" because the loopy alien invaders of this surreal invasion flick look just like bloated Potato Head and his deformed associates (only they're much more fun).The film captures the paranoia of 50's sci-fi and even throws in such great genre stalwarts as James Karen, who plays General Climet Wilson. The Sylvester Levay score has great sonic "alien" tones and the sound mix is eerie and effective.Around the time Hooper made "Invaders" he also made another great film, "Lifeforce", for the same production company (Cannon)."Invaders" flopped and disappeared, but it is out there now waiting to be unearthed and rediscovered.It is one of Hooper's and 80's sci-fi's finest hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With Faye Greener, Nurse Ratched, an "SNL" cast member and the guy from "Harold and Maude", how can you go wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper took an interesting approach in his "Invaders from Mars" remake, with everything told from young David Gardner's (Hunter Carson) point of view. There's an air of "Poltergeist" here, what with the portrayal of a world overrun by commercialism suddenly getting upset. As David's authoritarian teacher, Louise Fletcher seems to be channeling Nurse Ratched (I mean that positively). And Karen Black, as the only person who believes David, gets what is probably her neatest role since "The Day of the Locust".So, this movie's nothing special, but really cool. It sort of makes sense to cast Laraine Newman in this movie, given that she played Connie Conehead on "Saturday Night Live", but who would have ever imagined Timothy Bottoms starring here, as he earlier starred in "The Last Picture Show" and "The Paper Chase"? The only other cast members whom I recognized were James Karen (the developer from "Poltergeist") and Bud Cort (yes, the guy from "Harold and Maude").Oh, and there's a scene that gives new meaning to the expression "a frog in one's throat"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fits nicely with "The Goonies" and "The Monster Squad"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tobe Hooper's remake of the 1953 classic takes the always successful Amblin Entertainment formula made famous through films like "E.T.: The Extra-terrestrial," "Space Camp," and "Explorers" and adds his own flair. He takes those familiar ingredients and combines them with frightening aliens intent on taking over the world one small town at a time. In "Invaders from Mars," a boy (Hunter Carson) begins seeing his parents and neighbors act like zombies. Is it a coincidence the weirdness all started after a flying saucer landed in his back yard?The big genre star in "Invaders from Mars" is veteran genre actor Karen Black. She's perfectly cast in the role of the panicked and constantly tormented school nurse who believes our young lead character is telling the truth. Is she a little overdramatic and campy at times? Of course she is? she's Karen Black in a horror movie!"Invaders from Mars" is rated PG in that wonderful way many 1970s and 1980s movies were. It contains a lot of content that would've merited it at least PG-13 today. The movie includes violence but no real gore. Many sequences will frighten younger viewers because of how the aliens appear and the intensity they'll feel as the lead characters are chased down. The young boy in the film has quite a filthy mouth, much like his counterparts in several other movies featuring children experiencing fantastic adventures in the 1980s."Invaders from Mars" will fit nicely with "The Goonies" and "The Monster Squad." It has all the elements of the coming-of age films of the 1980s directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, and others. The only difference is it delves a bit deeper into the horror and sci-fi realms. It's exactly the sort of genre movie you would expect "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Poltergeist" Director Tobe Hooper would want to watch as an alienated (pun intended) boy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't think it was that bad, quite fun in a silly 80's way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars starts late one night as a young boy named David Gardner (Hunter Carson) tries to go to sleep, while lying in bed he sees flashes outside his window &amp; takes a look outside where he sees a huge UFO land just beyond Copper Hill at the top of his garden, he runs into his parents George (Timothy Bottoms) &amp; Ellen's (Larraine Newman) room &amp; tells them what he saw but they refuse to believe him. The next morning &amp; George has a look at where David said he saw the UFO land, when George returns home he has changed somehow &amp; insists that Ellen come over the hill as well. David is convinced something is wrong &amp; notices small wounds on the back of his parents necks, David eventually finds an opening to a tunnel in the hill behind his house which leads to a Martian spaceship buried in the ground &amp; realises that alien invaders from mars are taking over people's minds &amp; using them to sabotage a NASA space mission to their planet while at the same time stealing copper to use as fuel...Directed by Tobe Hooper for the notorious Cannon Pictures this seemed like an odd film for Hooper to make, best known for his horror films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) &amp; Poltergeist (1982) this is a remake of the classic sci-fi film Invaders from Mars (1953) which was one of the better ones from the 50's. While I haven't seen the original Invaders from mars for a few years I always remember it being a great little film, it's pretty creepy at times &amp; has a unique feel of paranoia running through it from a child's perspective as his town are taken over by the Martian invaders, here in this 80's remake the first hour or so does a fun job of recreating that feel as David finds himself in the middle of a Martian invasion but once the script introduces NASA &amp; the military things tend to go downhill as it then becomes more of an action film &amp; loses the creepiness. This 80's remake also has a dark comic vein running through it with some bizarre moments like George drinking a cup of coffee in one go or Ellen eating raw hamburger meat piled with salt, I didn't mind it's black humour but some might. Lasting 100 minutes this 80's remake is also a lot longer than the original which ran for just under 80 minutes, nothing of any great significance is added &amp; all it really amounts to is a lot more running around &amp; a little bit more build-up. The script is a bit uneven, while David, his parents &amp; Linda the school Nusre feature heavily during the first half they become no more than bystanders once the military are introduced. It can be a bit dumb at times but it moves along at a decent pace &amp; has some good scenes, the first venture into the Martian spaceship, the teacher eating a Frog, Davids parents strange reactions &amp; mannerisms when taken over &amp; the Martian intelligence creature is cool. The script feels a little unfinished, the reason for the Martian invasion is to blow up a probe that is being sent to their home planet Mars to supposedly stop us discovering them but surely coming to Earth &amp; walking around like they own the place has a higher chance of them being discovered? Also, while their need for copper is mentioned it never goes beyond anything other than that, a mention. These two points in particular could have been expanded upon as could the taking over of the humans, who exactly was controlling them?At this point in his career Hooper had signed a three picture directing deal with Cannon, the first product of this deal was the rather good, if somewhat ambitious Lifeforce (1985) which flopped at the box-office, then came this which also flopped before Hooper finally made the also rather good The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) which unfortunately again proved a disaster at the box-office &amp; therefore the Hooper &amp; Cannon relationship destroyed Hooper as a director &amp; almost financially sunk Cannon although I Have to say I think all three films that they made together are pretty good, but money talks I suppose. This remake is far more impressively mounted than the original, the special effects are good with some cool alien monsters, neck burrowing devices &amp; the huge Martian spaceship, I also liked the swirling whirlpool of sand effect that sucks people under the mountain. There's little gore or violence here, someone is eaten by a Martian, a few people are shot but that's about it. The organic design of the Martian spaceship is cool as well, from curved walls &amp; doors to huge tunnel digging machines I liked the alien technology on show here.With a supposed budget of about $12,000,000 this apparently had financial problems during production &amp; the was slashed a few times, filmed in Los Angeles. The acting varies, the kid Carson Hunter is awful while the adult cast are a little better &amp; play it up a bit.Invaders from Mars is a film that I liked more than a great many seem to, I thought the aliens were cool, it looked good &amp; has a weird feel running throughout it that while a little uneven makes it a bit more memorable than a straight, serious remake might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well made remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never understood the cult and loyalty that the original from 1951 seems to inspire.Don't get me wrong i watched a lot of classic SF-movies, from "The day the earth stood still", to "lesser" classics like "Earth vs. the flying saucers", and i like a lot of them very much. Despite the cheesy special effects, a lot of these movies are rather good. But to be honest, i never understood the cult about Invasion from Mars. The movie is just terrible. The story is utter crap, and badly executed. Most of the actors are horrible, and totally miscast. The pacing is laughable, and there is no feeling of real danger or suspense. The whole movie is just a terrible piece of cinema.The remake on the other hand is a lot of fun. The actors are not horrible, and the story is better than in the original and even more complex. While the character development is not great, one can really enjoy the development of the evil teacher and the generals favorite officer.There are a lot of very good and tense moments, which are supported by the inspiring score.I admit there are also a lot of problems. The acting for example is a very mixed bag, but most of the main cast actors are OK. At least it's not as horrible as in the original and the storytelling well above average. The general for example is very well cast, and while he is a hell of a cliché character, he is very likable, because he really cares for his men. Hunter Carson is not bad as David, and so is Karen Black as Linda.All in all, this movie has an OK story, likable characters, a lot of really good scenes, an awesome soundtrack, and some nice aliens.The movie is well shot, entertaining and has a good score. It's well worth the 10 bucks on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A boy tries to stop an invasion of his town by aliens who take over the the minds of his parents, his least-liked schoolteacher and other townspeople. With the help of the school nurse, the boy enlists the aid of the U.S. Marines.....Being directed by Tobe Hooper, I assumed (wrongly) that this was going to be an all out horror/Science-Fiction movie that wouldn't pull any punches when it came to killings.As far as I know, this film has never been aired on British TV, and has never been available to buy on Region 2 DVD, So all I knew about this film was the boy with the blonde hair.And I must, say, I was pleasantly surprised with the whole outcome of the film. It's pretty clear by the house and some of the background paintings, that Close Encounters has heavily influenced this film, and this is Hooper trying to do a Spielberg.It's funny in places, but most of all, it's a very effective mild Horror that is suitable for the whole family.The violence is minimal, the creatures are so over the top that they are more like Critters than Aliens, and overall, it appears that David is the person with the most common sense.Louise Fletcher appears as the Mrs. Deagle of the film, but she soon becomes laughable when she is chasing a car down the street.I liked it, but I can understand why the film vanished without a trace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Early on in the movie I was worried that this would be a real bomb. The film was saved later on by some impressive special effects with Martians that looked nothing like the laughable ones in the original classic. The portrayal of the world from a child's perspective was lost - and this greatly diminished the film's worth. Overall I found the film to be worth watching. I even gave it a "7" -- perhaps generously given some of the other reviews here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is meant to be a Saturday night beer and popcorn movie. Lighten up, kids! Do you not think this cast of established actors, along with a director like Tobe Hooper, did not set out to just have a fun day in the park as they made this movie? The special effects (except for the aliens) are excellent. The kid is very good, he portrays terror every time he encounters the aliens and every time he tries to explain it to an adult and nobody believes him. The scene where he goes over the hill into to glowing pit is very well done and eerie. And the music score is beautiful,especially end credits. All in all, this is an enjoyable movie to just sit back and chillax with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Gardner sees a UFO crash in the woods behind his home. He tries to tell his parents (Timothy Bottoms, Laraine Newman) but they don't believe him. Then his parents and his teacher Mrs. McKeltch (Louise Fletcher) change with something on the back of their necks. The only person who believes him is the school nurse Linda Magnusson (Karen Black).The movie starts off well. The premise is a good one. It's always compelling to have a kid be the most knowledgeable and the adults not believe him. The first half has some good paranoia. Then the movie starts to deteriorate. The aliens are cheesy looking. The special effects look weak. The introduction of the military takes away all of the early goodwill. It turns a pretty good paranoid thriller into a campy B-movie cheesefest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in this is pretty bad for the most part, and the lead kid is just awful.

Hasn't anybody got a penny?!" and "Marines have no qualms about killing Martians!" are gold.The creature effects are mediocre at best, the bulky Martian drones are neither well designed creatures nor well made animatronics, although the Martian leader looks pretty cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah the classic 1953 movie revisited and remade in that classic 80's style with wacky special effects. This really is a treasure chest of 80's gold through and through. Directed by Tobe 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' Hooper, written by Dan 'Alien' O'Bannon and with creature effects by Stan Winston, John 'Star Wars' Dykstra and Alec 'Aliens' Gillis. Doesn't get much better than that folks.The plot is surprisingly almost identical to the original classic albeit with a few minor changes here and there. One night during a storm a young boy sees a UFO land in an area behind his house (the sandpit?). He tells his parents but of course they don't believe him telling him it was a nightmare. The next day his father investigates and eventually returns with strange marks on the back of his neck, his mannerisms are odd and he seems emotionless and cold. Slowly many townsfolk start acting the same so the young boy tries to alert the authorities but has a hard time making folk believe naturally. Soon enough his school nurse starts to take notice and believe the boy and in time they manage to get the military on board to lay siege to the mysterious sand pit area.As I already said I was shocked at how faithful this remake is to the source material, it is virtually the same right down to the visual setup. Now this might sound lame (especially with this current horrendous remake trend) but if you've seen the 1953 version its quite cool to see the same stylings revamped (without the use of CGI I might add). The little pathway and hill leading to the sandpit behind the young boys house has been recreated to look just like the original film and it looks splendidly creepy. The alien ship interior is basically along the same kind of lines but obviously much more futuristic (for the time) and of course all the characters are almost identical, although some characters have different job roles here. It was also sweet to see the original lead boy actor from the 1953 version play the police chief in this movie.The major changes come in the visual effects department for the aliens and obvious things like the spaceship, makeup and a few minor horror moments. You can easily tell the rubbery monster/alien suits are Stan Winston's work, I can tell his creative style a mile away. The main head alien, the brain, was literately that...a fat pink brain that basically looks like Krang from the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' franchise. I believe this design did actually surface before the introduction of Krang in the animated TMNT series in 1987, so maybe this movie influenced that cartoon? Anyway this powerful double pupiled alien really looks tremendous if a little motionless. The other mobile aliens (if you can say that) are quite bizarre, honesty I don't know why they went with this design but they basically look like giant testicles with huge gaping jaws and four legs. Huge lumps of gristle with huge mouths lined with razor sharp teeth and four camel-like legs. Clearly very large and heavy rubber suits with the two front legs being for the performer inside and the rear two probably mainly being stability. Its very clever how they have done it but alas these aliens do look totally cumbersome, not very agile...not very mobile at all really and completely useless in an evolutionary sense. How on earth these aliens managed to build spaceships or develop technology I don't know, there must be other types of alien that helped them.One thing that does stand out was the bad acting which seemed strange to me seeing as this felt like a biggish production. Yeah sure this is meant to be a science fiction B-movie of course so possibly the cast acted badly on purpose? I kinda doubt it honesty, maybe some did but most I think were just poor, especially the main protagonist, the young boy. This kid really couldn't act, it was quite painful at times. He was also kinda tubby and clearly had trouble running too *giggles*, the amount of times he's running away from someone and its laughable, so slow! I guess when one of the main leads from the first two 'Return of the Living Dead' movies (James Karen) is in the film, you should know to expect some grilled cheese. But honesty no one here is very good, there is lots of hokey shouting, screaming and really obviously slow running away from dangerous things.Of course the finale won't be much of a surprise if you've seen the original film because this ends the same way. In fact it ends exactly the same accept for the cliffhanger moment before the credits role where all we see is the young boy rushing to his parents room, stopping and screaming in terror. Its a typical 80's finish, the kinda thing you'd see in an 80's horror anthology movie, its left to your imagination...and nightmares.The tension does seem to have gone from this newer version, I kinda expected it to be a trashy 80's gore fest, the movie poster does lend itself to that. On the other hand I did think it could of been a John Carpenter flick at times, if you didn't know any better it could seem that way, it has those dark comedic tones much like 'They Live'. On the whole its certainly a blast if you're into practical hands-on effects with larger than life creature suits and prosthetics but don't expect many thrills or blood. Considering the director its actually relatively tame.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's elaborate, bigger budgeted 80s remake of the 1953 science fiction classic does have scale going for it, as well as a see-it-to-believe-it cast and talented crew. Scripted by Dan O'Bannon &amp; Don Jakoby, it tells the story of David Gardner (Hunter Carson), ordinary kid who witnesses first hand the invasion of evil Martian creatures which proceed to enslave lots of local humans, Davids' own parents (Timothy Bottoms and Laraine Newman) among them.The problem, at least for this viewer, is that this doesn't have the stark nightmarish quality of the original, and is also often too silly for its own good, going for a camp quality, in terms of both acting and dialogue. Depending on ones' sensibilities, they can either appreciate or groan at lines such as "You'd better hurry, or you just might blow it." and "You don't carry loose change into combat, sir.". We also have the parents acting all goofy and eating either meat that's been overcooked or not cooked at all.Yet, moments like this contrast with some pretty good sequences such as seeing how the humans get their minds manipulated or when the tunnelling devices emerge from underneath the ground. The sets are quality stuff, what with people like Leslie Dilley ("Star Wars") as production designer and Craig Stearns ("Halloween" '78) as art director. The special effects are amusing, to say the least, with Stan Winston and crew crafting some memorable "Mr. Potato Head" aliens as well as a Martian intelligence that is actually kind of a cute lil' thing.The actors are mostly all pros (with the exception of Carson, the real-life son of co-star Karen Black) and some of them do a pretty fine job of maintaining poker faces. In addition to those actors mentioned, we've got Ms. Black doing an appealing job as the school nurse, Louise Fletcher playing her umpteenth Nurse Ratched like role as the miserly frog eating teacher, Bud Cort as a nerdy young S.E.T.I. scientist, the great James Karen of "The Return of the Living Dead" as an ass kicking, cigar chomping Marine general, Jimmy Hunt (who played the kid in the 1953 film) as the police chief, and veteran military technical adviser Dale Dye in a bit.One good thing about "Invaders from Mars" '86 is that it's never boring, and it does have nice touches here and there (the bit with the copper, the cameo by the original Martian Intelligence), and it's at least pretty true to the first film when it comes to the resolution. It's best recommended to undemanding fans of 80s genre fare.Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than Mars Attacks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like a lot of movie genres, sci-fi is one of them. But when it comes to campyness, this movie, doesn't try to be funny, but a couple antics are pretty silly. Tobe Hooper and his team do what they can with the script and after purchasing the DVD and watching the features, they overall succeed. The big question is, can it be frightening/ and funny and still be enjoyed? Of course...it can! The critics that trashed this film, I think they expected absolute plausibility and when they didn't get it, they found it worthless. I like director Tim Burton's movies-most of the time, but Mars Attacks was pretty cheesy in comparison to this film. Tobe took a somewhat more serious approach to an alien invasion through a child's eyes, and the results were basically effective. Everything that can be said, has been said, questions or comments welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's better than the 1953 original (though that's not saying much). I remember, vaguely, loving it when it came out in 1986. I just bought the letter-boxed THX-enhanced version, and I'm wondering just WHAT I liked about it. Yeah some of the imagery and use of color is fantastic, but that's about it. Carson is a terrible actor and Black gives one of her worst performances. Only Bottoms, Newman and Fletcher turn in somewhat enjoyable acting. That aliens are REALLY stupid looking, the attempts at humor are pathetic and the the story is way too slow-moving. I do know that director Hopper and star Black had real troubles with the film company when doing this (the company kept slashing the budget and complaining about every single dime Hopper spent), so much so that Hopper actually became physically ill at one point! Unfortunately, it shows up in the final product. Cool opening credits though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another flop for Hooper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre), visual effects wizard John Dykstra (Star Wars), make-up FX genius Stan Winston (Aliens), screenwriter Dan O'Bannon (Alien), cinematographer Daniel Pearl (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre): there's a wealth of experience and talent behind this lavish '80s remake of '50s cold-war sci-fi classic Invaders From Mars, but it amounts to little more than a thoroughly cheesy and rather camp piece of trashy escapism. For some, that might be enough, but given its pedigree, I expected, nay, DEMANDED much more.The film's weakest point is undoubtedly its young lead Hunter Carson, who appears in almost every scene, but is unable to even run convincingly, let alone persuade the viewer that the planet is under threat from Martians (what's with the flappy arms, Hunter?). A better actor in the central role would have helped immensely, although Hooper's direction also proves lacklustre, his film lacking in suspense but loaded with schmaltz (the overly saccharine opening family scenes suggest that the director spent far too long in the presence of Spielberg during the filming of Poltergeist). Serving to undermine the film's effectiveness further are the somewhat clunky aliens?far from Winston's best work.Mindlessly entertaining in the way that only an '80s Cannon movie could be, the film is admittedly never boring, and benefits from some interesting set design and impressive lighting, but as a big-budget sci-fi (by Cannon Pictures' standards, at least) from the man who gave us Leatherface, this can only be deemed a disappointment. Oh, well, at least this film's failure (along with his previous sci-fi/horror flop Lifeforce) resulted in Hooper returning to familiar territory for the long-awaited Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars (1986) (which incidentally is also the name of the Doctor Who season 28 opener) is not a bad remake of the original 1953 movie. The menace displayed in this movie is pretty well served here.Hunter Carson was very good as the young boy David Gardner who saw the aliens and the only who was on his side on this initially is school counselor Linda Magnusson (Karen Black).Thrilling what goes on along the way. Quite a surprise what happened at the last scene and the shocking ending.Incidentally, was surprised to find out from a DVD featurette that Jimmy Hunt who played the police chief was the original David in the 1953 film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Star Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this remake of the classic 1950s science fiction tale, a boy (Hunter Carson) tries to stop an invasion of his town by aliens who take over the the minds of his parents, his least-liked schoolteacher (Louise Fletcher) and other townspeople.This film has an all-star cast and crew: director Tobe Hooper, writer Dan O'Bannon, composer Christopher Young, actress Karen Black, and special effects guru Stan Winston. Say what you will, but the film has some of the finest people involved.The film lost money and received generally negative reviews. Time Out wrote, "whereas the original worked by building up an increasingly black mood, this version relies almost entirely on the special effects; and such limited brooding tension as it has is gratuitously undermined by a string of sequences played purely for laughs." Paul Corupe of Rue Morgue also comes down hard on the film, saying "Hooper overloads the remake with outrageous FX, excessively detailed sets and convoluted explanations." In short, he says the film "is unsatisfying, little more than a series of chase sequences" and "surprisingly clunky creatures that look like they were lifted from Jim Henson's reject pile."The film is, indeed, heavily reliant on Winston's creatures, and it is a bit silly or campy more often than suspenseful or scary. A great film it is not. But this also depends on who the audience is: if this is geared towards children (which may be the case), perhaps it works best being silly and without too much terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hopper's bombastic 80s update might not be anything terribly new, but it's competently staged with some adventurous camera-work, dazzling special effects and good hearty performances by its gamed cast (Karen Black, Timothy Bottoms and James Karen heading the list with colourful turns). Although I read a lot of criticism against the lead child Hunter Carson; who I didn't think was all that bad in the role. The original low-budget 1953 feature (and keep a look out for the visual reference to it) wasn't anything special either, but still it was a solid paranoid horror sci-fi treat and this remake was a neat little, almost cartoonish homage to it. The production's budget shows up rather well, as you can see in the special effects and overall polished tinge but within its tidy framework breathes a fun b-grade flavour. The studio sets construct some atmospheric imagery, eccentrically surreal creations (especially the details of its alien guests) and so does the eerily spacey sound FX along with its music score. A strong production is slightly let down by its material. The story centres on a kids point of view, as he tries to understand what's going on and who to eventually trust with his parents and the small town community coming under the influence of a hostile alien force. It's predictable, but always amusing however it did seem to loose some focus and become tired when the army becomes an important part the narrative progression. The finale might be a cop-out, but the final frames is suitably lasting in its grim suggestion. Bud Cort and a deviously illustrated Louise Fletcher also show up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never finds the right tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hooper and his writers seem to want to both parody the 1950s classic and, at the same time, to be a straight remake of it. Trouble is that this simply isn't possible. It looks great throughout, with superb, shadowy photography and generally good production design (though the Martian drones look more silly than anything else). Some of the actors, particularly Karen Black and Louise Fletcher, are very good; some, unfortunately including lead Hunter Carson, are not very good.  But the main failing is that the tone is so inconsistent. Some scenes are played for horror, and work; some are played as if the intent was comic, and they don't work. If the intent was to actually scare us, after being taken over by the Martians, the parents should have acted creepy -- but instead, they act silly, which is hardly the same thing. It's not the fault of Bottoms and Newman -- they could have played the roles however the director and script suggested -- but rather a failure to go for broke. In the original film, after returning from the sand pit, the father brutally slaps his son. Here, the big weird touch is that he fills his coffee cup with sweetener. Doesn't quite have the same impact.  And what's with the frogs? Kids LIKE frogs; they don't regard them as creepy. There should never have been a scene without the boy in it, but there are several. There should have been some touches of surrealism to fit the all-a-dream scenario. Dream logic isn't like waking logic, but it's stringent nonetheless; this film ignores logic. In the original, the Martians take over the parents, the neighbor kid, the cops and the military -- exactly the targets a boy would expect. Adding a teacher wasn't a bad idea, but the other targets here, including a busload of kids, don't make any sense. Why would the Martians want to control a bunch of children?  The effects are good but not as well-conceived as they might have been. The sand funnel that captures people is fancier in this remake, but much eerier in the original. And Christopher Young's score is a disaster.  The opportunity was here to make a technologically-improved version of a much-loved classic original, but for the most part, the film doesn't live up to its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome nightmare adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course this movie is quite old and it lacks in visual and sound quality. But the most important thing is - it does not lack in atmosphere. This movie starts like some kind of utopic family life view and ends up being a deep nightmare in which all things that a child is afraid off come true - and even more. It all feels like a having a bad dream, so shocking so traumatic but yet it's somehow true and that's probably what makes this movie. Besides the music fits totally and underlines the atmosphere. It does not lack in story and you will get some "uh-huh" moments through the movie. But what was most terrifying and also so great about this movie is that they almost didn't use any kind of special effects. It's all real made plastic-rubber things that look so scary but not cheap - they look really realistic and detailed. I watched this movie because I remembered some things about that movie as I watched it as a 8-year old - and back in the times I almost crapped my pants. It was such a big thing to me, I think the first horror-like movie I ever watched that I still was able to remember some situations 15 years later. So I had to watch it - I did - I am amazed - and my friend who didn't watch it as a kid were amazed as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did Tobe Hooper sell his soul to create The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Because while there's really no doubt that he created a horror icon, an amazing movie that cast a long shadow over the genre and a big name for himself with that film it becomes increasingly difficult to remember how good he can be when you see most of his other outings (and I am one of the people who enjoyed Crocodile, Mortuary and The Toolbox Murders remake to varying degrees).Here he gets his hands on one of my favourite old sci-fi movies and, to be blunt, almost completely ruins everything about it. The cast includes such names as Louise Fletcher, Timothy Bottoms, Karen Black and James Karen but don't let any of those attract you to the project. Not only is the main child star completely useless in the acting stakes but it would also seem that everyone else was having an off day/month/year with the exception of Fletcher and James Karen.The tale remains the same (kid spots UFO landing and, one by one but starting with the kid's father, people are abducted and the only sign is a mark on their neck) but it seems as if Hooper went out of his way to remove every ounce of tension and suspense from the movie, there really is NOTHING here. The script is poor although I am not sure how much of it is replicated from the original, which may have held up better in that era but fallen flat by today's standards, and most of the effects are pretty godawful (though, in fairness, I do recognise that Hooper was aiming to copy that old B-movie vibe). Sadly, it's just no fun at all. And the ending is still as dire as it was all those years ago.If you want some "bad" movie fun from Hooper then check out Lifeforce (a clip of which is shown on a TV screen in this film, only rubbing salt in the wounds IMO). If you want to watch a terrible, terrible remake then pick this one.See this if you like: Louise Fletcher, The Faculty, 50's B-movies.</fullReview>

Later on he got fame for being the advisor for Platoon, and then again on Starship Troopers. But this is where he started.I was one of the 200 REAL US Marines used in the movie as extras. And even during shooting, we laughed at how unrealistic everything was. But what would we know, we are just stupid Marines. We sat back, and let the experts show how real military equipment was to be used.The plot stunk (worn out 20 years before), the acting was so-so, neither good nor bad. Unremarkable is a word that comes to mind there. Although Mr. Dye plays the oldest squad leader I have ever seen (he is the one that yells "Fire In The Hole" and shoots the alien with the anti-tank rocket).If you want to see a comedy in the vein of "Killer Tomatoes", check this movie out. If you are looking for something like serious sci-fi, pass this up and grab something a little more cerebral, like maybe Battlefield Earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Remake Is Silly Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS is a cult classic, appreciated for both its influence on later similar films and the fact that it reads as hilariously corny by today standards. But this 1986 remake--in spite of a big budget, several very talented actors, and a deliberately campy script--is unlikely to inspire the same sort of loyalty, and it was universally condemned by critics and audiences alike when first released.That said, the film really isn't as bad as you may have heard. The plot follows the original version quite closely: the imaginative young son (Hunter Carson) of two loving parents (Timothy Bottom and Laraine Newman) catches sight of a UFO as it lands beyond the hill behind his house--and when his father goes out to investigate he returns... well... different. When his mother and his evil school teacher (Louise Fletcher) follow suit, he turns to the school nurse (Karen Black), and together the two alert the local military to the strange goings-on.The cast is really quite good. Although the script gives her little to do beyond run around screaming, Karen Black has a unique screen presence--and it is as evident here as it is in her more celebrated films. Her real life son, Hunter Carson, does the honors as the child lead, and acquits himself very well. But the most memorable performances are from Laraine Newman, Timothy Bottom, and Louise Fletcher, who are transformed by the UFO and sent abroad to do the aliens' evil will. Fletcher is particularly enjoyable, wringing the most from her role as every child's nightmare school teacher. The special effects have dated and seem remarkably derivative, a mix of STAR WARS and ALIEN, but they too are entertaining in their own way, and although it isn't always successful the script has enough campy humor (much of it in reference to the original) to give you an occasional hoot.As pure fluff, the 1986 INVADERS FROM MARS works very well, and kids ten and up are likely to find it extremely entertaining. Still, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for this particular movie. It is mindlessly entertaining, but I don't think it is a film to which many viewers will care to return.Gary F.

		<shortDescription>A flawed but decent effort...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another in the list of missed opportunities from the Orson Welles of the horror genre, Tobe Hooper. That he has talent is widely accepted, but that he can't put it into a cohesive film is often the case. Here is yet another example of a film with great moments alternating with lousy realization. Hooper does his best when he merely follows his Gothic instincts, and his worst when he forces humor and allows poor acting to remain.It's common for him to let his acting talent to have free reign over their interpretations of their characters. This is why Spielberg couldn't handle the Poltergeist shoots - it was a matter of a control freak vs a director who is the opposite. As an example in this film, it's obvious the child actor here is out of his league at some moments, and Spielberg would never have allowed those moments to stay in the film, but then the kid probably would have been scarred for life under Spielberg's direction.Neither style is great, but the Spielberg style is prolific in producing cookie-cutter popcorn entertainment, while Hooper's style creates a conglomeration of great genre works and other flawed yet interesting material, as is this film. It's worth a viewing, but doesn't hold up as well as the original, and is middling in comparison to all of Hooper's films, way better than many, yet not as good as several others, including the much better Lifeforce, made at around the same time.As a note, a scene from Lifeforce appears in this film on the TV, obviously they had the rights in hand. However, I would have preferred a shot from Robot Monster, the low-budget plot rip-off of the original Invaders from Mars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this remake of the classic 50s SF tale, a boy tries to stop an invasion of his town by aliens who take over the the minds of his parents, his least-liked schoolteacher and other townspeople. With the aid of the school nurse the boy enlists the aid of the U.S. Marines. A corny film from tobe hooper, but it isn't without it's merits. What tended to ruin the film was Hunter Carson. I swear, he's one of the worst actors EVER. They should have given him less screen time. Also, Karen Black does poorly with her character. On the plus side, however, Stan winston's creature effects are excellent, especially for 1986, the production values are grade-a (Loved the spaceship interior) and the musical score was excellent. It doesn't compete with Hooper's earlier films like "The Texas chainsaw massacre" or "Poltergiest", but it's still fun nonetheless and worth renting. My rating for "Invaders from Mars":6/10.About the DVD: MGM midnight movies has released a very quality disk for us. The colors are good, and, despite the small expected grain, the picture is generally crisp and with no major problems or flaws. The sound is pretty good, but the surround sound effects are generally lacking. For extras we get a behind the scenes documentary, which covers the production extensively and is quite enjoyable. Next up is an original documentary, complete with behind-the-scenes footage, cast interviews, and more. We also get a trailer for the film. The disk has been closed captioned as well. The disk is of excellent quality and is worth renting on a friday night. My rating for the DVD: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I am not a huge fan of this film, but I think that Tobe Hooperhas brought about a pleasant re-imagining of the original film withupdated special effects... the main problem is that this film is a bittoo graphic for the child audience at which it is aimed. I respectHooper's odd desire to make a sci-fi film for kids, but I think that hecompromised this vision by aiming the action scenes at olderkids... the only people I think that will really like this movie arethose who saw the original film as children and loved it, and thoseolder kids who are really into special effects and can ignore thelame acting and plot...Aside from that, I think that most older kids will find this film to belame and most younger kids would be too scared by the aliensand some of the violence... overall, I would recommend showingyour younger kids the original film (as I think that it really plays tothe fears of children in a non-threatening manner) and maybeturning them onto this film when they get a bit older... as a sort ofinitiation into more sophisticated action/horror films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was stunned by the movie. I didn't know it was a remake at first and thought it was a parody of all those old B movies. The fakey father and son chat that sounded like Leave it to Beaver to the weird science teacher with the long blue dress and how about the predictable editing sequences and camera shots that we have all seen so many times before. The best scene was when the boy followed the teacher into the cave. I want that clip to play at dance parties. If people say the acting was bad I say it was supposed to be bad to parody the bad acting of the 50's. So the movie achieved it's objective. It's really too bad that most people just don't get it. The aliens are supposed to look stupid. The film did it's job too well in mimicking the 50's and people misunderstand that and think it's cheesy. If you are imitating a recipe for cheesy pizza and you pizza comes out cheesy doesn't that mean you are a good cook and your product came out the way you intended?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars is a fun film. I'll say no more on that. However, the film goes back and forth with its genre like Night of the Hunter does. You can't make up your mind whether the Invaders from Mars is suppose to be a serious scary film, a science fictional epic, or a slap stick comedy of a horror film. The lead child actor is terrible in the film. I never saw him again in any other film. I'm pretty sure he knew the producer or the director of the film. Then again, the role of the school teacher was perfect. She was both scary and amusing. The special effects are good with a great horror ending that makes the overall film worth watching. The movie doesn't pick up entire things start to explode. Believe me, the film is more enjoyable when the marines comes in to blow up everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves another remake by someone talented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviews for "Invaders From Mars" here on IMDb are uniformly ridiculous, being written by those who have NO clue about the history of the original film and what transpired after it was completed and shown to the public.IFM was the brainchild of William Cameron Menzies, Oscar winner for Art Direction on a little picture called "Gone With the Wind" and many critics' pick for best use of Technicolor as designer for Alexander Korda's sumptuous "Thief of Bagdad" in 1940. "Thief" remains one of the top ten films to utilize Technicolor in every sense of the word. No other film comes close.Menzies took on strange projects after his triumphs, such as "The Maze" in 1953 which used the new 3-D process to tell the story of a man who's really a frog. The 3D effects were very well suited to this foolish Gothic story, especially in the maze sequences. The film flopped, and is now only remember by Menzies devotees.Along came the real masterpiece of Menzies' checkered career: "Invaders From Mars" in 1953. Menzies wanted to use the 3D process, but was eventually underfunded by the producers of this early sci-fi classic. The sets had been built to show the unfolding story from a child's point of view and disorient the viewer. The lack of 3D robbed the visuals of their impact, yet the story of a child's warning of invasion from outer space remains potent. Potent enough for Tobe Hooper to resurrect the whole damn thing in 1986 with some new whiz-bang effects. This version of IFM, while pouring on the homages to the original film (flawed though it was) is even more unfortunate despite a bigger budget and better known actors.Hooper's version of IFM is sloppy, lazy, and completely unfocused. He threw out the real tension the original offered by inserting useless comedy sequences and unnecessary effects to cover his myopia. The taut storyline of the 53' version is gone, replaced by SNL skit actors and Louise Fletcher as the teacher who swallows frogs, a character nonexistent in the 53' original. Hooper throws on the nostalgia to those in the know by reconstructing the famous "fence to the sandpit" and having the original David Gardner, the actor Jimmy Hunt (as a policeman) tell his partner "I haven't been up here since I was a kid" as they check out the scene of the sand abductions. Other silly 53' references are: David's school is now the "William Cameron Menzies" Elementary School, and the brief discovery of the original Martian "brain in the bubble" resting atop a discarded file cabinet in the school's basement, briefly seen when a cop's flashlight reveals it momentarily. Other stupid referential visuals litter the film to no avail. The Martians here look like backwards equines, and the "Mastermind" Martian will never be a substitute for the original. The original "brain" was a dwarf woman in amazing makeup (who had no dialog) and stood on a cardboard box for a few bucks and a box lunch according to Jimmy Hunt's adult recollection. Hooper just fails here at the usual 80's remake, expecting that audiences have completely forgotten the original source of this taut thriller. Watch if you need to. I paid to see this junk when it appeared in 1986. I left early. The 1953 version is fertile material for someone to reassess. Given the richness of the original material, Hooper's version is nothing less than stupid, very stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of the overrated 1953 film is even worse. It has the same basic plot of young boy who witnesses a spaceship land in a nearby sand pit, and how the adults, starting with his parents, are taken over in the first step toward invasion, and of course the boy(along with the eventual help of the military) are the only ones to stop these martian invaders.Pointless remake offers more elaborate monsters, but they still look awful, and film is too stupid and unpleasant to work, with a really crass ending that renders the whole film moot.

		<fullReview>The original INVADERS FROM MARS is something of a minor classic . From memory it's a wonderfully made film but its bizarre , strange nature causes it to stick in the memory . This remake is almost unknown however . I read in 1986 via Starburst magazine that Tobe Hooper was remaking it but the remake received no publicity on its British release . I never saw it on the shelves of the local video shop and as far as I know it has never been broadcast on British network television . I also couldn't help noticing that at least two of the forty reviews on this site were written by extras on the movie . Obviously this version of INVADERS FROM MARS was destined for obscurity As far as remakes go it's not bad . There's a couple of injokes with young David watching Hooper's previous film LIFEFORCE on television and star of the original Jimmy Hunt stating he hasn't visited the sand pit since he was a boy . The set design is excellent and captures the original's other worldly interior of the Martian base and the drones are scary monsters . Also good to see Louise Fletcher resurrect her routine as nurse Ratched , this time as teacher Mrs McKeltch If there's a problem the screenplay by O'Bannon and Jakoby mirrors the original far too closely . You can understand this to a degree since the 1953 version could be seen as a cold war analogy and Reagen was in the White House in 1986 , but the narrative plays out in a too predictable manner and you do wish the writers had brought their own vision to the film . It's also very noticeable young Hunter Carson is not much of an actor and unsurprisingly he didn't go on to have much of a career . But having said that if you haven't seen the original you might like this version</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, this movie was bad, but I'm sure that was part of the intent. Of course this sort of flick would have honestly spooked people in the 50s but now it's just one of those nostalgia remakes and it was just out of place in even in the 80s.There's a mix of horrible (probably intentional) and passable acting. I'm not sure if you'd call this movie "big budget" or not --- there was definitely some money behind it but I noticed people using recycled props from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (specifically, Saavik's tricorder. Double geek points for me ;p).I don't think this is one you'd really want to show to kids under 10, especially given the fact it has an elementary school kid being terrorized by adult authority figures...and aliens. The ending would also scare the crap out of young kids, I think. I don't think this movie would really even go over well with 10-12 year olds since they'd probably find it pretty campy even at that age.The original was right for its time and place to a certain extent. This remake is just a full technicolor backwards glance at the original. Good for a few cheap laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion Horror for Kids!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of an old Science Fiction film from 1953, and is also, of course, released by "Midnite Movies" on DVD. Anyone familiar with this company knows they're possibly getting some real crap, or some random quality that just never made any money for some reason, and thus ended up being released along with other crap, another couple of movies reviewed by yours truly that was also released by Midnite Movies was "The Beast Within" and "I Bury the Living." This company also graced the world with a DVD version of "Killer Klowns From Outer Space." So, here goes some more shlock horror!Basically, the film revolves around a young boy who loves astronomy and, believe it or not, sees a space ship land "just over that hill" from his back yard. Well, these guys are from Mars and apparently blew all of Mars' budget on a single space ship as this appears to be a very small invasion force. But they have a plan, oh do they ever! They're zombifying all humans! And it all would've worked, too, if not for that damn kid miraculously leading the military to the rescue! Oh, of course, a kid of 10 (or so) can't do this all alone, he has a sidekick?his school nurse portrayed by Karen Black of all people. Well if you're like me, pretty quickly into this film you start to wonder what the hell is going on and why is this kid the manly hero? Then you look at the DVD case and see the PG rating and it all starts to come together. This is a horror movie for kids. And it's directed, no you didn't read wrong, by "Texas Chainsaw Massacre's" Tobe Hooper.The Good:--The effects on the aliens aren't half bad--Decent horror film? for kids ages 10-15Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help It:--Atmosphere is tolerable.--Didn't really notice the music, so it must not have been too bad.--Would seem to be really creepy/scary for a kid?which would seem to be the target audience.The Bad:--The story is pretty grueling.--There's a little pudgy blonde kid as the hero.--Karen Black's make-up is scarier than the aliens?she looks demented.--The acting really blows. Pudge the hero seems to be able to act occasionally pretty well, but everyone else? Hell, I've seen some of these people in other films or TV programs and they could act then, what gives??The Ugly:--This is yet another "Horror Film Meant For Kids" that you watch and pretty often the phrase, "What the hell??" rolls through your head for various reasons. For instance, several times in the film we view scenes that seem too scary for kids, but the film is PG and the story is ridiculous, and the acting is really poor?so it's obviously made for kids, so what gives? This suffers from the same problem as "The Gate" starring a youthful Stephen Dorff wherein we clearly have a movie made for kids, starring kids, but which also seems to be too scary or "adult" at times for kids. So we're left with a movie with an extremely small audience that for the rest of us; isn't exactly watchable. Unfortunately for "Invaders From Mars" when compared to "The Gate," it suffers from much poorer acting, dialog and story.Acting: 3/10 Story: 4/10 Atmosphere: 6/10 Cinematography: 6/10 Character Development: 5/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 7/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 Violence/Gore: 5/10 Music: 6/10 Direction: 5/10Cheesiness: 5/10 Crappiness: 6/10Overall: 4 /10I would only recommend this to Horror completists and Horror fanatics attempting to raise their kids on a steady diet of horror?especially if your kids are a little slow?www.ResidentHazard.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of 1953 classic. The movie is made by Canon International that had on and off successes with their movies. This is one of the off ones they made.The movie is about a boy witnessing the landing of a UFO at the back of his house. Then people of his town starts to change, their personalities taken over by the martians. He desperately tries to save his parents. His teacher helps him along the way.There's no atmosphere to this movie. The acting was bad and production crew really didn't know what the movie was all about despite that they had the 1953 classic to work off of. 1953 classic at least knew how to show the terror of one boy who is surrounded by the enemies, and how to cover for his inexperience as an actor by putting his innocence forward. This movie has no such considerations.Best pass this movie and watch the original 1953 classic which is a far better production.</fullReview>

Also, it had a bad story.I usually like it when there is about 10 minutes of suspense before the aliens arrive in alien movies, in here it is basically instant. Also, the parents have stammered speech when they get overtaken by the aliens. Also, the acting is mediocre in the action scenes. The kid shows no expression whatsoever when there are explosions and similar things going on right next to him. I think it would have had potential were there some better acting and a little better graphics.

		<shortDescription>Was a Remake Necessary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror genre icon Tobe Hooper takes the directorial reigns and creates this remake of the fine film of the same name from the 50's. This Invaders from Mars is a lot different in many ways. Wheras the original was strictly a science fiction film about the dangers of alien attack and a hidden agenda about who you could trust from a child's point of view, this version goes for laughs as well. Sometimes these "laughs" detract from the thematic structure of the film. Basically the story is the same, but there are ample distinctions as well. A young boy sees a cosmic entity land just beyond his house, discovers changes in his parents, and eventually enlists the aid of a school nurse and later the military to crush the alien threat from Mars. Hooper does some obvious homage type stuff, all of that working very well I thought. The lighted path to the hill had an almost surreal look to it and was reminiscent of the original. Hooper had a school name after Menzies, the director of the original film. The child star falls short in his role exuding limited credibility, but most of the other performers are adequate. Lovely Karen Black plays the nurse, and Timothy Bottoms and Laraine Newman portray the youngster's parents. James Karen camps it up as the general in charge of the military. The performance problem for me was Louise Fletcher. Sure, she makes for a great witchy teacher, but her campy performance was a bit much at times - too incredible. Hooper also over does it with some of the special effects. The Martian creatures really look quite ridiculous with fat bodies and mouths the size of Volkswagens. But some of the effects are pulled off nicely, such as the sand tunnels and the men being devoured in the middle of a sandy pit. This remake, while I firmly believe an unnecessary remake, has some fun aspects to it and is if nothing else an interesting and diverting film. I am not at all sure of what hooper was trying to achieve at the end of the film, but I did feel it was quite contrived and departed from the spirit of the film's unity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of money and time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of three movies Tobe Hooper made for Cannon Pictures in the '80s (the others being LIFEFORCE and Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2). All three were financial failures that contributed to Cannon's demise, and explain why Hooper's career is now in the toilet. Why did this particular effort fail? One reason may be that there were no big stars in the movie, which is instead filled with unknowns and has-beens. Another reason may be that the movie is not particularly frightening, either from an adult's perspective or a child's. The movie just sits in front of us and doesn't try to be scary or eerie - at times the movie is just plain goofy to witness. It also probably didn't help that the characters of the movie, from the Martians to the humans, make plenty of dumb decisions along the way - you can't relate to their decisions. There are other things, like the terrible musical score and evidence that the movie was trimmed down before release (there are some unexplained minor touches to the movie). The movie does look like some serious money was spent, but that's about all that's positive I can say for it.</fullReview>

So... we went.As you might imagine... it was hot... to say the least. Most, if not all, of the shooting was done at night because of this. We spent most of our time running up and down the dunes... as if we were "on attack"!! When resting... we would sometimes get to meet the actors up close and most were actually very interesting. Lorraine Newman was actually hysterical. Timothy Bottoms I do not remember a lot... but one thing I will never forget... when Karen Black entered the set... we were told by some nut-job that we needed to stand at attention every time "Ms. Karen Black" walked passed us. Are you kidding???!!! Okay... maybe just this once.... but seriously.... it was 90+ degrees.... at night... and after "running the dunes" for hours on end... we have to snap to attention EVERY time we see her? Uh..... okay. Little did we know.... that "nut-job"really was a former Marine, Capt. Dale Dye. And, if I am not mistaken.... at one point someone instructed us to salute her... uh.... NOT gonna happen. LOL One thing is for sure... Capt. Dye is one interesting fella, from what I remember. I wasn't sure if half of what he said was true... or not.. most of the time. Ironically.... I remember liking him the most... because he ALWAYS had a story to tell you. Always! Another thing I will never forget is... after "running the dunes" on our first shoot... the sun began to rise.... so the shoot came to an end. Us real Marines were watching the actors all gathering around a food cart... with some of the best-prepared foods you could imagine. As we started to get in line with the "actors" we were quickly shunned and hurried off to another cart, of sorts. All they planned on feeding us was beer and donuts. No kidding... no water... or real food... just beer and donuts. Just what every dehydrated Jar Head eats for breakfast... right? We left shortly thereafter to go help fight one, of many, California brush fires. Ironic story in itself... we looked at the real firefighters and some had air tanks... others were wearing masks and protective gear... but all we were given to fight the fires was an entrenching tool (tri-folding shovel).

		<fullReview>Invaders From Mars is an ok Sci-Fi flick. I can't comment on its status as a remake because I have yet to see the original. The disappointing factors are the talent behind this mediocre romp. With a director like Tobe Hooper, Dan O'Bannon writing the script, and Stan Winston creating the Martians, this should have been better. That's my main complaint. It also features a cast of cult people like Karen Black, James Karen, and Bud Cort. It's also funny to see the guy that played George W. on That's My Bush as a possessed, robot-like human. He plays a George in this film too. It's the star of the film that kills me. I know Hunter Carson is Karen Blacks' son, but they could have found a better kid. His lisp is awful. I now understand why they cut him from the cast of Married with Children. A few standout scenes include the frog eating sequence, the circular sand pits, and the alien's first landing. I admire Hooper's direction at times too, but the film is still lackluster. A few excellent shots really can't save it. When it boils down to it, it's still an Invasion of the Body Snatchers wannabe. I think had it been played more seriously, I would have liked it more. It's just a little too cheesy at times. I will say that this and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (both from 1986) were Hooper's last good efforts until the Taken mini-series in 2002.Note for genre buffs: Lifeforce, another alien invasion film by Tobe Hooper, can be seen playing in the house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay effort from Hooper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**possible spoilers**In the mid-1980s, director Tobe Hooper signed a three-picture deal with the Cannon Group, offering him a rare opportunity at being a big-time filmmaker. Unfortunately, this endeavor was a failure in the long run, and his career has never recovered. Due to circumstances beyond his control, the films they did together were generally unsuccessful, critically and commercially. The only one to make any money was his unfairly condemned "Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2", an uneven but often invigorating dark comedy that bore little resemblance to the original. "Lifeforce" was one of Cannon's most expensive projects, and possibly its biggest flop. A long, ungainly mess (especially the butchered U.S. version), the film did not win favor with the public, despite the presence of the frequently naked Mathilda May as a space vampiress. However, the film that suffered the most was "Invaders from Mars," a remake of the 1953 cult classic. Cannon repeatedly slashed the film's budget and severely compromised Hooper's creative vision. Furthermore, it was recut during postproduction. The result is not a complete disaster, but it does fall short of its aims. Despite a solid first half, it runs out of inspiration later on, becoming just another generic alien invasion movie.One night, a young boy sees a Martin spaceship land near his home turf. Needless to say, no one believes him--but everyone is starting to act strange--especially his teacher. These early scenes have an "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" vibe there; while not highly original, the first part of the film is solid enough, generating some suspense as the boy realizes that the aliens are taking over. His only friend is the school nurse, but who will save them? From this point on, the material could have gone in any direction, but it ends up running out of ideas and becoming another predictable exercise. Eventually, the Marine Corps find that something is amiss and fight the Martins, but this portion of the film is simply not as exciting as it should be--the surprises have run out. The film still benefits from solid production values; the interiors of the Martin ship are good at times, with some colorful lighting effects, but the weak script still hurts the film.As the little boy, Hunter Carson does a reasonably good job; though acting scared once in a while wouldn't have hurt, at least he's not annoying. Karen Black is okay but not exceptional. The best performance goes to Louise Fletcher as a possessed schoolteacher--her condition only seems to enhance her more unpleasant tendencies. Timothy Bottoms and Laraine Newman are adequate as the ill-fated parents, as is James Karen, playing the Marine general. "Invaders from Mars" needed more to keep things interesting. Some more plot twists could have made this a winner, but instead it is content to stay on the worn path, playing the same note over and over again. It's a passable effort, but not one worth going out of your way to check out. Tobe Hooper has made better films...but not lately.** (out of ****)Released by Cannon Films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be the remake of a fifties film,but it finds inspiration here there and everywhere:the beginning is a parboiled cross between a chapter of Bradbury's classic "Martian chronicles" and "invasion of the body snatchers" (1956) with special effects which do not excite anymore since "Alien" .Add abyssal performances:Timothy Bottoms wins hands down with his fake father part -but at least he's funny- with Louise Fletcher's wicked teacher not far behind.An unbearable brat gives the death blow as he almost replaces the general while leading the marines.As if it not were enough,the "unexpected " ending is so predictable that another one -a "normal" one,say- would have been stunning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High on visual quality, low on everything else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The visual splendor does look incredible for an 80s B-movie along with a cool opening credits sequence, but that's the only thing good about this sorry remake of INVADERS FROM MARS. Because the plot and story is so lame, it pales next to the original. It's nothing to get excited over, really. DVD junkies will gasp over its high-res imagery that suffices a good worthy purchase, yet I don't own one. And what's Tobe Hooper got to do with this? Poor all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blond pre-teen Hunter Carson (as David Gardner) sees a UFO land in the picturesque hills outside his house one night. Naturally, parents Timothy Bottoms (as George) and Laraine Newman (as Ellen) don't believe him. Then, father Bottoms starts acting weird. Really weird. And, he develops a strange wound on the back of his neck. Puzzled mother Newman sums it up nicely with the line, "George, you're acting very strange." Then, mom starts over-cooking the bacon, and eating raw hamburger meat...Science teacher Louise Fletcher (as Mrs. McKeltch) plays the part with a frog in her throat. Wait until you see her croak!Finally, young Carson finds an ally in unaffected school nurse Karen Black (as Linda Magnusson), who happens to also be his real-life mother. The two team up to fight the titular Invaders. Former young astronomer Jimmy Hunt, who starred as the boy in the original "Invaders from Mars" (1953), has a cool cameo as a police chief. Watch for him early in the running time. Little besides Mr. Hunt seems to have made much progress in the ensuing thirty-plus years.**** Invaders from Mars (6/6/86) Tobe Hooper ~ Hunter Carson, Karen Black, Louise Fletcher, Timothy Bottoms</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry to say that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mostly when I buy 80's movies on DVD I expect to see the real creativity. Especially my expectations are very high when I encounter a Cannon group film produced by Menahem Golan, Yoram Globus and directed by one of my most favorite directors Tobe Hooper who did an excellent job with LIFEFORCE. The plot is - aliens are here, a little boy happens to see the ship at night. Then the "terror" begins. A very boring terror let me tell you. Mostly it's so boring that you don't pay much attention to what's going on, because the plot is not even slightly developed. I truly don't understand how they could make this after LIFEFORCE? To like this one you'll have to give up everything positive you have ever experienced watching truly good and entertaining movies, you're really risking to spoil your taste. Surely I didn't expect to see another Lifeforce, but this movie was the most unimaginative thing I have ever seen. The problem is the plot very-very little, the acting is awful, everything is so gray and lifeless. There's not even a single good frame. And I say what a waste? How could Cannon afford such a miss? I'm really sorry for what I am saying because I'm a real fan of Hooper and Golan/Globus production. I strongly recommend to everybody not to watch this movie. Hooper's worst-considered "The Mangler", "Spontaneous combustion" and even "Night terrors" are masterpieces in comparison with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic, Childish, funny... in a retarded sort of way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't remember much of this movie, except that when I saw it as a child, I found it scary and loved it. the 'back of the neck' marks remained in my head even when I had completely forgotten about it. After recently coming back to my memory, I desperately wanted to know this movie's name. Well, after I found out and watched it again......OW!!! I expected it to be cheesy, but not this bad! Forget about the terrible b-grade actors and a mediocre musical score (that starts with a Jerry Goldsmith rip-off and then degrades into an elevator music muzak). The alien ship sets are actually quite cool.... but the aliens, my god! I've never seen anything more ridiculous than this... giant mouths with four legs??? they of course move in a completely awkward and sluggish way, it would take them an hour to cross a room so there's no practical sense to any of it... and I wonder how they built the ship since they are basically primitive, stupid monsters with no hands...oh yes, they do have two tiny, atrophied hands at the sides, but they don't count for much.They always appear in couples, one to look and grunt (and be killed), and the other one to fire some stupid ray from a 'shoulder' mounted cannon (that needs a full bar of copper to be inserted every time it's fired). Really, these poor guys must get their butts kicked all along the universe, they have no chance with such odds against them. Actually, I'm beginning to like them more, now that I see them as such cosmic losers. the alien mastermind is slightly cooler, (must be Quato's great grandfather), and whatever alien menace we get from the movie comes from him and that giant needle drill they use to convert humans to their cause. About the teacher eating a frog... no comment. I'll bet Tobe Hooper thought it was a great idea, which explains his career after Poltergeist. Watch it for laughs. It's so bad you'll be tempted to think it's an intentional spoof, but it's Tobe Hooper we're talking about... this is probably the best he's capable of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in all - disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this, and whilst I admit some of the special effects were good, I felt there were some parts of the film that could have been a lot better as it digressed too far from the original story in places.The dialogue and some of the acting was corny. The aliens looked too far fetched, the head martian looked like a cross between something out of star wars and war of the worlds. Whilst the more 'lowly' martians looked out of place as again a cross between the war of the worlds aliens (1950's original) only with teeth! A bit over exaggerated I thought, especially where one of the aliens appears to be 'laughing' after his counterpart eats the school teacher! Speaking of which, I thought the scene of her eating a frog, had no real importance or relevance in the film for that matter.One of those films to watch once, and forget!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really have to pay more attention to what I'm doing. I thought I was making a request for the original "Invaders From Mars" through my local library system and wound up with this 1986 remake. Still, the DVD cover looked pretty cool with it's colorful, Fifties styled artwork so I figured I might as well give it a shot. Because my impression was now established that it was going to be a campy remake, I kept looking for the humor in it but it just kept taking itself more seriously than it needed to. Then, once the film made it's way to the alien cave with it's flashing disco lights and outlandish space creatures, it ceased being a serious sci-fi film for me and simply entered the theater of the absurd. So it didn't surprise me too much when it came time for the finale to reveal that it was all just the kid's (Hunter Carson) dream. Maybe that's what redeemed the picture somewhat for me, because now we're simply dealing with the kid's imagination. That's something I was able to relate to well enough, because when I was a kid, I was the only one in the whole family who knew there was a gorilla up in the attic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remembered the original vaguely but fondly. A successful, modest, and mysterious story of townspeople being "taken over" somehow by beings from a UFO that has landed and buried itself "over the hill." Everyone who walked over that hill to investigate came back strange.This remake has essentially the same plot. And there's nothing wrong with the plot itself. It was used to advantage in small masterpieces like "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and "It Came From Outer Space" and a couple of others.The story is told from the point of view of a boy of about ten. There's nothing wrong with that either. Look at "Shane" and "To Kill a Mockingbird." But this is dreadful. The "changed" folk of the town don't act merely strange. They act crazy -- and in an ominous way. And those who escape being implanted by the Martians are uniformly hysterical, from the nurse (Karen Black) to the Armed Forces.The remake is a more expensive movie. There are enough giant worm holes, lighted somehow with red gels, to make an ant farm. The special effects are stupendous -- colossal.But they don't add up to a better movie because the sense of gathering mystery, of quiet revelation, is missing. The remake tends towards in-your-face special effects and it seems as though it can't wait to rush into that final confrontation so the blue electrical arcs and the yellow death rays can be deployed.Well, maybe it's not so bad. Maybe it's just that the original was nice and quiet and -- well, original. This one is faster, noisier, and splashy, and my tolerance level has dropped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick With the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars (1986) * 1/2 (out of 4) Tobe Hooper's disappointing remake of the 1950s classic about a young boy (Hunter Carson) who witnesses a UFO land in his backyard and soon realizes that aliens are overtaking various people in town. The only person who will believe him is a teacher (Karen Black) and the two quickly find themselves hunted by the aliens. There were a lot of remakes going on during this era so it makes since that someone would try to remake INVADERS FROM MARS but The Cannon Group probably should have left it to someone else while they just worried about their Charles Bronson and Chuck Norris pictures. Or, perhaps they could have added Bronson and Norris to this thing and at least delivered some fun. This is a really lifeless, over-long and rather pointless remake that doesn't have much of anything going for it. Just about the only good thing that can be said about the film belongs to the special effects, which were pretty good. I thought the landing of the spaceship was rather effective with the lights being used and the monsters certainly looked very good. I also thought the set design of the cave was well done but sadly everything else here is just a bust. The biggest problem is the direction by Hooper who just doesn't bring any energy to anything going on. No matter what a scene calls for the director completely misses the boat and this includes the early scenes with him trying to show this "loving" family. There's so much sugar added to these scenes that you can't help but roll your eyes. Then when the boy comes under attack you'd expect there to be some suspense but there isn't. There are even a few hints at some comedy but this doesn't work either. The final forty-minutes of the film goes into action mode with all sorts of gun play, explosions and other craziness but these scenes too fail to gather up any excitement or energy. The performances really aren't anything to write home about either. Black is about as over-the-top in her emotions as one could get. Carson, as the young boy, isn't charming a bit and comes off more annoying than anything else. Timothy Bottoms plays the father and isn't all that entertaining. James Karen, from THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, is also so over-the-top that it seems like he thinks he's in some spoof. Even former Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher goes overboard as the psycho teacher. Jimmy Hunt, the boy from the original film, gets a fine cameo. INVADERS FROM MARS is considered one of the biggest disasters from the 80s and it's easy to see why Hooper's career started to go down. With such a budget they really should have came up with something much better but at least we have the original to go to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plan 9 from Tobe Hooper!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quintessentially nostalgic science-fiction (involving ill-natured aliens taking over our planet) was a genre born in the 1950, with such classic titles like "Invasion of the Body Snatcher", "The Thing From Another World", "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "War of the Worlds". "Invaders from Mars" was another influential film from that decade (released in 1953) and focused on hideous Martians that secretly landed on earth in a remote American town and took over humanity bit by bit. The original was a poorly made but nevertheless creepy milestone with a brooding tension and a handful of excellent sequences illustrating paranoia and mass hysteria. For unspecific reasons, director Tobe Hooper thought it was fun to do a remake, providing the Martians and their spaceship with a typical 80's look. The story stayed exactly the same but the special effects and monstrous designs now look cheesy and the complete opposite of scary. Hunter Carson stars as the little space-freak who wakes up in the middle of the night and witnesses the landing of a giant spaceship over the hills. The rest of the film revolves on him and school nurse Linda (Karen Black) escaping their own alienation while the rest of the town is getting brainwashed by the goofball-Martians. "Invaders from Mars" is an overall lousy film with many tedious moments, unintentional laughs and miserable dialogues. Some of the visual effects are imaginative but they never provoke feelings of fright. Tobe Hooper also regretfully retained the only aspect of the original that was actually open for improvement, namely the dire ending. He should have learned more from John Carpenter when he made his 80's version of "The Thing from Another World".</fullReview>
