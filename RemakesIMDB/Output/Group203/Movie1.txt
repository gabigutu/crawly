		<fullReview>I was seven years old when I was taken to see this movie by my sixty-year old Lithuanian grandmother (to whom it must have made no sense at all). The images in the movie - the big green guys, the melting rock that looked like an explosion in a bubble gum factory, the people falling into the sand pit, the dreaded implant approaching the pretty neck of Dr. Blake, the little silver octopus-like guy in the fishbowl - all replayed themselves in my mind over many nights. I saw it again recently on AMC and can see many of the things that are dated, but can also understand why the movie made such an impact at the time. The concept, especially, of one's parents being taken under the control of evil forces is particularly disturbing to a young child. The music and sound effects, too, are particularly eerie. The almost abstract quality of the set in the police station scene lends it a foreboding quality. I'm ambivalent on how to rate it. It very much shows its age (and they could have shortened the stock army footage of tanks rolling) but has much that gives it a weird sort of drawing power even today. A curiously compelling movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranoid, Maybe-Serious, Very.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in it's 2nd or 3rd run, around 1957 I was about 10 years old (same age as David in the movie) and very naive concerning agendas and hidden messages. The hook was the very beginning with a spatial view of the stars, a vocal chorus that sounded 'heavenly' and segued in beautiful fashion. I was a stargazer, thrilled with what was starting to happen in the space race and interested in all things scientific. When you're 10, you don't look for zippers on martian suits, balloons that move when martians go past them, or things like that. What you notice is that some of the people in the movie echo individuals you know in real life. You begin to wonder if people who seem changed in real life have something in the back of their necks. Maybe you look for these markings after you leave the theater?'Invaders' had a profound effect on me as a child, but then, so did "The Day The Earth Stood Still". I suspect that there wasn't a large budget to make this picture but am moved to say that it accomplished what it set out to do, both in sending a message and being real scary at the time. If you are a real 'Invaders' fan, try to find the 12" laser discs that came out in the late 70s. (2-12" laser disc set) It featured all the trailers and several different endings. I still watch it now and then and hope that I don't wake up in the same dream every day, like David did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptively Brilliant Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A child astronomer searches the skies with his father. Later the child astronomer wakes to the sound of a flying saucer landing in a sand pit across from his home. The child's father investigates, and returns "transformed." Soon father and mother both seem affected. Child, accompanied by his fetching teacher visits his astronomer friend, whom talks unashamedly about "invaders from Mars."Within this deceptively simple plotline is a surrealistic masterpiece. With stunning use of color, forced perspective, oversized sets, eerie dreamlike music and carefully mannered performances and plotting, director William Cameron Menzies (an Oscar-winning art director) displays the nightmarish incidents from a child's perspective. Even the typically 50s ending takes on a different perspective. Was it a dream? Was it a foreshadowing of the future? Or is it a recurring nightmare, in a mind gone hopelessly mad.Only since this film have widespread reports of alien "abductions" and "alien implants" become a reality. Coincidence?INVADERS FROM MARS is one of the great fantasy sci-fi films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Invaders", still potent after nearly fifty years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading many of the comments regarding this movie, I am somewhat amused to see how many have forgotten that there was life before CGI computer effects."Invaders From Mars" is still potent in the most valuable way, and that's imagination. The storyline, which owes a great deal to "The Wizard of Oz" in it's final moments, has deep psychological effects which still resonate today. If it wasn't so effective, people wouldn't still be discussing it after nearly fifty years.CGI effects have dumbed down movies to nothing more than computer-effects orgies, relying on a "gee-whiz" factor that ultimately comes up empty in more than a few cases (the big-budget "Godzilla" leaps quickly to mind here). IFM was originally set to be a 3-D movie, which was ultimately scrapped for budgetary concerns. William Cameron Menzies, the director, used the original sets which had been designed to force perspective. The resulting film, which throws the objectivity to a child's point of view has fascinated viewers for years. Menzies did the best with what he could afford, and the visual results are still gripping even today. Yes, the film has it's flaws, but we need to consider the making of IFM in its historical context. Menzies was an Oscar-winning art director (for "Gone With the Wind", no less). Also consider his work on "Thief of Bagdad" with Sabu, one of the most beautiful color films ever made. IFM shows the same visual excitement (referred to by some viewers as "garish"), but rising above it's badly slashed budget to gain a foothold in popular memory.It's sad to think that the work of a real artist will be dismissed simply because he worked in an era where technology hadn't swallowed vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stuff Nightmares Are Made From</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An eerie horror/sci-fi that works even better today: great set design (by the director William Cameron Menzies), script, haunting music, and unforgettable images: the hill-top "sinking sand" set, weird marks on victims' necks, the catacombed alien lair, the tall, green, bug-eyed Martians, the gold-like, tentacled, expressive "head"-intelligence in the globe, the LONG hypodermic needle, much more. Costumes work well too, note the change of the mother (Hillary Brooke) from loose-haired blonde sweetness, to a possessed rigid-hairstyled villainess in black. The doctor-heroine (Helena Carter) is a picture-book beauty of auburn-coiffured refinement and soft-spoken sympathy, clad in a cream-colored dress, with a bright red handkerchief to set it off and two-toned stilettos. Jimmy Hunt is all-American red-headed freckleness, unusual in that the story is told from his point-of-view, a fine performance. Good support from Morris Ankrum, Arthur Franz, and Leif Erickson. The dreamlike nature of the picture is only enhanced by the repeating footage, lots of stock military scenes, the wobbly aliens, etc. Basic plot was re-used for "It Came From Outer Space" (1953), "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956), "It Conquered the World" (1956), many more. Skip the abysmal 1986 remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal 50's Sci-Fi from a child's perspective. Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by anyone who dismisses Invaders from Mars as a piece of retrograde schlock. There may be a visible zipper or two on the monster suits and their weapons will look a little Dr. Seussy compared to a Trekkie phaser, but this movie has a lot to offer, including a completely unique child-driven story line. I can't think of another movie that so successfully captures the terror at the heart of every child's fear that their parents may not be who they say they are; that no one believes them because they're children (how many abused children have been fobbed off by well-meaning adults who should have listened?), or that they're entitled a a perfect, loving father and mother (the nurse and the astronomer), not the ones they've been born to.Compared to so many of today's Sci-Fi disasters that are long on money and short on everything else, Invaders from Mars relies on atmosphere and expressionist angles, nightmarish sets that are just a little too big, too stark, too skewed (the Police Station is a perfect example). And instead of Mars Attacks' little green gremlins that take such glee in splattering and fricassing everything in site; the Martians in IoM are insidious; relying on one human to lure another into a sinister sand pit (a metaphor for the threat of communism or the tactics of the House UnAmerican Activities hearings?). How many future 'alien abductees,' sci-fi plotters and X-files authors have used the conventions here? Tiny implants inserted at the back of the neck. Friends turned into traitorous zombies. Humans kidnapped and set out on slab tables for experimentation? Alien tunnels spread like netting beneath the placid surface of the world's oblivious Earthlings. A hero with the truth that no one will listen to? And how many film makers, even now, would have the skill and the nerve to save the boy, start the ordeal all over again, and make it work? Because, as we all know, the monsters in the closet come back as soon as the light goes out again.NOTE: the remake is a total waste of time that Tobe Hooper should be mortally ashamed of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And a Child Shall Lead Them...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of positive and negative feedback for this film, and I can understand why. Whether we want to admit it or not, nostalgia does have an impact on how we view things. As someone between the two generations(early 30's at this time), I can understand how I have put special importance on things I watched as a child. I know that some of these films were not too good but they mean't a lot to me. I also know that I was the kind of person that watched older films and appreciated them if they were good, and watched newer films and appreciated them if they were good. The biggest problem with many younger viewers today is that they do not look at a film in a context of when it was made, nor do they look at the most important aspect of the film which is what message is the film trying to relate....NOT how does it look in relating its message. We as a society are too caught up with presentation and other superficial things that sometimes we ignore what the core of something is. Anyway...enough philosophizing. This film is a good film period. Yep, it is cheaply made. Yep, it is filled with lots of stock footage, particularly the battle scenes which take place at night but footage takes place during day. Yep, it has mediocre acting. I won't argue those point because they are accurate. But those are only a part of the film...and for this film at least a very small part. This film has style and substance. Director William Cameron Menzies WAS a great director. He directed the science fiction classic Things To Come in the 30's which was a visionary masterpiece. He made this film fun to watch as he incorporated German expressionistic sets into his small-town simple story of a boy that knows aliens have landed on Earth in his back yard. The young boy played by Jimmy Hunt does a fine job in his role. The messages the film relates, however, are for me at least the core of the film....watch out for the ordinary....listen to children.....conformity is dangerous. This film is saying so much...give it a chance without worrying about window-dressing! And a final note...Long Live Morris Ankrum in film...I like him in this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Lost Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you know this movie was almost lost forever rotting away in a film file at a tv studio in California I believe.There was just one copy left and it was deteriating badly! Thanks to a man called Wade Williams (one of the producers in 86 awful remake) who ran a movie theater in Kansas City went all over the country in the seveties looking for this film. He like myself grew up watching this movie in the early sixties when it just literally disapeared off the face of the earth.This info is based on a Star Log magazine story in 1977 and a personal phone call to Wade Williams that same year.I did finally get to see the movie in early 1981 when it was shown on tv 38 Boston and was blown away to see it again.I have the movie on vhs and plan to get on dvd soon.I grew up the late fifties and early sixties and this is as well as 3 Stooges Have Rocket Will Travel and Target Earth are part of my all time favorites.I guess you had to haved lived thru that era to really appreciate these movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia probably has a lot to do with my affection for this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could never be legitimately argued as one of the masterworks of Cinema. And, while its director was at the very least always regarded as competent, and more usually engaged as a production designer, he would never even be considered by critics when ranking the greats.But at a time when computerised sleight-of-hand can achieve the impossible in depiction of alien worlds, few modern science-fiction films can match the portrayal of a young boy's fear and wonderment of the unknown as depicted in the original version of Invaders from Mars.Nostalgia probably has a lot to do with my affection for this film. Although the original release date of the film was before my time, even some years later the early 1960's Irish schoolboys were still endlessly fascinated with the possibility of flying saucers. And while we wanted to believe that there really was something out there, the Red Planet was seen as this great evil place which we had to be constantly wary of.So I really do identify with Jimmy Hunt and his sense of wonder. But the film is more than just a festival for nostalgia-freaks.The wonderful design and look of the film, those marvellous garish colours; the feeling of alienation (sorry) by Jimmy when it seems that not only can he not trust the local police but even his parents seem to be under the control of the aliens. And that wonderful ending when it seems that the nightmare will never end.Of course you can pick faults: the master alien is rather ridiculous looking. And the scenes of the aliens running through the tunnels would never strike dread in you. But I'm sure the budget, even by the standards of the time was not much above Poverty Row. But these are minor quibbles. Its the overall impact that matters most. And the accurate portrayal of the concerns of the time.I know there are many films of the 1950's which Americans maintain are allegories of the McCarthy witch-hunts and the Cold War. I don't know about that. But I do know that however much I may admire the computerised sci-fi films of the 80's and 90's, this film will always have a special place in my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem in the rough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders From Mars is, arguably, a cult classic. William Cameron Menzies, of "Gone With The Wind" and "The Thief of Baghdad" and "Things to Come" fame puts his artistic expertise to work in creating a world of impending doom, seen through the eyes of an 11 year old boy.It is because of this point-of-view that lends a nightmarish quality to a struggle this boy encounters when he tries to convince the authorities that a spaceship landed in a sandpit behind his house.The sense of "something's not right" with Mom and Dad starts as the boy's parents are sucked below the sandpit into the evil arms of the Martians, made into zombie-spies, and returned to the surface. The boy's fear mounts when local police and even high-ranking military fall prey to the Martians' mind control.Through the assistance of a well trusted astrophysicist and a school psychologist the boy convinces the local Army base to make a beach head in the boy's back yard... and the battle to return the boy's parents and the villagers to normalcy begins. Eventually, the boy and the psychologist confront the Martian intelligence (midget Luce Potter as a convincing body-less head with tentacle-like arms in a glass sphere). In a poor "race against time" sequence in which the little boy and psychologist are rescued from the spaceship before it blows up, the film reaches its climax to the cacophonous din of artillery explosions, and Raoul Kraushaar's eerie, disharmonious a capella choir.Many criticize the poor production values, the over use of stock footage, the idiotic costumes, and the fact that the film had TWO endings (one popularized in Great Britain, one here in U.S.A.).Yes, I agree that production and set values were cheap (green condoms to represent molten rock "bubbles" in the tunnels and obvious zippers in the velour-like jump suits of the Martian slaves, to name a few.)Nevertheless, Menzies applies forced perspective to his sets, and the skillful use of background mattes to lend an unearthly tone to the scene Remember folks, this is 1953... a time when Communism infiltration and subordination of Mr. and Mrs. Joe America was the chief "fear of the day". There are few other films of that period that deftly portrayed this paranoia so aptly as "Invaders From Mars"If one overlooks the "rough" edges of its obviously low budget, one can still appreciate the helplessness, fear and mistrust the little boy develops as his parents and others are turned into "tools of the Martians". Is it truly a nightmare, or did it actually happen? The viewer is left to make that choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insecurity Abounds as Here Come Dem Martians !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Menzies compelling and interesting look , at the 1950's , from a young boys' perspective, as little David MacLean(Jimmy Hunt)witnesses a flying saucer landing in the sandpit in back of his house.Innocent small town America, 1950's , structurally sound and completely secure , until one day the Martians land and people start behaving oddly .One morning David wakes up early to view an astral event, only to see a flying object, bury itself behind his house. His dad goes to investigate, and becomes the first victim of the Martians.The residents are lured to this site, and sucked under ground,listen for the MUSIC, and inserted in the back of the neck with a metal implant, that allows the Head Martian to control their actions and gather info from their thoughts .The Head Martian is the Ultimate in Evolution, disappointing in the fact that you are resigned to a fishbowl without arms and legs . I am not alone, as to how this movie introduced a young audience, to McCarthyism, fear of diverse thinking, and primal fear of insecurity of your parents . I doubt if there will ever be another demographic of baby boomer's, that will be the target for such a provocative film .After Parents 1 and 2 , 2 policeman,and petite Kathy Wilson are implanted, Jimmy decides he needs help. So he goes to the nearest GAS STATION ATTENDENT ?DUH...Well, then he goes for help from the Local Police Chief, but he also has the DREADED RED X , on the back of his neck .DR. Blake(Helena Carter) intervenes, but Jimmy needs to check her neck, I would have checked more extensively, but that is another story.They invoke the help of Dr. Kelston(Arthur Franz),and he contacts the military, whom they convince to check out the sand pit area.Look for Barbara Billingsly, and yes, she is wearing a necklace.Menzies does a Terrific job of directing, his sets and camera angles draw you into the movie psychologically.Even with a low budget, they use prophylactics for F/X . I don't think that has been done before or since .The Mutants, pronounced MOO' Tants, like MOOt ants', are funny looking and Green, but effective, on a big screen to young people . A terrific look at the 50's and narrow thinking. Still provocative after all these years, even only if people debate if it was originally designed for 3-D ? I have the DVD which I think is Terrific , it has extras, and the British release which has the alternate ending, which leads me to believe, that maybe they just like happy endings.A Great Film, check out Menzies other Films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; Bad Of 'Invaders From Mars''</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little boy is the star of this film, and he does a fine job acting. Jimmy Hunt is his name, and he didn't have a big career acting, "retiring" at the end of the following year (1954). He was a decent child actor, as he shows here. He did come back to be part of the remake in 1986, playing the police chief and uttering one ironic and inside-joke line.I thought the best part of this 1953 sci-fi classic was the beginning where Hunt really took center stage as the kid who saw a Martian UFO crash-land in a nearby area and then saw what the aliens did to his parents and others. I appreciated the fact the film didn't overdo the "we-don't-believe-the-dumb kid-angle. I presumed they were going to go on and on about that, but they didn't. He got a good ally soon and it wasn't too long where people woke up to what was happening. This was made in the era, unlike the last few decades, in which Hollywood portrayed the U.S. military as the good guys. There is no need to go into story details. The fun of the film is the corny lines here and there and, of course, the horrible special-effects, some of which will make you laugh out loud.This was meant to scare kids 55 years ago but now, as adults, we just look at these films as "campy" or "cheesy" entertainment to give us laughs, and keep us entertained. For the most part, this film delivered in those areas. You can't take any of it seriously because it's too hokey for that. I was sorry to see them use stock footage. That really wasn't needed because the story and acting were acceptable enough, and the dialog dumb enough to be entertaining. Still, don't expect a "masterpiece," or something that is so bad, it's great. It's kind of somewhere in the middle.Generally speaking, I enjoyed this film, but after hearing some rave reviews, expected a little more. My major complaint - and it only one - is that it lags halfway through, until the last 20-or-so minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent cult sci-fi movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders From Mars is one of the best science fiction movies of the 1950's. I have seen this several times and never tire of it.A haunting atmosphere throughout and a good musical score keep it going. It is shot in glorious colour and the special effects are pretty good despite the low budget.The acting in this is excellent, especially from young Jimmy Hunt and 50's regulars Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum are reunited in this as they starred alongside each other in Flight to Mars (1951). Extensive stock military footage doesn't spoil this at all.I enjoyed this movie very much and it has gained a cult following.Rating: 4 and a half stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perfect movie from the 1950's which echoes the Cold War, McCarthyism, and to a certain extent, don't trust anyone over 30! A spaceship lands and disappears into the ground and suddenly people are not quite themselves anymore. A particularly terrifying scene is when David's mother suddenly "falls" only to re-emerge changed. The photography/direction for the most part is from the young boys point of view. The police chief is huge and menacing behind an overly large desk inside a sterile police station. Once the military arrive and blast their way into the alien ship, an army of goons with disintegrator guns try to protect their creepy ruler. Once you see the ruler and this movie, you really won't be able to forget it. Hopefully this will be on DVD soon, it really needs to be restored. Produced as a "B" grade movie but it earns an "O" for outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was only a year old when this movie came out, but I saw it on TV when I was around 8 years old, and it made a deep impression on me. In fact, when they brought out that long needle, my sister and I hid behind the couch and screamed for our mother to come turn off the TV! As a result, I did not know how the movie ended until I saw it again as a teenager. The special effects may seem cheesy to the jaded audiences of today, but they were effective enough to give me nightmares for years. (In one dream I am being carried by my own mother, who is walking stiffly, with a fixed smile.) I believe what makes it work is that the entire film is seen from the point of view of the boy. The director capitalizes on the insecurity of young children, and the way they relate to the world around them. All the best horror and science fiction movies succeed not because of CGI, costumes, rubber prostheses and fake blood, but because they focus on basic human fears and insecurities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a fairly big back yard when I was growing up and there is nothing but a field behind it. I also had the back bedroom. So of course after seeing this movie I would check out the window at night to see if anything was going on. In the morning I would check behind peoples neck to see if there was a implant. This routine went on for a while. Until my parents were losing their patience. Oh boy that would of really proved they were undercover martians lol. This movie scared the mess out of me and today I still look out for strange going ons in my backyard at night. In movie in which the bad guys in this case martians look like regular folks scare me. It is so more realistic then monsters running around town. Just get the heck out of the way and wait for the National Guard and the Army to nuke them. But these wolf in sheep clothing horror movies really scare me because the enemy are people we are friend and family too. WHo can you trust? That is why this movie and the one where this women marries this guy only to have martians take over his body among other people scare me. Dracula , Invasion of the Body Snatchers are in that category too. The movie uses stock footage from other flicks and the budget was probably around 9.99. But it still scared me to death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>though flawed with a pitiful production budget, IVM survives now some 50 years later as a (cultish) spooky favorite of the boomer crowd, mentioned by few but remembered by many. menzies' superbly staged (and, i suspect, ingeniously makeshift) set designs make the film work as a memorably haunting child's dreamland gone bad.as subtle in it's style as it is heavy-handed in it's obvious subject-matter, IVM's emphasis on effect over "effects" separates it from the legion of '50's era monster-from-mars flicks whose climatic moments always ended with a pitched battle of the perfunctory rubber-suited. here the rubber suited demons are not THE villians, but merely the low-level functionaries of doom - doormen at the entrance of a deeper tale of parental abuse, betrayal and destruction, all whispering the threat of an impending, ultimate chaos.the end of the world -- at least to a child --has never seemed more real. a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better (I mean good-better) sci-fi films of the '50s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undeniably, this film is pretty juvenile (even for me) but those who saw it when it first came out in theaters remember how it represented all that was scary as a kid. But films were not made to comment on the social structure alone. They were meant to entertain. So let's move on.The story concerns a little child who sees a flying saucer land in his backyard. Dad goes out to investigate, but when he comes back behaving rather rudely, the kid knows something. When the cops who went out come back and the kid sees strange marks on the back of his head, he knows something's wrong. But not to fear! A lady psychiatrist and a well-to-do scientist are on hand to convince the world that they are up against . . . INVADERS FROM MARS.But don't worry. It's all a dream. Or is it? Let's just say that the dream deus ex machina explains why this film is so childlike in its approach. Note: Robot Monster uses the same plot device, and granted, that film is like something one would have during a fever, but no one gives that film any respect. Anyway, this is '50s life at its best: everyone knows everyone else's name, even if they've never met before, and once the military knows about it, they immediately roll in stock footage of tanks, soldiers and aircraft going to war. The effects are shoestring (check out the bubbles on the alien spacecraft wall), but done well for a film with it's budget. It helps that the director, William Cameron Menzies, was one of the most innovative art directors of our time, having worked on Gone With the Wind (He also directed Things to Come, written by H.G. Wells.). Some of the most chilling moments in this piece are the weird alien leader (a head in a bubble, spooky) and the close-up of a little girl, possessed by the aliens, who the little boy is running away from, smiling evilly. Trust me, these sights you won't soon forget. Finally, the acting, one of the most important elements, is very good for a film of this type. In other words, you know scientists and generals don't talk like this in real life, but they should. Jimmy Hunt, as the little boy, is one of the best child actors ever. He has a true child-like curiosity of "what's this? Can I touch it?" throughout the whole film. Arthur Franz is the astronomer who befriends the boy and shows him what dear old dad has been working on, Helena Carter is a sexy psychiatrist, Leif Erickson and Hillary Brooke are the perfect evil parents, and Morris Ankrum is a - you guessed it, general. He basically NEVER plays anything else, what did you expect?On a final note, we should remember back to the times when the atomic bombs meant aliens in bubbles, and the only ones who could stop them were little children who knew better than adults. Not until the Gamera flicks would such wonders be revisited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Sci-Fi alien invader films from the 50's? I'd have said so.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders From Mars starts at approximately 4.30 a.m. one morning as an alarm clock belonging to a young boy named David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt) goes off waking his parents George (Leif Erickson) &amp; Mary (Hillary Brooke) in the process as well. Budding scientist &amp; astronomer David wanted to be up early to witness the clear early morning sky's through his telescope but what David actually sees is a huge flying saucer land in the fields behind his house. David ask's his dad to go &amp; investigate which he does, he however does not come back. It's now morning &amp; the sun is up &amp; George is still missing, worried Mary calls the police. Officers Jackson (Douglas Kennedy, uncredited) &amp; Blaine (Charles Cane also uncredited) turn up &amp; head out back to see if they can find George. Back at the house George walks in &amp; is somehow different, very aggressive &amp; evasive about where he has been. Then the two policemen reappear &amp; they too seem different. David is convinced that aliens have done something to his dad so decides to keep an eye on the field &amp; when he sees a young girl named Kathy Wilson (Janine Perreau) sucked under a stretch of sand he becomes convinced of it. David desperately tries to make someone, anyone believe his story but doesn't get very far until he meets Dr. Pat Blake (Helena Carter) &amp; Professor Stuart Kelston (Arthur Franz) whom become convinced David is in fact telling the truth...Directed by William Cameron Menzies who also acted as production designer I must admit that I have a special place in my heart for Invaders From Mars. It was the first Sci-Fi horror film I can ever remember seeing all those years ago &amp; images from it have always stayed with me. In no small way I would say that Invaders From Mars had a huge influence on the films that I enjoy today &amp; shaping my tastes &amp; I vividly remember it creeping me out big style! The scenes of the sand opening &amp; sucking people in &amp; then closing again literary embedded itself in my mind &amp; genuinely scared me. Looking at it now in the cold hard light of day in August 2005 all these years later as an adult it obviously doesn't quite evoke the fear it once did &amp; to be brutally honest isn't a brilliant film but it is a good one. The script by Richard Blake is a little better than most 50's Sci-Fi, he tries to give the film some sort of story as the Martians are here for a specific purpose rather than to just randomly wipe us out or eat us, it's just a shame that the middle slows down to a virtual stand still with a long drawn out scene in Professor Kelston's office where he explains lots of outdated scientific nonsense &amp; within a few minutes manages to not only figure out where these aliens have come from but why their here. The very fact that Professor Kelston has to use an artist's interpretation of the surface of mars which has greenery on it should give you a clue as to how Invaders From Mars has dated. There is one funny bit where David &amp; Professor Kelston are showing Colonel Fielding (Morris Ankrum) the area by sitting on a house's roof, what's wrong with looking out of the window chaps? I mean it would be a bit safer &amp; less conspicuous wouldn't it? The characters are thin &amp; very 50's in the way they act from the police to the Army, people just wouldn't behave like this these days or at least I hope they wouldn't. Technically Invaders From Mars is pretty good considering the period it was made, most of it was obviously shot in a studio even the exteriors of houses &amp; the like &amp; at one point to signify the Pentagon they show a model complete with toy cars driving along next to it! Shot in colour director Menzies uses some garish colour schemes throughout. The alien ship is alright looking but what stands out for me &amp; another aspect of Invaders From Mars that I have never forgotten are the dark tunnels created by the aliens that run under the sand pit complete with somehow eerie bubbled walls. The main alien 'intelligence' (Luce Potter) actually looks very impressive &amp; again creepy whereas the big servants don't as their obviously just tall guys in green felt costumes &amp; matching goggles, I suppose what I'm trying so say is the Martian Intelligence actually looks alien &amp; the big green things most definitely don't. The acting is pretty wooden as you would expect from a cheap 50's Sci-Fi so no surprises there. Overall I have fond childhood memories of Invaders From Mars so maybe my judgement is clouded but I will openly admit it hasn't dated too well, having said that I throughly recommend it &amp; it's a film I think will stay with me forever. Definitely worth a watch &amp; absolutely essential viewing material for Sci-Fi fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed it- despite being forced to watch it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Invaders from Mars" is one of the more enjoyable films that we have to watch for media studies, however there is far more to it than just that. When considering the budget and technology at William Menzies disposal a really innovative and ground breaking piece of cinema was created. There are many things happening in the film on different levels giving scope for individual themes to be analysed, for example the conventions it follows and what makes it a cold war movie.On a personal note I found it easy to watch and it interested me how many of the themes, signifiers and metaphors have crept in to many of todays Sci-Fi films, in this respect it is similar to Fritz Lang's "Metropolis". Also noteworthy is how many of todays Sci-Fi's have developed into films justifying Americas military budget and Menzies helped create this trend, whether or not that was good or bad thing remains to be seen (quite literally).When focusing on the cold war themes running throughout this pioneering piece of work you begin to understand what was happening throughout the world socially at that time, although it is difficult to fully comprehend for me having been born in the eighties. America was scared of the threat of communism and the effect it could have on their capitalist society and watching the film with this in mind makes you fully appreciate that it was not produced purely with aim to entertain, but in a sense educate. Having said that it remains to this day a good film, you have to look beyond the fancy-dresslike costumes and concentrate on the conventions, themes and storyline which were unprecedented at that time.Overall my comments are irrelevant, but the fact this film is still being watched and talked about speaks volumes about the esteem and regard in which this film is held.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate 1950s Kid Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early color sci-fi classic, as uniquely 1950-ish as 'This Island Earth'. Ten-year-old David McLean (Jimmy Hunt) wakes up one night during a thunderstorm and witnesses a strange glowing object which lands in the sand dunes near his house. The next morning David's father (Leif Erikson) climbs the dunes to check out his son's wild story about a flying saucer. When he returns, Erikson is strangely cold and hostile towards his family. Later, David's mother (Hillary Brooke) suffers the same change.David discovers that alien invaders are kidnapping people and inserting tiny brain-control devices into the backs of their necks. When David tries to warn the authorities about the invasion, nobody believes him except a lovely lady psychologist (Helena Carter) and a friendly astronomer (Arthur Franz).Milburn Stone ('Gunsmoke's' Doc) has a small role as a policeman. Naturally Morris Ankrum plays a high-ranking Army officer, but in this one Ankrum actually gets to lead his troops into battle! Ankrum appeared in more 1950s sci-fi films than any other actor -- even John Agar!This is the ultimate American Kid's Adventure: David is kidnapped by the aliens, fights side-by-side with the soldiers, and saves the world with his bravery and scientific knowledge. If you like the basic flavor of 1950s sci-fi, you'll like this one. Excellent special effects by Jack Cosgrove, and the alien makeup by Gene Hobbs is good (even though you can see the zippers in the Martian suits). Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who was production designer on 'The Thief of Baghdad' (1924), 'Gone with the Wind' (1939). and 'Things to Come' (1936) which he also co-directed.In the 1986 remake of 'Invaders from Mars', the now grownup Jimmy Hunt plays the chief of police. When he climbs the sand dunes to look for hidden Martians, he says, 'I haven't been up here since I was a kid.' A great 'in' joke.If you're old enough to remember movies before computer-generated special effects were common, or you're imaginative enough to appreciate the more sincere efforts of the 1950s filmmakers, you'll enjoy 'Invaders from Mars'.If you do, drop me a line. We're a vanishing breed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Martians Are Coming, The Martians Are Coming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a lad I got to see this one on television fairly early, about five years after it was in theaters. I was pretty taken with the film, I was still in grade school. Seeing it again though I managed to note a lot of the scientific flaws in the film.I cannot imagine that Arthur Franz who is identified as Helena Carter's favorite astronomer was able to deduce so much about life on Mars from telescope observation. We haven't got that far with the Mars probes we've sent in more recent times. The Martians know plenty about us though, they know exactly where on Earth man is learning about them and they want to do something about it.This all starts when young Jimmy Hunt sees a flying saucer actually land in a field near his house and bury itself beneath the soil. When his astronomer father Leif Erickson goes out to investigate, he gets caught in some artificial quicksand and when he comes back in the house he's not your typical Leave It To Beaver Hugh Beaumont like dad any more. He's got a little crystal knob sticking out the nape of his neck and pretty soon these start sprouting up on people, like Jimmy's mother Hillary Brooke, the police chief Bert Freed, etc. Fortunately for the world's sake, young Master Hunt convinces people before Kevin McCarthy did in Invasion Of the Body Snatchers that something ain't kosher out in that field. The armed might of the US Military is brought to bear.William Cameron Menzies put together some real nice sets and special effects in a film that is before those computer graphic things we're now so jaded with. He also got some convincing performances out of a good cast of character actors, mostly from Jimmy Hunt. The young man got his career role in this film, we see this invasion through his eyes.Of course there's perfectly logical reason why it is with his eyes which I cannot reveal.The conception of the Martians when we do meet the invaders could possibly be where the inheritors of Gene Roddenberry got their idea for the Founders and the Jem Hadar. If you see Invaders From Mars, see if you don't agree.Though the film is dated, positively saturated with Fifties attitudes, Invaders From Mars is still a good source of entertainment and speculation.</fullReview>

There is a road near where I live today.

I lived near a big lot with sand and all I could imagine was martians coming up thru the sand. A 6 or 7 yr old wasn't looking for a message just to be scared out of his wits on a warm summer night.

		<fullReview>This movie scarred the hell out of me back in 1953 (I was 9 years old at the time). However, I don't ever remember seeing the 3D version. In fact, the booklet that came with my new DVD said that the limited number of 3D cameras weren't available for use when IFM was originally made, due to a number of other 3D films being made at the same time. The negative was instead shot on the new single strip Eastman film. Anyway, the movie was quite effective in creating a creepy and alien world in which a young boy could escape to on a Saturday afternoon. I enjoyed the story, and really didn't care about the mediocre special effects. In fact, because the story was obviously a dream, the soft focus shots and cheezy effects made it all the more surreal. I might also add that beautiful Helena Carter became my first dream babe! LOL.Sorry Bruce Cook (an earlier reviewer), the actor who played David in IFM was named Jimmy Hunt.</fullReview>

Unfortunately this takes away from the enjoyment of one of the classic benchmark scifi films of the fifties. I have a VHS tape of the film that has a better print.

		<shortDescription>Began well, but really fizzled quickly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me state that this review is for what I understand to be the British version of the film which takes events at "face value" if you will.At times I tend to be a bit dubious about being so critical of something that the majority of viewers seem to love; However, I must say that from my perspective, what started out to be an engaging story with some psychological angles pretty quickly turned into little more than a curiosity piece for fans of classic sci-fi.I enjoyed the way the film began (despite the cheesy effects), with the boy waking up and viewing the saucer land, to his father returning with a glazed, angry demeanor and the "X" scar on the back of his neck (ahead of it's time!), to little David desperate for help at the police station (the surrealism of which would argue more for the American storyline version, btw). I was expecting at this point for the story to be a "boy against the establishment" type of plot, which I was willing to accept -- particularly if told from his point of view.However, the movie started to lose me pretty fast when the script got just plain silly. First, when Dr. Blake is going to interview David in the cell (in the cell, really??) and they want to be alone -- the police sergeant seems reluctant to leave Miss Blake there and says "If you have any trouble, just yell", as if he was leaving Clarice in the cell with Mr. Lecter or something. Then we move to the observatory where (at least in the version I watch), the movie slows to a crawl, gets very condescending, and the dialog becomes just plain goofy. I did get a great laugh at these lines as Dr. Blake and David are talking w/ Dr. Kelston --Dr. Blake: "What do you think it's all about, Stew? What David thought it was?" Dr. Kelston: "Possibly." David: "A spaceship?!" Dr. Blake: "From where?" Dr. Kelston (very gravely): "From outer space."After these scenes, I really couldn't engage myself back in the movie. Watching extended minutes of military vehicles on a train, driving, parking, etc. was obvious stock footage time filler. There is no way the little boy would be around everything, tell the astronomer all the facts, etc. In short, the movie as I watched it started out fairly well, and then really took a turn for the worse, and made it rather unengaging for me. I streamed this film from Netflix and I wish I could have seen the other version, because from reading some descriptions and comments here, I think I would have liked it a little better (some of the bad dialog and goofiness would have a somewhat plausible explanation). Maybe it would have been a 5 or 6 in that case. My recommendation is to avoid the British version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed and Lame Cult-Movie and Source of Inspiration of a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The intelligent boy David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt) is the son of the Armistead's engineer George MacLean (Leif Erickson), who is the responsible for the secret design of the engine of a powerful rocket that will be launched to Mars. His mother Mary MacLean (Hillary Brooke) uses to say that he will be a scientist like his father is. David frequently uses his telescopic like an astronomer to search the sky. One night, he sees a spaceship landing on the beach nearby his house and he tells his beloved father that promises to investigate in the morning. George goes to the spot and vanishes, and Mary calls the police. The two officers walk to the place and also disappear in the sand. Out of the blue, George returns to his home emotionless and acting in a strange way, and David notes a cut on his back neck. Sooner David learns that the aliens are somehow controlling earthlings and he goes to the precinct to tell to the chief of police that is also under control of the invaders. When Dr. Pat Blake (Helena Carter) interviews the boy in a cell, she concludes that he is scared and telling the truth. She brings David to visit her fianc, the renowned scientist Dr. Stuart Kelston (Arthur Franz) that calls Colonel Fielding (Morris Ankrum) and the military activates a defense plan against the invaders from Mars. "Invaders from Mars" is a flawed and lame cult-movie visibly inspired in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1951) that also became the source of inspiration of masterpiece "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956). In times of Cold War, "Invaders from Mars" is not pacifist like the foregoing 1951 film, but has the clear intention to demonstrate the North-American bellicose military power against aliens and saboteurs that threatens the American Dream represented by the McLean family. The alien abductions and brain implants are frequent theme of sci-fi movies and "X-Files" is the most famous recent example. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Invasores de Marte" ("Invaders from Mars")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one scared the hell out of me when I first saw it as a kid; I remember them showing it in the evening on BBC2 back in the 1980s. Looks like a lot of other reviewers were similarly traumatised. Watching it now, as an adult, it's easy to laugh at what is a shoddy, low budget production. Scenes are repeated, special effects are wobbly to say the least, the aliens are silly rather than menacing, and the paucity of the production is apparent in every respect.And yet...there's something oddly menacing about this film. It's partly the Cold War paranoia-inspired plot about nice, ordinary people being taken over by a sinister foreign menace. Interestingly, this is the earliest version I've seen on that theme, predating INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS by a couple of years. The paranoia is cloying and really raises the hackles, even as an adult, and even allowing for the cheesy over-acting of the child star.The more overt aspects of the story, which take place towards the climax, are also profound, and in this case the imaginative nature of the production outweighs the budgetary constraints. That alien leader, little more than a head in a goldfish bowl, is oddly disturbing and an image that's stayed with me for my whole life. It's easy to forgive the problems in a film like INVADERS FROM MARS when it contains such classic, timeless material and I do think this is one of those '50s-era B-movie alien invasion classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big influence on Spielberg. Visually, it's the Vertigo of silly B movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Invaders From Mars" offers a now iconic plot: a young kid goes to bed and "wakes" up in a nightmarish world in which every authority figure, possibly including his parents, may or may not be an extraterrestrial with sinister intentions. The film is famously framed by sequences in which the kid lies in a bed, the audience uncertain as to whether the film it has just watched has been the child's nightmare, a premonition of some future invasion, a manifestation of the kid's unconscious fears, or "reality"."Invaders From Mars" may be just a raging B movie, but ignore its over-use of stock-footage and its conventional "military vs the aliens" cop out ending (it's funny how little has changed between this film and modern invasion fare like "War of the Worlds" and "Independece Day") and the film has aged fairly well. Considered by many to be a classic of 1950s alien invasion cinema, it belongs to that sub-genre of alien invader films that dealt with alien infiltration and duplication. These are films that brought the more outward aspects of alien invasion into a more paranoid psychological space (some became allegories for McCarthyism and communist witch-hunts). Others among this genre include "It Came from Outer Space", "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", "The Enemy from Space", "The Thing", "The Brain Eaters" and "I Married a Monster from Outer Space". Mostly, though, "Invaders From Mars" benefits from a truly unique visual look. William Menzies, one of Hollywood's greatest art designers, spent a great deal of time creating a vivid colour palette and several surreal sets, all of which lend his film a creepy, stylised look.Modern viewers, however, will perhaps find "Invaders From Mars" noteworthy for inspiring the surreal sets that pop up at the end of Spielberg's "War of the Worlds". Spielberg's ominous hills, crooked wooden fences, rotten barnyards, tractors and blood red Martian soil are all visual signposts borrowed from director William Menzies' influential scifi film. "Invaders" also started a trope now common in most Mars movies. From Spielberg's "War of the Worlds" (the film is framed as Tom Cruise's nightmare, the alien invasion a manifestation of our hero's fear of his own kids - whose names appear on a TV as he sleeps - thereby mimicking "Invader's From Mars'" fear-of-parents meta-plot) to "Mars Needs Moms" (a kid's animosity towards his parents literally has them kidnapped by martians), an inordinate amount of Mars movies use the red planet as a kind of psycho-domestic inkblot test.8/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perspective is everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of the user comment folks, I grew up with this film, and thus have always had a fondness in my science fiction heart for it. It's totally right-on as a child's nightmare (forced perspective, huge sets, adults seen as stereotypes, horror) which makes me think William Cameron Menzies really knew how to make his tiny budget stretch and become an engrossing children's fantasy. Many other filmmakers (Tim Burton, et al) have duplicated Menzies' sense of wonder in consruction of sets. I don't know if it ever was released in 3D, but I'm assuming it was. - everything seemed designed for that process.Nothing awful in the film (in adult eyes, such as the zippered monster costumes)matter at all next to the truly incredible sets, the grand Mars "master" in it's globe (actully a woman playing the surreal head), and the still gruesome (by suggestion) shots of the Mars crystal bored into the back of necks to make adults willing slaves while more and more folks are captured in sand-dunes opening up beneath them.... well, whew! It's an supurb rendition of a kid's most terrible sweat dream.Tobe Hooper's version touches on none of this - why, I don't know - and is a very, very bad "remake".

		<shortDescription>Tense and haunting throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILER IN THIS COMMENT)A haunting feeling grips me every time I see this film. The alien threat is vividly brought home via the etheral choir background music. The point where the protagonists approach the end of the picket fence where a hole in the sand waits for them is the stuff my childhood nightmares. Although cheaply made in parts (some of the troop scenes were, I believe, taken from wartime footage), the overall effect never loses its tension. The Cold War theme predominates with characters being 'brainwashed' by having electronic devices inserted in the back of their necks through which the martians control them. Their change in character is apparent to others, especially the boy. This is reminiscent of The Manchurian Candidate and Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, where, as in Invaders.., the are used as agents to be sent on sabotage and espionage missions.The arrival of the army to put things right - which they do - always leaves me with a great sense of relief and well-being.

		<fullReview>Overall, this film catches every kid's dream of being the one to save the day from the evil (aliens, Russians, whatever... fill in the blank) and have adults genuinely pay attention to them.It also manages to capture the essence of childhood insecurity (why do you think kids flip out when their mom's leave for 2 seconds?). All of this is so weird, because this film is so ridiculously cheesey and bad (but in a good way). I have always loved this movie, for different reasons, and at different times of my life (I first saw it on the Creature Double Feature when I was a wee lad). I think that it is a great film for kids and tolerable for all but the most dour adults. I would rather have my kid (well, if I had one) watching this, than watching most of the c**p on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From some other reviews..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.. I sometimes wonder why these people watch films.It's NOT just nostalgia, the plotline and writing, along with the relatively understated acting, separate this film from the typical horror-schlock of the 50's. Seeing it on AMC didnt just bring back memories, it made me reappreciate the film's undercurrents and tensions. Compared to it, the remake is in the class of a community cable program.Jimmy Hunt was one of the best child actors ever and it's only the cycle of film styles (folks were still burnt out on kid stars from the late 30's) that kept his talent from being appreciated.The studio pressure to cut production costs is evident in the dichotomy between the quality of the direction and the set and effects.I read a lot as a kid and I certainly understood effects of budget on production values and the studio system so the scenery didnt bother me.. after all, how many stage plays use realistic backdrops and effects? Yet we often applaud a good play for its content and drama.If you have a hard time relating because of the effects and scenery, pretend this is a long "Twilight Zone" or a filmed stage production.Bottom line: This is probably the best, if not ONLY, science fiction based psychodrama of the 50's that's comparable in impact to "The Bad Seed". In fact, you might consider it the complement of that lauded film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was SCARED!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was ten years old, and I was terrified. Actually, it's not quite correct to say that I "saw" it, because I had my eyes closed through a great deal of it. I couldn't sleep for weeks after (almost) watching it. For decades thereafter, whenever I got into a conversation about science fiction movies, I would cite it -- usually to people who'd never heard of it.Then came the '86 remake and the rediscovery of the original. Of course, the special effects had lost their power by that time, but the movie was STILL scary. From my adult perspective, I was able to understand the McCarthy-esque paranoia of that era. I remember hearing on the radio in late '54 about the censure, but that didn't make much of an impression at the time -- I really didn't conceptualize censure any better than I did Communism.While I'm sure that this movie doesn't appear on ANY "top 10" list anywhere, it was thoughtful and decently made, and it will always hold a nostalgic place in my heart as a reminder of a milieu that I have only come to understand in retrospect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 10/10 rating presupposes that you've decided that you like this movie even before you've seen it. For the most part, "Invaders from Mars" seems like another '50s B-movie about aliens trying to take over earth. But it does have a certain charm to it, with the part about what the Martians seek. A previous reviewer said that you have to have lived through the '50s to really appreciate these kinds of movies.* Methinks that we can still appreciate them in the 21st century, just because of how corny they are.Anyway, this is a must for fans of '50s sci-fi flicks. The 1986 remake was also quite well done. I wish that there could be a '50s sci-fi flick festival someday.*I guess that part of that is that it was the era when so many movies were the "family fun" released by Disney. Nowadays, most of us agree that they were about as fun as a root canal. The point is, movies like "Invaders from Mars" were always a great, enjoyable alternative. So if absolutely nothing else, the Cold War enabled the existence of these sorts of movies, with their neat - if ridiculous - special effects, and hot babes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the Choir Sings Look Out For Sink Holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another 50's Science Fiction classic. The U.F.O. craze was hitting the nation with mass sightings of Space ships and aliens visiting our countryside. Which leads us to this tale of visitors from another planet. Boy looks out of his bedroom window and sees an object crash into the grounds behind the wooden fence. David played by Jimmy Hunt tells his Dad, (Lief Erickson) to take a look out back . Dad goes out but doesn't return till morning. Jimmy's Dad Has a stark, cold demeanor as he says that he didn't find anything out there. Jimmy's Mom played by Hillary Brooke from the Abbott and Costello Show was also surprised by the changed personality of her spouse.Husband takes Wife off to the area out back and drops her in the sand pit with a chorus of singers. Jimmy notices that his parents are not the same as he also notices a mark in the back of their necks. Jimmy also has a run in with the law as the police chief also fell in to the pit and has a mark on his neck as well.Even little red head Kathy Wilson fell in the hole and came out an arsonist. Apparently these marked individuals are being controlled by a higher intelligent life form. Jimmy's cry's for help leads him to the observatory where he briefly meets Barbara Billingsly from (Leave it To Beaver)who plays Dr. Kelston's (Arthur Franz) secretary. Jimmy also be-friends Dr. Pat Blake child shrink with a strong British accent (Helena Carter) our leading lady. So much for introductions, The fact is these people with the marked necks are reeking havoc on the community and must be stopped and the source of the problem is in Jimmy's Backyard. Call in the Army and why not? Here's where the film goes south. TOO MUCH STOCK FOOTAGE and that annoying Army tune which would have John Philip Sousa rolling over in his grave entitled (Army Goes Rolling Along.)I was also intrigued by the Martian Leader in the fishbowl. To my amazement the actor was played by a woman. Movie could have been edited better and cropped down in time. The acting for the most part was adequate and those chorus of singers when the sand hole opens gets me every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars is a B film by director William Cameron Menzies the first Oscar winner for art direction.David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt) is a 12 year old kid interested in astronomy who sees a flying saucer landing in the sand pit outside his backyard. When his father, George (Leif Erickson) goes out to look he disappears. David's mom, Mary (Hillary Brooke) calls police, but who also submerge into the sand.Some time later the two cops and his father return, but they act differently like they are under a spell. David notices something in the back of their heads.David finally manages to find two people who believe him when others are sceptical and maybe under the influence of an alien entity which by now also includes his mother.Dr Blake (Helena Carter) and Dr Kelston (Arthur Franz) think there is something in David's story and call in the military who discover a Martian spaceship who are controlling people who they think are important or useful.The film taps into the reds under the beds scare of the 1950s and the supposed flying saucer sightings of the era as well. Films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers dealt with the material in a more thrilling and cerebral way.Invaders from Mars views this from a child's perspective. Something unusual is happening outside of the house, his parents have been taken over and there is no one else seemingly to turn to or trust.Some of the visual effects reminded me of the original Star Trek series which again shows the B movie origins of the film. A nice bit of hokum that probably played well in the 1950s than today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes an alien is just an alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the scariest movie I have ever seen. Perhaps that's because I saw it as a child, around the age of David. The movie is filmed from a child's point of view, and I certainly identified with it. As I watched it, I imagined what it would be like to be in David's shoes; as he was carried underground, I was carried underground. Judging from the reviews by others who saw it as a child, I am not alone. Even today, it creeps me out. But whether it would work seeing it for the first time as an adult is another story. Adults are perhaps too rational. Invaders from Mars works best when mainlined directly into the subconscious. A child still in touch with his fantasy world can do this, but can an adult? Look at the adult interpretations: It's a symbolic representation of the cold war, and the aliens are actually Communists taking over America. Having actually watched this during the Cold War in America, I can tell you this interpretation never once crossed my mind, as a child or adult. Sorry, the aliens were aliens, and the fear was of a clandestine alien invasion of Earth. This should come as no surprise to the well-informed, because there were numerous reports of UFOs in the press, complete with apparently authentic photos from the late Forties through the Fifties and Sixties. THAT is why people were afraid of UFOs, though they didn't talk much about it, and the government tried to pretend it was all an illusion of some sort or other. (It is convenient to dismiss the fear of aliens as actually a fear of Communism, though, who knows, perhaps these were Commie aliens. Or early incarnations of the Borg, which is the same thing. Resistance. Is. Futile.)Worse than that, there has been extensive discussion in recent decades of possible implants associated with nose bleeds during alien abductions, especially of children. Harvard professor John Mack, M.D., presented evidence of this, including X-ray films of implants being extracted by doctors, on a network television special in the 1990s. Actual implants were recovered and studied. So this film may have tapped into more than just some collective unconscious fear. I remember waking up with blood from a nosebleed on my pillow, and I have memories of vivid "dreams" of being abducted by aliens from my bedroom, yard, summer camp, and elsewhere. Sometimes these "dreams" left physical marks upon my body. No wonder this movie scared me so much -- and perhaps others. The cast, no offense to any still alive, is not exactly A list. But it works. So do the weird sets, the creation of the genius of William Cameron Menzies, the same Menzies of Gone With the Wind and Things to Come. Here Menzies is the director, rather than just the set designer, though presumably he did both. Spoiler alert:The brilliant move of the movie is the ending, when it turned out all that came before was a dream, but now the real nightmare was about to begin. So the surrealism of the odd perspective sets was the product of a child's subconscious dreams. But it was a dream triggered by a real fear of alien invasion that was on the minds of millions at the time, and perhaps ever since H.G. Well's War of the Worlds. For another take on aliens from a child's perspective, watch Steven Spielberg's series Taken, narrated by Dakota Fanning. The wonderful old Twilight Zone series also tapped into this vein many times, suggesting it was still a concern of people. Invaders from Mars could have been a Twilight Zone episode, and perhaps it was an inspiration and model for Rod Serling. &nbsp; &nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing About It Is Perfect And Yet It's The Perfect 1950S SF B Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early one morning young David MacLean is woken from his sleep by a noise outside . Looking out of his bedroom he sees a spaceship land in a field . Telling his parents his story is quickly dismissed as a nightmare . Very quickly however people who enter the field of the landing return with their personalities changed and it's clear that an alien invasion is under way Sometimes you watch a film that has you saying to yourself this is absolute rubbish and yet you find yourself enjoying it for some reason . INVADERS FROM MARS is a few steps up from being mere rubbish and yet you're very aware that nothing about it is very good . The budget is small and this translates to the mis en scene , the mutants are very silly and are actors in green jumpsuits etc and the film doesn't succeed in doing anything perfectly and yet it's probably the perfect science fiction B movie from the 1950s . Why should this be ? Director William Cameron Menzies directed HG Wells 1936 film THINGS TO COME , a film that showed great visual imagination even though Menzies had a problem realising it on screen , possibly down to over ambition . We see the same type of ambition and even though it never actually works one hundred per cent there is a strong imagination at play that makes for a highly stylized movie . " The sand choir " sound where the ground opens up is slightly laughable at first but the more it is used the more it starts to drill itself in to the audiences mind Menzies started out as production designer and he concentrates on the sets . It's interesting that the story is told through the eyes of a child and conscious of this Menzies builds his sets as to how they look to a child . Notice the way David enters the police station to talk to the police sergeant and walks through a massively long and wide corridor which is both minimalist and implausibly large which suits the world view of a child It's also the first film to use the cold war allegory . Yeah I know there's a subtext to THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD with the warning " watch the skies " but this is the first movie to state watch everyone around you because there's communist traitors in our midst . We're shown the American military leader stating that tanks are a great site in any other war but if you're fighting a cold war where the enemy are using invisible infiltration tactics then they're no good . The film is also good at showing the childhood angst that the world is full of adults and it does seem strange that once adults become communist slaves from the red planet they somehow become more oppressive adults ? Hmmm a somewhat reactionary view is it not ? . Of course scientists are the good guys and this is in keeping with 1950s Western world science fiction In summary INVADERS FROM MARS is on the surface a rather cheap and disposable film featuring a child protagonist but is not easily dismissed as being a children's film come B movie . Either by accident or design - and I'm probably being charitable by saying it's by design - - it is ironically one of the better movies from its era and even today remains a minor classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An altogether great example of 50's sci-fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very talented designer &amp; director William Cameron Menzies comes this paranoia- fuelled alien invasion story, as seen through the eyes of a child. That child is David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt), who one night witnesses a flying saucer landing in the field behind his house. As people go to the field to investigate, they return as clearly changed individuals; the invading Martians are enslaving these people and forcing them to do dastardly things. Fortunately, it's not long before the local military is convinced that young David speaks the truth, and they're determined to kick some evil Martian ass. With this movie that is very much a product of its era, with the theme of lack of trust in one's fellow man, Menzies and screenwriter Richard Blake deserve credit for maintaining a fairly dark tone - there's some sense of hope, but there are still no guarantees of everything turning out all right. The moment when David's own father, George (Leif Erickson) gives him a GOOD slap is particularly upsetting and effective. Menzies's way with visuals helps to make "Invaders from Mars" a pleasure to look at (it's fairly colourful for its time), and there are images here - the funnels sucking humans to their doom, the Martian Intelligence (Luce Potter), the lumbering mutants (pronounced mu-"TAHNTS" in this instance), the look of the field as seen from David's window, etc. Tobe Hooper and company were wise to use them again, or pay homage to them, when doing their remake of 33 years later. Raoul Kraushaar's music is both thunderous and sinister. Moreover, a roster of highly capable actors fill out lead and supporting roles well: Helena Carter and Arthur Franz as the kindly, helpful psychiatrist &amp; scientist (with Franz doubling as the narrator), Erickson and Hillary Brooke as the parents, and Morris Ankrum, Max Wagner and William Phipps as the key military personnel, with Barbara Billingsley, Peter Brocco, Richard Deacon, John Eldredge, Bert Freed, Todd Karns, Lock Martin, Walter Sande, and Robert Shayne in small roles. Hunt is engaging in one of his final gigs as a child actor; he would return to the profession after a 30 plus year absence as the police chief in the remake. It's got a lot of exposition to swallow, but it's all delivered breathlessly and Menzies does keep the action going and the pacing efficient. But what really makes the movie this affecting is the way it takes that child's eye point of view, extending to the way adults sometimes seem to just loom over David; the world can be a scary enough place for a kid, never mind whether there is an alien invasion underway or not. It's one of the all-time classics, retaining its appeal almost 60 years later, and comes highly recommended. Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scared the hell out of me when I was eight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this age of CGI Special effects, where real live dinosaurs leap out of the screen at you, this movie is a testament to how Hollywood can do a lot with a little. And it is a psychologically astute story that speaks to the deepest fears of children, that their world might be undone and they will be powerless to do anything about the threat, that their fate depends on the help and intervention of adults but the adults may not always be counted upon to give aid.A ten year old boy witnesses a landing of an alien craft at a sandpit right near his home. People are sucked into the pit only to reappear altered and under the control of aliens. No one believes him. Then his parents become slaves of the aliens and try to silence him by implanting the dread controller into HIM! The police and other authorities are sucked into the vortex of alien control. Only two adults believe him, and are finally able to get the army mobilized against the Martian invaders.In the end all is revealed to be a bad dream, but as he gazes out his window his nightmare begins to unfold again in reality.Ignore the visible zippers on the alien's costumes and focus instead on the dread horror of the story. The reality of the story overcomes the unreality of the costumes and effects. This is classic horror - Sci-fi at it's best. The clunky effects actually make this original version better than the 1986 remake, whose storyline is remarkably faithful to the original but lacks the special qualities that make the original classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie of halves AND there are two different versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars: Half 1 (William Cameron Menzies, 1953) What a nice film to look at. Wonderfully weird eye-popping colors that scream "THINGS ARE OFF AROUND HERE!" (bottom line: Supercinecolor rocks) and extremely sparse but exaggerated set design that give off a nightmarish vibe. They even use mate paintings of the sky full of frozen clouds throughout the picture. Oh, the confidence they had! A world within a confined space, it looks so nice.Then there's the plot. Aliens land on earth and take control of the minds of people who are around little Timmy. Timmy immediately sees what's going on but nobody believes him. It's such a nice allegory for the communism craze at that time. They are among us, they look like us, they behave strange which you may notice or not, but they certainly have nothing good on their minds and they are going to kill you or at least they are trying to set up a new world order. They take good, innocent Americans and turn them into brainwashed puppets who share their dangerous beliefs. Time for the USA to act. Aggressively! Violently! Inconsiderately! Aliens = Communists. But it makes sense both ways. Brilliant. Unfortunately the movie lacks an ending.7/10 Invaders from Mars: Half 2 (William Cameron Menzies, 1953) 'Invaders from Mars: Half 2' is a typical monster movie about shooting monsters, running away from monsters, monsters killing people, and eventually defeating the monster. There are a few nice visuals and sets to look at. The aliens are tall men put into furry green costumes, wearing goggles on their green painted faces et voil, we have an alien. Have you seen 'Earth Girls are Easy'? That's basically how they look like. And they move just as ridiculously, too. Luckily the U.S. military has a long magic stick with which they can locate Jeff Goldblums, Jim Carreys and Damon Wayans who visit earth.But nothing will prepare you for this ending. If you don't want to have it spoiled look away now. We get a montage of anything that happened before in the Invaders from Mars "franchise" while little Timmy is running and running and running with his blue, terrified face sticking in the camera lens. At the end part of the footage is played backwards. Then stuff explodes and little Timmy wakes up. That's right, it was all just a dream. And I mean everything. Funny thing is, though, that when he later wakes up again at the exact same time as in the beginning of the movie the exact same thing happens again. He sees a UFO landing near the house. And what does little Timmy do? Why, he does the exact same thing he did before, of course. He says: "Gee wiz." And then the movie ends. Yeah, take that cake you just ate and eat it again.3/10 That was the U.S. version. The UK version adds an (anti-)scientific discourse in the first half about our universe, life on other planets, and UFO sightings. The pointless ending montage got cut and it was not a dream. Instead we get reshot footage that doesn't fit into the rest of the film (the same goes for the scientific discourse) of people running away from the oncoming explosions. Out of focus footage and stock footage. But my favorite is the shot of a fake tree falling over behind the actors and apparently landing on the mountain decoration. The only thing that was missing is that the mountains are moving because of the tree landing on them.4/10 Overall I give this whole affair 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gave me nightmares when I was a kid, no other movie has had such impact. I can't remember how old I was exactly, but I'm guessing around the age of the boy in this movie. I've wanted to see this again for years and now managed to finally catch it.It's now easy to see why it was so scary. If you are a young boy and you're parents change to violent and emotionally strange, it's definitely nightmarish. (As a social sidenote, this is a very good portrayal how kids might feel when their parents get drunk). There is also the fact that the boy doesn't know if his parents will ever get out of it it or if they're lost for good.Other than the fact that this movie is told from a childs point of view, there are many other very powerful images. I was totally blown away how eerie and weird most of the images actually were. The set designs are surreal, especially the police station. Proportions are completely out of ordinary, like a childs view again. Most shots are also framed very tight, creating a very claustrophobic feel.I didn't remember the movie was shot in color and this too gives to the atmosphere. I read that the reels were found decaying somewhere, so I'm not sure how original the images and colors were, but some of the colors (think of the melting pink bubbly walls) were really odd.Even tho I'm now much older, it's gonna take some time for me to shake off the image of the eyeballing head alien in a bowl. How bizarre was that?The movie is not without flaws, but it's definitely one of the greatest horrors ever made and has some insanely creative art direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bright young boy, David(Jimmy Hunt), so interested in astronomy he awakens himself early enough to see planets clearly through his telescope, sees an alien ship bury itself underground. Those who go near it's resting place are captured by a sandpit(..the ship's hatch) which, accompanied by a humming chorus, sucks them inside the ship. Those captured are immobilized with a device attached to their skull, the aliens able to mind control them. Little David must find someone to believe him or else the aliens will soon gain control of the whole city, and perhaps eventually Earth.You know INVADERS FROM MARS was a nice surprise. I am aware of the Tobe Hooper version, which I thought was okay, but never had a chance to see the original until now. I think what makes this movie work so well is that the protagonist who saves the day is the child..it's seen through David's perspective, and he contributes plenty to the discovery and potential defeat of the martian invaders. I think, as you might have read elsewhere from more established writers than myself, the fear of losing your parents is also successfully tapped into, and the idea of a child being right there within the action certainly adds a unique spin to this sci-fi effort. Like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS(..which this film came before), INVADERS OF MARS has been often imitated and obviously inspired filmmakers since it's release, touching on the potent theme of "body invasion", human beings controlled against their will, unable to suppress the threat responsible for their capture.Fine cast includes Helena Carter as Dr. Pat Blake, who believes David could be telling the truth regarding the alien threat as certain locals, whose bodies had been taken over, wind up missing(..they are part of a plot to destroy a specific rocket with atomic power to protect the Earth against potential alien invasion from other planets), and Arthur Franz as astronomer Dr. Kelston(..a mentor to young David who knows he's not one taken to "flights of fancy"). Leif Erickson and Hillary Brooke are David's parents, whose house is right near where the alien ship landed. Morris Ankrum is Col Fielding, the military head who leads the charge on the offensive against the martian enemy.Yes, this is one of those sci-fi B-movies that features "men in green rubber suits"(..the Martian leader has a silver face with an enlarged head and little tentacles on both sides, living within a bulb it's followers carry around to safety) , but I was rather pleasantly surprised at how well orchestrated the final race through underground tunnels was as our heroes race against time to escape to safety as a detonator is on the verge of exploding. I think the color actually benefits this movie(..I often prefer these movies in noirish B&amp;W photography where the mood is enhanced)and, despite just how limited William Cameron Menzies was in budget, the director(..I felt) is able to effectively convey the terror of the plot regarding a serious threat to mankind. The stock military footage used is rather impressively interspersed within the film as the troops are called in to destroy the space ship as the aliens use a type of canon which melts and explodes rock to move underground. It's amazing this film turned out as good as it does once you read about it's tumultuous production.SPOILER:Known for it's famous double-ending which has been copied to death throughout the decades since where a nightmare repeats itself, and a person's worst fear is realized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young David MacLean is awakened during a thunderstorm one night and sees strange lights and a flying saucer land in a sandpit near his home. The next morning his father goes to investigate and returns different-sullen, easy to anger and no longer the loving father he was. When others in town begin to be changed as well, David seeks the help of his mentor, an astronomer, and together, along with a kindly doctor, they investigate the phenomenon and soon discover the townspeople are under the influence of evil alien invaders. Or are they? Invaders from Mars is filmed from the perspective of the boy, David, which makes it unusual and different from most science fiction films. The sets, as mentioned by other reviewers here, are larger than expected, as they might be perceived by a child. This gives the film an interesting look.Some might say the dialog is a bit corny and dated, and perhaps so, but not so much that it distracts the modern viewer and it is all certainly appropriate for the film. And there it is a low budget film with fairly cheap production values with at times fairly laughable special effects.So what? It's a fun movie that does an excellent job of presenting a child's fears in an entertaining and thought provoking manner. The ending, criticized by some, was, in my opinion, perfect and fit in beautifully with the rest of the film.Great movie. Fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewed through the lens of a child's inherent helplessness and powerlessness in the face of forces beyond his control, IFM -is- a bad dream come true.It's 1953. Joe McCarthy, the "Red Scare," and the House Un-American Activities Committee. The West is worn out from war, but the Commies have taken Russia and shoved the West out of China... and the Russians have The Bomb. America is full of young fathers back from the Sands of Iwo Jima, Salerno and Normandie. They are confused, bitter, haunted. They don't make the most patient or understanding of parents. Mom pulled parts in a defense plant and worried for three years if she'd ever see dad again. Then he (or Uncle Billy) went off to Korea. Unstoppable waves of Chicom -invaders-. MacArthur's nuclear solution. Newspapers and magazines full of flying saucers. Early morning TV full of fireballs and mushroom clouds in the desert north of Las Vegas. Teachers suddenly shouting, "DROP!" You had to be a child then to understand.I didn't see IFM until I was in junior high in '57. They showed it over five days in the auditorium at lunch time. By Thursday, the thousand-seat room was packed. Some laughed at the gooney Martians, but I saw haunted faces nervously walking to their next class and sitting there wall-eyed. I dreamed of those -eyes-, of parents with holes in their necks, of slowly turning drills. My parents had slapped me around pretty good, too. (Didn't -everyone's- in those days?) Woke up to the same old same old every morning.Battle, Blake and Menzies seemed to know the mind of the mid-century child: what that mind thought and felt, and how to resonate with it. The organizing principle was simply the average eight-year-old's nightmare in '53. Moving beyond what Robert Wise did in "The Day the Earth Stood Still," Menzies used the child as the sense of perspective. We see the story through -his- eyes, not those of scientists of the military men. IFM wasn't made to make the sort of political statement Wise intended; Menzies seems to have been out to make a film -children- could relate to. In that, he made a film few who saw as children will ever be able to forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall going to bed after watching this movie as a child and spending much of the night staring nervously out of my window. I'm sure my heart rate became elevated whenever I approached a sandpit for some time afterward. I dreaded encountering a seven-foot subterranean lumbering mutant and searched facial expressions for giveaway clues of contamination. Fifty-odd years later I could still clearly visualise images from this movie before watching it again on late-night cable. A cynical eye now targets the shortcomings and budget limitations that escaped me the first time around. But nothing can wash away the lasting effect of a powerful story on an impressionable and awestruck boy. I'm thankful I had the opportunity to experience this as a child.

		<shortDescription>Plucky Kid Must Save His Town From Alien Menace Fifties Sci-Fi Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One night, twelve-year-old David MacLean sees a spaceship land at the back of his house but it conceals itself underground. When David's Dad goes to investigate the site, he returns as a bad-tempered, suspicious, changed man, as do two cops who follow him out there. David is convinced aliens are taking over, but can he make anyone believe him ?This movie probably doesn't deserve the rating I've given it - it's pretty cheaply made, with lots of army stock footage and the same shots recycled several times (the Mutants in the tunnels, for example), some of the performances and a lot of the dialogue are a bit ropey, and it can occasionally seem more like a stuffy documentary than a feature film - there's a long scene where a scientist with a sweater and a pipe matter-of-factly analyses UFO sightings of the previous six years. Despite all this, I find it very charming. It's an almost dream-like fable from a more innocent age, and both the story and the visuals are designed from a child's point of view. It's doesn't seem real, but it's not supposed to; a boy's fantasy of space invaders, his parents turned into monsters, his town taken over and him helping the army fight the terrible menace with tanks, searchlights and rayguns. I love the way John Seitz' garish colour photography and Menzies' highly stylised designs contribute to this, with oversize doors, menacing adults, empty spaces and tons of black, red and green. The cast are a bit wooden; Hunt is okay but has to carry pretty much the whole story (a tall order), but Brooke and Ankrum are both fine B-movie stalwarts. This is by no means the best fifties science-fiction film, but it is a minor classic and for me it represents beautifully what the fantasy boom of that era was all about. Don't miss Tobe Hooper's brilliant but little-seen 1986 big-budget remake, which is just as surreal and suspenseful but has a better everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, here's the skinny. The Mutant effects was kind of lame. Could have been much better. But I write that off because it's 1953. The story about a child is the only one who knows about a secret alien invasion from Mars is cool. The head in the bubble that works. That works allot. One of the best effects in the movie. Slower then other movies of the time. But it's interesting enough to keep watching it.Here's something interesting, if you've seen the American version of this movie, then you must see the British version. The ending is completely different. Without giving it away, it's way different then I expected. Both versions are on the DVD. I give INVADERS FROM MARS...8 STARS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howdy. I was wondering if anybody else had noticed this interesting scene from the remake of Invaders. Remember the head martian in the first movie? It was a face in a glass ball with tentacles. Well in the remake there is a scene where a couple of police officers were scearching the basement of a High School. As their flashlights searched the room, they flash across a table with stuff on it. Among the stuff is a glass ball with the same face with tentacles from the first movie. I have always wondered if it was done on purpose to see if anyone would noitce.I would like to ask somebody involved in the production, but I can't even find out what studio made the movies. I even went as far as to rent both movies at the same time to see if I was mistaken. Can Anyone shed any light on the matter? Any reply will be welcomed. Thanks. Mikey</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invaders From Mars is directed by William Cameron Menzies, based from an idea by Richard Blake and adapted to story treatment by John Tucker Battle. It stars Jimmy Hunt, Helena Carter, Arthur Franz, Morris Ankrum &amp; Leif Erickson. Plot revolves around a 12 year old boy called David (Hunt), who one night witnesses a flying saucer land just beyond the hills he views from his bedroom window. Tho convinced by what he saw, David has a hard time getting anyone to believe him, more worrying is that his parents and some people in the town are suddenly starting to act queer.It's cheap sci-fi but with a whole lot of love and guts thrown into the mix. Invaders From Mars has a big reputation as a sci-fi classic, one that now is almost impossible to live up to. It's also one of the most divisive of the 1950s sci-fi schlockers. Depending on what side of the fence you sit with it, it's either a kiddie friendly piece of tack, with penny pinching noticeable in every frame-or it's a cunningly clever piece of story telling observing Cold War paranoia, rich in symbolism and maybe even daring to hint at child abuse in its narrative. Yeah it's divisive alright.Truth is is that it's obviously up to the viewer to make their own mind up about it. Viewing without nostalgia, tho understandably hard to do for many, helps to get a more honest perspective; both technically and thematically. Maybe the film is all of the things that have been put forward? Imagine that, that would make it low budget genius. What isn't up for debate is the influence of the film. On the sci-fi alien invasion scale it's pretty low in execution, but many far better film's, such as Invasion Of The Body Snatchers 3 years later, owes Menzies' piece a great debt.You buy your ticket you take a chance, and without an alien probe inserted in your neck you should have a clear thought process to work from. Me? I'm like Switzerland staying neutral, I own and enjoy the film but can often be found cringing after nodding in approval. Go figure. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm talking about the DVD. If you select Original U.S. release option, that's a bold face lie. I remember the original and that isn't it. The biggest complaint of people who see William Cameron Menzie's masterpiece is of the repeat scenes and stock footage. That cr*p was not there in 1953. I recently saw IFM on TCM and thought, "Did I forget what schlock there was in this movie?" But then the savvy host wised me up. The copyright went up for sale and the new owner thought the movie too esoteric and needed more tanks. So stock footage was dropped in of loading tanks (to the tune of "Caissons" no less) and tanks running to the rescue. During the repeated scenes and the stock footage even the music is different. William Cameron Menzie's stark design and tight storytelling has remained with me as a designer and writer all these years. The new owner of the film should be shot for reediting a sci fi classic and destroying it. The only way to enjoy this movie the way it was in '53 is to buy the DVD, copy it on VHS deleting the tank scenes, and then return the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invaders from Mars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years I have made an effort to find and watch classic films that evoke the time period in which they were made, this is a very good example of one such film, directed by William Cameron Menzies (Things to Come). Basically one night young David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt) is awakened by a thunderstorm, then a strange light appears, from his bedroom window he sees a large flying saucer descend and disappear into the sandpit area behind the house. His scientist father George (Leif Erickson) knows that his son is not the sort of child to make up things, so he investigates, when he returns the next morning David notices a strange red puncture on the back of his neck, and his father behaves cold and hostile. David soon realises that something is wrong, he notices certain townspeople with the same mark on the back of their neck and acting the same sort of way, then he witnesses his child neighbour Kathy Wilson (Janine Perreau) disappearing underground walking in the sandpit, she later returns with hardly any emotion at all. David flees to the police station for help, he is placed under the protection of health-department physician Dr. Pat Blake (Helena Carter), who slowly begins to believe his crazy story, and taking David to local astronomer Dr. Stuart Kelston (Arthur Franz), he confirms with the boy and Dr. Blake that there is likely to be an upcoming invasion from the planet Mars. Dr. Kelston convinces the U.S. Army to investigate immediately, and soon enough the Pentagon assembles troops and tanks, command by Colonel Fielding (Morris Ankrum). David and Dr. Blake near the sandpit are suddenly sucked underground, two tall slit-eyed green humanoids have captured them, but Colonel Fielding and some troops find the entrance to the flying saucer. Inside they confront the Martian mastermind: a giant green head with a humanoid face atop a small, green partial torso with several green arm-tentacles, encased in a transparent sphere, it is served by tall, green, silent mutants. The human victims taken have been implanted with mind-control devices, they are attempting to sabotage an atomic rocket, if they are captured the devices implode and cause a fatal cerebral haemorrhage. Dr. Blake and David are rescued, Colonel Fielding and the troops open fire at the pursuing mutants, the army plant a timed explosive charges aboard the saucer. Following a large explosion, David wakes to find himself in his bed, just like at the beginning, his parents are back to normal, he returns to bed assured that he had a nightmare, but then he goes to the window and sees the same flying saucer from his dream descending into the sandpit, it is unclear what happens next. Also starring Hillary Brooke as Mrs. Mary MacLean, Max Wagner as Sergeant Rinaldi, Milburn Stone as Captain Roth, Walter Sande as Police Desk Sergeant Finlay, John Eldredge as Mr. Turner, Robert Shayne as Dr. Bill Wilson, Luce Potter as Martian Intelligence and It's a Wonderful Life's Todd Karns as Jim the Gas Station Attendant. Over the years this film has gained a cult status, its distorted and abstract surrealistic are the big reasons, you can maybe laugh now at the ridiculous of it, especially the low-budget special effects and costumes for the alien creatures, but in a way, that is part of the appeal, and it certainly plays on the paranoia that went on at the time, it could have been less chatty and have more alien stuff, but overall it is a relatively entertaining classic science-fiction thriller. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't go near the sand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars is directed by William Cameron Menzies, has a screenplay by Richard Blake and stars Jimmy Hunt,Arthur Franz, Helena Carter, Leif Erickson and Hillary Brooke.David MacLean(Jimmy Hunt)is awoken by a strange noise and light in the middle of the night. Looking out of his window he sees a flying saucer land near his house. He wakes up his dad(Leif Erickson)who goes and looks but doesn't come back. David's mum(Hillary Brooke)phones the police, two officers come and search and also go missing. The dad and the officers then return sometime later seemingly devoid of emotion and all bearing strange marks on the back of their necks. Later David's mother is also changed.David is convinced that aliens have done something to them and runs to the police begging them to get help. Nobody believes him except his friend the Astronomer Dr. Stuart Keltson(Arthur Franz)and Doctor Pat Blake(Helena Carter). This trio soon discover that aliens have indeed landed and must try and alert the authorities to try and stop them.This film has it's moments but too many weaknesses to make it one you'd want to watch again and again. The people controlled by aliens are very creepy(this altered behaviour precedes Invasion of the Body Snatchers by several years)and seeing the horror from the perspective of a child is quite interesting. The little girl who burns her house is very creepy(that scary smile of hers would make you run a mile in real life).There is nothing more frightening than knowing something to be true but nobody believes you and the film portrays that very well. Seeing the people being dragged beneath the sand to be altered is very creepy as it allows you to imagine all sorts of scary things. Unfortunately most of the acting is pretty bad, the seemingly endless army stock footage is unnecessary and the reveal of the alien base beneath the sand is a big disappointment, some things work better when unseen. This one has it's moments but could and should have been so much darker than it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sand Trap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a little mental work -- rearranging the schemata, tweaking the synapses -- before you can accept Leif Erickson as a smiling husband, father, and respectable scientist. Usually, he's on an airplane in jeopardy or some other tense situation. And he's the angry guy who stands in the aisle, blocking everyone, shouting orders in a loud voice, and demanding to know what's going on because he has an important business meeting and -- why is that engine on fire? Is he going to be late? Once over that hurdle, you can settle down to an old-fashioned science fiction movie that hides its low budget by the sparing use of special effects. There are no monsters flapping around in ugly rubber suits. People just disappear in the sand. It's like an extended episode of "The Twilight Zone." The story follows the general template of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," except that instead of pods there are tiny electronic devices planted in the base of the skull. The scientific dialog is risible. "We've attached the standard frame to a variable oscillator. That should do the trick." The rest of the characters are pretty much stereotyped. The first victim to get it in the neck is the loving father, Leif Erickson, and for the rest of the movie we can let our archetypes go back to where they belong. He turns into a nasty brute who slaps his kid around and snarls. Oh, by the way, you can always tell who's under alien control. They stare expressionlessly into the camera and never blink. And if they get in trouble, their heads explode.I'd like to recommend William Cameron Menzies, an intuitive genius in his own way, but this is awfully clumsy. The dialog, lacking any touch of originality to begin with, seems to be read aloud for the first time from cue cards off screen. "Your father and mother are at the hospital, Davey." "But." "They'll be all right." There is a palpable pause before and after "but." Lapses like that recur.We win the final underground battle but I don't know how. Too many suspense devices are stirred into the narrative -- the earthlings are trapped in tunnels while a time bomb is ticking away; tanks are shelling the hell out of an area unoccupied by aliens; crazed Martian slaves wrapped like mummies lumber this way and that; the Ultimate Humanity that runs the whole Geschft is a bronze disembodied head with the features of Idi Amin.The military defeats the Martians, which is rather an original touch. Usually the tanks are useless and some special device like a ray gun must be invented for the sole purpose of disabling and destroying the aliens and the junk they've brought with them. In movies of this caliber, nobody would ever dream of a solution like having the aliens undone by their lack of immunity to our germs.</fullReview>

That's when he spots a flying saucer land and borrow it's way underground not far from his home. At first not believed by his dad aeronautical engineer George MacLean, Leif Ericson, by him checking the landing site he himself disappears and later shows up at home acting as if he's been lobotomized! Soon a number of people in the area including David's mom Mary MacLean, Hillary Brooke, end up the same way like her now zombie like husband totally detached from reality as well as the human race.As the shocking truth comes to the surface it's a spaceship full of Martians lead by their leader, the guy with his head in a fishbowl, played by Luce Potter are planning to prevent the construction of a space ship that George MacLean is working on to be complete! They don't want anyone being able to travel to Mars like they can travel to the Earth and mess up their ecological system. It's the US Army that is summoned to stop the Martians before they can do any more damage.With Col. Fielding played by the "Eternal Colonel" himself Morris Ankum in charge to stop this invasion from Mars he unloads all the firepower he has at his disposal at the Martians who's underground hideout easily withstands. Taking the fight to the Martians to their own tuft in the underground hideout that they, with laser technology, made for themselves seems to backfire by Col. Feilding and his men not realizing how dangerous and unstable the Martians' laser ray machine is in the wrong hands: themselves! And with that Col. Fielding has set off a number of events that may well end up killing everyone within a 10 mile radius! ***SPOILERS*** There is a happy ending here but not one you would expect. Little David and his parents together with all the people in the movie who've been turned into brain numbed zombies are back to normal again but were not that sure that they'll stay that way. Like a repeating nightmare it, the movie, seems to go on forever but only for David who's the only one in the cast that's fully conscious of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Example of 1950s American propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie follows along the same theme as It Conquered the World. The aliens land and begin to kidnap people and implant devices in them to serve their evil purposes. Only a kid believes and all of the people he speaks to, those in authority, have been controlled. It is not until he speaks to the doctor that she believes him and things begin to happen.Basically the martians are concerned that the Earth is getting too aggressive, especially when they launch satellites that contain missiles that can destroy any target on the Earth. The martians feel threatened so they decide to act first and put an end to this project. They tunnel into the sand and begin taking people in authority and implanting them so that they might stop the work on the rockets.This has two angles, that of the invisible communist takeover, and this movie was made in 1953 during the second HUAC hearings in Hollywood, and also a reaction to increased military spending and weapon development. The martians are threatened by the Earth's ability to launch rockets into space, and this is a feeling that is of concern to us, as it intensifies the cold war and brings the threat of nuclear war ever closer. Launching satellites to fire missiles intensifies the arms race and this is what the movie is drawing out.It more deals with the enemy's reaction to this arms race. They are not saying it is evil, and do not make a moral stance at the end. Instead we have the invisible enemy trying to undermine this. The enemy takes the form of aliens, though it is communism that it is replicating. The enemy uses converted people to perform its operations outside of its land, thus increasing the paranoia. We don't know who is a friend or an enemy, it could be anybody.In the spaceship we see the enemy. It is a head that controls automatons. This possibly also represents communism as everybody in such a nation has no free will. The head is that which rules (Josef Stalin) and everybody else is just his implements. There is not culture, nor free thought within such a state.Invaders from Mars is a fun little movie. As my house mate says, it gets straight into the action and does not bandy around, as many movies seem to do now. Still, it is a little long towards the end, but it is a great example of subtle anti-communist movies.</fullReview>

A movie title appears, punctuated by a sudden stab of dramatic music: INVADERS FROM MARS. Slow move in to extreme close up of Poe426 as the movie plays; his eyes widen. Montage: a spaceship, barely glimpsed behind a row of trees, lands on a hilltop behind a house; the boy who lives in the house sees the ship, tells his parents; his father goes to investigate, comes back acting strangely. Poe426 watches, rapt. Finally, the end credits run. Poe 426 gets up, turns the TV off, and goes slowly to his bedroom. Bedroom, int.- night. Poe426 goes to the window, sees lightning flash, hears thunder rumble. He looks toward the hill behind his house and sees a flash of light. Or does he...? INVADERS FROM MARS holds up for the most part, despite some overuse of stock footage of tanks doing target practice. There's the kind of paranoia all kids can appreciate (the mistrust of adults), some sound (and some not so sound) special effects and costumes, and (for kids especially) some nerve-wracking performances.

		<shortDescription>Great early sci-fi reflecting the U.S.'s fear of Communism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been well documented that 1950's science fiction was a reflection of the fears of Communist infiltration of the American way: political difference was something (and still is) that creates gung-ho attitudes towards outside elements - something that the USofA is incapable of accepting, just look at the travesty of the Vietnam war. Invaders from Mars is no different to this trend of political allegory - and was also another way for film makers to make statements about the country that they were living in; through the use of allegory, and using the very visually stunning and populist genre of science fiction.Young David MacLean (generic 1950's freckly kid, Jimmy Hunt), witnesses what he believes to be a flying saucer land underground at the back of his home. On reporting this to his father, George (Leif Erickson) he decides to investigate the area. What transpires is that people are being sucked into a hole in the sand, and implanted with mind control devices. So, the minds of the local population slowly become slaves to the "martian" ideals, and a bid to stop the production of the atom bomb, which is being developed in the local area. David, being of sound scientific processes, notices the difference in behaviour in his parents, and tries to warn the townsfolk. The nuclear family is destroyed by the alien infiltration, which is precisely what the American people/government believed would occur if Communist ideologies were to get to the American people.William Cameron Menzies was a production/art director on such classics as Gone with the Wind (1939), and also had uncredited director duties on The Thief of Bagdad (1940), and Duel in the Sun (1946). His eye for detail within the frame is highly evident in this classic of '50's sci- fi. Considering this was a B-movie, that had an incredibly low budget, the visuals of the film, whilst often simple, are absolutely triumphant. OK, so the "martian" silly green furry costumes are laughable, but this does not hinder the enjoyment of the piece, and I hold it in high regard, along with other classics of the decade, such as The War of the Worlds (1953), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nifty 50's sci-fi alien invasion classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young boy David MacLean (a solid and engaging performance by Jimmy Hunt) witnesses a flying saucer landing in the field behind his house. David finds out that a band of nefarious Martians plan on invading our planet, but can he convince everyone around him that something is amiss before it's too late? Director William Cameron Menzies, working from a tight and engrossing script by Richard Blake, brings a really stylish and imaginative visual flair to the standard, yet effective and enjoyable premise which in turn gives this picture a supremely surreal and creepy nightmarish atmosphere (in an especially masterful stroke, the bulk of the plot is told from David's point of view). Moreover, Menzies astutely nails the pervasive paranoia of the Cold War era, relates the narrative at a constant brisk pace, and stages the exciting climax in the Martians' underground lair with tremendous rip-roaring aplomb. The sound acting from the capable cast rates as another major plus, with stand-out work by Arthur Franz as quick-witted astronomer Dr. Stuart Kelston, Helena Carter as the sweet Dr. Pat Blake, Leif Erickson and Hilary Brooke as David's possessed parents, and always reliable veteran character actor Morris Ankrum as the rugged Colonel Fielding. John F. Sietz's sharp cinematography makes bold use of vibrant color and boasts plenty of cool askew camera angles. Raoul Kraushaar's robust score hits the rousing spot. The eerie sandpit choir chant, obvious stage-bound sets, and rough special effects enhance rather than detract from this movie's overall spooky and unnerving strangeness.

		<shortDescription>Not the best movie within its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, all I can say is that I'm glad I wasn't around in the '50's. I would had gotten fed up with this type of movies so soon and easily! They really are all the same and the quality and production values of them really aren't that high at all.But of course you have to look at this movie fairly and judge it for what is is. I can honestly say that I from time to time enjoy watching these sort of movies and can also really appreciate them for what they are but having said all that; I really don't regard this movie as one of the better ones of its period and within its genre.To be honest, this movie can be an at times pretty silly and awkward little movie to watch. It's an, unintentionally so, bad and silly movie at times and it actually made me laugh at certain points because of how bad some moments were looking and at how silly the story could get at times.It's a very cheap looking movie, not only just with its effects but also with its visual look and sets. It all obviously for most part got shot inside of a studio, even the exterior sequences. And of course just like any other cheap '50's science-fiction B-movie, it features lots of archive footage, involving the sequences with the military.But what is more troublesome is its story. Really nothing original about it. Not with its story but also really not with its approach. It makes this a very average genre entry, that besides also feels like a real lackluster. It's a movie that starts off promising enough but you'll soon realize that the movie is just never going to be an exciting or tense genre entry. The story progresses for too slow and uninteresting for that. I also loved the fact how the military were having no problems with it to drag a little kid along with them, no matter how complicated and dangerous things could get at times. Totally ludicrous, just like this entire movie is.The movie also features some absolutely horrible acting in it but you already should be used to that once you are a bit familiar with watching movies like this. You knew your career wasn't really heading anywhere, once you found yourself in the middle of a '50's science-fiction movie, which also really was the case for all people involved with this movie.There are still positive points about this movie of course. I for one liked the ending, that at least was action filled and paced properly. I also liked the music, which wasn't really anything typical or something you would expect from an '50's science-fiction flick. No, no theremin sounds in this movie!There are definitely far better and more entertaining '50's genre movies to watch out there!5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>40 Minutes of Science Fiction Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than five decades after seeing this film in its first run, I still recall the eeriness and wonder of certain scenes.Long before I was able to see the film again as a grownup, I carried around in memory the image of that implant slowly approaching the lovely nape of the heroine's neck as she lay in a dreamlike state inside the Martian saucer. The movie has other equally memorable images--the Martian "intelligence" inside the globe; the strange backyard with its sand pits as seen from a distance; and that wonderful sequence in the barren, disproportionately sized police station, as only a child could envision it in a nightmare.The entire first half hour or so, culminating at the police station, is wonderfully done. The unaccustomed slap across the face from the boy's father is shocking, as are the abrupt cuts to closeups of the evil-looking faces of the father and the little girl next door. The choral background music, distorted to give an alien effect, is a nice touch. The final sequence, as everyone desperately tries to get away as quickly as possible from the spaceship set to explode, was intended as a filler to add running time (so I am told) but it is really weird and exciting, with flashback after flashback tumbling onto the screen, superimposed on the face of the running boy, as the eerie choral music once again is heard.But that brings us to the problem that plagues the entire final two-thirds of the movie: low budget and too much "filler" material. The endless cutaways to stock Army footage of tanks being deployed, with "The Caissons Go Rolling Along" on the soundtrack, are first funny, then tiresome. The Martian "mutants" lumbering back and forth underground--now going left, then going right, as shots are reversed--don't do much for the credibility of the film, particularly given the phony-looking suits they wear (with visible zippers). And there is one shot, showing soldiers moving in from the camera foreground to deploy around the sandpit, that is shown over and over again, in flashes so the audience doesn't readily catch on that it is the same soldiers repeatedly rushing to the same spots.Ah, then we come to Arthur Franz, that lead actor in so many bad SF movies of the 1950s. One can live with his utter lack of talent--this is SF after all--but the lines he is given to recite are so patently absurd as to be insulting. At one point he says something that amounts to this: "I'm a scientist--I'll believe anything." So: Take away Arthur Franz; take away the filler footage; and take away the stupid Martian outfits. That leaves about 40 minutes (out of 79) of science fiction gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as great as its rating, but still a good watch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this way back in the 1960s on TV, and thought it was scary, but then I'm a kid at that time.Just saw it again last night, and it was less scary, and not really extraordinary, but still an okay film. Thankfully it was in color, which highlighted the director's production design abilities. It was obviously set up for 3-D filming, as indicated by the many shots of depth, but apparently no 3-D camera was available.Without giving away the plot here, I'd say this film took on greatly the milieu of the times, the McCarthy era, and is pertinent for that plus it's fun to watch even though sometimes silly in its presentation of the aliens. The takeover of humans by the invaders is not silly however, and is pretty spooky, and is a recurrent theme in later films.If you collect sci-fi films of this period, this is one you must have, but otherwise just rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunted Memories from Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just found this movie again after nearly 50 years. Saw it when I was young and it left very spooky feelings that I can remember at times. All I had to go on was feelings from: a no-man's land where people were sucked into the earth, haunting melodies, sand or loose soil where people disappeared. At times these feelings could be resurrected even after decades. Now, due to the internet I was able to identify this movie and actually watch it again. Naturally, seeing it now as an older person is no where near the same as being a child. From the perceptions that have remained with me from seeing this at a young age, I have learned that children feel emotions far beyond what they are actually seeing. So when someone falls quickly into the sand as they do in this very B movie, the impression it left with me as a young person was much stronger than it actually appears. Seeing this again puts an end to one of those things in life that you think you will never get an answer to. Some people think you get all the answers when you die. In this case, I don't have to wait that long!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Shifty-Eyed Martian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A boy, about nine years old, awakes to strange sounds outside his bedroom window and the sight of a Hollywood-conceived flying spaceship which, conveniently, lands near the boy's home. His father, and then later his mother, investigate, but return with changed personalities.The first half is mostly human drama, with lots of talk and not much in the way of sci-fi visuals, which come in the second half. The first half is thus more credible but more mundane. The second half is cheesy but more fun.The initial score is okay. But background music deteriorates into nondescript noise as the plot moves along. Acting is borderline at best. The boy is rather annoying, with a wide-eyed, gee-whiz manner. And everyone overacts at least to some extent.The way in which the Martians trap humans is rather analogous to a Venus flytrap, so to speak. The silliest element is the Martian who controls things. He's a disembodied human head with shifty, tired-looking eyes, and octopus-like tentacles, who lives in a glass jar. He's presumably intelligent, but without limbs requires slaves to move his jar-house around. What a hoot.As with most 1950s sci-fi movies, the theme here is shallow. The film seeks only to capitalize on viewer curiosity of alien "flying saucers". There's more stock footage than I would have preferred, mostly of irritating American military tanks. The story's ending is a cop-out."Invaders From Mars" is your typical early-1950s sci-fi film. It's neither better nor worse than most others, strictly grade-B, but kinda fun, especially that Martian with the shifty eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent SciFi and Scary for Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first scifi movie when I was a kid. My older sister and I could not wait for it to come to our small town theater. Just seeing the previews scared the beejesus out of us.My dad was in the Air Force at the time and we lived in Roswell, New Mexico, so this movie really had an impact on us. Often, my dad would be away for long periods of time, and we lived on the edge of town, so some nights, after seeing this movie, my sister and I would watch outside the bedroom window, just like the kid in the movie, watching the night sky for "aliens" to land.Although many today would think this movie hoakie or down right infantile, it really was a scary movie in it's day. Just the thought of these bug-eyed goons from outer space kidnapping your mom and dad would give any kid the willies. And, to make it worse, the "Brain Guy" from Mars sends them back to you as creepy Martian Zombioids.....and then the real scary fun begins.This movie, though badly dated now days, is well worth watching. It seems to me, as an adult, that it was really made just to scare the crap out of kids, so don't pay much attention to the goofy sets and the really stupid costumes. As a kid, I can tell you, it really gave us something to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RUINED By The Ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the firs time this morning.I was expecting to see another cheesy, campy, Mystery Science Theatre 3000 type movie with bad effects and equally bad costumes.Instead, what I watched was a fairly decent film dealing with mysterious alien takeovers.Yes, the communist undertones were there, yet beyond that, the film was truly well done, actually much better than endless other films I can think of that have won Oscars and were heaped with critical acclaim from this same period.This is a good movie! Unlike ET (a movie I detest) this boy only tells what he knows and sees. He isn't presumptive as Henry Thomas was to deduce that everything the adults were doing was wrong and his pouting and tears could save the day.The kid here actually steps out of the movie and lets the adults take over when it is necessary for them to do grown up business.And then the child is allowed to return for moments, pretty much involving his parents.The story progresses in a subtle way, credibility is given to the boy's story by simple things, like the two policemen not reporting that they were called out to the family's home that morning.A man isn't automatically believed simply because he is a general. Actually, we see nothing of the general, before or after he is taken over by the martians.But this movie is good! And it is a solid image of this era.Every time I waited for the film to sink into predictability, it managed to stay focused and keep the action subdued, not too intense, not too far-fetched.The only fault? Everyone who has seen the movie knows what it is.If it were at all possible to stop watching the movie when we see the people running away, I would recommend anyone watching the movie for the first time do just that.The movie does not end well. It's not only the predictable direction the movie takes, it looks like someone else came in and concocted this ending.Was the director running out of time? It doesn't even look like that.Poseidon Adventure ran out of finances or time so that is why we get the short cut to the survivors getting on the helicopter like that, but still it wrapped things up, to an extent.This one took a strange, unnecessary direction with the movie. And it is a shame.Still, a brilliant film from the early 50s, dated like wine, and I don't say that about many films.But the ending ruined it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-budget sci-fi for paranoid little boys, complete with explosions, ray guns, body snatchings and zippered aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After some introductory narration, we open on a bogus-looking backdrop, representing a house in a peaceful suburban neighborhood. That night, young David McLean (Jimmy Hunt) sees a spaceship crash into a nearby sandpit. His father (Leif Erickson) goes to investigate, but comes back changed. Where once he was cheerful and affectionate, he's now sullen and snarlingly rude. Others fall into the sandpit (accompanied by the sound of a heavenly choir?an effect that works better than you'd think) and begin acting like him: cold, ill-tempered and conspiratorial. David knows that aliens are taking over the bodies of humans, but he'll soon discover there have been far more of these terrible thefts than he could have imagined.Unlike his successor in "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers," this young doom-monger finds some serious help in a lady doctor (Helena Carter, in an appealing performance) and a brilliant astronomer (Arthur Franz). Here the script becomes too talky; but later the doctor and the boy fall into the sandpit themselves, and we enter the bubble-filled interior of the spaceship. There we meet mutants (pronounced, for some reason, as "Mute Ants"), who are green aliens with insect-like eyes. These ludicrous beings prove to be slaves to their leader: a large, silent head with ceaselessly shifting eyes and two tentacles on either side, each of which branches off into three smaller tentacles.This is a movie tailored to a perfect fit for any little boy, made as it is with space ships, green men, tanks, soldiers, ray guns, exploding buildings, exploding people, and even a sinister little girl coming to a fatal end. The young hero is intelligent and resourceful and is taken seriously by everyone, even?or especially?the people-cum-evil-aliens who try to denounce him as a little crackpot. Bobby Driscoll's character in "The Window" should have had it so good.William Cameron Menzies directs, doing what he can with a severely tight budget. The stylized sets look pretty good; but the green-carpet costumes for the alien slaves are awful, especially their zippers. The opening scenes showing the boy's happy family life are phony and awkward. Otherwise, the first half hour is the best, as it usually is in monster movies. Waiting for aliens is more fun than seeing them.The fun ends just before the movie does: whoever decided on the it's-all-a-dream cop-out must have had an alien device stuck in the back of his neck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating but flawed slice of SF paranoia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Invaders From Mars' is one of the most curious SF/horror movies from the 1950s. While nowhere near as good as say, 'Forbidden Planet' or 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers', it also isn't as silly as the laughable 'Teenagers From Outer Space' or the legendary Ed Wood, Jr's schlock classic 'Plan Nine From Outer Space'. It's really hard to gauge how it would have played to an audience fifty years ago, but today it's a fascinating but flawed slice of SF paranoia. The main weakness in the movie is the script, which starts off brilliantly, but quickly loses direction, and most of the acting isn't all that good. At first you almost think it's going to a precursor to 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' (a movie it quite possibly influenced), but then it goes into more 'Brain From Planet Arous' territory. Which is fine for what it is, but you can't help but think it's a missed opportunity. What really saves the movie are some of the bizarre visual sequences, and director/designer William Cameron Menzies who was responsible for the highly thought of version of H.G. Wells' 'Things To Come' back in the 1930s. The scenes inside the alien's craft are especially effective and creepy, and the main reason to watch this movie. Fans of 1950s SF will probably enjoy this one much more than other viewers, but 'Invaders From Mars' is still worth a look, and it is definitely much more entertaining than Tobe Hooper's ill advised 1980s remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but it suffers from the ultimate cop-out ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars is a film that has been copied many times, from films like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) to one of the better episodes of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" to, believe it or not, "SCTV". Because so many plot elements are familiar here, the film is clearly a seminal film for the genre.The film begins with a kid (about age 9 or 10) waking up and seeing a space ship land in his back yard. It is able to somehow burrow under ground and leaves no trace, so at first it's hard to convince people it landed--especially because many of the first people he tries to tell have had metallic devices implanted in their necks to make them do the Martians' bidding. However, the kid is able to convince several key people surprisingly easy and soon the local military base is mobilized against the alien scourge. The main problem is to find their way inside to the alien hideout. Additionally, being very advanced Martians, they have many high tech devices that are apparently easily defeated by a well-place grenade.While the film is fun to watch, there were several problems. First, the print I saw looked absolutely horrible. Perhaps it was experimental color film they used, but it looked like it needed a ton of restoration work and the colors were both garish AND dark at the same time! Second, although the film was exciting to watch for fans of the genre, at the very end (following the destruction of the alien ship), the kid awakens to find it's all a dream. What a cheap cop-out and hasn't this plot device been a bit overused?! Still, this is a very important film historically speaking and it is entertaining in a cheesy 1950s way. High art? No way--but entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>False Information</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much wrong information in this listing. Here are the facts:INVADERS FROM MARS was not filmed in 3-D. Therefore, there were no ads promoting a 3-D release placed by the studio.There is no official documentation that the film was planned for 3-D. An undocumented phone conversation with someone that worked on the film 50 years earlier is not proof. Memories can be very selective. Show me some official Edward Alperson/20th Century Fox studio paperwork.The film was not disintegrating in the early seventies when Wade Williams found "the only print." There were several sets of 35mm protection elements, and they were safely stored in several film vaults.The repetitious footage of the tanks was most certainly in the original release prints. I had one (an original 1953 35mm SuperCinecolor copy) and it included all of that stock footage.35mm color separation elements (red, blue, yellow) do exist and are stored at the UCLA Film Archive. It has not been restored because of a rights dispute with the current distributors. I've done extensive research on the 1950's 3-D films, and can back up these statements with authentic, documented source materials.I hope this sets the record straight. Anybody who claims to have seen this in 3-D, or a newspaper ad promoting that release, is victim of an over-active childhood imagination!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martians In the Backyard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invaders From Mars is worth seeing for director-production designer William Cameron Menzies' scenic designs. The story, which concerns a boy who witnesses a Martian spaceship land in his backyard, who proceeds to try to get grownups to believe him, is pure fantasy. There's a paranoid air to this movie, which is so often the case with fifties sci-fi. What makes it work, when it does, is its sets, which Menzies was largely responsible for. He used forced perspective to make things look longer or larger than they are, which emphasizes the dream nature of the story over the realistic. There are striking images in the movie, such as the backyard, with its rickety fence to the left, and the path, trailing off into what looks like infinity, with the enormous sandpit dominating the foreground. The scene in which the boy goes to the police station, with the sergeant's desk looming above like a malevolent cliff, provides yet another remarkable image; while the underground caverns of Martians are surreal and eerie, complete with giants in spacesuits lurching to and fro. One of the most striking scenes in the film focuses on the chief Martian, a head in a jar surrounded by seaweed-like hair. Also effective is the use of a wordless chorus to accompany the various hapless victims of the Martians as the approach the sandpit.Alas, dramatically, the story is not well developed; nor is the dialog compelling or interesting in itself. The actors are at best mediocre, though it's nice to see Morris Ankrum in one of his many roles as a military man in sci-fi of this period. Invaders From Mars is a strange movie, and not for all tastes. It manages to be visually grand, yet it is a ludicrous story that plays like hand-me-down Cornell Woolrich as filtered through the mind of Ray Bradbury. I find it difficult to tell how serious Menzies was when he made this film. He was a hugely talented man with a weak story sense, and I gather that he used the material in this movie as an excuse to indulge his talent for creating splendid images, and in this, if nothing else, he succeeds magnificently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INVADERS FROM MARS {Original U.S. &amp; Alternate U.K. Versions} (William Cameron Menzies, 1953) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall having slept through my first viewing of this one on Italian TV several years ago; now, it still emerges a disappointment after a strong first half. There are undeniable good moments along the way, but almost as a reassurance to Cold War-era American viewers, Menzies seems obsessed with showing lengthy scenes of mobilizing troops - though the passages here don't have the rhythm of equivalent sections in THINGS TO COME (1936); his stylized sets, however, are quite effective. It's interesting that I watched Menzies' two sci-fi films back-to-back, as it demonstrates the difference in style and content the genre underwent from the progressive-looking 1930s to the paranoid 1950s.The film mainly gets by thanks to a likable cast, and the electronic score (credited to Raoul Kraushaar but actually composed by one Mort Glickman!) is also notable. The climax, though, is a major let-down: the mutants (one of whom, reportedly, was played by Lock Martin - Gort in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL [1951]) are repeatedly seen running around aimlessly through the underground caverns; the military absurdly allows the kid to fire the aliens' ray gun (as if it were a toy!) which eventually liberates them from their underground trap; while a scene of falling debris from an exploding rock-face is repeated three times (alerting one to the film's essential Poverty Row status)! At times, it's even unintentionally hilarious: the hysterical army manoeuvres, the make-up of the glass-encased chief alien (played by a female midget) - also because it does nothing but look about it! - and, my favorite, the look of surprise and terror (in close-up) on a scientist's face after surviving an assassination attempt by the zombified kid's father. Interestingly, the film was apparently shot in 3-D but there are no glaring examples taking advantage of this format; also, the original story writer had his credit removed when the film-makers turned his story into a child's nightmare! As for the alternate UK Version: this features a lengthy and tedious explanatory scene of UFO activity over the years half-way through which stops the film dead in its tracks (clearly shot much later as the boy's haircut is totally different and the sequence itself indifferently staged); the alternate ending isn't that bad, though - despite allowing the Martians to unaccountably escape scott free (I was actually glad that the boy's rather frenzied reminiscence of past events as he's running away from the alien hide-out in the original has been dropped). In spite of its solid reputation, I wouldn't classify INVADERS FROM MARS as one of the top-tier films from the sci-fi heyday (the body-snatching angle alone was more persuasively handled in IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE [1953] and especially INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS [1956] - though the "quicksand" technique used here is, in itself, innovative).The print of both versions on Image's "50th Anniversary" DVD is quite scratched and extremely dark (the famous green alien costume is hardly discernible); this also does the rather ugly Cinecolor no favors at all. It also includes a welcome Easter Egg in the form of trailers for BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA (1952), SHE DEMONS (1958), MONSTER FROM GREEN HELL (1958), THE FLYING SAUCER (1950) and THE CRAWLING EYE (1958).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like stock footage of army tanks being loaded onto a train, or endless shots of guys in green velvet jump suites and ping-pong ball eyes running back and forth, then you'll love this movie. The only interesting scenes are in the police station. Whoever created this set should receive an award. The ceiling appears to be about 30 feet high. There are no pictures or other decorations on the walls anywhere and the jail cell where the boy meets the shrink is about 5 feet deep with the walls, floor, and ceiling tapered to add the illusion of depth. The effect is bizarre since it creates an (unintentional?) forced perspective which makes the boy look huge next to the (not-so) distant back wall when compared to the people in the foreground. It's worth seeing for Milburn Stone who is brilliant as usual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, maybe in its time, this movie might have been something, but even I can appreciate older classics of the sci-fi genre. If you're in the mood for a sci-fi classic, check out War of the Worlds, or The Blob...even It Came From Outer Space held more entertainment value to me than this movie. It wasn't terrible, but pretty close. Hokey costumes were more reminiscent of Plan Nine from Outer Space. Lame plot and lame acting complete the picture. The only way I could ever imagine being able to enjoy this movie would be watching it being ripped apart by Tom Servo, Gypsy and company of Mystery Science Theater. I can honestly say that I've seen more entertaining movies on MSTK than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a tremendously big fan of fifties Sci-Fi movies and, even though I don't rank this "Invaders from Mars" among my decade's favorites (probably not even in the top 10), I most certainly do reckon its value and importance for the Sci-Fi genre in general. I think we cannot even estimate how influential ? and quintessential ? this motion picture from William Cameron Menzies has been, and still is, for the genre. To name just one example, for as long as I can remember, even in kindergarten school already, the image of extraterrestrial beings that got planted in my head was that of an odd-looking green creature with large heads and evil penetrating eyes. I daresay that this alien prototype largely originates from "Invaders from Mars", and perhaps one or two other contemporary classics, and several more basic Sci-Fi principles were still fresh and innovative back in 1953, like the rural "backdoor" of America setting and the aliens' mind-controlling techniques. As said, I personally prefer other fifties genre milestones over "Invaders from Mars", most notably the rawer and disturbing ones like "War of the Worlds", "Forbidden Planet", "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", "The Thing from Another World", "The Day the Earth Stood Still", etc etc? And yet, from many viewpoints "Invaders from Mars" is quite mature and intense despite the lead protagonist being a young boy and the climax being a complete letdown. During a stormy night, the young astrology-obsessed David MacLean witness how a flying saucer lands over the sand hills behind his parental house. David's parents naturally don't believe his grotesque story but they are the first ones to sink into an eerie sandpit and return as robotic and cold- hearted minions. Several more people are lured to the sandpit behind the MacLean's house and, especially from the little wound in the back of all their necks, David quickly concludes that they have brainwashed by the aliens that landed in the saucer. As more and more sandpit visitors begin to behave strangely and freak accidents occur all over town, David finally receives support from a friendly female physician and an immense military counter-action gradually unfolds itself in David's backyard and underneath the ground. The first half of the film is compelling and tense, what with David being pushed around and even menaced by the town's authority figures, or the eerie sub plot about the little neighbor girl Kathy who set her house on fire! The second half is more dull and routine, even though it's only by then that the green Martians appear on screen, and the underground battles seem to take forever. One of the reasons why I found "Invaders from Mars" disappointing is the random and over-excessive use of military stock footage. There are far too many repetitive shots of bomb explosions and massive tanks firing even though it's made quite clear that they don't have anything to nuke or shoot at, since the aliens are under the ground! I like the Martians' green rubber suits &amp; masks a lot and particularly their "leader" ? basically a surly silver head with tentacles attached to it, and living in a fish bowl ? is a highlight of creative fifties' Sci-Fi imagination, but you can hardly refer to them as frightening or even remotely unsettling. The climax is annoying but I've grown to accept this kind of end twists, especially when the pivot characters are children. I'm glad to have seen "Invaders from Mars" for its historical relevance and because it contains some really atmospheric filming location and sound recordings, but I can easily name two dozen of Sci-Fi movies from the fifties era that better and yet more obscure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I wouldn't bother to review a movie (especially one like this). But at 6.4 (current IMDb average), I have to say this movie is grossly overrated.When it comes to sci-fi movies, I'll take an intelligent script and fine acting over sensational special effects, poor scripts, and bad acting anytime. If the script is good enough, you can even suspend disbelief when the make-up, costumes, or special effects border on the ridiculous.The costumes and sets are indeed ridiculous in this movie, but the script is absurd, too, and the acting is dreadful. The direction and editing are awful as well. How many times do we need to watch men in green jumpsuits run through a tunnel (left to right, right to left, and then back again ad nauseum)?I must have been about 12 when I saw this movie the first time, and I thought it was great. All these years later, I find it's not worth a second watching.The sad part is seeing this may discourage viewers from moving on to some really good 50's sci-fi: The Fly, Them!, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, etc. See those films first, and then watch this one.On second thought, just see those films. You can really skip this one.(I'm really sorry I had to mark this with a spoiler alert because of the green jumpsuit reference. This film was spoiled long before I wrote this review)</fullReview>

But more importantly, this version mentions that the boy's parents are alive and well, and recuperating in hospital. At the end of the film, after the army has defeated the Martians, his two adult friends put him to bed and all is well.In the version I've grown up seeing a dozen times or more, the army seems to be losing the battle as the boy is running and running, looking for an escape. We have learned that his parents are dead at this point. He wakes up in his bed, realizing it was just a nightmare, until an actual spaceship does indeed crash exactly as it happened in his sleep. Now knowing how to beat the Martians, the boy happily climbs out his window to go save the world from the invaders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invaders from Mars (1953) *** (out of 4) Sci-Fi classic about a young boy (Jimmy Hunt) who witnesses a UFO crash in his backyard and then goes through the horrific events of seeing the aliens take over the minds of people in the town including his parents. This is one of the most famous Sci-Fi films from the decade, which is saying quite a lot considering how many of these movies were released then. There's always going to be controversy and debate when discussing this movie and I'm sure that's one of the reasons it has survived so long while many others are forgotten. For my money this is a very impressive film that has a few flaws but none of them major enough to kill the film. What impressed me the most with this recent viewing is how incredibly well-made the opening twenty-minutes are. The opening contains some wonderful suspense as the young boy begins to realize that his parents have been transformed into some sort of monsters. The fear of the kid is what makes this opening so effective and I love the way the director keeps everything moving at a very fast pace so we really don't have a second to breathe. I think when the science aspect is brought it, the film drops a few notches and the military stuff is silly at times but these are just small issues. I enjoyed the look of the aliens even though I doubt too much money was spent on their outfits. The sand pits was a nice twist as was the main leader who looks quite well. Then we have the controversy of the ending, which I won't spoil for you but I don't mind it too much. Some might call it a cop-out or see it as a nice twist but I think it works just fine. In a decade that was full of great, good and bad Sci-Fi films this one here is certainly remembered for a reason.</fullReview>

The Martians are risible, the blocking of the scenes look like WPA posters &amp; the script is so self-lampooning as to render it MST3000-proof.

The acting is atrocious, the special effects don't deserve to be called "special", and the screenplay is a disaster. Anybody pick up the back and forth running done by everyone while underground under the sand (which seemed to go on forever)? What they did repeatedly was to reverse the image to make it look as if it were another part of the underground caverns (notice the items on the belts of the soldiers and how they switch sides). They even did this once to the path behind the house leading to the noisy sand (fence on the left of the path, then fence on the right). Speaking of that sound when the sand was opening, yeah, that was really, really scary (rolling eyes). It was made by a choir! I could go on and on about the plot and dialog but I'll just say that if you're really desperate for a sci-fi flick, try something else first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor script. Bad music score. It felt like it was directed by Hump Dee Dumpty. I've seen better acting in a kinder garden play concerning the survival of the south American swamp rat. Why the film was shot in color is beyond me, any (good) sci fi film from the 50's, "The Thing", "Them", "The Day the Earth Stood Still", "Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" and the list goes on, these films were shot in black and white for a reason. For this viewer, with this film, color (among other things)was a distraction taking away from the supposed scary content of what could of been a good B picture. Just think, years ago (like now-days) people were getting paid good money to put stink bombs on film. The definition of the word classic is, 'to with-stand the test of time'. Again I'll mention Howard Hawks', "The Thing", that film scared the daylights out of me as a child and to this day, it still raises the hairs on the back of my neck, thus we have good film-making! As for "Invaders From Mars", what-a-ya-gonna-do? I'm sorry, this one's a real stinker. Cold war, hot war, any war or no war, this thing didn't even make it to the alphabet. If there were really life on Mars, they would file a law suit against Hollywood. It makes sense that the Brits would want to have their own version of the film, after all, it was only 1953 when the stinker was released. OK, what else should we talk about?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a release date of 1953 and it looks it.What does that mean?I don't know of when I have seen a proposed investment not be calculated for effect, what is portrayed is a deliberately constructed story line projected against a contemporary political world of McCarthy hearings,Spying,and so on.The film possesses those elements, however those are not the only elements that is within the confines of identification.There is much that is within the films construct that does not provide for identification and that is why this film still attracts viewers.What is it about this dated projection that is worthy of note.The story line suggests that this event occurs and that as it is unfolding we are allowed to know that this invasion is being brought to you by some guy in a glass whose claim is of being Mankind?How does an Invasion from Mars represent Mankind?I don't know,however this is how we all get screwed up with ridiculous nonsense like this.That though, is not the only incongruent element present in this illustration of just how much of an opportunity the motion picture really provides for.This comment actually would like to know what exactly was reality up to when it made this film?This film is something of a sparsely constructed movie set that can even provide for an attempt to persuade through the use of either influence,or maybe something referred to as the power of suggestion,again we come upon the threat posed by the having power over another and the abuse thereof.I think that this is what the film is in fact commenting on,that in fact this is about the effect of an abusive system and what it might seem to a young boy and to us as viewers as his parents.What is in fact reality?Can a system actually cause these things to occur?What manner of ability would be required in order to allow for such an influence that would be so foreign as to represent an invasion from mars?There are to be certain many areas whereby the politics of the day provided an underpinning to the hysterical hooey that this motion picture provided for, however the up shot is that without always being aware as to how much that the film provides for we are in fact able to draw out what is essentially the real ability that this entertainment medium causes to occur.The politics of power over another is coupled with the thought of an invasion from another planet and you should be made aware that this film is an attempt to influence through suggestion.The conceit that is provided for in the mind of mankind in a bottle is complicated by the fact that the rest of the body is unattached.It is as well suggested that we are in fact looking at drone like slaves whose only ability is to do what the mind in a bottle commands them to do,however the guys in the pajamas are without an ability to determine for themselves what is provided for by way of the mind in a bottle.If that is a little bit eerie than please look at our world that way because there are not any men from mars running around loose, that is what is most purposeful about such an opportunity as is had by this industry.The question as to reality is real and as well the source of this dissent is it in fact based on truly something foreign? My suggestion is that we may in fact be looking at some home grown perception and that to often it is thought of being from another world when in fact it is very close to home.Home?Who are we anyway?What is in fact reality?Is there any design by this mind in a bottle to out smart the viewer? This film wishes to be something of a dream however the suggestion is that this is not a dream but reality as such because it happened or is happening or will happen and that the only real answer is that we will lock our doors and close reality down for the night.Why is such an answer legitimate?How is such a consequence worthy of the human race?This film to be sure was almost uninteresting however I had forgotten some of the imagery and watched the entire film more than twice since purchasing the DVD some 6 months ago.As things go its O.K. there are better and more compelling story lines to be had from films of this era.It is though one of only a few that I remembered and that in of it self provides for the fact that it was one of the more successful films of the 1950's.Well anyway,so much for the commies,we've got Hollywood?Or do we!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had long wanted to see this film. I endured the 80s remake on a first date that ultimately led to a disastrous first marriage, but I didn't hold that against the story! Anyhoo, the entry in the /Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film/ made it sound like this was at least a visual treat ...... and, to be honest, there are many nice things (pointed out by other reviewers here) to look at. But these do not add up, in my mind, to anything like a satisfying movie -- even given the date.For one, certain of the visuals are unbearably cheesy. The bubbly, "melted" appearance of the Martian corridors is completely ruined by the fact that the dopey-looking, shambling "mutants" repeatedly brush up against the hanging condoms and make them swing lazily back and forth. And the costumes (zippers included) on the mutants ...! Also, the same little clips of film are repeatedly 3, 4 and even 5 times. Was this supposed to add to the "dreamlike" quality of the film? Given the presence of all that stock footage of tanks (a sure hallmark of a lazy filmmaker), I'd be inclined to say that it was cheapness instead, and a reliance on the audience being too stupid to notice. Final note: that telescope! It looks like a paper towel roll painted white and is way too small for the dome it was in -- not to mention the fact that it was very strange to see an astronomical telescope being used /during the day/ to look at things on the horizon.The film suffers from a wooden child performance, as well. I'd guess that the fond memories many people have of this movie would mostly dissipate if they were to see it again as adults. Some 50s genre films hold up really well - I don't think this one does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young David (Jimmy Hunt) sees a flying saucer land close to his house. His friendly joking father goes to investigate--but comes back cold, vicious and impersonal. It seems there are aliens there and they're controlling human beings. Jimmy gets Dr. Blake (Helena Cater) and Dr. Kelston (Arthur Franz) to believe him...but can they stop the aliens before they take over the world?This is held in high regard by many adults who it scared silly back in the 1950s when they were kids. It DOES play into childhood fears very well and the surreal looking sets add to the nightmarish quality of the movie--but that's about all this has going for it. With the sole exception of Hunt the acting is terrible (although Carter and Franz try), the story slight and slow and there's TONS of stock footage of the Army sending out weapons to destroy the aliens. This all could have been excused if the aliens are cool--but when you finally see them at the end the film falls apart. They're VERY obviously guys in stupid, ill-fitting green suits that look just ridiculous! A few times you see the zippers running up the back! Any sense of menace or terror that might have been built up by then is gone. Add to that terrible special effects and a REAL poor ending and you have an abysmal sci-fi film that is ONLY a classic for people who were kids in the 1950s. Even the 1986 remake wasn't this bad! It doesn't help that the print I saw on AMC is very scratchy with faded color and bad sound (nonstop commercials too). I give it a 4 for Hunt and the ridiculous aliens alone.BTW this was NOT shot and released in 3D. That story has been going around for years but it's not true.</fullReview>

The official response is even more ridiculous than the imagined threat, but all the stock military footage (without which the film would be half its length) at least provided a reassuring reminder of America's armed superiority against the Red Menace, The colorful production design by William Cameron Menzies is still fascinating, and, curiously, the plot anticipated Ronald Reagan's SDI pipe dream by some 30 years (the idea hasn't improved much since then).</fullReview>
