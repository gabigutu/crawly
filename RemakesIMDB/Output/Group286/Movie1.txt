		<shortDescription>Doris Day at her zaniest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like this Doris Day flick. Doris does more slapstick in this feature than all her other movies put together. James Garner thinks Doris has been dead for 5 years. He is now on his honeymoon with new wife Polly Bergen and guess who shows up after being rescued off a deserted island? You got it. Doris hilariously ruins the honeymoon (this was when couples waited until the honeymoon to make love, YEAH RIGHT!) Anyway, Polly is quite frustrated not getting any action from James Garner. Several scenes are classics. especially when Doris poses as a Swedish Masseur and practically beats Polly to a pulp. The best scene of all is watching Doris drive a brand new 1963 Imperial Conv. into a car wash and then accidentally putting the top down. Don Knotts makes a funny cameo as a randy shoe salesman and Edgar Buchanan (Petticoat Junction) is funny as a surly Court Judge. Thelma Ritter is always funny and she is up to par here. This movie was apparently re-worked for Doris Day after the death of Marilyn Monroe who was essentially filming the same movie when she died. Even the sets were basically the same. I guess 20th Century Fox needed the money after the Liz Taylor fiasco "Cleopatra" almost put them in bankruptcy. Overall, a very cute, sexy (for the era) funny movie. They don't make cute movies like this anymore. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Thelma Ritter gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the somewhat "infamous" film that has the distinction of being Marilyn Monroe's final film (titled "Something's Got to Give"), however she doesn't appear in any scene of it whatsoever. That's because by the time this film ended up being made, she was sadly already dead. Nevertheless Doris Day, James Garner, Polly Bergen and Don Knotts step in to replace Marilyn, Dean Martin, Cyd Charisse and Wally Cox and the results are simply hysterical. This is a classic early 1960's "Kennedy-era" screwball comedy with jokes, gags, comic pratfalls and the like. Who out there will ever be able to forget Doris Day as the scheming "Swedish Nurse" and Thelma Ritter as the up to no good meddling mother-in-law? Move Over, Darling is a film that I like to watch at least twice a year whenever I need a good laugh.My only wish is that Rock Hudson would have teamed up with Doris yet again to reprise their earlier success of "Pillow Talk". James Garner to me always seemed a bit wooden in the role of Nicholas Arden. Both Polly Bergen and Thelma Ritter singlehandedly steal the show.One final note: in the original "Something's Got To Give" film that Marilyn did, there was a nude swimming pool scene. I would have liked to have seen Doris try to pull that one off, but alas, was it too "impure" for her to even think of doing in the first place?My rating: 3 stars(For an excellent analysis of Marilyn Monroe's final film with 20th Century Fox check out the book "Marilyn the Last Take". You won't be disappointed, trust me.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this glossy remake of the 1940 comedy "My Favorite Wife" did not turn into the funniest Doris Day vehicle, it does provide several highly amusing moments (Doris's posing as the Swedish nurse is priceless). There are a couple of scenes that could have done with some trimming (Day and Garner's scene in the hotel room and the opening courtroom sequence come to mind) but the film benefits from an excellent supporting cast, Thelma Ritter being the stand-out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it's not the most hilarious movie you've ever seen. But there is something magical about Move Over, Darling. No one could ever get mad like Doris Day and boy does she shine in this movie as usual. It's a fun film that anyone can enjoy if they don't think too hard and just sit back and relax. The added bonus is seeing James Garner flashing that million dollar smile and of course, Thelma Ritter who was always a riot in any movie she was in. Doris Day lovers need to add this to their collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect feel good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the perfect Sunday morning movie. It is absolutely delightful with a spectacular cast that even the least devoted movie buff will recognize. The primary actors, Doris Day, James Garner, Thelma Ritter, Polly Bergen, and Don Knotts are comic masters at the very peak of their talents. Aside from Doris Day's genius, Thelma Ritter pulls off another jem as Garner's mother. Thelma Ritter is in my honest opinion, the best character actress that Hollywood has ever produced, and is allowed to perform her many talents with minimal intrusions by other actors or the movies editors. If you love Doris Day, admire great comedy movies, or just need a little entertainment, this is the perfect way to spend a couple of hours!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite my not being around when this was released, (I am 14) James Garner is really a dish. I enjoyed this movie a lot. It was done in a way you don't see anymore. James and Doris look so cute together. I really liked the story and am hoping to see the original with Cary Grant/Irene Dunne. I especially have a place in my heart for Doris Day's 60's comedies and I rank this with the best of them. I love the car wash scene...It was so cute. And Doris's and James's jealousies at what they had been doing when they were away, (just the measures they took), just was funny. If you wanna feel good, watch this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think Of The Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Move Over Darling with James Garner and Doris Day which is a remake of the RKO classic My Favorite Wife is probably better known for being the end result of the disaster known as Something's Gotta Give. That of course is Marilyn Monroe's legendary last film that she never finished.Looking over the cast of the unfinished Something's Gotta Give I have to say though I don't think it would have been Monroe's greatest film, the rest of the cast was pretty good. When 20th Century Fox fired Marilyn, Dean Martin also quit and the whole film was scrapped. At that point it was just decided to redo the whole thing with an entire new cast and apparently no one survived the change.I also imagine that a serious rewrite would have to be done in order that a role originally cast for Marilyn Monroe could fit Doris Day. Seeing Doris on the screen I can't imagine that Chuck Connors or in Marilyn's case, Tom Tryon, would have been unsuccessfully trying to catch her on a desert island for five years.The story as originally written by Sam and Bella Spewack has James Garner going to court to get his first wife, missing for five years after a forced ocean landing, declared legally dead. He wants to marry Polly Bergen. But wouldn't you know it, a Navy submarine rescues Doris Day at just that time and when she hears about Garner's new bride, it's Doris off to spoil that honeymoon.Polly Bergen was just great as the picture of sexual frustration on that honeymoon. Although I can certainly see Cyd Charisse in that same spot with Dean Martin. Edgar Buchanan is great as the crusty judge who declares Doris legally dead the first time and then has all the parties and then some in court to try and untangle things. That role was supposed to go to John McGiver and certainly those two would have been different types.It goes that way up and down the cast list, Don Knotts substituting for Wally Cox as the timid shoe salesman Doris has impersonate Chuck Connors so Garner won't be jealous. And I can't see much difference with Phil Silvers as opposed to John Astin as the smarmy insurance man. One thing I did notice is that there was no equivalent parts in Something's Gotta Give for Fred Clark the hotel manager and Thelma Ritter as Garner's mother. My guess is that whoever was supposed to play those roles may never have got on camera because there was no way to shoot around them.I suppose the best thing to do is not speculate, but enjoy the funny comedy that did come out of all the grief 20th Century Fox had with this film. Certainly only Doris Day could convince you that in five years she never succumbed to Chuck Connors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plush, burlesque comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While on his honeymoon with a lusty, neurotic bride, widower James Garner discovers the hard way that first wife Doris Day is still very much alive. Enjoyable bedroom-farce, a remake of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne's "My Favorite Wife", has a colorful supporting cast, cute kids, a fine score by Lionel Newman and, of course, Day herself, shining brightly while going from happy to sad to frantic to sentimental. Despite some forced bits (shouting from Garner and the tired jokes with the irritated judge), it's a happily brawling slapstick comedy. I loved the scene where Doris, dressed like a sailor, sees her two daughters for the first time in years ("Are you a lady or a man?" they ask her) or when she sings them to sleep and one of the girls recognizes the song, but overcome by memories says she doesn't like it. Doris gives Polly Bergen the massage of her life, trades dry quips with Thelma Ritter, flirts with Don Knotts, and gives Chuck Conners a series of karate moves that leaves him floored. It's a comedic tour-de-force for the actress. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great mid-century classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie epitomizes the blind optimism of the mid-century era. Its one of the perfect movies for Vintage and Mid-Century collectors. This is a remake of the uncompleted Marilyn Monroe/Dean Martin version (which is available in itsincomplete form in the Marilyn Monroe Diamond Collection) The Monroeversion wasn't finished because she died during filming after many on setproblems, it was slated to be finished ans just before filming she died! Having seen the monroe version and this as well, I have to say both are great in their own ways, the shots are almost identical, the dialogue as well, but castingmakes all the difference! The Day/Garner version has a much more wholesome/ happy vibe to it that for me is the hallmark of movies of the Mid-century era. You half expect to hear someone say "golly gee willikers"! or something corny like that. Doris Day delivers a performance that only Day can and Garner is theunsung hero of this kind of genre movie, he had great comic timing, he wasdashing and personable without ever coming off as too sleazy or smarmy. Ireally ache to see this one on DVD, especially if they are kind enough to include some fantastic extras!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen this movie but once I saw the cast, I new it had to be at least acceptable (it turned out to be much better than that). Each actor was skilled in either movie or television and the delivery of most of the comedic lines were as professional as can be. Doris Day, as a whole, is so underrated and rarely mentioned in discussions of fine actresses, when she should be. Whether it be good drama or good comedy, both are difficult and she fills the part extremely well. As for Garner, yes Grant has big shoes to fill but his presence is strongly felt. All of the others are just fantastic, all the way to Chuck Conners, in the roles they play. As a side note Maverick (Garner) meets the Rifleman (Conners).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Move Over, Darling (1963)The situation is hilarious--a man finally gives up his wife as dead in a plane crash in the South Pacific and remarries. Then she comes home, just hours after the ceremony. And in time to avoid the classic consummation at the ritzy hotel. Doris Day plays the lost wife returning home and her hubby is the charming James Garner. And Garner's mother--Day's mother in law--is played by the impeccable Thelma Ritter.So what could go wrong here? Nothing much really. It's colorful, plasticky, fun, goofy, and well written. Except that it's a remake of a more famous and in many ways better movie starring the snappy on-screen couple: Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. The original is called "My Favorite Wife," and I totally recommend it. It must have occurred to these newer actors that they had huge huge shoes to fill. And to make things more weird, Doris Day is basically filling in for Marilyn Monroe, who died during the filming of this same kind of plot (though this movie started the idea almost from scratch, only Ritter and some of the sets being carried over).One way to avoid comparisons is to never see the original. We all know the dangers there--who wants to only see the second or third "King Kong" or the second "The Women" and so on? But there is also the truth that Doris Day is her own commodity. She is convincingly regular, a true 50s/60s mom type for middle class America (though be sure, these are all extremely rich people here, part of the glamorizing that the audience craves). So go back to the start here--this is a well made, fast paced, silly movie in the Doris Day vein. She's the true star, though Garner does his best to be a somewhat more conventional Grant. There are a couple of scenes that will crack you up beyond the endless smaller jokes and gags. One is where Day pretends to be a Swedish masseuse and ends up "massaging" that is torturing the new wife. The other is a wonderful automatic car wash scene in a classic car with suds flying--and the top to the car goes down by mistake. Day is an amazing sport for all of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it wrong to consider it one of my favourite Doris Day films?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of Doris Day, I loved Move Over Darling. My Favourite Wife is often compared to this film, but I personally prefer this film. Move Over Darling is funny, charming and without a wasted scene. The film looks fabulous, with beautiful cinematography and fresh-looking scenery, while the soundtrack is bright and breezy. Then there is an engaging story, a witty and charming script and professional direction.Not only that there is some fine acting in this film. I have always loved Doris Day, not only as a talented singer but as a fresh and endearing actress, and she is lovely in Move Over Darling, and James Garner as always is immensely likable. While Polly Bergen and Chuck Connors give perfect support as the other woman and the hunk marooned with Day, it is the delightful Thelma Ritter who steals the show as Day's outspoken mother-in-law.Overall, one of my favourite Doris Day films, and a film that is warm, witty and charming. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Giving this a huge thumbs up for modernizing a classic and being equally as enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doris Day herself even reflects on the original version of this ("My Favorite Wife") where, with a Swedish accent, she asks the new wife of her husband (James Garner) what would happen if the first wife (herself!) came back from the dead, "just like Irene Dunne done....ah, did..." The zaniness of this very 60's remake is obvious from the get-go, taking a good deal of the structure of the original, yet giving it a modern feel thanks to the presence of some of the biggest stars of its time and casting many great actors in smaller parts.Take the opening courtroom sequence for instance with "Petticoat Junction's" Edgar Buchannan as the irascible judge who declares Ms. Day legally dead and then marries his "widower" to the neurotic Polly Bergen. As coincidence would have it, Doris has just returned from being shipwrecked on a desert island, shocking her mother-in-law (Thelma Ritter) who faints long enough to reveal her secret thrill that the new marriage isn't valid, sending Doris on her way to where the unlucky newlyweds are honeymooning. This creates a lot of confusion for the hotel staff once Garner is forced to get his back from the dead wife a room of her own so he can intelligently think of how he's going to get himself out of this jam.Garner is a perfect replacement for Cary Grant, equally as dashing, and very much the picture-perfect husband. While Day is more famous for her pairings with Rock Hudson, I think she had equally hot chemistry with Garner, although they only did one other film together ("The Thrill of It All", the same year as this), and only did a total of three with "the Rock". I would also rank this higher than many of her other sex comedies of the late 50's and 60's for being consistently funny and definitely much better written, not rushed together just to get another film out to take advantage of her status as top female box office star, even higher than Liz, Audrey, Sophia, Marilyn (originally assigned to do this film) and Debbie.Such comical gems as Fred Clark, Don Knotts, John Astin and Max Showalter have nice parts here, and Chuck Connors is (at least from the face down) nice to look at as the body builder Doris was stuck on an island with. There's plenty of slapstick to keep this moving at a steady pace, and a hysterical chase sequence that has Doris covered in car wash soap suds. Even if her character is a bit abrasive, Bergen adds a patheticness to her that you feel sorry for her even though it is obvious that she is fighting a losing battle. Ritter gets in a few of her typical deadpan laughs, and the children (played by Pami Lee and Leslie Farrell) are adorable. While remakes of classic screwball comedies are often a mixed bag, this one scores highly, even though the plot had been done over and over again. 1940's "Too Many Husbands" a sexually reversed version was not nearly as good as the remake, and only made more palatable with campy musical numbers as 1955's "Three For the Show".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In some ways better than "My Favorite Wife"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you may know, "Move Over Darling" is a remake of the Cary Grant/Irene Dunne film "My Favorite Wife." This film copies the original almost scene-for-scene, with a few changes. I'm torn on which film is better all around, but this version fixes a few things that bothered me about the original. First of all, the reunion between the two main stars at the hotel toward the beginning is more romantic and emotional here. Also, I didn't like the ending of the original film, which felt tagged on and unsatisfying, whereas the ending to this film wrapped everything up nicely and pleasantly. This film has much better co-stars, including Don Knotts and Thelma Ritter. The only reason I do not say for sure that this film is better than the original is the fact that the original was a very funny film, which is not to say that this is unfunny, but the comedy simply doesn't measure up to the brilliance of Cary Grant. I recommend both versions, and while the original provided more laughs, this gives more emotional satisfaction, but both are enjoyable. Just don't watch them side-by-side or you may feel like you just saw the same film twice.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Decent Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After five years lost at sea, a missing wife (Doris Day) thought long dead returns just after her husband (James Garner) remarries.For the first half of this film, we have what amounts to more or less your typical romantic comedy of the era: a man and his wife trying to reconcile after five years, with some big obstacles in their way. Hilarity ensues, and fans of Day and Garner will love it.Then comes a bit of a plot twist, which turns up the heat... and we get to see Don Knotts in a much-too-small role. How will things turn out when we find that the wife has more than a few secrets of her own? And is it even worth trying to make things work at that point?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..............making good use of some then popular film &amp; TV players.BEING THAT THIS is a remake of a highly successful movie from the early '40's, hey didn't do such a bad job at all. The most necessary bit of movie magic was in updating the setting, the gags and the execution of the plot moving on-screen happenings.MAKE NO MISTAKE about it, this movie, as well as its predecessor, MY FAVORITE WIFE, have one bit of fascinating and risqué thought at its core. That would be the scarlet letter "A" of adultery. The circumstances of the occurrence being marooned on as dessert island makes it more acceptable, though no less naughty to our rather adolescent way of seeing things in the late '60's.THIS LATTER VERSION does have much to recommend it, although the earlier film wins the battle of star power; being that the cast is headed up by the likes of Cary Grant, Irene Dunne and Randolph Scott. Stars Doris Day and James Garner are most capably backed up by: Polly Bergen, Thelma Ritter, Edgar Buchanan, Pat Harrington, Jr., SAlvy Moore and Chuck Connors.BOTH MY ASSOCIATE, Schultz and I give it a decent rating and a limited recommendation. In other words, see it, but don't go putting it on your Bucket List!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film remake with Day and Garner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the 1940 RKO comedy hit, "My Favorite Wife," 20th Century Fox wanted to remake the movie around 1960. It was to have a substantial makeover under the title, "Something's Gotta Give," and was to star Marilyn Monroe and Dean Martin. It didn't happen. In a nutshell, Monroe was fired for failing to show up at most shootings. Then Dean Martin quit if Monroe wasn't going to be in it. Finally, Monroe was back in, but she died a few days later of a barbiturate overdoseThere's a lot more to the story, and one wonders what to believe. My DVD of "Move Over, Darling," has a bonus special documentary short that delves into the movie that wasn't made and some of the sordid details. But, after seeing the original 1940 story, and then this 1963 film with Doris Day and James Garner, I can't picture a Monroe-Martin combination in the same type of story. I think it would have gone over like a lead balloon. So, with a lot of investment in the film otherwise, Fox picked it up again, dusted off and rewrote the script, and put out "Move Over Darling" in 1963. The film is a more modern version of the original, with some changes. In the original, Ellen Arden is lost at sea for seven years after the ship she was on sank. Her children were a boy and a girl. In this remake, she was lost five year after her plane crashed in the ocean. Both of her kids are girls. Both supporting casts are excellent. And, while Day and Garner are very good as Ellen and Nick Arden in this film. they are just a notch below the performances of Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in the original. The original script also is a bit more crispy and witty. One very good addition in this film is Day's character impersonating a "Svedish" nurse-masseuse. Doris Day never won an Oscar in her talented career of singing, dancing and acting. But she won Golden Globe Henrietta awards as the world's favorite female actress four separate years. The whole family should enjoy this film. It's just one of those situations when an original has such a character of its own ? with its specific cast ? that any new rendition with another cast can't quite match the humor of the first. My DVD had a bonus special that I found very interesting. It was about the origin of the story. "Enoch Arden II" was the first film of the story based on a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson. It was made as a short in 1911 by D.W. Griffith. It followed the original tragedy of the poem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move Over, Darling is an enjoyable romp with Doris Day and James Garner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When James Garner died a few days ago, I suddenly had a yen to watch some of his movies. I managed to see The Americanization of Emily a couple of days ago with my mom after checking that from the library, and when Netflix delivered this one yesterday, Mom and me saw this just a couple of hours ago. Garner plays a man about to have his previous wife-Doris Day-declared dead after five years of disappearing from a sea accident so he can then marry Polly Bergen. But Day turns up rescued by Navy officers as she surprises mother-in-law Thelma Ritter and her two girls who are no longer babies. I'll stop there and just say that there are plenty of amusing supporting turns by familiar character actors like Edgar Buchanan as a judge, Fred Clark as a hotel manager, Don Knotts as a show salesman, John Astin as an insurance man, and Chuck Connors as someone who ended up on that island with Day. Day, herself, is pretty hilarious when she disguises herself as a Swedish nurse when massaging Bergen and recounting the movie My Favorite Wife of which this was a remake. The chase at the end was a bit over-the-top but what the hell! I also liked it when Garner pretended to be injured in some scenes. So on that note, I thought Move Over, Darling was a mostly fun movie to watch as did Mom. P.S. I know this was originally supposed to be a Marilyn Monroe vehicle called Something's Got to Give and having seen the scenes that were filmed for that one, it's a shame it had to be scrapped because of her personal problems that resulted in her death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this is the remake of My Favorite Wife - an excellent comedy.It is also a remake of what was to have been Marilyn Monroe's (last) picture; Something's Got To Give.While I doubt SGTG would've gone down as one of Marilyn's best, it definitely held out promise - for both the RomCom genre, and, for Marilyn's career.A big mistake (initally passed down by 20th Century Fox) was how/why Marilyn was terminated, etc.A little known fact was Marilyn WAS rehired to finish the film - and was looking forward to it.Saying that as a preamble, the reason I get a little misty seeing MOD, is I'm very familiar with the stuff MArilyn &amp; co. shot - on the same (some, slightly redressed) sets that Doris &amp; co. use.Scenes that Marilyn played (VERY well!) with a natural femininity (and motherliness) that, while definitely sexy, were NOT 'act sexy' if you get my meaning.One scene in particular, is when Marilyn mets her children (in SGTG, a boy &amp; girl, and in MID 2 girls).Marilyn actually almost brings tears to my eyes when she played the scene, because her interaction with the children was so sincere, so maternal, it was really something to see.In MOD, it's played in a typical 'Doris' style (and, I'm NOT taking ANYTHING away from Ms. Day. I LOVE her!): a bit of silliness, and, the 'sexy' part toned down.If you're familiar with SGTG, then you can play theses comparisons in several scenes - the other being Marilyn/Doris as the masseuse, and Mariyn/Doris at the shoe store (Wit one of my all-time favorite double entendres - Marilyn asking Wally Cox to have lunch with him, and he says he eats lunch in, to which Marilyn says she'd be 'so grateful if he'd take it out.' In each of them, you can see the two women in a rare moment of comparison.I think Doris was put in MOD, and proved herself a real trooper, as this project had such 'stigma' attached to it, and I think she does the best she can.While I can see (and agree) with the comparisons others have given MOD to MFW, I try to look at this not through those eyes, but, through the eyes of what might've been, and what was.A good 1hour 21min of Doris fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming enough movie even if the original was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of My Favorite Wife, starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, which I gave a 10 to. It's been a while since I've watched it the latter though, and at first I was hard-pressed to understand why I felt I liked it better than this remake, but it soon enough came to me.Both movies are vehicles of their leading ladies and tailored to suit their characters. Hence, with Doris Day, there is more slapstick humor and her character comes across as more "cutely" petulant. Irene Dunne is classier and she has an air of benevolence. Now I love Day but with this story, I feel that Dunne's character is more appropriate. And of course Cary Grant is more charismatic than James Garner, even if the latter is pretty hot in this movie.What Move Over has going for it is the queen of wisecracking supporting actresses, Thelma Ritter, who is as fun here as any of her other movies. Also, without the disadvantageous comparison to My Favorite Wife, this movie is a charming enough romantic comedy in itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Average Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of "My Favorite Wife" follows the original fairly closely for the most part. It wisely changes the ending a little, as the last part was weak in the original. Day and Garner are well-cast in the Irene Dunne and Cary Grant roles, and there is a funny reference to the earlier film, but was this remake really necessary? Ritter is fine as Garner's frazzled mother, but Connors is not as good as Randolph Scott was in the original. This started out as a Marilyn Monroe vehicle, "Something's Gotta Give," but was abandoned after production problems and was left incomplete upon her death, replaced with this cast and crew. Interesting change from sex symbol Monroe to virginal Day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice little film, but a far cry from the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this review because I have just watched 'Move over Darling' for the first time after having been watching the original, 'My Favorite Wife' for years so I thought I'd write a review of both films and compare them.Firstly this remake is good and entertaining but not as good as the original black and white version. Although the later film does have identical dialogue in parts and James Garner and Doris Day are great in the roles, they just do not to it as good as Cary Grant and Irene Dunne done...er did. For instance, the scene where Nicholas Arden first sees his wife in the hotel lobby and he follows the lift doors closing. Hilarious and Garner does it superbly, but that was a typical Cary Grant action and no-one can do it better.The film opens with Nicholas Arden (Garner), who having lost his wife to a shipwreck five years ago, is filing his petition to get have his missing wife declared legally dead, so he can marry Bianca, a fox-clad beauty played by Polly Bergan.However, having happily made his vows and is all set to settle down with wife number two, wife number one, hilariously portrayed by Doris Day determined to get her husband, life and home back, returns after having been shipwrecked on a desert island.Garner now has to spend the rest of the movie realising that his one true love has returned and must find a kind, and considerate way to 'dump' his new bride.Add to his misery and torment, Garner's discovery that his wife has not been the lone shipwrecked victim these last five years, but has been a jungle mate to a muscle bound Adonis played by Chuck Conners, news made worse by the fact that their affectionate nicknames for each other during that time seem to have been Adam and Eve.With such 'naked' truths scratching the surface, it's not long before Garner's troubles really start as with two Mrs Arden's out and about, living, breathing, walking and talking, the authorities are starting to sit up and take notice. Bigamy is after all a crime.What is more evident in this movie is the sexual overtones which had been thoroughly censored in the first movie, but were starting to emerge more as the sixties progressed. Like Garners' attempts not only to tell his new wife of his first wife's reappearance, but his attempts to avoid having sex with her.I also like Doris Day's chat with Bianca during the massage scene where she describes 'My Favorite Wife' to draw a comparison with her own life. Her Swedish accent was a bit bad though wasn't it???Perhaps the only top marks this remake gets over it's forerunner is the title song which became Doris Day's last big hit, certainly her last top ten hit in the UK. A lovely song sung by my favourite female vocalist. In fact I preferred her talents as a singer than her talents as a comedienne, as funny as she was, which is ironic as I preferred her to see her 1940 counterpart Irene Dunne work her comedy than to sing her operettas.The one failing of both these films however is the character of Bianca, she is such a tragic figure when you think about it, she's neither nasty, vulgar, cruel, malicious or evil. Just a woman who loved a man enough to marry him, yet in both films she becomes a victim. Maybe she should have been written to be a gold-digger or a liar or a cheat, just so you don't feel so sorry for her. The Comedy can become a bit tainted and black as a result.Anyway. Not as good as the original but still a great screwball 60's sex comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day and Garner are reunited for this revamped Monroe vehicle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final film project of Marilyn Monroe, SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE, was shelved after months of dealing with the temperamental and troublesome Monroe, 20th Century Fox fired Marilyn, the film was shelved, and Marilyn was dead a few months later. The project was later revived and revamped as a vehicle for Doris Day and the result was MOVE OVER DARLING, a predictable but watchable comedy in which Doris plays Ellen Arden, a woman who has been stranded on a deserted island for five years and is finally rescued, only to return home and find that her husband has had her declared legally dead and is preparing to marry someone else. This story is as old as the hills, dating back to the old Irene Dunne comedy MY FAVORITE WIFE, but Day is always watchable and works extremely well with James Garner, who is sexy and charismatic as Ellen's husband, Nicholas. Polly Bergen is very funny as Nicholas' new fiancée, the self-absorbed Bianca and the always reliable Thelma Ritter steals every scene she is in as Nicholas'mother. The film is tamer than the original Monroe vehicle, but the material has been perfectly revamped for Doris Day and she works hard at making the film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move Over, Darling-What's the Guy Supposed to do? ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely hysterical film dealing with a guy, James Garner, who remarries only to find out that very day that first wife, Doris Day, has survived a plane crash in the jungle and has come home to him.Polly Bergen is just sensational as the 2nd wife caught up in all the mayhem.James Garner, who costarred with Day later on in "The Thrill of It All," is very good here as the victimized husband who may very well have an ax to grind himself. What was Day doing all those years on an island with Chuck Connors?The picture also allowed a re-teaming of Day with Thelma Ritter from 1959's "Pillow Talk." The always wonderful Ritter fits in beautifully in the mother-in-law role.Acting kudos to Edgar Buchanan as the harried judge and to Fred Clark, the hotel guy who must put up with the antics of Garner, Day and Bergen in the hotel. Day must have taken lessons from Loretta Young in giving an authentic Swedish accent in several scenes. Going Swedish gave Loretta a 1947 Oscar for "The Farmer's Daughter." Too bad that Garner, Day, Bergen and Buchanan were not considered for Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another delightful visit to Planet Doris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More great escapism from the queen of the feel-good film. This time Doris is paired with James Garner and, as ever, the result is a delight. Cynics will say that Planet Doris is a fake, implausible world but do I care? It's how the world should be and a real joy to visit after another stressful day at the office.Plenty of plot to cope with this time in a film that keeps you on your toes. It all has the feeling of one of those plays where characters keep emerging through different stage doors with another set of outlandish plot twists to amuse and bemuse. It's always kept just light enough to be funny yet there's enough meat in the story to involve you with the characters and, therefore, care about the twists that befall them. It's not quite as good as the Doris and Rock films, but it knocks the socks of most of the nonsense made in the last twenty years.Bottom line....wonderful and daft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the only version I have seen.... I saw how this was a remake of a remake but I never saw the other two. I wouldn't necessarily say that this movie is all that bad... I guess it could be funnier but it's one of those movies where you can still see the "lighter" side of life or the way things were back in the time it was filmed. Doris Day is cute and perky while James Garner isn't all too bad looking himself, but plays his role modestly and maintains his composure .. even though I'm sure most of us would have reacted quite differently to the situation at hand. Thelma Ritter cut in a few lines that brought a smile to my face... and seeing Don Knotts... what a treat! He certainly added to the movie. I'm not saying this movie is bad, it's not that great either but I think that Doris made better films aside from this one. But.. there again I would still watch it if I happen to get the chance to do so again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What might have been"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original MY FAVORITE WIFE is a masterpiece in screwball romantic comedy. The remake, MOVE OVER, DARLING is a minor fluff piece which can't quite find its own legs. Originally started with George Cukor directing and Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse in 1962 as SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE, MOVE OVER DARLING was cancelled, then restarted again the following year. What overshadows the production is the contemplation of "what might have been" had the original remake been fully realized. Doris Day and James Garner are nonetheless delightful as are the supporting players Polly Bergen and Don Knotts. The new version takes some of the implied sexiness of the original and plays it out in typical 1960s Technicolor sex comedies of the time (for which Doris Day seemed to churn out in her sleep). Enjoyable for its parts if not for its sum. MOVE OVER, DARLING is recommended viewing. Make sure you see Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in MY FAVORITE WIFE eventually.</fullReview>

Day and Garner are amusing, but it's the supporting cast that steal the show -- Fred Clark as the snoopy and prim hotel manager, Thelma Ritter as the wisecracking mother/mother-in-law/granny, and especially Edgar Buchanan as a hysterically grumpy judge.It's dated to its time, but it's fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chuck Connors as 'Adam' to Doris Day's 'Eve'? Surely a recipe for fun, frolics, and misunderstandings ...'Move Over Darling' is a remake of 'My Favorite Wife' which manages to surpass it. Ellen (Day), married to Nicky (James Garner, OK but she'd worked with better leading men) goes missing after a shipwreck and is declared legally dead so he can marry again. His new wife Bianca (Polly Bergen) is just as shrewy and screwy and you can well understand his just wanting a quiet life.The fur really begins to fly when Ellen returns after spending some time, alone, on an island with Stephen (Connors), a fellow traveller. There's a courtroom scene which is absolutely hysterical towards the end of the movie - don't miss it - although an earlier bit where Day goes through a car wash (in a car with no top) is well worth watching too. No one looked better rucked up and covered in soapsuds than the majestical Miss Day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smarmy then, smarmy now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caught this refugee from the Sixties on television the other evening and let's just say that time has not been kind to it. Doris Day cranked out a series of bedroom comedies during one of the most turbulent periods in American history, "Move Over, Darling" is just another in Doris' canon of "chase me, honey" farces. Even when this flick (and many others like it) were splashed over drive-in screens, they were already outdated. Between the violent upheavals in the country, the Vietnam war, the sexual revolution, and youth counter-culture among other things, Doris' antics would have been embarrassing even in the Fifties.All the bedroom farces had to offer were Cinemascope and double entendres. "Move Over" has so many smarmy, smutty, and lewd jokes (all of which fall flat) you feel like you just escaped a traveling salesman convention. The wit and sparkle found in "My Favorite Wife", upon which this travesty is based is nowhere to be seen. Doris is certainly no Irene Dunne, and although square-headedly handsome, James Garner is a poor substitute for Cary Grant. Doris is way too old for Garner, so their relationship seems off from the get-go. Also floundering in this dirty joke is Polly Bergen, acting as if she can't get out of whole mess quick enough. Fill in the rest of the cast with future TV "stars", obvious indoor sets that make the Brady Bunch's yard look real, and the beginning of Doris' infatuation with terrible dynel wigs that look like white cotton candy. The whole movie looks cheap, no better than a high school play. The incessant sex jokes and innuendo drag everything down as soon as the cartoon opening credits unspool.One of the strangest fixtures in these sort of farces is the insertion of at least one "gay" joke. "Move Over" has two: future Laugh-In resident flamer Alan Sues mincing around in a non-speaking role as a court clerk, and Don Knotts. Knotts is first seen fluffing a chiffon scarf around a woman's shoe display, in an entirely lavender surrounding. He also minces, but is soon revealed as a ladies' man when Doris picks him up. It is to be supposed that audiences loved a good chuckle at the nervous nellies on display, but this sort of cheap joke went out of style in the Forties. Still, every one of Doris' movies in this genre contain at least one such scene. Perhaps the director thought it was "hip", but we'll never really know. This is a movie best forgotten and left on the shelf as a curiosity. It's nearly impossible to sit through, so watch at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only some comedies were tightened up and shortened a bit, they would be laugh riots from start to finish. 'Move Over, Darling' has that potential. Day and Garner are first rate comedic talents and come off very well together. The movie's pace is usually snappy; there's some great comedic support from the supporting cast. And the storyline is hilarious.But the film tends too often to slow down and linger. And suffers from being ten to fifteen minutes overly long. Regardless, though, there are many wonderfully funny scenes to enjoy.</fullReview>

I remember this movie as excessively lowbrow, almost vaudeville. It really works hard to make you laugh, without offering any insights about anything. That in itself it can be irresistibly hilarious. We often laugh at someone straining to be funny. Boy does this movie strain, and strain and strain. Laughter is a noble profession. We don't want to be highbrow all the time.

		<shortDescription>Irene Dunne, Marilyn Monroe and Doris Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw the original version of "My Favorite Wife" starring Irene Dunne, Cary Grant, Randolph Scott and Gale Patrick. Through the years, I have collected practically all of the scenes that Marilyn Monroe filmed for the sequel, "Something's Gotta Give" with Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse and I own the last version, "Move Over, Darling" starring Doris Day, James Garner, Polly Bergen and Chuck Conners.Quite frankly, I didn't like any of them. "Wife" is rather dated and was considered "cute" when it came out to favorable reviews. "Something" was never finished because of an inept Marilyn Monroe who proved once again that she was no professional and ended up getting fired. The script was dusted off a year later, after Marilyn's death, and Doris Day, the #1 Box Office Star in the World, stepped in and filmed "Move Over," without a hitch, and the picture became a big hit, but was met with mixed reviews.The director, Michael Gordon, must have put a lot of pressure on his actors to "make this one funny". Doris Day had a couple of very funny scenes, despite the mostly unfunny proceedings. Her scene in the department store with Don Knotts was wonderful. Comparing Marilyn's try in the same scene with Wally Cox, which was awful, Doris was brilliant. Shown on tv, this scene is always cut for some strange reason. Boy, is it needed. She was also good in the car wash scene, proving once again that she will do anything for a laugh.Edgar Buchanan was very funny as the absent-minded judge and Thelma Ritter was in her usual form: great. James Garner was just loud and Polly Bergen, a bit too "obvious" for my taste.The stylist who did Doris Day's hair and wigs must have just gotten out of the insane asylum. They changed her hair, mid scene, and changed it back. Maybe they shot the scene twice with different hair and spliced them together. Anyway! So you won't go crazy if you see it, the scene is when she asks Garner, "did you tell her that you loved her?" during his honeymoon with Bergen.Chuck Conners seemed to be having a ball, but there wasn't much to his part.Perhaps Marilyn Monroe's version would have been alright if she had completed the film. As Tony Randall said of her, "if you were standing there watching her do a scene, you'd say 'awful, she'll never get by...but the next day when you saw the rushes, MAGIC on the screen'"! Randall had high praise for Miss Day calling her 'brilliant'. But, in "Move Over, Darling" she was just adequate.</fullReview>

Sounds plausible to me! Polly Bergen is totally miscast, screeching and screaming her way through the entire movie. The same can be said for Doris' performance too. Besides being too many, how many bedroom comedies did she crank out? The car wash and chase "scene" were way too long and unfunny, with hokey 1960's sound effects that I've heard used on Saturday morning cartoons. James Garner seems to be the only saving grace to this film, never looking as dashing and suave as he does here. Made me wonder why his character would want to hang around either of the two "screaming Mimi's" in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake Does Not Get To Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy Writer/Director Leo McCarey originally filmed this as My Favorite Wife with Carey Grant starring. The original is better. This one while it has a talented cast has several things that handicapped it's success.There was a shadow over the production as it originally started filming with Marilyn Monroe in 1962 as Somethings Got To Give. Marilyn died before it could be completed so it was re-shot with Doris Day replacing Marilyn.This redo relies too much on tung-in-cheek comedy trading on the Doris Day clean &amp; pure image while not enough on the comedy. The film does not take enough advantage of James Garner who is in peak form but not given enough to do in this version of the film. Even in the 1960's this formula story is wearing out as social changes had already happened making the plot seem trivial. Hetrosexuals in the 1960's were trying to cast off the bonds of marriage so they could swing and be more free. This movie still acts like the values which are being replaced are still in place. That is even a bigger problem with My Favorite Wife now, but this one, while planted firmly tung-in-cheek for comedy, doesn't hit the bullseye often enough.If your a Day or Garner fan this is good. If your interested, the incomplete Monroe version of this from 1962 is available too as well as the Grant version from 1940.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might have been a lot different were it called "Something's Got to Give" had Marilyn Monroe not been sacked from what might or might not have been her final film. So many 'what if's'. Instead, it became a vehicle for Doris Day, playing the part Irene Dunne played in "My Favourite Wife", of which this is a mildly entertaining, mildly funny remake. None of it rings true, but then farces usually don't and this is a farce which is why we wish it were funnier.In this one Day is chirpy rather than starchy but is prone to mugging, (something she was inclined to do from time to time). The husband who has just remarried, (Day has 'come back from the dead'; she was marooned on a desert island, presumed drowned), is James Garner who was a much finer comedian than he was given credit for. Polly Bergen, looking uncomfortable, is the new wife and Thelma Ritter, as ever, steals the picture as the mother-in-law.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked "Pillow Talk" about as well as possible, both as a fun movie of any period, and particularly among these antiseptic "bedroom farces" as made 45/50/60-years-ago. Both Doris Day and James Garner are likable personalities, but in this film two positives somehow resulted in a negative.After viewing it again, I could only recall that both Doris and Polly Bergen spent more time screeching than talking normally throughout the production.Those commercials which one sees, where some kid uses words far beyond the capabilities of even a child with a 200 IQ, or where the cavemen speak like William F. Buckley in those awful insurance ads -- take what was intended as "clever" or "cute," far over the line, to "annoying."However, in this flick, there are several - all too many - moments of this. And the part where Doris assumes the identity as the Swedish nurse, in scenes with both Jim and Polly (her "accent" makes one wish you could hear fingernails scraping over a chalkboard as an alternative) ----- this takes clever and cute to the annoying level where suicide can be contemplated by the viewer. Doris chewed more scenery than a horde of beavers unleashed in a redwood forest.The movie/story, originally, was partially filmed, with Marilyn Monroe and Dean Martin in the two lead roles, Cyd Charisse in Polly's, and Tom Tryon in Connors'. It was never completed, due to Marilyn's suspension, and then her subsequent sudden death. In seeing this picture, I couldn't help but believe that Monroe's more whimsical persona, and Dean's more low-key style, would have made a much more enjoyable presentation. And Cyd Charisse would have been preferable to Bergen's squawking presence here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caught this last night. I'm aware of the aborted Marilyn Monroe version, and recognized some parts of this from that. My big problem with this was the character development, more specifically, the 180 Nick does. He was so anxious to marry Bianca, he has Ellen declared legally dead. But when Ellen suddenly shows up out of nowhere, he can't kick Bianca to the curb fast enough! If the movie showed him conflicted, not knowing what to do, I could have gotten on board with it. Instead, Nick was such a jerk, I was hoping that he'd wind up alone!Polly Bergen was terribly miscast. She simply has a toughness that works against her trying to sell the fragile Bianca as the real victim here. Heck, she's more into her shrink than she ever was into Nick!Garner was better than I imagine Dean Martin would have been in the Monroe version, but I couldn't help but think that another actor would have been better than Garner.Don Knotts was simply creepy. I don't know if that was due to the hack, sorry, director behind the camera or a sample of Knotts's range, but his take was completely wrong.As for Doris, nobody does self-righteous indignation like Doris. In "Pillow Talk," her outbursts were perfect because they were totally justified. But here, they're just plain childish. Ellen has nothing to be cheesed about. Her getting worked up over Bianca made no sense, and the car wash episode made her look like a loon instead of an otherwise level-headed woman wanting nothing more than to return to her family.What saves this from being a total waste is Thelma Ritter as Nick's mother. I liked how she and Doris have a grown-up relationship; Ellen calls her Grace instead of Mrs. Arden, unlike Samantha on "Bewitched" who always called Darin's mother Mrs. Stephens. And Grace knows all along what's best for her boy. You go, girl!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't work up much enthusiasm for this uninspired remake of MY FAVORITE WIFE from the screwball era of comedy in the 1930s.They should have let the dust settle when the first attempt starring MARILYN MONROE and DEAN MARTIN (with CYD CHARISSE as the other woman) was shut down because of Monroe's death.This was re-worked to suit DORIS DAY and JAMES GARNER, and while it's not terrible, it's not terribly good either.It's the old one about the missing wife who was shipwrecked on a desert island for years with another man, who turns up trying to resume her life with hubby but discovers he's engaged to another woman. Day and Garner are old hands at this sort of thing, and yet the sparkle seems to be missing due to some non too witty lines and ridiculously overplayed situations (as in the car wash scene).It's just passable as comedy--not one of the best from Doris Day and certainly Garner has had better roles elsewhere. POLLY BERGEN has the thankless task of being disagreeable which she carries off to perfection. THELMA RITTER was funnier in other broad comedy roles.Summing up: Not worth the round trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irritating remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of the superior 1940 film "My Favorite Wife"starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne as his recently un-deceasedwife.Unfortunately, I'm not particularly fond of the 1940 version. Either.It's one of those screwball movies that would have wrapped up inthe first 30 minutes if the male lead had a backbone and could spitout the truth (that premise holds for many Flintstones episodestoo). However, "My Favorite Wife" had the benefit of screwballveterans Grant and especially Dunne, who knew how to have a fitwithout making the audience hate her. Even though the originaltook place in the late 30's/early 40's, you believed that Dunne wascompletely capable of taking care of herself and was having a bitof fun torturing her remarried husband even though she was stillcompletely smitten with him.That said, "Move Over" does nothing but copy scenes from theoriginal with a few tweaks here and there. I know that's how aremake works, but in this case, you're left with the feeling of "whybother?" The courtroom scene, while funny in the original, didn'telicit one chuckle in the remake. The added car chase was absurdand only served to reinforce the stereotype of "women drivers." Ican't begin to tell you about the awful car wash scene and DorisDay's irritating shrieking. The remade final reunion lacked thefeeling of anticipation or joy as in the original, but did include Day'shoarse shrieks. She was hoarse, no doubt, from all thescreaming, shrieking and yelling she'd done in the previous 2hours of the film.Day's portrayal of her character as basically helpless but withrighteous indignation, screaming outbursts, stamping feet andnear sobbing would have been better suited for a 2-year-old. WhenI was 2, if I had acted like that I would have been spanked and sentto bed without any dinner.James Garner was very bland and it wasn't clear how he couldhave gotten 2 women to marry him. Actually, his character was soboring that I barely remember him even though the movie ended20 minutes ago, except when he was shouting in order to beheard above Day.The best part of this remake is watching the trampoline/divingroutine put on by Chuck Connors. Or maybe it was a stunt double.Either way, it's not worth putting up with the rest of this mess. If thestoryline intrigues you, do yourself a favor and rent theGrant/Dunne original. At least there won't be any shrieking.</fullReview>
