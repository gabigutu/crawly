		<shortDescription>Tremendous fun, if not the sharpest screwball specimen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some lovely, touching and dryly amusing scenes in this film. Kanin and the scriptwriters manage to form a substantive, if occasionally gossamer light, whole out of the playing of fine leads and canny comic incidents. The basic story may be the oldest of chestnuts, but it is here embellished with some degree of incisiveness. Grant's scene by the pool with Dunne and Scott reaches a fine pitch of hilarity, and who can forget the impressionistic scene of Scott's diving coming into Grant's mind and being presented in miniature on-screen? That master player of light, witty material, Grant, is of course sublime, and I was surprised by Irene Dunne - who I had never previously seen in a lead film role. She was magnificently feline, as Pauline Kael says; dispensing slinky, fluttering phrases and quips, and making it clear what a laugh the character is having; she seems rather to be getting off on the entangled situation. The speech patterns are drolly created by Dunne; wonderful Southern hamming, or archetypal screwball dame quick-talk... Her warming, gadding-about voice is charms, along with deft facial acting; look at the "Oh Bianca..." scene at the hotel early on, where she sensuously reclines on a settee and gets Grant to pretend he is entering the room and kissing his new wife. Minxish mischief of the most heartwarming kind, aye...! Remarkable to think that Ms. Dunne was over forty when this was made. She has the bearing of many years younger and conveys an impressive vigour. One takes to her unconventional good looks; her slight awkwardness as a 'star' is amusingly alluded to, under the surface, in her son's dialogue late on; very poignant little moment, that. Like Rosalind Russell and Kate Hepburn, she is no textbook beauty, and it is her characterful playing conveys a winking, winning attractiveness. Why is it that we have so few similarly idiosyncratic actresses around today? All - or rather much - has to be homogenised; pop star product looks are apparently required, and conveyor-belted into mainstream films. Film is missing the enticing depths of real-life when it opts for the conformist teenage boy's supposed 'dream woman' - mass-media-fostered - over a greater variety of people and appearances, as one encounters in actual reality.The actor playing the world-weary, rather Robb Wilton-esquire magistrate ought to have been involved more than he was; an enjoyable turn, that would have been effectively woven deeper into the narrative. Randolph Scott amused slightly too, in his support role; a worthy foil. Things did perhaps get rather sentimental with the involvement of the couple's children, although this is hardly the worst such offender in Hollywood history. The insidious wryness seems completely blunted by the end, when the couple are finally reconciled. One may be charmed by the actors' performances, but it all starts to seem a bit indulgent, and the feeling grows that chances were missed.But really, one must be indulgent, critically; there is priceless stuff in this film's fibre, and while it fires not on all screwball-comedy cylinders, it is a very pleasant feature with glorious screen presences making (deceptively) light of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree that Move Over Darling is a very good remake of My Favorite Wife, but Doris Day and James Garner, much as I like them, cannot reach the level of sophistication of Grant/Dunne. Randolph Scott does nothing to detract from the picture. Certainly no more than Chuck Connors does in the same role in Move Over Darling. The courtroom scenes with Grant and Granville Bates as the judge are superior, and Donald McBride as the hotel clerk is exceptional. Cary Grant's facial expression on the elevator when he first sees Dunne after 7 years is so memorable that I can still remember it 35 years after first seeing it. If you are a Grant fan, you have to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening moments, when the big wooden doors part and usher us into a beautifully spare art deco courtroom with slanting shafts of sunlight enhancing the clean architectural lines, we know that this is going to be a deftly-made, elegant film. What follows does not disappoint us.Attorney Nick Arden (Cary Grant) lost his wife Ellen in a shipwreck in the Pacific seven years ago. He has now decided to have her declared officially dead, so that he will be free to marry Bianca (Gail Patrick). The irascible judge eventually accedes to both the declaration and the marriage, and the newly-weds set off for a honeymoon in Yosemite. Meanwhile, who should turn up at the Arden residence, very much alive, but the long-lost Ellen? When she hears of the recent marriage, she heads straight for the honeymooners' hotel ..."My Favourite Wife" is a fine example of those early Cary Grant farces, the ones in which he gawps with surprise, double-takes and mutters to himself as only he can. Irene smoke-gets-in-your-eyes Dunn is great as Ellen, unveiling a hitherto unsuspected gift for witty comedy. Scotty Beckett and Mary Lou Harrington come close to stealing the show as the Ardens' cute little kids. Randolph Scott is interestingly cast as Steve Burkett, the muscle-bound Adonis who spent seven years on the desert island with Ellen.Some of the film's highlights are worth mentioning here, like the superimposition of Burkett performing gymnastic feats alongside Nick Arden's troubled face as he muses at his desk, conveying with economy the husband's jealous preoccupation. It is unfair to give away a film's jokes, but one gag which lose nothing in the telling is Ellen's outfit at the Yosemite hotel. She has been out of circulation for seven years, and she looks comically untrendy in her 1932 polkadots and lapels, and obtrusive hat. Watch for the derisive glances from the other hotel guests.Such a light, charming piece of entertainment is hard to fault, but the film does have some shortcomings. Its central problem, which is not resolved, is what to do with Bianca. She married Nick in good faith and has done nothing wrong, yet she is neglected by Nick. Because there is no satisfactory way of dealing with her, she is simply dropped. Ellen's return from a watery grave after all those years would be a news story of international importance, but instead she arrives home having hitched a ride in a truck. Her entry into the country seems to have gone unannounced, even to her husband. The scene in which she persuades a shoe store clerk to pose as 'Adam' in front of Nick has enormous comic potential, but is abandoned after a few seconds. Nick's sleeping-in-the-attic scene is far too long for the humour it contains.However, the film is a pleasant and very amusing romp, and such weaknesses as it contains do not detract from its appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Screwball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...albeit a little slow-paced in the first half. Leo McCarey's chaotic pace which made The Awful Truth so much fun is missed here, but Garson Kanin directs capably in his absence and the script and actors deliver enough good wit and chemistry to keep it all balanced out in the end.Cary Grant gets himself into an unwitting romantic pickle when he's confronted by his thought to be long dead wife on his honeymoon with his new bride. Hilarity ensues, as it does in every brilliant screwball comedy Grant was the star of, and there are some priceless moments along the way.As in The Awful Truth, Grant and Irene Dunne make a fetching and compatible screen couple. Dunne's comedic felinity and tendency to affect nutty stereotypes in order to get what she wants is better than Katharine Hepburn's imitation of her in Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story. Grant and Hepburn were terrific in their movies together too, and not taking anything away from Great Kate, but Grant and Dunne's chemistry was just that much better and it's a shame they never made more comedies together.Hilarious in-jokey scenes between Grant and Randolph Scott, and a near scene stealing turn by Granville Bates as The Judge round out a pretty funny flick. The Doris Day/James Garner remake "Move Over, Darling" is memorable in its own right and viewed right after this would make for a good video double-bill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant makes this the best of the numerous versions of the script -- later attempted as SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE (Marilyn Monroe's last film) and remade as MOVE OVER, DARLING.Just the expressions Grant has on his face make this worth watching. It's a delightful look at him in a classic comic predicament -- a man who thinks his first wife is dead discovers on his honeymoon night with his second wife that wife #1 is still amongst the living. The next complication: she has spent 7 years with another man -- and Grant gets to do his best as the jealous husband.This is just plain funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Use of the Idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gets pretty good comic mileage out of the often-used 'Enoch Arden' (or, as here, 'Ellen Arden') idea of the long-lost spouse who returns to find his/her spouse now involved with someone else. Numerous movies have used it both for drama and for comedy, and in this case, the premise is adapted to the screwball comedy formula that was so popular for a time in the 1930s and 1940s.The story starts by slightly revising the usual setup, with Irene Dunne as the formerly shipwrecked spouse, Cary Grant as the husband who has since become involved with another woman (Gail Patrick), plus Randolph Scott as a wild card in the relationships. Practically every stage of the story is highly implausible (probably deliberately so) but amusing, and it is generally left to the cast to make things work, which they usually do.Grant usually seems quite at home in this kind of comedy, and he and Dunne work well together, depicting their characters' relationship with the kinds of intangibles that help make the whole scenario more believable. Patrick is always quite good as an elegantly icy rival to the heroine, and Scott also works well here in his role. Amongst the supporting cast, Granville Bates gets some very good moments as the grouchy judge.For as far-fetched as the scenario seems at times, it works pretty well. The cast is strong enough to carry the weight, and it would have been hard to improve upon their combination of talents. It doesn't have quite the depth of comic variety or the subtlety of implied commentary that the best screwball comedies have, but it's an entertaining movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his shipwrecked wife is declared dead and he takes on a new wife, Grant's first wife resurfaces, rescued after seven years on an island. This reteaming of Grant and Dunne after their success with "The Awful Truth" is pretty funny for the most part, as Grant tries to solve the problem of one wife too many while dealing with jealousy after learning that Dunne had a male companion (Scott) on that island. The only complaint is that the laughs stop in the last quarter of the movie, which is rather uninteresting as the focus shifts from comedy to romance. Bates, who is hilarious as a flustered judge, died in July 1940 but managed to act in 12 films released that year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A curious one that leaves a mildly bitter taste in the mouth. It's funny alright (but never hilarious), and the acting from - and chemistry between - Irene Dunne and Cary Crant is exquisite as always. But the film's fundamental problem is that none of the characters are particularly likable. Throughout the film three of the four main characters take their turn to behave despicably, yet the new wife - a woman who's merely unpleasant - is the villain of the piece; constantly the butt of jokes and fair game for ridicule even though she's done absolutely nothing to warrant it. At times it's like watching two spoilt brats from the Hamptons bullying their visiting second-cousin from the Bronx.The script is also strangely stunted, best witnessed in the scenes before the judge. They really should have been classic screwball moments - the ingredients were there - yet between the lengthy silences and repetitive parrot-dialogue it falls almost completely flat. The gaping plot holes and poor script continuity can't be forgiven either, even allowing for the fact the film's seventy years old.Don't get me wrong, I laughed, and I enjoyed myself, and I thought it was a decent film. It's just that the character's actions don't stand up too well under scrutiny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's Two Timing Who</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant's got a real problem on his hands. He thinks his wife was killed in a plane crash seven years ago. So he goes to court with Gail Patrick who he now intends to marry after getting the judge to declare Irene Dunne legally dead.Wouldn't you know it, Dunne turns up the day of the honeymoon and puts Cary in an awful pickle. He's a lawyer and he's busy trying to work out all the ramifications of what's happened. I've thought about it for a while and I came to the conclusion that it's Grant's professional training that prevents him from just confessing to one and all what's happened. Where a lot of the laughs come in is Grant trying to avoid marital consummation with Patrick until he can work it out.Another factor comes into play when Grant learns that Dunne spent several years on the desert island with hunky Randolph Scott. Grant starts to feel a little less guilty then.The whole mess is dumped on the judge who originally declared Dunne legally dead, Granville Bates. His role as the judge gives him some of the best lines in My Favorite Wife.I do feel sorry for Gail Patrick though. Usually she plays a lot of bad girls and other women in movies. But she really is the wronged party here.Dunne and Grant worked well together in another marital comedy, The Awful Truth and they were just as bright in My Favorite Wife as they were in the first film.One interesting footnote it was a remake of this film Something's Gotta Give that Marilyn Monroe did not complete. Eventually it was made over with Doris Day and James Garner.That one was good, but this one is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shakespearian masterpiece of farce.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Garson Kanin's best films are so bright, fast and funny, and have been plundered by so many pallid, feel-good imitators, that it's easy to overlook how courageously critical they can be, of prevailing social norms, for instance, what society takes to be normal - 'natural' - about crucial concepts like family, gender, marriage etc. In 'My Favorite wife', Kanin takes the idea that a particular social order is natural, and tears it apart, by putting civilisation on one side, nature on the other, and revealing that there's nothing remotely natural about civilisation, or our places in it; that these things are man-made, and so can be questioned, negotiated, even changed by man (or, as is more usual in Kanin's world, woman).'Wife' opens with an elaborate sequence showing the structure of civilisation at work in its most intrinsic form - the legal system. The hero is a lawyer, and is trying to declare his missing first wife dead so he can marry another. There are a few things we notice here: the judge is hilarious, a cantankerous old buffer, testy, capricious, and not at all rigorous, or even knowledgeable in his application of laws which, after all, structure people's lives, and which, we learn, are constantly overturned by the Court of Appeals, so that something that should be inviolable is shown to be provisional. there is room for manoeuvre, but there is also room for corruption.More important for Kanin's purposes are two incidental details. The wife has been missing for seven years, a fairy-tale or mythical number in a site of legal process, undermining its claims to ultimate, 'official' reality. The hero's name is Arden, which might remind us of Shakespeare's Forest ('As you like it'), and the spirit of play that will inform the film, with people assuming and discarding roles, putting on costumes, using props, putting on 'plays' or performances to deceive, enlighten or outmanoeuvre others. On one level, this warns us against accepting appearances in a civilised world that depends on appearances (all the talk about respectability); on another, it shows that certain roles - like being a mother, or husband - aren't God-given, but roles which have to be constantly rehearsed and refined. Play can be subversive - the way Ellen Arden dresses up as a man, breaks up a marriage, or tries to conceal a possible adultery - but it is also seen as a necessary process of socialisation: the children learn to imitate their parents, as they theatrically make their lost mother 'perform' her confession. They learn that society is fluid, not fixed; they also learn to lie. (the hero winds up in an Attic (as in Greek comedy), but that might be taking the analogy to far!)Hitchcock once said that he often used Cary Grant because he wanted to work against his established image. But the figure of masculine immaturity and insecurity so richly realised in Roger O Thornhill ('North by Northwest') is already fully-formed here in a 'hero' who jumps at any chance to avoid making difficult decisions. Kanin, like Hitchcock later, makes brilliant, ironic use of Grant's most famous previous roles: 'Topper', another story about a professional flustered by a 'ghost'; and, especially, 'Bringing up baby', not just in the comically ghastly leopardskin bathrobe his second wife buys him, but in the animal imagery used throughout (kids going to the zoo; Steve as Tarzan etc.), contrasting with his civilised world that is making him desperately unhappy, his identity and masculine certainty fragmenting. (knowledge that Grant used to live with Randolph Scott adds further comic potency to their scenes) This conflict between Nick's civilisation and the 'natural' order is typically complicated - Nick clearly married Bianca for her sexual prowess; Ellen and Nick are compatible because of their intellectual superiority to everyone else (which gives a streak of cruelty to their games, and makes one feel genuinely sorry for BIanca). 'Wife' is a masterpiece of farce, of shared rooms, opening and shutting doors, frustrated sexuality, mixed identities - but what makes it a true classic are the flashes of whimsy - the Steve diving sequence that results in some the most bizarre, incongruous, and sidesplittingly funny visions ever seen on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth Is This Grant/Dunne Vehicle Is No "Awful Truth"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This romantic screwball comedy tries to recapture the zany chemistry shared between Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in "The Awful Truth," but the final product falls somewhat flat.Something's just missing this time around, and it's a shame, because the story has serious screwball potential. Dunne plays Grant's supposedly dead wife, who shows up alive just after Grant has remarried. The rest of the movie is about Grant promising to tell his new wife (Gail Patrick) about his old one and finding ways out of it, and then getting jealous when the man (Randolph Scott) who shared seven years with Dunne on a deserted island when they both were supposed to be dead reenters the picture and threatens to steal Dunne away. The premise is dynamite, but the humour feels somewhat strained and many of the jokes fall flat. It doesn't help that Grant's character is a bit of a weenie, and the new wife, who we're supposed to think is a bitch but whom the film never establishes as such, comes across as a victim, which makes Grant's and Dunne's antics feel more mean than funny.There is a memorable conclusion though that finds Dunne in bed and Grant dressed as Santa Claus.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so this has been done and done, but quite delightfully done was this attempt. I did not, however, enjoy the fact that Cary Grant's character lies throughout this film. It was very off putting to see Cary Grant just boldly and clearly lying to his wives scene after scene.That having been said, getting past that off-putting element, the performances are witty and clever, delivering a natural human feeling, even when in tongue-in-cheek mode. The twists are eye brow-raising and cleverly written, incorporated in an otherwise enchanting story.All in all? I wish they had written these characters more forthright. The comedic elements could still have worked, and it would not leave fans wondering how much of the dishonest elements should be associated with their favorite star? I like this, but cannot love it. As such, it rates a 5.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Screwball Comedy with Dislikeable Leads?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a great fan of black-and-white 1940's screwball comedy but "My Favorite Wife" is far from being one of my own favourites. The playing is fine and there's some decent dialogue; the problem for me is that not only don't I relate to the characters, I actually feel hostility towards the leads! Both Nick and Ellen are self-centred, selfish, and manipulative ? how someone can come back from a desert island thankfully saved after seven years and immediately become so devious, almost malevolent, I can't imagine. My difficulties are compounded by the treatment of Bianca - were she drawn as some sort of gorgon then she would be getting her comedy comeuppance, but she is in fact characterised as an innocent party stuck between the other two's unpleasant manoeuvring so that the treatment she suffers doesn't raise the expected smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-notch romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two attempted remakes and dozens of rip offs have failed to diminish the hilarious complications and romantic musings of this often-imitated, never duplicated screwball farce. Loosely based on the Alfred Lord Tennyson poem "Enoch Arden" (Tennyson does not receive a screen credit in the finished film), MY FAVORITE WIFE piles on the fast-paced, snappy dialogue and outrageous, comedic misunderstandings at a frantic rate. Director Garson Kanin skillfully maintains the perfect serio-comedic tone throughout the film's runtime, and the picture is easily respected screenwriter's best film as a director. Interestingly enough, Kanin took over the directing duties from Leo McCarey (an Oscar winner as Best Director for 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH, which also starred Grant and Dunne) after McCarey was injured in an automobile accident (McCarey also co-wrote the screenplay with Kanin and Sam and Bella Spewack).The cast is marvelous, topped by yet another Oscar-worthy performance by Irene Dunne, who offers a multi-dimensional portrayal in a genre where one-note characterizations typically run rampant. Dunne was indeed a rare actress who could peerlessly balance madcap humor and genuine pathos, without ever appearing forced or contrived. Cary Grant is every bit Dunne's match as the befuddled husband who finds himself with one wife too many. Although his role doesn't permit him to display the jaw-dropping physical prowess that was showcased so remarkably in THE AWFUL TRUTH, Grant's mastery of internal comedy is given ample screen time here - especially in the final two-third when he discovers he may have a romantic rival.The supporting cast is also diligently cast, although there's no animal scene-stealer, a la canine performer Asta's memorable turn as Mr. Smith in THE AWFUL TRUTH. Platinum-haired beefcake Randolph Scott is fun as Grant's rival for Dunne's affections, and the fact that Grant and Scott were lifelong friends and roommates only makes their scenes together even funnier (there's also a hilarious sight gag involving the two of them that will have even the most reserved viewer rolling on the floor with laughter). The appropriately rigid Gail Patrick plays the role of the stereotypical shrew as well as anyone could, and director Kanin also pulls natural performances from the two children in the cast. A comedy with a large dosage of wit and an ample amount of intelligence is quite rare, and MY FAVORITE WIFE has all of that and more in abundance - it's simply a picture where everything works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a Portugese freighter rescues her off an island in the Pacific, Irene Dunne returns to her husband and children seven years later--only to find spouse Cary Grant has only recently gotten remarried. Fans of Doris Day's 1963 screwball farce "Move Over, Darling" will find this original version of the story lacking in zesty humor. Director Garson Kanin keeps the comic confusion light on its feet, yet the results are possibly too sober (it's a dizzy farce without any fizz). Dunne and Grant are more like joshing pals than husband and wife, and their two tots are a little brash (there's a terrible interlude where the kids entertain the grown-ups, and the reaction shots of Grant look as though they were edited in from another movie). The wrap-up is over-stretched, cooling out all the fire from this scenario, and poor Randolph Scott (who shared the island with Dunne) is given the short shrift. There are some funny scenes, and merry musical cues which help pick up the slack, but this is an instance where the remake improves upon the original. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guffawed watching the remake ("Move Over Darling"). The original version seemed pale. Everyone seemed too polite and relaxed to be really funny. But after repeated viewing I began to appreciate this version too. The plot strains credulity: Man about to marry when his wife appears after seven years of absence. The second wife is conveniently vain and insufferable, and easy to dump. So, why is he marrying her in the first place? But comedy is built on implausibility. No big laughs in this one, just enjoyable, wholesome comedy. More high-brow than the remake, it prefers tongue in cheek than tongue out of cheek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Mr. Arden thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Favorite Wife" is a brilliantly witty romance comedy starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant. Attorney Nick Arden (Grant) goes to civil court for two reasons: 1.) to declare his first wife Ellen (Dunne), whom he loved with all his heart, legally dead from being shipwrecked and supposedly drowned seven years prior, and 2.) to get married again, this time to a woman named Bianca (Gail Patrick), for whom he never held a high regard. Meanwhile Ellen, who has NOT drowned, returns home, finds out about Nick's remarriage, and shows up at the hotel where Nick and Bianca plan to spend their honeymoon. From then on, Nick's life becomes a series of complications, cover-ups, and embarrassments, which is what makes "My Favorite Wife" such a joyous picture to watch.Here are my favorite moments from this charming movie (but please DO NOT read any further until after you have actually seen it). At the honeymoon hotel in Yosemite, Nick spots Ellen for the first time just after he and Bianca enter the elevator; as the door closes, Nick humorously moves his body to one side as he stares at Ellen through the increasingly narrow door opening. In trying to cover up for his lengthy absence from his honeymoon suite, Nick has a frantic phone conversation with Bianca in which he fumbles his words trying to make her believe he has left on a plane, not realizing that Bianca is only two phone booths away from him! When Nick learns that Ellen spent seven years on a desert island with a man named Stephen Burkett (Randolph Scott), Nick decides to pay a visit to the Pacific Club where Burkett resides, and he becomes horrified at the sight of Burkett's tall, rock-solid athletic frame as he performs a gymnastic workout above the pool. (The fact that this scene is accompanied by a familiar Strauss waltz makes it so much funnier!) Later on, Nick cannot concentrate in his law office as he sees images of Burkett's flashy performance. Back at the Pacific Club, Nick catches Ellen's conscience by proving that he knows who Burkett really is (the mischievous Ellen had earlier tried to fool Nick by having a very short-statured shoe salesman, played by Chester Clute, pose as Burkett in order to prove to Nick that there was nothing going on between Ellen and Stephen during their seven-year stay on the island); Ellen can only react to her little failed prank by laughing hysterically at herself. A visiting psychiatrist (Pedro de Cordoba) spots Nick grabbing some clothes for Ellen, but the doctor believes that the women's garments Nick selects are meant for a man, especially when Nick tries on the clothes himself! The most heartwarming scene in this picture is that of Ellen almost in tears when she realizes that her two children Timmy (Scotty Beckett) and Chinch (Mary Lou Harrington) know that she is their mother. And finally, the sight of Nick in a Santa Claus suit confirms that he and Ellen no longer need to fib to each other about their happiness in resuming their marriage together.Last but not least, the casting of "My Favorite Wife" could not have been better. Irene Dunne was absolutely the perfect choice to play the lovable, mischievous, sweet-natured Ellen Wagstaff Arden, who loves her husband, adores her two children, and is full of playful pranks. The handsome Cary Grant, one of my favorite actors, was a wise choice for the role of the hilariously befuddled Nick Arden. Randolph Scott was quite appropriate for the part of the tall, lean, muscular, smiling Stephen Burkett, who is not above displaying his macho side to win Ellen's heart, but who also hides a large heart himself in understanding Ellen's faithfulness to Nick. And finally, Gail Patrick was perfect for the role of Nick's second wife Bianca, a cold, sensitive, high-strung woman almost devoid of personality, showing virtually no affection for the two Arden children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The silliness of Cary Grant being too embarrassed and afraid of hurting his bride's feelings to tell her what happened--and the screwball results--gives way at the end to an interesting play of sexual tension between husband and wife as the wife refuses to give "privileges" till her husband affirms, not just his passion, but his commitment to her and the family. For a comic but sophisticated peek at what men and women need from each other, it joins Friendly Persuasion and The Quiet Man.Casting is excellent--you can't feel very sorry for the wronged bride or for the cheerful disappointed suitor; the kids are funny, neither sentimentalized nor smart alecky; the judge and hotel manager are gems; and Cary Grant and Irene Dunne manage to generate sparks while seeming as comfortable together as old shoes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful diversion on a rainy day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Irene Dunne star in this nice little romantic comedy. They are both good in the film and Grant has a few nice moments. He was a great comedic actor and not afraid to make fun of himself or put himself in some pretty silly situations in this film and others. Randolph Scott (Grant's real-life room mate when they were getting started in the business) is pretty good too as a vegetarian Tarzan who has spent 7 years on a deserted island with Grant's wife Dunne. She shows up the day Grant has her declared legally dead and marries the tempting but vapid Bianca (Gail Patrick). The funniest moments are provided in the courtroom with Granville Bates as the bewildered judge who tries to make sense of the comic situation, and in a hotel with Donald MacBride as the hotel clerk, dismayed and in awe of Grant at the same time, trying to juggle his new bride and his wife in two different suites. Ordinary people would not resolve the situations in this movie the way it plays out, but then it wouldn't have been much of a movie or as much fun if they had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Long in the Bottle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has sometimes occurred to me that screen comedy may have a shorter shelf-life than serious drama, largely because our ideas about what is comic change more quickly than do our ideas about what is tragic, poignant, dramatic or exciting. Certainly, many comedies from the thirties and forties, including some that were highly regarded when first made, come across today as stale and dated. There are, of course, exceptions. Throughout his career Cary Grant was a fine exponent of romantic comedy, and two of his others from around this period, "The Philadelphia Story", made in the same year as "My Favorite Wife", and "Bringing up Baby" from two years earlier, are among those exceptions, fine vintage comedies which still keep their flavour more than sixty years later."My Favorite Wife", despite having the same star, is not in the same class. The film starts with Grant's character, Nick Arden, about to get married for the second time. The problem is that he is still married to his first wife Ellen, a photographer who disappeared seven years earlier while on an expedition and has never been seen since. The problem seems to have been solved when Nick persuades a Judge to declare Ellen legally dead, leaving him free to marry his new fiancée, Bianca. Ellen, however, is not dead at all, and has spent the last seven years marooned on a desert island. Rescued by a passing ship, she arrives back in America on the very day of Nick and Bianca's wedding. The film then explores the complications arising from this situation.One reason why the film has not lasted well is its sentimentality, something that typically ages very quickly. (Oscar Wilde's famous remark that a man must have a heart of stone to be able to read of the death of Little Nell without laughing was made within thirty years of Dickens's death). Grant's co-star in the two other films mentioned above was, of course, Katharine Hepburn, an actress who was always able to bring a touch of astringency to her comedies, preventing them from sliding into treacly sentiment. Irene Dunne was probably regarded in her own day as an actress of similar stature to Hepburn, but her performance in this film comes across as rather syrupy, particularly in the scenes with her children.It might be interesting to consider how a film on this theme might be made today. (I have not seen the 1960s remake "Move Over Darling"). It would, of course, be more sexually explicit; in the actual film we never actually learn whether Nick's brief "marriage" to Bianca is ever consummated. One assumes that it is not, but the strict moral codes of the forties prevented the film-makers from being explicit on this point. We learn that Ellen was not alone on the desert island but had a companion, a young man named Stephen. This causes Nick some temporary jealousy, but Stephen hastens to assure everyone that nothing improper occurred between Ellen and himself during the seven years they were together. It is hard to imagine a modern film being quite so innocent.More importantly, a modern remake would probably correct one of the film's weaknesses, the imbalance between Nick's two wives. It is clear almost from the beginning that Ellen is his real love and that he will end up with her; Bianca is a minor figure, who can quite ruthlessly be pushed aside without anyone worrying. It would have been more interesting if the two had had equivalent status, with the question of who would eventually win the battle to be Nick's "favorite wife" left in the balance until the very end. (A modern film might even have had Bianca winning). There are amusing moments in this film, but these generally do not arise from the interactions between the main characters Nick, Ellen, Stephen and Bianca. They rather involve minor characters, such as the crusty and cantankerous old judge, who declares Ellen dead and is then persuaded to declare her alive again, or the creepy manager of the hotel where Nick and Bianca spend their "honeymoon", a man who continually invades his guests' privacy in his obsession with defending the respectability of his establishment. On the whole, however, the film does not hold up well today. If "Bringing up Baby" and "The Philadelphia Story" are fine vintage wines which have kept their flavour, "My Favorite Wife" is a wine of similar age but from a lesser vineyard which has been kept for too long in the bottle. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of THE funniest films I have ever seen! Nick (Cary Grant) was married to Ellen (Irene Dunne) for 4 years before she was shipwrecked, and presumed to be dead. 7 long years later, he remarries (to Gail Patrick) - just as Ellen has finally been rescued. She turns up at his place only to find that he's on his honeymoon, so she hightails it to the hotel to go surprise him. Nick gets himself into an awful pickle trying to find the right time to tell his new wife (whom he has been married to for only a few hours) what has happened, and also telling the children that the new lady that they are enjoying the company of is actually their mother. The plot can only thicken when Nick finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on that island for 7 years, but she had company in the shape of a very athletic (and very single!) man..Funnier than Grant and Dunne's previous comedy, The Awful Truth, and just as sweet as Penny Serenade; this is a definite 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite The Awful Truth, but an entertaining film regardless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not my favourite screwball comedy of all time or anything, but I did really enjoy it. It is compared to The Awful Truth, and I will say I do prefer The Awful Truth, and while people may find this blasphemous I preferred 1963's Move Over Darling too.Where the film doesn't quite succeed is that it felt a little too short, the film's end takes a little too long and felt misplaced and there are some moments in the middle where the film drags a bit.However, it looks good, is well directed, is well scored, while the story is great, the screenplay a lot of fun and the performances from Irene Dunne, Gail Patrick and especially Cary Grant are fun. In terms of casting, the only weak link is Randolph Scott, not that he was terrible or anything but he is very underused seeing his role feels I agree more of a cameo than a fully-fleshed out character. So overall, good but not great, worth seeing for Grant. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unnecessary do-over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Favorite Wife," uses the formula, the stars and the director of the hugely successful "The Awful Truth," and tries to do it all over again. Unfortunately, this time, it falls flat, feeling like exactly what it is, a rehash of a much, much better film. Instead of trying to do something different, we get the same story, slightly changed but with the same gags and plot devices. In both, there is a married couple dealing with a separation. In both, the wife tries to hoodwink a female paramour by adopting a weird accent. In both, the wife tries to convince the husband that nothing happened with a male admirer. In "The Awful Truth," the first half of the film was concerned with the husband's jealousy over another man; the second half with the wife trying to get rid of the inconvenient other woman. In "My Favorite Wife," this plot structure is simply reversed, the other woman comes in the first half, the husband's jealousy in the second. This is about as original as "My Favorite Wife" gets. Children are also added this time around, unnecessarily, serving to make everything feel more domestic and boring. The film ends appropriately, in a sad attempt to recapture the magic at the end of "The Awful Truth." It stages the scene in practically the same way. While "The Awful Truth" ended with a dignified Grant and Dunne finally getting together, "My Favorite Wife" ends with Grant in a Santa Claus suit, a fitting contrast between the two films.Randolph Scott is wasted here, his role amounting to more of a cameo, less a full-fledged character. The reason he's in the movie at all is probably to make light of the rumors concerning his real-life relationship with Cary Grant (they lived together for a number of years). The film has Grant almost swoon at the sight of a shirtless Scott taking a dive, and later it has Grant sitting in his office, reliving the moment in his mind. And then there's the scene of Grant looking through women's clothing, holding them up to a mirror, while telling a doctor, "I have to go, he's waiting for me in the car!" Fun at the expense of Cary Grant's sexuality is probably the most interesting thing about the picture.Overall, this movie is lifeless, a bankrupt attempt to recreate the success of "The Awful Truth." It repeats too many elements, and not very successfully. Watch "The Awful Truth" instead.</fullReview>

He is perfect as the husband who's life is out-of-control when his wife returns the same day he's had her declared dead. His joy of realizing she's still alive is second only to the manic gyrations he puts himself through as he tries to deal with the situation without letting his new wife in on the news.Too bad this isn't avaiable on DVD or VHS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny if flawed comedy starring one of Hollywood's best screen teams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Irene Dunne were great together, and though "My Favorite Wife" is not as funny as "The Awful Truth," it's still pretty good. Ellen, lost at sea and presumed dead, returns after 7 years to find her husband Nick has remarried. She goes to his honeymoon hotel, which is a setup for one of Grant's best bits - he sees her as the elevator is closing and his head follows the door until it closes. However, he can't seem to tell his bride Bianca (Gail Patrick). Then he finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on the island but spent the 7 years with one Stephen Burkett. In another funny scene, Ellen gets a sheepish, short, bald shoe salesman to pose as Burkett. Nick has tracked the real Burkett down, and Stephen looks a lot more like Randolph Scott than the shoe salesman. In fact, he's played by Randolph Scott.Grant is his usual riot and extremely handsome. He spends a lot of time talking to himself as he acts out what he's going to say to Bianca. Also, as in "Bringing Up Baby" and "I Was a Male War Bride," he gets to do something with women's clothing - this time standing in front a mirror and trying to figure out what to bring Ellen to wear. Dunne is very funny, posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca, and also is quite touching when she first sees her children.The only problem is that it all gets a little tired, particularly at the end with a prolonged scene having to do with Grant in the attic. As others have pointed out, the script has some holes, particularly the fact that a woman returning after 7 years gets no publicity. And poor Bianca comes off like a villain when she's a victim. Go figure. As amusing as "My Favorite Wife" is, it could have been better.Nevertheless, with these stars, it's a delightful film, and some of the funniest scenes take place in the courtroom. The Judge, played by Granville Bates, is hilarious and a good example of "no small parts." He sure makes the most of his role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody wants to be Cary Grant. I want to be Cary Grant.-Archie LeachI doubt that the above quotation is on Cary Grant's tombstone, but it should be. Just as "On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia" should be on W.C. Fields' stone (unfortunately, it isn't), Cary's quote would make a fitting epitaph to a career that spanned more than three decades. All of which has nothing to do with My Favorite Wife; it's just one of my all-time favorite quotes and I love to use it.What would you do if you declared your wife legally dead after seven years in order to marry another woman, and she came back? Furthermore, what would you do if you found out that during those seven years she was alone on a deserted island with another man? That's the situation facing Nick Arden (Grant), and while some men may relish the idea of having two wives, it nearly drives him insane!Ellen Wagstaff Arden (Irene Dunne) has just returned after seven years to find that her husband Nick has married Bianca Bates (Gail Patrick). Stephen Burkett (Randolph Scott)is the athletic gentleman (check out the way he dives into a swimming pool) who spent seven years alone with Ellen.Both Stephen and Ellen (or "Adam and Eve" as they called each other) insist that nothing happened, but Nick isn't so sure. When Ellen explains that Stephen was out of commission with a broken leg for the first six months, Nick replies, "That still leaves six and a half years." To allay his fears, Ellen introduces a short, bald, shoe salesman to Nick and claims he is Mr. Burkett. The humor in the scene arises from the fact that Nick has already met the real Mr. Burkett at his club. Adding to the mix are the two children Ellen left behind when they were still infants. So now we have two problems: Nick has to tell Bianca that he's already married, and Ellen must tell the children that she's really her mother. Cary Grant was a master of this type of comedy, and the film's screenwriter and producer is Leo McCarey, who began his career making Laurel and Hardy shorts (when McCarey directed the Marx Brothers in Duck Soup, he took the title from a 1927 L &amp; H short; Groucho considered him the only first-class director the Brothers ever had). Randolph Scott, whom we usually associate with Westerns, does a fine job as Nick's rival. And Gail Patrick, who played Carole Lombard's snobbish sister in My Man Godfrey, really makes us feel sorry for her. The poor girl had no idea what she was getting into.As implausible as this whole scenario is, a fine cast makes it work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This splendid comedy is the one about the wife 'who comes back from the dead' only to find her husband, just that morning, remarried. Of course, she was never dead in the first place but stranded on a desert island with a hunky athlete as her only companion. The resulting complications are the stuff of a classic screwball farce and when the husband is Cary Grant and the wife is Irene Dunne and the writers are Sam and Bella Spewack you know you have a winner on your hands.Bits of this movie have found their way into homages to the genre over the years and the whole thing was remade in 1963 as a vehicle for Doris Day and with considerably less zing. Leo McCarey, who directed Grant and Dunne in "The Awful Truth", (and won an Oscar for doing so), acts as producer here, leaving the direction to Garson Kanin who makes a very fine job of it. The supporting cast are pretty top-notch as well, with terrific cameos from Donald Mc Bride as an hotel clerk and Granville Bates as a somewhat bewildered judge. Even the children can act in this one and aren't in the least obnoxious in the way of most American moppets of the period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By complete accident of circumstance, I have seen three (!) Cary Grant/Irene Dunn movies this year: Penny Serenade, The Awful Truth, and now My Favorite Wife.While there is no denying the chemistry between Grant and Dunn, which is not so much sexual as affectionate, chemistry can not compensate for flawed scripts, which is why Penny Serenade (very maudlin) didn't work for me, and why My Favorite Wife only rates 5 out of 10 for me.For a comedy that relies heavily, as this one does, on plot complications, the characters' actions need to make sense; they can't just be there for the sake of absurdity. Without going into spoilers, I'll just say that throughout this film, the characters behave in ways that make no sense apart from serving the "wacky" script. Moreover, Dunn's character does things that make her quite unlikable."The Awful Truth" is a vastly superior Grant/Dunn comedy which avoids the pitfalls I've listed above.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a sad state of affairs when the best scenes and lines of dialog in a movie are offered up by the support players instead of the principals. I'm referring to Donald MacBride as the hotel clerk and Granville Bates as the distracted judge in the divorce hearing. I thought the best moments in the picture were the scenes with those two in them.I had a definite impression the film makers were going for screwball comedy here but it just didn't pan out in my estimation. There were some funny scenes to be sure, Nick's (Cary Grant) sideways tilt seeing 'dead' Ellen (Irene Dunne) for the first time while in the elevator was done well. Overall however, the life went out of the movie for me with Nick's refusal to come to grips with the situation, and Ellen's playing him along with the foolish set-ups at home and the lodge. As for Bianca (Gail Patrick), the script treated her miserably; it's no wonder she appeared bummed out most of the time. She had good reason.My best takeaway from the picture rests with the physical presence of the main characters. Grant and Randolph Scott fill their roles with the requisite good looks that leading men of the era embodied; Scott was even given a decent beefcake scene at the swimming pool for admiring fans of the day. Irene Dunne was actually older than Grant by six years, but with a glowing, youthful appearance that the story line should have taken better advantage of. I thought Gail Patrick was an attractive catch for Nick, and it would have been nice if the story offered her a chance to crack a smile every now and then. As it is, she was the only character who's actions were credible and decisive, even though given short shrift in the story's resolution.</fullReview>

Watching his facial expressions, it always amazes me how he could use them better than any actor in history. The look on his face when he sees her as the elevator door is closing is worth the watching of this movie alone. The hotel clerk and the judge are also both hilarious in their limited scenes with Grant. Even Randolph Scott, who's character was stranded with Grant's wife's character, is very amusing in his bickering with Grant. But the real kicker is the ending and watching Cary Grant fidget and stress over how to choose his REAL wife in their cabin. This movie is everything a comedy should be and one that any Cary Grant fan or classic movie lover should definitely see! My grade: A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very best comedy-romances excel in all their ingredients. The plot, screenplay, direction, settings, cinematography, editing, cast and acting ? all must be the very best to put a film at the top of the genre. But one intangible aspect sets a movie apart even further and raises it to the level of great films. That is the chemistry between the lead players. Both Cary Grant and Irene Dunne had wonderful chemistry with a number of their co-stars. But I don't think either pairing with any other performer had better chemistry than these two together. In all three of their films, Grant and Dunne worked perfectly off each other. The witty lines, humorous situations and hilarious scenes in their comedies were so spontaneous and flowed so smoothly that one felt they were perfectly natural. Their chemistry was just as obvious and beautiful in the drama- romance, "Penny Serenade," which was their last film together. Their first film, "The Awful Truth," ranks among the very top on all major comedy film lists. It's one of the best screwball comedies of all time. This second film, "My Favorite Wife," is wonderful fun and only misses the elite group because of its somewhat lesser script. Still, the chemistry makes this film a treat to watch and enjoy. The supporting cast all excel as well. Granville Bates is hilarious as the judge, and Donald MacBride is a riot as the hotel clerk. "My Favorite Wife" is sure to keep on entertaining over the years. Here's a hilarious exchange to end my review. Nick (Cary Grant), "Well, it's no use. I'm out of gas." Ellen (Irene Dunne), "You seem to be out of everything ? except ideas."</fullReview>

Now I just watched the movie that one was based on, this one starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. Much of the same plot but this one was much funnier especially when Ms. Dunne did a Southern accent! Grant was also funny with his reactions and his lying to try to not make anyone mad at him. Gail Patrick wasn't so funny as the new wife but I guess she wasn't supposed to be but Randolph Scott was quite enjoyably hilarious as the "Adam" to Irene's "Eve"! So on that note, My Favorite Wife is highly recommended. P.S. The main reason I watched this just now was because since I've been reviewing the Our Gang comedies-and individual members doing films outside the series-in chronological order, this was next on the list since one of the players was former member Scotty Beckett who's one of two children of Grant and Dunne.</fullReview>

Dunne has been missing for 7 years and it's time for Grant to move on. Specifically, with Gail Patrick (Bianca). The Judge, after painfully dithering about ? some people find this funny, I didn't ? then agrees to marry Grant and Patrick, and they go off to their honeymoon. But what's this??first wife Irene Dunne returns home! She's not dead. She heads for the honeymoon hotel. What is everyone to do?.?The cast are mainly good in this film. Cary Grant spars well with everybody, and especially with hotel clerk Donald MacBride. There are many funny scenes that include Grant's reaction in a hotel lift when he first sees Irene Dunne. He also has an amusing scene with Pedro de Cordoba (Dr Kohlmar) as he rifles through a wardrobe full of ladies clothes, explaining he is doing it for a friend, and "he's waiting outside". There is another amusing set-up with the story of Irene Dunne's male partner on the desert island ? hunky Randolph Scott (Burkett). Dunne tries to pass off meek Chester Clute as the man she has innocently spent 7 years with to a knowing Cary Grant.However, whilst, the film is entertaining and is easy to watch, it peters out at the end once the action moves to the mountain home. It gets sentimental and silly, and the film could have been resolved in a far more satisfactory manner. We are left with a few questions regarding the plot, such as what has Gail Patrick done to deserve what has just happened? Is Randolph Scott a complete carrot-eating moron? And Irene Dunne is actually pretty awful considering that she is meant to love Cary Grant. The children are a bit irritating and Irene Dunne has an annoying episode where she puts on a Southern accent, but, despite all of that, this is a fun film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many wives can spoil the marital soup.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or, as Irene Dunne says, "the Mulligan stew", which gets a laugh in court as she reveals she is the wife who came back to life after being declared legally dead when her husband (Cary Grant) went off and married another woman (Gail Patrick). In the same year as the sexually reversed "Too Many Husbands" (which is about just what the title indicates), "My Favorite Wife" is the more remembered of the two, probably because it has a fast moving and funny screenplay where everything comes together perfectly.Those who have seen this film's Doris Day/James Garner remake ("Move Over Darling") first will have little trouble recognizing the same structure which only changes at the end. The story opens with Grant in court going through the legal procedure of having the long-missing Dunne declared dead just so he can immediately marry the somewhat temperamental Patrick. Dunne shows up immediately afterwards, encountering her two children and mother-in-law, then heading off to the hotel where she and Grant initially spent their first honeymoon to create a bundle of confusion. It continues when Grant and Patrick arrive home and Dunne is there, posing as the daughter of an old friend of Grant's mother (Anne Shoemaker). Grant discovers that his missing wife wasn't quite so alone on her island stay, with the handsome Randolph Scott present as a man whom she nicknamed "Adam" to her "Eve".This is both combination of family and screwball romantic comedy as the desire to reunite the family torn apart by no fault of their own, and it is brilliantly written and acted. You can tell when Patrick breaks down crying that those are indeed crocodile tears as she is way too tough (both in her character and in our memory of her previous screen performances) to be willing to break down so easily. Character performances by Donald MacBride as a befuddled hotel clerk and Granville Bates as a befuddled judge add to the delight of this story. Dunne and Grant are an easy-going romantic team who in three films had the sophistication and wit of Powell and Loy, Tracy and Hepburn, and Lombard and Gable. How I wish they had done more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Handsome widower Cary Grant (as Nick Arden) has his spouse, shipwrecked off the coast of Indochina seven years ago, declared legally dead so he can marry an attractive brunette he met while helping with the search. The newlyweds are honeymooning when Mr. Grant's wife, still beautiful Irene Dunne (as Ellen Wagstaff), returns home. It turns out Ms. Dunne had survived on a deserted island. She expects to pick up where she left off with Grant and their two cute kids. Grant's new wife, pretty Gail Patrick (as Bianca Bates) is anxious to put their marriage to bed. Things get more complicated when hunky Randolph Scott (as Stephen Burkett) arrives on the scene. He was stranded with Dunne for seven years on the island...The castaways called themselves "Adam and Eve"...This was one of two attempts to turn the melodramatic Alfred Lord Tennyson poem "Enoch Arden" into a 1940 comedy movie. More successful than "Too Many Husbands" (1940), "My Favorite Wife" reverses the gender of the original characters and leaves viewers with the possibility that no extra-marital sex occurred. The formula was repeated for Doris Day in "Move Over, Darling" (1963). Which wife fits the "My Favorite Wife" title is never in doubt. Note, for example how the women are introduced ? Dunne is sweet and motherly while Ms. Patrick is primping and self-absorbed. Safe and obvious, the story engages with performances and innuendo. Leo McCarey and the RKO studio crew make it a smooth, classy production.******* My Favorite Wife (5/2/40) Garson Kanin ~ Irene Dunne, Cary Grant, Gail Patrick, Randolph Scott</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant is a funny-man of the 20th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I must say that this movie doesn't exceptionally stand out from the whole bunch of screwball comedies produced in the times of Great Depression in the USA. The first part of My Favorite Wife may be even called boring, due to a very slow narrative process and lack of any specific action. Of course, it's just an introduction to the plot and the viewer has to believe that in a moment something extraordinarily funny and crazy will happen. And it does, along with the entrance of, fantastic as always, Irene Dunne. The story presented in this movie is so ridiculous that it will make you laugh just reading about it. It seemed like another regular wedding for Mr. Nick Arden (Cary Grant) and his new wife Ellen (Gail Patrick). His first wife is presumed dead after drowning somewhere far at sea seven years ago, and he wants to be form a happy relationship with a new woman. Guess what happens when Ellen Arden (Irene Dunne) suddenly shows up at their doorstep more alive than ever ? all hell breaks loose and Nick becomes involved with two women at the same time. Additionally, his two wives (how grand it sounds) aren't particularly fond of each other and start to make Nick's life much harder than he imagined. And if this wasn't enough, somewhere on the road Nick meets Steve Burkett (Randolph Scott), a handsome man, with whom Ellen was stranded on a deserted island for seven long years. Level of jealousy goes through the roof, and the real 'fun' starts for all people involved in this ludicrous affair. Finally, Nick has to decide, who to choose, as it may seem that from a point of having two beautiful women at once he will ultimately be left all alone.The movie provides a great amount of laughs, due to many amusing one-liners and gags, especially on the part of Cary Grant's perfect sense of humorous acting abilities. Every screwball film, in which he stars abruptly becomes much more entertaining, because of his irrefutable acting manners and charisma, so important for a funny leading man. And he does it differently every time. Even though the movies may seem similar, the portrayals of characters that he presents always have other specific comedic feels to it. And the relationship that he forms with Irene is brilliant; you can sense that deep emotional attachment coming from their characters in every scene. Maybe seven years have passed, but the flame in their hearts still burns. They can't argue that their need to be together is so strong that it will surpass anything.All in all, I can't call it My Favorite Screwball, but I certainly might recommend it to anyone, who is need of a light-hearted American comedy that may provide a positive shock in the sense of absurdity and amount of laughs that come with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seven years of his wife, Ellen, presumably being lost at sea, Nick Arden marries his latest flame, Bianca. Only to get on his honeymoon to find that Ellen has in fact survived and spent the seven years on a tropical island with another man called Stephen Burkett.My Favorite Wife is based around the Alfred Tennyson poem entitled "Enoch Arden". Numerous adaptations have been made, but few, if any, are as frothy as this Cary Grant and Irene Dunne starrer. Grant and Dunne are re-teamed here after their massive success with the quite marvellous The Awful Truth in 1937, and tho the role of Ellen was touted to Jean Arthur, it was Dunne who grasped the role and created sizzling comedy once again with the fabulous Grant. The Awful Truth director Leo McCarey was all set to direct this piece but a car accident put paid to that and the reins then passed to jobber Garson Kanin, who, aided by a firing on all cylinders cast, weaved a splendidly delightful picture.Tho the movie's obvious charm lies with it's two main stars, it would be a big disservice to forget the contributions of Randolph Scott as Stephen Burkett and Gail Patrick as Bianca. Scott's laid back persona is perfect foil to Grant's more batty approach work, while Patrick in the tricky role of the neurotic second wife is fabulous. It remains a mystery as to why she didn't go on to better and brighter things? Although the ending is never really in doubt, and the last quarter dries up on the gags front, My Favorite Wife still stands the test of time as a screwball picture of note. So see it if you get the chance, it should brighten your day. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irene Dunne was gloriously beautiful and funny beyond measure in this great RKO film where Irene was Queen of the Lot over such equally grand ladies such as Ginger Rogers, Katharine Hepburn, and Lucille Ball. What women!Irene Dunne is ultimate screwball comedienne and I am just amazed, shocked and baffled why the Academy never honored Irene Dunne with an Honorary Oscar. Doesn't a career that comprises of Show Boat, Love Affair, The Awful Truth, I Remember Mama, A Guy Named Joe, et al and this splendid film entitle a Star to an Oscar???I loved this movie slyly directed by Garson Kanin ( who wrote that tell all book about Tracy and Hepburn that ruined the friendship of Kate Hepburn and Garson and Ruth Kanin as Kate felt he betrayed confidences). The look in Cary Grant's eye when Cary sees Randy Scott perform acrobats off the Diving Board!! Sly,Sly Kanin. Wasn't he hinting more to the point re Grant and Scott??Great old fashioned movie with fantastic photography in black and white and the set decoration. If only we could all live that well!I rate this movie a 9 and salute Irene Dunne, Cary Grant, Randy Scott, Gail Patrick, Leo McCarey, and Garson Kanin for a great adult film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Almost) My favourite screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I played this to myself on a long flight back from a winter sun holiday and the near 90 minutes it took up simply (pardon the pun) flew by. I love the screwball comedy "genre" and will be endeavouring this Christmas holiday to seek out as many examples as I can, but I doubt many of them will beat this Leo McCarey production directed by young hot-shot (at the time) Garson Kanin.The premise is as daffy as you would expect but boy do Cary Grant (at his effortless best) and one of his most supreme comic foils Irene Dunne run with it.I laughed out loud many times in the first thirty minutes and anxiously looked at my watch wondering where the story and laughs were going to come for the next 60 minutes but it just kicked on with Dunne's hilarious attempt to hoodwink Grant as to the hunkiness (or lack of same) of her seven year companion on their desert island and the easy introduction of Randolph Scott as the All-American athlete she actually hunkered down with.The timing of all concerned, particularly the leads of course, is near perfect throughout, the comedic situations hilarious (bookended by a courtroom scene with a great turn by Granville Bates as an incredulous judge - an idea so good that Peter Bogdanovich lifted it almost wholesale for his 1972 homage "What's Up Doc") and climaxing in a homage of its own to the one that started it all, the famous "Walls Of Jericho" scene in Gable &amp; Goddard's "It Happened One Night" and of course its own Grant / Dunne predecessor "The Awful Truth".I keep coming back to Grant and Dunne as the keystones to the film's success. Both separately (Grant in his interplay with the hotel manager during extended avoidance of new, wholly undeserving bride Gail Patrick, perhaps the only actor in the film who fails to catch the arch mood of the piece) and Dunne (when she affects accents of contemporaries Hepburn and Davis to devastating comic effect) but especially together - these two play off each other to the manner born.Even the scenes with their kids don't grate, there's admirably little recourse to the use of traditional slapstick and the way this sex-farce pushes the envelope out at the censor (especially Grant's preening himself with women's clothing and that ending when you know he's about to become literally "Bad Santa") just takes the biscuit.A sheer delight, from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not the biggest screwball comedy fan, since most movies just don't seem to really quite got 'it' and are more or less often too much more of the same and they get drowned by the movie its clever story and low key sentiments. "My Favorite Wife" was however a screwball movie that I really enjoyed watching.It features all of the typical screwball elements, in which an odd unusual situations and how the characters handle them plays the central key element of the movie. Things get worse and worse when they get deeper and deeper into trouble when more facts slowly surface. It's a well written story that offers plenty of surprises with its moments and main plot-line, even though of course the movie in a sense is mostly predictable, just like any other genre movie. Who knows, perhaps the movie would had been even better if indeed Leo McCarey ended up directing it, like originally was intended. He however got involved in an automobile accident shortly before the filming of this movie and he had to pass on the directing honers to less experienced Garson Kanin. Kanin obviously didn't do a bad job with it but McCarey was of course more experienced in the genre and was definitely most at ease and in his element with directing these type of movies. He has some great classics below his belt, also prior to the release of this movie. McCarey still served as the writer and producer of the movie though, so his touch is still notable within the movie.The more I see of Cary Grant as a comedy actor, the more I start to like and appreciate him as one. He is of course still best known for the roles he played in Alfred Hitchcock movies but he successfully started off his career with movies such as this one. He was a great comedy actor who could play a regular guy, despite his always good look. While watching this movie it by the way also made me think; 'Wow, this guy would had made a great James Bond!'. Later I found out that he was actually asked to play the James Bond character in the first 1962 Bond movie "Dr. No" but he turned it down because he believed to be too old already at the time to play the character. He stars in this movie with Irene Dunn, with who he has appeared in in several movies together throughout their career, which also all happen to be the same type of movies. Both were just 2 of the best and most successful genre actors at the time. One of the better movies that the '30's screwball genre has to offer.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Us Now Praise Irene Dunne in a Frothy Marital Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Cary Grant is justifiably remembered as a screen legend (indeed he was probably the most adept of any of his contemporaries at romantic comedy), it seems criminal that Irene Dunne is almost forgotten these days. This is the second and most lightweight of three very fruitful screen pairings they had during this period - the other two are the even more insane divorce farce, "The Awful Truth", from 1937 and 1941's child adoption tearjerker, "Penny Serenade". With her insinuating laugh and sophisticated but down-to-earth manner, she is a wonderful screwball heroine, even if she lacks the haughty glamour of Katharine Hepburn or the brazen beauty of Carole Lombard.Here Dunne plays Ellen Wagstaff Arden returning home after seven years shipwrecked on a desert island. The problem is that her husband Nick has just gotten remarried to a high maintenance socialite named Bianca. Further complications ensue when it's disclosed that Ellen was not alone on the island and that her companion was an athletic Adonis named Stephen Burkett, of course a bachelor. The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool. In 1940, the same year he made classics like "The Philadelphia Story" and "His Girl Friday", Grant is at the top of his game, and Dunne matches him every step of the way. It does seem a bit of a stretch to think that the principal characters would be celibate for seven long years, but such was 1930's Hollywood convention.Randolph Scott gamely plays the dumb-as-dirt Stephen, an ironic choice given the rumors of the actor's relationship with Grant. As Bianca, the glamorously venomous Gail Patrick - expert at such roles from classics like "My Man Godfrey" and "Stage Door" - knows her fate in the movie but doesn't really show her talons until the courtroom scene. In scene-stealing bits are Granville Bates as the frustrated judge and Donald MacBride as the confused hotel clerk. The only drawbacks are the overly precocious children played hammily by Scotty Beckett and Mary Lou Harrington. Directed with comic mastery by Leo McCarey, it's a frothy confection from a bygone era, and the far inferior 1963 Doris Day remake only proves how unmatchable Grant and Dunne are. The DVD has a surprisingly pristine print transfer, and extras include an unrelated comic short featuring humorist Robert Bentley and a condensed 1950 broadcast of the movie featuring Grant and Dunne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant's lost wife returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Garson Kanin's snappy film teams Cary Grant and Irene Dunne (they'd also be seen on screen together in 'The Awful Truth' and 'Penny Serenade') - he thinks she's dead, she's about to return after spending several years AWOL with the wooden Randolph Scott. This basic plot sets the scene for the usual misunderstandings, set pieces, priceless Grant face reactions, and more.I prefer the remake, 'Move Over Darling' - perhaps, despite Grant and Dunne's best efforts, Scott drags the whole thing down and it doesn't recover. Gail Patrick is OK as the second wife, and Irene Dunne is as tearfully sentimental as she is dotty. 'My Favorite Wife' is worth a look but there were better films of the type made in the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grant and Dunne are exceptional in this delightful screwball comedy! When Ellen Arden(Dunne) returns home after seven years on a deserted island she finds her husband, Nick Arden(Grant), remarried. The movie is based on Grant trying to tell his new wife he's already married and Grant being jealous of Stephen Burkett(Scott), who was on the island alone with Ellen. The scene of Grant watching Burkett do gymnastics is one of the funniest scenes of all time. Although this movie is not on video at the present it comes on AMC quite often.

		<fullReview>Hilarious RKO comedy of 1940 with impeccable credits both cast and writing/directing and crew. With editing by Robert Wise! What a combo! Obviously a smash hit in its day and must have a wonderful experience to see in the 3000 seat movie palace. Screened a lot on TV in Australia, anyone lucky enough to roar with laughter at this almost perfect screwball comedy will instantly agree how hilarious and exact it is. In the 60s, it was ineptly remade as a Doris Day vehicle also successful and equally well crafted but not nearly as much fun. Somehow it works better as an art deco comedy. The courtroom scenes are almost lifted verbatim into WHAT'S UP DOC in the 70s. Interesting and sad too, to see the very talented child actor Scotty Beckett long before his untimely descent into crime and early death. The obvious rapport between housepals Grant and Randolph Scott is slyly enjoyable too. This is champagne Hollywood. Imagine a hideous remake today for the multiplex mob: Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore instead of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne... with Rob Schneider in the Randolph Scott role. Add swearing and punching and edit using a lawnmower.</fullReview>

Movie moves into high gear when Nick (Cary Grant) sees his first wife as the elevator door closes in the hotel on the way to the honeymoon suite with his bride and he's on the spot to break it to his new bride but then finds out his wife was stranded with a hunk of an anthropologist (Randalf Scott). She makes it worse by hiring a milque toast shoe salesman to impersonate the anthropologist so as to mislead Nick into thinking there was nothing to worry about but he's on to her. Many very funny scenes in the courtroom where a cantankerous judge weds, annulls, declares death and fines people for contempt.If you like old fashioned romantic comedies, you'll love this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm well aware that the classic screwball comedies often relied on somewhat unlikable characters and morally questionable plots, but "My Favorite Wife" lacks the two saving graces of screwball comedies: real chemistry between the leads and a truly winning heroine. The plot is simple: a man's long-presumed dead wife shows up (she's been marooned on an island for seven years) the same day he's taken a new wife. Hijinks ensue. If the plot sounds familiar, it's because it was remade over two decades later as "Move Over, Darling". Talk about 88 minutes badly spent! Cary Grant plays a spineless, weak willed dunce who doesn't have the guts to tell his new wife his old wife is back. Irene Dunne swings back and forth from charming and lovely to manipulative and shrewish and back again. Gail Patrick should have played the role as Grant's new wife in a bitchier manner. After all, this is the same actress who nearly stole the show from right under Carole Lombard in "My Man Godfrey" as the deliciously evil older sister. Instead, Gail's Bianca is rather pathetic, and you end up feeling sorry for her. Heck, in the scene where she punches Grant in the face, I found myself cheering instead muttering insults at her expense. Randolph Scott got a chuckle from me as Grant's health nut rival for Dunne's affection. Top that off with dull courtroom scenes and Dunne and Grant's two obnoxiously adorable, only-in-Hollywood children, and you've got one disappointing screwball comedy. Still, Grant and Dunne were both wonderful actors, so don't let this trifle turn you off from their other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Quiet! I'll have no laughter in the courtroom," says the deadpan judge, but in fact the scenes in the courtroom deliver the only laughs in this movie, because they deliver the only breaths of fresh, honest air in the script.Cary Grant's comedic flair shines as always, even when he's mugging for Garson Kanin (a director who should have stuck to writing). Too bad his character, the only remotely attractive one, is stuck with a lousy screenplay and two loser wives.Nothing against Gail Patrick, who exudes cool intelligence and can deliver a cynical remark like a brunette Eve Arden. Unfortunately, most of her roles are thankless, and none more so than this one. As Wife No. 2, she's pure plot device, manipulated to the needs of the story.But, as usual with her movies, it is Irene Dunne who makes this almost unwatchable, particularly in close-ups, when her ever-visible tongue threatens to flop out of her usually open mouth.If you get stuck watching this, check out the score and the sound editing. Both are aggressively silly, in an attempt to make up for the lack of comedy throughout the film. A futile attempt.</fullReview>

Maybe it's just me, but I don't find it humorous. Even a nice cast like this with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in the leads, can't make a difference.

		<fullReview>Too many wives for one husband seems to be the problem for Nick (Grant). How did he get into the mess in the first place. Maybe if wife Ellen (Dunne) had stayed dead, he could retire with new wife Bianca (Patrick). But no, of all times, Ellen turns up alive on his wedding night to Bianca. Oh my, how will this straighten out. Worse, Bianca is having a very lonely honeymoon. At the same time, muscle-bound Burkett (Scott) turns up as Adam to Ellen's Eve after their seven years together on a lonely island. Now what's Nick going to do. Will the screenwriters be able to figure it all out.Great comedy premise that doesn't need madcap to heighten the effect. Grant and Dunne are in fine comedic form. But truth be told it's that looney judge (Bates) who steals the show in a uniquely addled performance. In his law book, legalities are just bothersome details. No wonder things are in such a mess. My only complaint is that the reconciliation phase goes on a little too long, somewhat dragging out that part. Nonetheless, it is hard having to sleep on a mattress that talks back, which hilariously leads up to that inspired last shot.Fortunately, this is the kind of movie that put the 'golden' in Hollywood's golden years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparkling, Light-Weight Sex Comedy with Cary Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The romantic comedy "My Favorite Wife" is a consistently entertaining sex romp that carefully skirts vulgar material. Cary Grant bounces back and forth between two women. One of them used to be his wife while the other is his new wife. "Adam's Rib" director Garson Kanin and scenarists Bella &amp; Sam Spewack with Leo McCarey had to tread carefully on their subject matter because the Production Code Administration condemned any movie that didn't treat marriage with respect. The amusing premise is that our protagonist, Nicholas Arden (Cary Grant), has just had his first wife declared legally dead in court. Arden's first wife, Ellen Wagstaff Arden (Irene Dunne) vanished somewhere in Indochina when her ship sank. She had just given birth to two children, a boy and a girl, and had gone off on an anthropological expedition when her ship went down. Nicholas traveled to Bangkok to interview everybody who had anything to do with the shipwreck, but he wasn't able to find his wife. Seven years have elapsed, and Nicholas is planning to remarry to Bianca (Gail Patrick) after the court declares that Ellen is legally dead. Unbeknownst to Nicholas, Ellen survived the shipwreck and spent those seven years on an island. No sooner has Nicholas married Bianca than Ellen comes home. It seems that a Portuguese freighter wandered off course by 200 miles and found Ellen. When she arrives at her old home, she finds the two children that she had only known as infants when she left them. Little Timmy and Chinch tell their mother that their mother drown at sea. When she tries to get more details out of them, they inform her that they aren't allowed to speak to strangers. Ellen slips into the house and surprises her mother. Ellen's mom explains that Nicholas and Bianca have left to celebrate their honeymoon. Morever, they are celebrating it at the same hotel that Nicholas and Ellen celebrated their honeymoon. Ellen hops on a plane and arrives ahead of them at the hotel. When Nicholas and Bianca show up, Nicholas refuses to take Suite A because Ellen and he spent the night there on their honeymoon. They have just gotten aboard the elevator when Nicholas spots Ellen in the lobby. At this point, our hero is not allowed to consummate his marriage to Bianca. Naturally, he is shocked by Ellen's appearance and she explains that she survived and has come home. She realizes the predicament that Nicholas is in and prompts him to tell Bianca about her. Poor Nicholas is caught between a rock and a hard place. Although he is an attorney, Nicholas finds himself tongue-tied by his situation. Clearly, since Ellen is not really dead, Nicholas cannot climb into bed with his second wife. Meanwhile, Bianca is considerably upset because Nicholas keeps running out on her. Adding to their woes is a suspicious hotel clerk (Donald McBride) who watches as Nicholas picks out Suite A for them. Immediately, the clerk suspects that Nicholas is determined to destroy the sterling reputation for honesty and decency that the hotel has maintained for 33 years. After the first forty minutes, "My Favorite Wife" takes a dramatic turn when Nicholas discovers that Ellen spent those seven years on that island with another man, Stephen Burkett (Randolph Scott), who happens to be a physical specimen of muscular perfection. Indeed, one of the women at pool side at the hotel where Burkett is staying asks Nicholas if Stephen is Tarzan actor Johnny Weissmuller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No need for Grant and Hepburn....Grant and Dunne will do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me that these 2 didn't make more films together. There were easily as good as Grant and Hepburn. What a crazy premise for a film. A guy goes to court to get his first wife declared legally dead so he can marry again. His wife was supposedly drowned or lost at sea in a ship/ferry accident 7 years earlier. He looked and looked for her to no avail. On his honeymoon, the day they get married, his long lost wife reappears out of nowhere. After this....hilarity ensues.Trust me folks, forget the junky newer comedy you were thinking about watching. Find this one and be prepared to laugh til it hurts. The laughs are mainly from what Irene Dunne does to Cary Grant. She runs him through the ringer. Grant doesn't have the courage to tell his new wife, whom no one likes, that his wife is back. Situation after situation she tears him up with what females do to men...verbally. They both still love each other and he's a nice guy but she forces his hand in telling his new bride. It's the way she does it that'll bring Grant to his knees.I think the scene stealer of this comedy gem is the actor who plays the judge. The first 5 minutes in this judge takes the film from Grant and goes with it. Towards the end at the annulment hearing he does it again. He's just a scene stealer all the way.No doubt if you've seen Move over Darlin from the 60's the theme seems familiar. That'll be because it was a remake of this. The newer version to me is more of a family comedy whilst this early comedy gem is just a plain out and out screwball comedy. Try this on for size and be prepared to laugh and laugh and laugh. It's just that darn funny folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, almost ruined by the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to say anything bad about a film like this, but when there are so many similar films and I have seen a lot of them, it's easily to make comparisons and nit-pick. Let me say, first of all, that I am not complaining about this film. "My Favorite Wife" is easily enjoyable, with a well-written plot that is engaging from the beginning. It's funny, and like all great romance films, there is real emotion here. It involves Cary Grant finding his wife, whom he thought was dead after a shipwreck, seven years after the incident alive and well. Trouble is, he is remarried and he believes she is in love with a man she met on the island. It's all screwball fun and somewhat touching as their romance is rekindled and their children discover their mother for the first time. It has a similar feel to most other Cary Grant films ("The Awful Truth," etc). Irene Dunne plays Grant's wife as well here as she did in that film. The ending of the film seemed a little out of place and took a bit too long to wrap up. This came close to ruining the film for me emotionally. Despite that, if you're looking for some clean, easily-likable comedy, this is for you. Not the best of it's kind, but still entertaining.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the many delights ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the very best of the classic screwball comedies, this 1940 RKO film benefits from a marvelously ingenious and witty script by the Broadway playwrights Sam and Bella Spewack ("Boy Meets Girl" "Kiss Me Kate") full of double-entendre and innuendo that somehow slipped by the censors. Every character from the radiant co-star Irene Dunne to little Chester Clute as the shoe salesman is perfectly cast. Among the many delights, watch the performance of Granville Bates as the thoroughly befuddled judge; Donald MacBride as the indignant hotel clerk; and cowboy-star Randolph Scott as the carrot-eating square who shared a desert island with the favorite wife. Perhaps in no other film in his long career does Cary Grant display his unique talent for outlandish physical and verbal comedy as expertly as he does here. Was there ever anyone so handsome in the history of film who could be so funny? The direction is credited to Garson Kanin, but one suspects that the producer Leo McCary (director of "The Awful Truth" and "Duck Soup") had a lot to do with the films madcap style --briskly edited by Robert Wise and photographed in high studio gloss by Rudy Maté, both of whom were to become excellent directors in their own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Screwball Comedy,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this review because after years of watching this movie and loving every minute of it, every time I watched it, I have just watched 'Move over Darling' for the first time and thought I'd write a review of both and compare them.Firstly this original and black and white version is so much better. Although the later film does have identical dialogue in parts and James Garner and Doris Day are great in the roles, they just do not to it as good as Cary Grant and Irene Dunne done...er did. For instance, the scene where Nicholas Arden first sees his wife in the hotel lobby and he follows the lift doors closing. Hilarious and Garner does it superbly, but that was a typical Cary Grant action and no-one can do it better.The film opens with Nicholas Arden (Grant), who having lost his wife to a shipwreck seven years ago, is filing his petition to get have his missing wife declared legally dead, so he can marry Bianca, a fox-clad beauty played by Gail Patrick.However, having happily made his vows and is all set to settle down with wife number two, wife number one, hilariously portrayed by Irene Dunne, makes an unexpected return from her shipwrecked paradise, determined to get her husband, life and home back.Grant now has to spend the rest of the movie realising that his one true love has returned and must find a kind, and considerate way to 'dump' his new bride.Add to his misery and torment, Grant's discovery that his wife has not been the lone shipwrecked victim these last seven years, but has been a jungle mate to a muscle bound Adonis played by Randolph Scott, news made worse by the fact that their affectionate nicknames for each other during that time seem to have been Adam and Eve.With such 'naked' truths scratching the surface, it's not long before Grant's trouble's really start as with two Mrs Ardens out and about, living, breathing, walking and talking, the authorities are starting to sit up and take notice. Bigamy is after all a crime.As with 1937's 'The Awful Truth' Grant and Dunne prove what a great comedic team they made and that their performances were by no means a fluke. It is also my opinion that Irene Dunne was a more natural comedienne than she was a singer...good voice though she had. She was just more of a joy to watch in these kind of roles, the opposite of her 1963 counterpart Doris Day, whom i always preferred as a singer.The one failing of both these films however is the character of Bianca, she is such a tragic figure when you think about it, she's neither nasty, vulgar, cruel, malicious or evil. Just a woman who loved a man enough to marry him, yet in both films she becomes a victim. Maybe she should have been written to be a gold-digger or a liar or a cheat, just so you don't feel so sorry for her. The Comedy can become a bit tainted and black as a resultAnyway. A True classic and a great example of screwball comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of Grants best comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not as wacky and funny as either Bringing Up Baby or Arsenic And Old Lace, this is a very funny and memorable Cary Grant comedy. I don't understand how someone could be disappointed by the movie, as one comment on IMDb stated, but everyone has their own taste (and I sure know of a lot of beloved films I hated).Irene Dunn plays Grant's wife who has been lost at sea for many years. She and a man she is shipwrecked with were finally discovered and she returns home to Grant on the eve of his wedding! Apparently, after so many years he is ready to have her declared legally dead and proceed with his new fiancée. Her arrival sure throws a monkey wrench into their plans! However, when Grant finds out she was stranded along with the handsome Randolph Scott (FYI--he really was Cary Grant's best friend in real life), Cary isn't sure whether to get remarried or return to Dunn!FYI--The same year this film debuted, another film with almost the exact same story line also came out called "TOO MANY HUSBANDS". While this other film was amiable enough, MY FAVORITE WIFE is better in every way. If you only see one of these films, be sure it's MY FAVORITE WIFE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant is well-known for his Hitchcock movies and his touching romantic chick-flicks (i.e., "An Affair to Remember"). He is also fairly well-known for his screwball comedies, but I believe that this one is definitely underrated. This is just as hilarious as "Bringing Up Baby" or "Arsenic and Old Lace" but is less critically-acclaimed than those two. This is definitely a good movie to rent if you love to laugh (like me!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Largely a comedy of manners in mid-20th century America, much of the humor is derived from the strict gender roles that were ascribed to married couples around the WWII years. To myself, as a modern viewer, the plot is as frustrating as that of "An Affair to Remember," with all of its character motivations hopelessly outdated (probably even for the 1940s).Dunne and Grant are always fun to watch and there are some good bits here and there - but the "wrapper" storyline just doesn't cut it anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, well-written comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if this movie would strike today's viewers as being so amusing. I mean, it's STILL extremely amusing today, but in 1940 some of the subjects that gags are built around were taken more seriously. In middle America divorce was rare, for example. As late as 1964 one of the reasons Nelson Rockefeller lost the Republican nomination was that he had recently divorced and remarried. We didn't have a divorced president until Reagan, 16 years later. And at one point Cary Grant is sent to gather some clothes for his wife and a psychiatrist sees him examining the dresses in her closet and posing in front of the mirror, holding up the dresses in front of him, trying on different women's hats. The suggestion of homosexuality and cross-dressing must have been outrageous at the time. Homosexuality was still "the love that dare not speak its name" and was thought by everyone in Bassett, Nebraska, to be a mental disease -- those residents who had heard of it, anyway.The jokes are built around a simple enough plot. Grant, believing his wife (Dunne) to have drowned 7 years earlier in a shipwreck, remarries. But Dunne shows up vibrantly alive, having made it to an island. Grant tries to hide Dunne's identity from his bride while trying to figure out what to do. Halfway through the movie he discovers that Dunne was not alone when she was rescued from the island. Also rescued was another survivor -- the robustly masculine, handsome, and athletic Randolph Scott, who is also in love with Dunne.That reminds me. When I said earlier that homosexuality was taken seriously, I meant it. Careers could be ruined by rumors -- whole lives could go down the drain. Grant and Scott happened to be pretty good friends and they shared a house at the time this movie was being shot. Rumors began that they were both gay, based on nothing more than their living in the same house. Both careers survived, but the rumor about Scott lingers on.The greatest character in the movie is undoubtedly the judge, Granville Bates. What a crabby face! What an irritable and impatient man! Someone in the courtroom opens her compact and begins applying makeup, and the reflection of the light reaches him. "Hey! Put that thing away! What are you trying to do, blind me? I won't have any of that in this courtroom. Try washing your face instead of painting it. (pause) There's such a thing as contempt of court, you know. (pause) Don't let ME get after you." The other great performance comes from Cary Grant. Nobody has ever been better at light comedy than Grant, I swear. His every statement is funny. Even his hesitations, like "Well ---" And he uses the skills he learned as an acrobat to add to his success. Watch him scuttle across the balcony of the house with his wife's dresses, his legs working like a marionette's while his head advances in a level line without bouncing at all. It belongs in the Ministry of Funny Walks.Randolph Scott is good too in one of his freewheeling earlier roles. His chest is always puffed out, his voice loud and resonant, his gestures flamboyant, everything that was deliberately dropped from his later roles in the Boetticher Westerns.I could never really get with Irene Dunne. I understand that she was a genuinely decent woman, but her on-screen appeal eludes me.It's a good thing that film lasts as long as it does, because they no longer make many comedies as successful as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... they don't make them like this anymore? If not someone should. In connection with another film I stated that most errors or unrealistic situations can be overlooked if we are compensated via Style, Class, Sophistication etc and this movie proves my point. It is 1) unrealistic that Irene Dunn, missing at sea for seven years, should reappear on the very day that husband, Cary Grant, has succeeded in having her declared dead and then, moments later, remarried in the same courtroom and 2) that Grant's mother would not have attended the wedding; presumably the writers needed Dunne's mother-in-law to be in when Dunne (who naturally would not have known about the new wedding so would have no reason to attend and try to stop it) resurfaced though a little thought could have solved this. Gail Patrick is saddled with the typical Ralph Bellamy part but the whole thing moves along lickety-spit and generates lots of laughs and good feeling. A minor gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man on the flying trapeze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie with Cary Grant, to me anyway, is wonderful. It is trite to say, but there really is no actor like him today. Geoge Clooney could have been, but to his credit (unfortunately for us Cary-like lovers) he has chosen to accept the challenge of many different roles and sees himself as an actor, not a specific type of person, acting. I like both these men, in any case.Irene Dunne is also fabulous, her timing is the best of anyone this side of Madeline Kahn, but Dunne was more sophisticated and played off Grant beautifully. One cannot imagine Kahn as a Cary Grant leading lady!And Randolph Scott! Wow. Where has he been all my life? Oh yeah, dead. Too bad, he is also perfect for this film. I wouldn't mind seven years on a Pacific Island with someone who can swing from a trapeze like he can.Oh yes, the film...great escapism, but I must say I think both "Nick" and "Ellen" as husband and wife were insensitive clods to Gail Patrick's character, "Bianca." That poor woman would have made some man a good wife, too bad not Nick.This is one of my favorite movies and I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to see how the other half lived in the 1930s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The flatmates are teamed up together again for the second time, and appear in this romantic comedy with Irene Dunne. The younger Randolph Scott was far more impressive than the mature Randolph Scott in the westerns. Although he went on to appear with John Wayne in 'Pittsburgh', he never quite managed to look credible in a western as Wayne did. This film is altogether a good and entertaining film. It belongs in the canon of Cary Grant, but also stands out by itself as a self contained film. Cary Grant is genuinely funny in this film, and the chemistry between him, Scott and Dunne almost define the perfect romantic-comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Social Change Has Dated This Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine film, it has a lot of talented people in it. Carey Grant, &amp; Irene Dunne are great &amp; really the whole cast is great. The comedy genius of Leo McCarey (who did some fine comedies with the Marx Brothers) is involved &amp; the film is well done. The only problem is that now the plot seems a lot tamer than it was then. Back when we had morals in society, a man &amp; a woman alone on an island for 7 years that were not married to each other was a big scandal. Now, with single women having kids without fathers, some having multiple kids with multiple fathers &amp; with an anything goes types of morals involving girl &amp; girls the plot in this seems to innocent. In the early 1960's this one was remade with Doris Day &amp; James Garner (after Marilyn Monroe died tragically during her filming of it).If you want to see a fine talented cast making a fine film, this one is for you. When it was made, the theme seemed more mature than today, but this one can still give you a smile &amp; make you miss the age of moral decay which today represents by taking you back in time to a era where this humor comes from.161</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grant &amp; Scott---quite a team!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant &amp; Irene Dunne were a great screen team --all 3 of their films were winners--but this one was the very best. Gail Patrick usually played a glamor puss &amp;, as in this film, she was,as usual, very haughty. However, a very interesting sidebar to this film is watching Grant &amp; Randolph Scott together. They made their 1st movie together back in 1932--a film called Hot Saturday. In My Favorite Wife,a stand out scene was when Grant 1st sees Scott on the diving board. His eyes light up and even later, in his office, he cannot get the image of Scott out of his mind. Of course, anyone might react that way if their wife had been alone with him for 7 years--but--these guys certainly looked ( and apparently did) like 2 guys who really appreciated each other--in more ways than one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwed up Screwball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writing a movie is first a matter of engineering a solution to the fact that viewers both know they are in a movie and at the same time want to be swept up in the narrative. Many solutions fall into the category of "folding," a special study of mine. For about ten years, Hollywood experimented with the "screwball" fold.This solution is based on situations where an actor plays a character has to dissemble: an actor playing a character who is acting. The screwball version of this lets us in on the joke at the beginning and always involves a comic situation (usually with unexpected consequences). This gives the writer the ability to create a more abstract situation, as goofy as you wish.And it allows you freedom to build a brand around a contract actor, which was the main goal in those days. So here we have a rather mundane brick in the building of the Grant brand. He is involved in a game of avoiding reality with two women, and one of them (his first wife) feeds the game.Grant does his job well enough, though he wasn't yet at the impeccably tailored state. The problem is the vehicle is poorly written: the second woman isn't engaged in the screwball world (though the second man is). It would have been fixable: she could have overheard the kids talking about their misunderstanding of the insurance investigation and believed Grant was trying to kill her.These screwball things are hard to do. I think the genre burned out because you have to be more novel each time out. I see "Charade" as the culmination of the form: it is only partly screwball because we the audience is only let in on part of the comic dissembling.
