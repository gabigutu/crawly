		<shortDescription>It;s Cukor and the script!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only way to fairly judge the 37-minute "re-creation of "SGTG" in "The Final Days" is to have seen the previous 1990 documentary on the making of this film, which contained alternate takes, AND to have seen (as I have) the bootlegged hours and hours of Marilyn on set, doing it over and over. Not because she couldn't remember her lines, but because Cukor demanded it. And what you'll find is a very patient and usually cheerful actress obeying her director. Each time he asks for a new take, she does it just a little different. Higher, lower, softer, stronger. When she flubs, she doesn't fall apart. She seems miffed with herself, but no great drama is revealed.THis patched together thing in "The Final Days" is to me, the final indignity. Almost without fail, her weakest takes are used. Remember, again: Even when MM was letter perfect, Cukor DEMANDED another take.I think most of the IMDb reviewers probably know the backstory to this debacle--the script she approved, which was then changed, an antagonistic director(right before she was fired he went to Hedda Hopper, demanded anonymity and scourged her. Declared her insane and her career over. Nice guy! All we can really say about what remains of "SGTG" is that she was very lovely, strikingly beautiful. It is clear, however that as the film progressed she grew thinner and indeed looked a bit ill. She is radiant in the costume tests, and at a perfect weight. Later, in the beige suit, she is obviously padded (she had a normal-sized bosom, except when she was plump--which was most of the time.) The script appears to be a drag, but Marilyn was at least playing an adult woman, with children, in sleek clothes and using a far more natural voice. Had she lived to complete the film, it might have found success, based on the nude swim--a carefully choreographed stunt, she was never naked in the water at all, and her more mature appearance and attitude. But Cukor was a lousy director at this point, and HE was the problem on "Let's Make Love" as well--those endless scenes! He'd lost his touch.I'm glad so much attention has been paid to this last gallant effort on Marilyn's part. But you'll only recognize how hard she tried, if they release every second of her on set.Maybe fate was kind, and middle-age would have been an unbearable horror for her. But in what remains of "Something's Got To Give" you can see the elegant performer she might have become, if she'd had more faith in herself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Last Wink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not George Cukor would have made a good, sexy comedy from "Something's Gotta Give" is a moot point. We'll never know if it would have been compared favorably to its source, the very funny Cary Grant/Irene Dunn movie "My Favorite Wife." It would have to have been better than "Move Over, Darling," the mess it turned into after Marilyn Monroe died.We don't know what sort of screen chemistry would have been generated by Marilyn Monroe and Dean Martin (though if an actor ever came off bad with Martin, it wasn't Martin's fault). We don't know if the public would have accepted Monroe as a performer of significance for the emerging nineteen-sixties; each new decade necessitates weeding out what or whom isn't going to work from the previous one. We don't even know if this movie would have been entertaining or embarrassing, or both like "Some Like It Hot."But thanks to the 37 minutes of footage that someone managed to find, process, and splice together, we do know a couple of things:1. Though a little underweight, Marilyn Monroe still looked like she would glow in the dark; sexy, funny, tremendously likable to men and to women, and unlike any of her imitators. She drops a lot of the breathless affectations she picked up around "How to Marry a Millionaire," using mostly the sweet voice we hear in her TV interviews. 2. She missed lines here and there but Marilyn was touching and convincing as a mother of two kids (!) as well as a sexy wife. Nobody seems to be enjoying the famous nude swim scene more than she.It's common knowledge that a few weeks into shooting "Something's Gotta Give" Marilyn was fired by 20th Century Fox. What too few people know is that shortly thereafter the studio and her agents were already negotiating a new contract for Marilyn, one that would guarantee her better material, choices of directors, and a substantially higher salary. A few upcoming projects that were being considered for her were "Period of Adjustment," "Irma La Douce," "Two for the Seesaw," and "What a Way to Go." If you have a chance to see this 37-minute curiosity, do so by all means. It isn't much, but it's like Marilyn popping out of the sky, laughing and giving us one last wink.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gotta give her one last 10...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta say, i was terribly gloomy while watching the footage of what could've been a very interesting work in Marilyn Monroe's résumé.I haven't watched the original movie in which Something's Gotta Give was based, so i really can't say it would've lived up to the original.The one thing i can say though is that i've never seen Monroe looking so stunning on screen. She was 36 and more beautiful than ever! She had lost that dizzy kinda dumb blonde look she had in the 50's, even the famous breathy affectation in her voice was gone. No gimmicks this time. She was determined to prove that she was indeed an actress and apparently those years she spent in the Actor's Studio improving her acting really paid off. The footages leave us only wondering how delightful it would have been to watch this new, much more mature and sophisticated woman she was evolving into. Her acting was quite sharp and despite of her constant mental confusion she still turned out refreshingly sexy and funny on the screen. Watch as her astonishingly slim figure gracefully strolls across the set in this flowery summer dress. She was cheery and smiling here.Her character was a young wife and mom and ,as absurd as it may sounds, she seemed to have nailed it. As a mom, she was caring and loving (watch her effusively playing with the kids) and as a young wife she was just absolutely charming. The film even includes some scenes in which she splashes around the poll naked. And believe me there's nothing tasteless here, in fact she was just being a plain goof ball. It's very funny to watch 'cause you can totally tell she was having the best time while shooting it.I was completely charmed by Dean Martin's character and Cyd Charisse was just being her regular elegant self. They truly assembled a terrific cast for this!The documentary that comes before the 37 minute film is somewhat biased but effective either way.Seeing this only puzzles me more and more regarding Monroe's tragic demise. Clearly she was not the most stable person, but with the new contract she got with Fox, all these new perspectives springing up and all, nothing hinted she was on the verge of something like that. That's why i think the suicide assumption becomes less and less believable.Anyway, hands down, Monroe's still absolute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May have been Marilyn's best film......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may have turned out to be Marilyn Monroe's best film. I remember when it was being made in the spring of 1962. There were some pictures of her on the set in Life Magazine . She was with George Cukor on that set by the pool. She looked awesome. I had seen her in the 'Misfits' in 1961 and thought she was becoming a real serious actress. Marilyn had been excellent in 'Some Like It Hot'. Her singing voice was great . After 20th Century Fox fired her in June no one ever thought she would be dead a few months later. It hurts to see the out-takes of her with Wally Cox at her 36th(and last) birthday party on June 1, 1962 as they left the 'Something's Got To Give ' set for the final time. I was pleased to see that someone finally found all that film that they used to put together the 37 minute version of 'Something's Got To Give' for that special on 'Marilyn's Final Days'. The saddest part is the last shot of her and Dean Martin talking and then you hear the voice of George Cukor (the director) shout " Cut " then the picture just fades away....and the titles say "In memory of : Marilyn Monroe , Dean Martin and George Cukor " .........Maybe someday some ambitious young film buff will piece together enough material from 20th Century Fox cans and cans of film from all those 'takes' to finish the film.....John in Louisiana........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn was more beautiful in this film than in any other!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the documentary on AMC that aired on her 75th birthday, 6-01-2001.I was disappointed in the fact that the documentary said that in 1999, AMC, 20th Century Fox and the Estate of Marilyn Monroe had started and completed restoration of 9 hours of film from Something's Got to Give. I believe this but find it hard to believe that they only could get 37 minutes out of 9 hours of film! There is more film footage available as in 1991 there was a documentary on this film that showed at least 10 minutes of film where Marilyn in her Greta Garbo accent was showing Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse around the house. Marilyn was absolutely hilarious. There is a lot of material that was left out on this attempt to make a picture out of what was left of the original film. Personally, I think someone concerned with this effort really didn't want to let people see Marilyn look so good when all they did was talk so bad about her while the filming was in progress. Just my point of view. Someday, I hope they will somehow finish this film with computerization. If filmmakers finished Jean Harlow's last film in the 1930's after her death with a stand in, I'm sure that someone could finish "Something's Got to Give" today, especially with all the film that has been restored and also with the technology that is available to film makers today. I hope that whomever or whatever is holding this back will have a change of heart and release a complete 2 hour film. After all, 9 hours of film is a lot to restore if you are not going to show it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn's last hurrah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This brief glimpse of Marilyn's last work is very interesting.She was trying a new look that actually made her look younger than her fiftie's image. It's strange everyone was talking about her age and an older Doris Day eventually played the part with a bleached white Marilyn do!It's well known Cukor hated the assignment and was determined to use his own script. Marilyn didn't have script approval and had to face Cukor's resentment every day. At least her bouffant sidesweep hair style swept the country,giving Marilyn one last hurrah.Cukor's attitude soured Marilyn on the project.She was anxious to leave Fox and get into better movie deals. Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse made good costars. It's one of those films I wish they had finished.Despite the ugly rumors Marilyn was staggering around in a drugged state,she looks wonderful. If they had to fire anybody it should have been Cukor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Voted 10 ... Monroe deserves it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I voted 10 on what they could put together with the last pieces of film of Marilyn Monroe. The opportunity to see her one more time is reason enough for high scoring this film/collection a 10.At times she does look a bit "out of it", but a lot of that may have been due to her own lack of genuine "enthusiasm" for this script. I don't know if this vidio shows the early wardrobe test, but that wardrobe test along with the swimming pool scene does show that Marilyn Monroe still had all of her talent and beauty nipped in a bud. "Enthusiasm" was one of the keys to Marilyn Monroe's spirit and talent, which she would have held during this films beginning with the wardrobe test, as well I am sure that she couldn't help but to have had enthusiasm with the freedom of filming the swimming pool scene. Regarding such, one can recall what Patricia Ryan/Whittier High School Teacher once stated back in 1937, that being.....Thus to you I say: never lose your enthusiasm - merely direct it - and that same enthusiasm will take you "where you want to go." Madame Ryan would later marry Richard M. Nixon. Perhaps the reasons and facts regarding the life and death of Marilyn Monroe may never be uncovered, but I always have found joy in watching her on screen and in the reading of her life, or in just looking at a candid snap shot photograph of her. She had incredible talent as an actress. She had an incredible spirit that moved off the screen and touched many people's hearts. And she was just as pretty as a pretty person can be and then even prettier.Dean Martin deserves mention here, as it has often been reported that it was due to his insistence (and contract right) that the movie continue with Marilyn Monroe and no one else, after she was dismissed from the film. This then forced the studio to hire her back. For the record and to Marilyn Monroe's credit, she was hired back at a more deserving salary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting relic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Movie Classics broadcast the salvaged remains of this unfinished movie in its documentary MARILYN MONROE: THE FINAL DAYS. The concept of the film is interesting, but what we see is also a bit sad since it is only a fragment which comes to an abrupt end.The story is 1960s fluff, a sharp contrast to the turmoil both in Marilyn's life and in the country that soon would lose its innocent view of the world. Evidently numerous scenes and inserts are missing from what was filmed. For example, when Dean Martin discovers that his presumed-dead wife Marilyn is not dead, his reaction is, at most, slightly surprised.It could have been an amusing little film which would have been remembered as Marilyn's first feature with a little bit of nudity. American Movie Classics is to be commended for letting us glimpse this tidbit of the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, For What Might Have Been, Maybe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been one quite-good movie. AMC assembled the footage that was shot prior to MM's death-- but if you're reading this, chances are you know this-- and from every indication, it could have turned out to be an enjoyable sex farce, perhaps a groundbreaking one, as it pushed the envelope just a little further.First, Monroe looked great in the tests as well as in the completed footage. She could get her act together if handled right. Second, and this fact cannot be overlooked, she was playing a MOTHER-- of children-- for the first time. And a sexy, mid-30s mother at that! Way back in 1962, 40-odd years before "Desperate Housewives," sexy moms were unheard of. Nobody considered that a woman was still a woman, even after having a kid or two. Second, "Something's Got To Give" had a great cast. Both Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse were perfect as the other two angles in this screwball triangle, Martin quite convincing as a comic suburban dad and Charisse exemplary as Monroe's sexual foil. And the cameos from comedians ranging from Wally Cox to Steve Allen only added to the parfait.But above and beyond Monroe and the casting, "SGTG" had George Cukor at the helm. Cukor knew a few things about comedy and could bring a presence to any film bearing his directorial touch. He knew what makes things funny. Think the Tracy-Hepburn classics. Think "The Women." Think "What Price Hollywood." No, DON'T think "My Fair Lady" nor "A Star Is Born."There's talk about finishing this film digitally. Just one question: why? Unless someone can digitally resurrect George Cukor from the grave, there'd be no point.Something's got to give? Something DID give, damn it. Marilyn Monroe gave into her demons, and what might have been a new start for Monroe's career as we witnessed maturing sexuality never got a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What might have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently on AMC a restored (as best as possible with the few completed filmed scenes) version of this never completed film was shown during a special about the late Marilyn Monroe. Complete with 20th Century Fox's logo/fanfare music and the films opening credits and music the story is presented albeit with so many plot holes it's virtually impossible to follow anything. The entire showing runs about thirty eight minutes and has an odd surreal feeling about it especially after watching the special about Marilyn Monroes final days and the making or at least attempted making of Something's Got To Give. Most of the cast members are now dead which additionally gave it a quasi-haunted feeling. It's hard to say how the picture had it been completed done at the box office or how it would be viewed today. It was eventually remade as `Move Over Darling' with James Garner, Doris Day and Polly Bergen and that film was nothing overly spectacular. To sum it up it's one of those `What might have been' instances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn's Last Sublime Acting and Appearance on Film Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvelous. Although this is an unfinished film, this 37 minute-excerpt of this wonderful 1962 film 'Something's Got To Give', is a very interesting story, that, unfortunately went to be the uncompleted and it was the last appearance (on film screen) of Marilyn Monroe.At 36, she still was the sexiest, beautiful and big actress woman ever. In this film, that glimpse with the kids, something, that she, in real life, was unable to have, gave her and to this film a very special feeling and beauty.And of course, the temperature raises to the most hotness, in that beautiful, wonderful, sexy scene, diving nude, completely nude, showing that she was (and still is) the sexiest woman ever, and that she still have a gorgeous, excellent, sculptural body.So much tensions and angry and financial problems, and of course, Marilyn's sickness and 'addiction' to the sleepy pills causing her (i believe accidentally) death, and of course, her trademark to getting late, caused the film get unfinished, and get replaced, but then Dean Martin didn't want with no other than Marilyn and the film stopped, but later she was re-hired to get back on October, but she died unfortunately.But thanks to those that wanted the film, it was restored and put on a 37-minute segment.Enjoy it! You would love to see Marilyn one last time. ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering everything that was happening in Marilyn's life, the footage they have restored and put together is for me her best performance, she wasn't made to speak in a wispery voice that she usually did, but in her own naturally soft and sweet voice. She plays a grown up women with children, not a stupid blonde. Her weight is at her lowest in this DVD and she looks absolutely smashing and elegant. I am very sad that they weren't able to complete the film for it would definitely have been a success. And just for the record Marilyn was supposed to film her nude scene in a skin coloured bikini but she took it off and filmed it nude.As a conclusion, its a very interesting and touching DVD if you want to know the truth about the legend's final days from those who knew her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn's Marvellous Farewell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The poignancy of seeing Marilyn Monroe in her final, uncompleted picture is deepened still by the emptiness one feels at the thought of what the silver-screen goddess might still have accomplished.It is true that "Something's Got to Give", based on the screwball comedy "My Favorite Wife" (1940), is a rather light, conventional movie: Nick Arden (Dean Martin) has his wife Ellen (Marilyn Monroe), who got lost in a storm five years ago, declared dead so as to be able to remarry. Upon returning from his honeymoon with his new spouse Bianca (Cyd Charisse), Nick finds that Ellen, who got stranded on a tropical island with another man, was rescued and has come home. Ellen pretends to be the new Swedish maid in order to mislead Bianca, at the same time urging Nick to explain to Bianca that she is indeed his legitimate wife. Nick, however, has suspicions of his own about the man who stayed with Ellen on the island. The fragment breaks off after Ellen introduces another man to Nick as her former companion.Just weeks before her suicide, Marilyn Monroe is as brilliant, sexy, and effervescent as ever. I do not agree that she seems absent-minded in the completed scenes - this assessment is a misconception rooted in the fact that the reconstructed movie can only be seen as the last part of the documentary "The Final Days," which strongly foregrounds Marilyn's dependency on barbituaries. In the picture itself, however, Marilyn is in top form. Particularly in the scene in which Ellen returns to her home for the first time in five years, and finds that her two children have no conscious memories of her, Marilyn's performance is outstanding: Her silent emotional response to the place and her body language match her best performances in "Bus Stop" (when she's mad at Don Murray), "The Prince and the Showgirl" (the reverie in Westminster Abbey), "Some Like It Hot" (her disappointment at Tony Curtis leaving her) and "The Misfits" (overall). You can see that she actually relates to the idea of a mother coming home and not finding reciprocal affection in her family, which allows a deep glimpse into her own psyche, i.e. her desperate wish to have kids of her own.Further, the nude bathing scene is absolutely stunning even though there is something labored to it. Marilyn definitely wanted people to see what an extraordinary body she still had at 36; you can see that she makes people see. And - as we learn from the documentary - she wanted to knock Liz Taylor, who was shooting "Cleopatra" in Rome, off the magazine covers, which she did. Despite these afterthoughts, there is an authentic sense that Marilyn's really enjoying herself and feels confident about herself. Seeing this kind of self-assurance, it is hard to believe that she suffered from depression, physical fatigue, and alcohol/drug abuse while she was shooting the picture.Finally, despite her luminous aura and still impressive physique, "Something's Got to Give" shows a more mature Marilyn, as do the photos made by Bert Stern and George Barris taken at the same time. Marilyn Monroe is no longer Cary Grant's secretary - as in "Monkey Business" - or the bubble-headed showgirl she had to play so often ("Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," "Let's Make Love" etc.); she's Dean Martin's wife and an affectionate mother of two children. This is at least in part the reason why it is so sad that Marilyn couldn't make more movies: Had she lived longer, "Something's Got to Give" might have continued the transition from "girl" parts to "woman" parts, which began with her playing Roslyn Taber in "The Misfits" - her best performance by far in her most artistic picture.To sum it up: Though the plot of "Something's Got to Give" is pretty thin, Marilyn is at her best in the completed scenes. Her presence is as bright and dominant as it ever was. The movie might have continued the transitional phase of her career towards more mature parts, and hence might have opened a new chapter in the history of Hollywood film making. It is infinitely sad that Marilyn Monroe, eclipsing her fabulous co-stars once again in her final picture, had to go so early.</fullReview>

The rest of the cast and supporting actors are great also. Maybe the film was newer finished because of the director, George Cukor? He kept taking retakes after retakes when it was not really needed? Who knows? Why didn´t they finished the picture with her standin Evelyn Moriarity? Hope they (FOX) will someday show us the rest of the filmed material (9 hours).

		<shortDescription>Absolutely a gem. A big turning point in Marilyn's career.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unfair to compare an unfinished product (Something's Got To Give) with a finished product (Move Over Darling).Doris Day is one of my favorites, but her 1963 version of My Favorite Wife had the familiar Immaculate Mary stamp of the genre that made her a number one box office attraction in the late 50's. Move Over was directed by her Pillow Talk director, Michael Gordon, and a role was especially created for her comic Pillow Talk sidekick, the reliable Thelma Ritter, as her mother-in-law in this movie. Bianca (Polly Bergen) and Nicholas (James Garner) naturally never made it in bed as a couple, before or after their civil marriage. Horrors, if they did. Ditto with Chuck Connors (Stephen aka Adam) and Doris (Ellen aka Eve) on that fantasy island for 5 years. Horrors, if they did. Absolutely no sex for Nicholas and Ellen for 5 years except to each other.With Marilyn's version of My Favorite Wife, however, the script and career possibilities were limitless. First, it was directed by the great George Cukor. Second, I believe it was the first time for Marilyn to play a mother in her career, and it was about time. More importantly, Marilyn put her career at risk (or showed her strength or vision, if you will) in this movie by agreeing to be surrounded by "strangers" (from Cukor to top movie star Dean Martin to the beautiful Cyd Charisse to Tom Tryon to Phil Silvers to John McGiver). Her character, Ellen, was the exact opposite of Doris Day's Ellen. This Eve had no sexual pretensions and she loved to show off her body. And what a 36-year old body. Bianca (Cyd) and Nicholas (Dean) definitely slept together when they honeymooned in Hawaii. And what about Stephen/Adam (Tom) and Ellen/Eve (Marilyn) on that fantasy island for 5 years? Don't even bother to think that they were able to hold it off for one minute! Alas, we'll never know how this movie would have actually ended. We all have a million versions. But we would never see Marilyn's full version. Something's got to give.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful treat to watch this little gem of unfinished footage of a stunningly beautiful Monroe, looking a little out of sorts (according to "The Final Days" account - she was quite ill at the time) but quite in control of her faculties and looking quite stunning and very very thin! All of her scene's with Martin, Charisse, the children and the dog are excellent and it's hard to imagine the behind-the-scene's tensions that were actually going on. An enormous tragedy that the film wasn't finished so that Monroe would move onto meatier roles like she'd envisioned for herself. Just weeks before her suspicious death, she had signed an agreement to return to the set to finish the picture and had a three picture deal ahead of her - making suicide highly unlikely.But back to the film: Dean Martin, handsome and charming as always, sparring excellently with her and appearing the true professional he reportedly was on set.I wish so much that this was easier to get, but finally getting a copy of this was a dream come true for I'd read so much on the making of this film.For any doubters that Miss Monroe couldn't act, check this out and appreciate the 37 minutes of 'treasure'. I gave this 10/10.</fullReview>

Looking better than she had in years and in fantastic shape, -witness the nude pool scene, daring for its day, Marilyn Monroe was giving one of her best performances! I guess that is why 20th after offering the role to Kim Novak who refused out of respect to Monroe and then to Doris Day and Shirley MacLaine both of whom refused the part, 20th finally cast Lee Remick who accepted ( only to have Dean Martin refuse Lee Remick as a co star) did 20th do the inevitable and re hire Ms. Monroe, and at 5 times her initial salary!When Marilyn Monroe was fired it was reported -likely leaked by 20th- that MM was acting as if in a daze but from the scenes of film I have seen MM was anything but! Looking beautiful and acting in a clear concise manner, I saw the magic of George Cukor's direction. This movie would have been a big big hit for 20th and Marilyn Monroe. Dean Martin was a great leading Man and Cyd Charrisse sexy and wonderful as Dean's second "wife". Wally Cox, John McGiver were great too!There were stars and then there were superstars and then there was Marilyn Monroe! Forever FantasticDavid Barra Los Angeles</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SOMETHING that could have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE is what MOVE OVER DARLING would have been had Marilyn Monroe not been fired by Fox and it's a shame it wasn't completed because what's here is choice. Monroe returns home after being on a desert isle with Tom Tryon only to find out husband Dean Martin is marrying Cyd Charisse. She tries to get him jealous with Wally Cox(!)substituting for Tryon. It's silly, fun and extremely well put together by the master George Cukor, who managed to squeeze out a lot with very little. Martin is Martin, Monroe is terrific (and stunning!) and Charisse is gorgeous. Phil Silvers pops up briefly as the insurance adjuster and Steve Allen is pretty funny as a then pop-psychiatrist. If nothing else, the film is of historic importance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marilyn was misunderstood...she only wanted to be loved as a person. She will forever be my idol and the purest of purity. She was all love. And all she wanted out of life was to be loved...unconditionally. But she never found the answer that society wanted. She tried...she loved...and it was not accepted by the "right" people. God Bless her forever; she was a true angel - even if she never felt this way. God Bless her...I don't know why she died - suicide or murder - but she is gone and the legend she has left is so powerful for me. I can not comment for others, just for myself and I feel her presentance most daily. She is the icon of beauty, intelligence, and sadness, and happiness (briefly through her life) that keeps me stable and wondering about society as it is today and yesterday. Why can't we all be loved and cherished as individuals as we are today. We all have the right to shine; as the stars in the sky.........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the 37 minutes I saw on AMC last night, this could have been a very pleasant movie. You can feel where the missing pieces are, but the 37 minutes they put together do make a coherent story, up to the point of the last "CUT!"An excellent cast, though I can see why Steve Allen didn't do more movies. I loved him on TV, but here he's a bit lost. Not exactly miscast, but not in control of his part. Wally Cox and Phil Silvers were lots of fun to watch.Oddly enough, the missing scenes seem to be the ones between Monroe and Martin. There's Monroe and the kids, Monroe and Cox, and Monroe by herself (the famous nude swim), but what must have been the initial confrontation between them is missing.At any rate, it's well worth spending 37 minutes on...I hope they come out with a video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think we're all very fortunate to have had even a glimpse of the most famous movie never made. My biggest hope with the ever expanding use of computer graphics, at some point in time, this movie could be "completed." Maybe a little over budget, and released 42 years later, but released nonetheless! Wouldn't it be wild to be able to create new movies using all of the old great stars? I agree with other reviewers that Marilyn looks wonderful as always and slimmed down from her previous movie. Of course one can't rate her performance using clips and snippets of remaining footage. But there should be much more in the can with the remainder of the cast. I often heard their scenes were shot, and then re-shot when Marilyn would not show up for days on end. Whatever the case might be, we're fortunate to have seen her final efforts on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike others reviewing this film I don't see Marilyn looking "out of it". As a matter of fact I think she is radiant and in better (physical) shape than her prior 3 films. Especially better than "Let's Make Love" where she is pushing the line between voluptuous and fat. That performance, which was also directed by George Cukor, was known to have been extremely sloppy and sporadic ultimately requiring the editors to piece takes together from short segments. In this incomplete film she seems to have made a concerted effort to not only lose weight, but to tone up as she was known to do in her younger days (living on Catalina Island while married to Jim Daugherty) where people were surprised to see a girl doing exercises and lifting small weights. To be realistic Marilyn's magic screen presence took a large amount of skill, desire and patience from those around her especially her director and co-stars. Less so in her early days, but by the mid fifties she had become insecure from too much drinking mixed with pharmaceuticals and too much ill applied Freudian psychiatry. Actors with self-discipline found her infuriating. As a member of the audience I don't think I'm alone in saying it was well worth it. With a decent script such as "Some Like It Hot" the fans found her better and better as she progressed from The Seven Year Itch to The Misfits. However difficult the creative process may have been. Fox sacrificed a good and possibly great film to instead support the bloated antics of Taylor and Burton that were bleeding the studio's shareholders for a rather muddled epic, "Cleopatra".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something was amiss...Marilyn looks so wistful and a bit dazed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe was still stunningly beautiful when she started filming her last movie. According to the latest data, Fox had fired her when she showed up for only thirteen days of actual shooting--but Zanuck later changed his mind and she was rehired a couple of weeks later and the film was to go back into production again with perhaps a new director.As we all know, Marilyn's despair led to an unfortunate mix of drugs and alcohol--at least that's what led to her death being termed a "probable suicide". But now edited footage has been put together to show what the unfinished film might have looked like if it had actually been released.From the look of things, it would appear that the script was not exactly what one could call witty. It seemed more like a tired remake of "My Favorite Wife". Marilyn's few remaining scenes make it hard to determine what the entire performance would have been--but she appears just slightly off-kilter, whether warmly embracing the kids at poolside or sharing scenes with Dean Martin and Wally Cox. There is a self-conscious flavor to the nude pool scene with Monroe swimming in the buff while Dean Martin cautions her to leave. This follows a scene in which Phil Silvers has a few amusing moments with Martin, as an insurance salesman and then does a double take when he spies Monroe in the pool.The one who really emerges from the unfinished film looking good is Cyd Charisse, who shows a fine flair for comedy and gives what appears to be a polished performance as "the other woman". She looks trim and attractive and it might have been a good comic role for her.Dean Martin looks as though he's perplexed by Marilyn's behavior and she handles her dialog in rather a halting fashion--looks as if she couldn't be pushed to do a better take. There's an almost vacant look in her eyes--and it's not because she's playing dumb.The end result is a mixed feeling of sadness and yet appreciation for being able to see Marilyn while she was still at the top of her appeal. Apparently, the film was just a thin piece of fluff. There is no indication whatsoever that it would have turned out to be anything more than a routine romantic comedy with screwball overtones. She does manage to suggest an impish amount of charm with her unforced laughter.Judging from the results of the later remake ("Move Over, Darling") with Doris Day and James Garner, they should have left this story alone. Dunne and Grant had it right the first time. It strikes me that this is the sort of film she wanted to get away from when she fled Hollywood for the Actor's Studio in New York.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe had a contract with 20th which provided Director Approval. Once 20th announced MM for a movie 20th had to also assign one of Ms. Monroe's approved Directors, ( The list was small but what Directors!: Hitchcock, Wyler, Huston, Wilder, Cukor and a few others). The studio also had to roll production within 40 days of announcing the film or Ms. Monroe would get paid and this great star had one of the first of the Play Or Pay Deals. Previously Ms. Monroe got paid off for The Blue Angel and Goodbye Charlie because the studio either could not supply the approved Director or start production within 40 days. Smart Lady. George Cukor approved by Marilyn Monroe was the Director on this film.Cukor has a reputation of great work with women stars: Garbo, Crawford, Shearer, Loren, Hepburn, Leigh, et al. Joan Fontaine was especially kind to Cukor in her autobiography. ( One star who wasn't a fan of Cukor was the irascible Bette Davis). Has anyone ever done a book on the back story to Somethings Got To Give? It would be interesting. We were all told that Ms. Monroe was fired because MM was giving a poor performance as if "acting under water" Instead we see the unfinished film and outtakes and Ms. Monroe looks gorgeous maybe the most beautiful of her career and splendid in her acting. Marilyn Monroe's "Greta Garbo" scenes are hilarious. MM's frisky skinny dip scene is sexy and again proof the Star was in total control. Lovely lady. Marilyn Monroe was scheduled to resume Somethings Got To Give with her cast mates Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse but under Jean Neguelsco's direction. Good deal. I am not sure the relationship between George Cukor and Ms. Monroe was ever that great. And Mr. Cukor made some snide comments about MM after her Death joining in the chorus of those at the time trying to demean the Great Star. 20th was allowing Elizabeth Taylor and cast to run up huge overtime bills for Cleopatra but made the Great Star who made them millions upon millions with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Bus Stop, Niagra, The Seven Year Itch and her other famous 20th Century Fox films insisted that the crews of her film have MM's birthday party at the studio after hours. Marilyn Monroe photographed by the great Franz Planner and costumed by a genius Jean Louis and looking better on screen than she had since Some Like It Hot, and beautifully performing Her role, this movie would have been a smash hit.How we miss you Marilyn!

Maybe because there was so much controversy on just how she died, they didn't think it was appropriate to give her that much fame. I think she just wanted to be loved, and I don't think that is a crime. If you can never find true love, just what is the reason for living? I really think people should be able to see her last film. How could we not be allowed to see her last film, when she was the most famous person in Hollywood? I don't understand it? Unfinished or not, why can't they do something about it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 37-minute subject, assembled recently from the raw footage of Monroe's aborted last project, is a fascinating look at what might have been a charming bedroom farce of the early 60's. I think she comes across as more appealing than Doris Day in the final version, "Move Over, Darling", made in 1963. Continuity is fairly intact aside from a few plot ellipses, and, bearing in mind that re-takes and pick-up shots were obviously impossible, it holds together pretty well. Could it have been shot in sequence? The new score is for the most part quite appropriate, and the skinny-dipping sequence, although tame by today's standards, is still delightful. The abrupt ending, as the scene literally rolls out with the director's "Cut", brought me suddenly back to sad reality. Maybe in a parallel universe...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of the blonde bombshell...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe. Two words that sum up all that is bright, shining and glamorous about 50s Hollywood. No other actress in the history of cinema has the iconic status of Norma Jean Baker and it's doubtful anyone else will.Something's Got to Give was Marilyn's final film effort, an incomplete bedroom comedy in the vein that Doris Day would later make famous. The fact that Marilyn died part way through production makes the footage here extremely interesting for Monroe fans. In fact, from what is left of the film we get a good idea of what the finished product might have been like and had it not been for the untimely death of its lead, it is doubtful whether it would have been of much interest. What does exist leads one to believe that this would have been a rather weak, lifeless 'comedy' made on the cheap and intended to cash in on Monroe's box office clout to make Fox a buck or two at a time when the studio was in financial dire straits.However, it is open to conjecture what SGTG would have been had it been completed. What does exist is some of the most exquisite footage of Monroe we have. After looking somewhat bloated and tired in her previous couple of movies, here Monroe is svelte, her figure is gorgeous and her hair and make-up are a dream. Again, Monroe was breaking new ground by ditching the curvy, hour glass look of the 50s and paving the way for the sleek, slim line figure of the 60s which Audrey Hepburn popularised.However, Monroe was not to finish the movie and so what we are left with are some rather pretty snap shots of her in her final months of life. Although it was a terrible waste that she died, Monroe to me typifies the 50s and therefore the 60s weren't really her territory. Although how she may have redefined the era is anyone's guess. Something did give and unfortunately it was Monroe herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i hadn't been hit by "Titanic", this should have been my 500th review. Why?Because after having reviewed an impossible movie because in production (100th), because it's porn (200th), because it was the fear of my childhood (300th), because I lost the fun (400th), my effort would have been to focus about the cinema's best known incomplete movie!Besides, with it and two more of Marilyn's movies, I exhaust my DVD collection that took 7 years to watch and review (like a famous itch)!Why an adult Frenchman in 2010 can be still interested by an American movie star that dies an half century before in 1962? Well, it's simple: I saw recently pictures about her and I was deeply mesmerized by the deep sadness and fragility she exuded. As I knew nothing about her except her tragic death, i first read a brilliant biography ("The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe" by J. R. Taborelli) and I got my answers for her sad eyes: no happy family, no supportive husbands, no ethic doctors. And yet, with such a heavy world, she illuminated the screen as never. In addition, she was also a motivated student and I was surprised to see that she shared the same teacher (named Lee Strasberg) as Brando or Pacino . In a way, this last movie was true to her life because she couldn't go on forever like she did. Nobody can have a career with being not at work and nobody could live with such drugs addiction. The real pity is that the older she become, the better she was. Thus, her last moments captured for this movie are really a must see for all fans of movies because it encapsulates all the essence of cinema most talented actress!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Insight Into Monroe's Final Days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Something's Got To Give" was your typical 20th Century Fox designed Marilyn Monroe vehicle. Woman lost at sea, Husband and her Children move on with lives, Woman returns home after several years - can things ever be the same? So a very simple plot, which was in fact already done years before in a movie on which this was based. On paper, certainly not a very exciting picture - nothing original and nothing ground breaking. But as it turned out, "Something's Got To Give" became one of the most fascinating movie projects of the early 1960's and indeed the Hollywood Studio System. This was due, in part, to it's leading lady - Monroe - and the circumstances surrounding the picture. By the time of the movie, Marilyn's difficult behaviour had become somewhat legendary and she had been blamed for costly delays on nearly all of her pictures - unable or unwilling to 'get herself together' to go in front of the cameras, she was often late on set, distracted and a seeming nightmare to work around. Yet, her incredible charisma and unique connection with the camera would always prevail and the efforts it took to get the best from her were always, without question, worth it 100%. Billy Wilder once said of her - "Better Marilyn late, than all the others on time".During the time of this production, Monroe's personal life was in total chaos as it so often was in her life. Secretive Affairs with the Kennedy's were perhaps the most important developments of her life at the time, but other aspects like her continued manic depressive personality, dependency on sleeping pills and alcohol continued to play a major part in her apparent downfall and they ravaged the girl. The extent to which her personal life was seemingly destroying her is evident for all to see in the restored footage from the movie. Although, superficially she looks far better here than she had previously in both "The Misfits" and "Some Like It Hot". Monroe seemed to have regained some of that magical glow that appeared to have been lost in her previous few films - Wardrobe Screen Tests prove that. Looking vitalised and healthy, those close to the film would be forgiven in thinking that things may have started to change and perhaps, after all, Marilyn Monroe was back on form. But they were wrong.In several restored scenes, Marilyn looks confused and almost "doped up". She struggles with lines and at one point appears to almost break down into tears whilst trying to perform a scene in which she must silently emote. "I Can't....." she says before appearing to break down. In other scenes, she struggles with relatively simple lines over and over. It truly is a heartbreaking sight. A once masterful comedienne and fine dramatic actress, to see Monroe struggle so much - and appear to frustrated by it, is truly a sad sight to see. Yet, on the other end of the spectrum, in many other scenes she is excellent! One particular example is a scene in which she is trying to convince her ex-Husband that a total stranger she has just met is the main with whom she spent her time on the Island - to put her ex-Husband's fears at rest about her fidelity. Monroe is masterful, she goes through the entire scene without error and her timing is beautiful - it's a truly outstanding scene. There are other similar moments in which Marilyn is on form, but it would appear moments of excellence and despair came in even quantities in this picture.The one-off look it gives us at Marilyn Monroe in her final days is what makes "Something's Got To Give" so fascinating. For fans of the blonde bombshell, it's also a heartbreaking piece because it shows how truly ravaged and destroyed the beautiful Marilyn became. But yet, in even measure, it shows how despite everything that was happening in her personal life Monroe was still able to perform wonderfully in several scenes. Dean Martin is also to be applauded - his sheer kindness towards Marilyn when she got it wrong is heart warming. Attempting to encourage her - "That was good though, wasn't it George (Kukor)" - he says at one point and he means it. A genuine soul who wanted to help Marilyn out when she was so clearly in need of assistance, Dean Martin is to be thanked and applauded. "Something's Got To Give" is a fascinating unfinished movie that can also be very moving and even heartbreaking. Marilyn Monroe fans should do everything they can to try and catch a glimpse of it, at least, because what it shows of this Iconic actresses, who died before her time, is truly compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn Monroe's 10 Hottest Moments on Screen EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I ADORE Marilyn Monroe. She's the sweetness itself, the sexiest girl ever, and my goddess. Giving me happiness is her talent. She can make me real moved just by a smile, a look, or a sign. It's my first and last time to dream about collecting every single frame of her (yes, I said "frame" !), because simply that's the only way to enjoy every single reaction, as she can give a different image every second where the frames save countless Marilyns that astonishingly everyone of them is more beautiful than the other ! If you're already feeling what I say, then you're living the adoration that I live. Ahhh, she wasn't a super star, she was, and still is, The super star. The screen, any screen, didn't have such a beauty..sexiness..tenderness all in one like that before or after.Marilyn wasn't the best actress in history, but surely she gave that Lumi?re's invention (which is called cinema) a damn good use ! So, let's review the best of the legacy that she left of not great movies or unforgettable roles; only great unforgettable time on the screen :10_From (Bus Stop) equally : Some reporter with a camera wants to take a photo for Marilyn, then she bends to collect something from her purse, so the wicked ? yet connoisseur ! ? man shoots only her bottom while bending ! MOREOVER when she was taking off her cloth in the bus, although we saw nothing, but the idea is purely tempting ! 09_From (Niagara) equally : the shot when she was getting off the bed ; frankly her look (blonde, with too red lips and supposedly naked) was too bold, or too beautiful, for the moment. I bet that was cinematically what pornographic means and feels back in the early 1950s! MOREOVER the moment when she was singing (Kiss). In that red dress, that figure, that voice, that indescribable out-of-this-world beauty No comparison can stand. You can't believe the heavy sexual charisma that the celluloid carried.08_(Some Like It Hot) : incontrovertibly Marilyn's walking is what the feminine female walking should be. I believe director Billy Wilder totally agrees with me, so that's why he made the scene in which Marilyn walks with Jack Lemon to her room at the hotel take place through a long corridor, filming it all from the *backside* as well ! Marilyn oozes seduction in that tight white dress by her so ordinary moves. Even spontaneously; she was too sexy !07_(Some Like It Hot) : singing (I Wanna Be Loved by You). I suppose that Marilyn was better singer than actress. Her performance was sparkling. No one can pronounce it the way she does "I wanna be loved by you. Boop boop de doo !). This is exclusively Marilyn ladies and gentlemen ! You can define "Original" by things like this !06_(Something Got to Give) : Being nude, even under the water, could be the orgasm of the whole cinema till 1962!05_(The Seventh Year Itch) : Her anticipated intro, in a tight white dress again, short hair, with that innocent look in her eyes (like she's saying : I don't do anything, while surely she ? even by only her appearance ? does A LOT OF THINGS !). While she was rising the stairs dear Billy Wilder, again, was shooting her from behind, Hmmm, why is that exactly ?? I'm sure that Tom Ewell's character was saying stuff in his mind that the censorship at the time would've cut ! True that declaring these unspoken comments became possible right now but who'd deserve them among the stars of today ?!04_(Monkey Business) : naturally being in that DAZZLING black swimsuit. She wasn't only sexy in it, she was literally electrifying. I seriously dare anyone can allude, just allude, to any other girl in the history of the American cinema ever been in a swimsuit and was more hot or perfectly-voluptuous than Marilyn in here! This is what impossible is all about. By the way number (7) on the swimsuit's side could refer to the original sins, assuring that Marilyn in it is more alluring than all of them !03_(Some Like It Hot) : The feast of kisses. Tony Curtis was the luckiest man on Earth in 1959. Though, he said that he didn't enjoy it ! (No, he's not gay !). Let me tell you, at any rate : I, with millions if not billions, enjoy it. This is the closest to a sex scene Hollywood made at the time. Marilyn was hypnotizing, delicious and loose. Damn, she was the looseness of the American cinema itself! 02_(There's No Business Like Show Business) : I have 2 holy words for you (Heat Wave) ! Without much ado, just go to the movie's pages at the IMDb to read my review about it (the number, not the movie of course!).01_Well, it's from a movie but not in a movie ?!! Remember Marilyn when she was kissing one of the male dancers at the finale of her (My Heart Belongs to Daddy) in (Let's Make Love)?, OK, that was extremely wild not to mention the energy of its surprise (which lasts from the first watching indeed !). I know all of that, but sorry, the one you've watched is not the one that I mean ! Actually it's not that mighty compared to another kiss, done for the same moment, yet only exists in the movie's old original trailer. I deem that kiss one of the most important events in the 1960s. The trailer described it as "saucy" and that's why it's sexy, rather ultra-sexy, for me! If you watched it then this is my definition of the most outrageous moment ever filmed for the sexiest women in history! So, what about your list ? And its highest moment ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mess From the Get-Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess it isn't ironic that 20th had two historic disasters on their hands at once--this and "Cleopatra." Says something about management, doesn't it? My take on MM's non-performance, both on set and off, is that she knew from the start this was going to be a disaster and just couldn't bring herself to go along with it, contract or no. Now, I don't believe in stereotyping and I DO believe in giving an actress a chance to stretch herself, but come on, gang--Marilyn as a yachtsman, photographer, AND mother of 2?? And Dean Martin as a lawyer??? Marrying Cyd Charisse at her most brittle as a controlling unpleasant hopeless neurotic? Isn't SOME part of a movie supposed to be believable? The casting makes a ludicrous premise all the more so. Cukor had a rep for directing female stars, but on the basis of this and "My Fair Lady" (where he kept the fact Hepburn's singing voice was to be dubbed from her for the whole shoot) he must've become a hardcore misogynist somewhere along the line. What a rotter. Interesting how completely opposite the final version ("Move Over Darling") was--no one would mistake Doris Day's sanitized squeaky-clean wife as anything like Marilyn's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, yet comforting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught a scene from this on the doco "Remembering Marilyn", and was quite disturbed at how frazzled Marilyn looked. She could hardly speak properly. They said on the doco that drink and drugs had made her that way. Very sad - from watching her, i didn't doubt it. And she looks virtually anorexic in the wardrobe tests for the film).(Mind - i'm not being defamatory, i have deep love and respect for Marilyn, and begrudgingly admit what manipulating abusing Hollywood men and drugs had done to her)In one way i was comforted - this was NOT a case of "what might have been" - if the conspiracy theories are true, the CIA did not rob the world of more and better Monroe movies. It was sad what happened to Marilyn, but in the condition she was in, there was no way she could have produced any more decent work, and nothing in life brought her the least bit of happiness.At least now she feels pain no more, and can be used and abused no more.Rest in Peace, Norma Jean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irene Dunne vs Marilyn Monroe vs Doris Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doris Day made "Move Over Darling" as big favor to 20th Century Fox and as a chance to finish her contractual commitment with the company. 20th was in financial trouble with Elizabeth Taylor holding up production of "Cleopatra" in Rome and practically breaking the studio financially with delays, illness, etc. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Marilyn Monroe couldn't get it together to film "Somethin's Gotta Give." She was late, couldn't remember lines, wasn't showing up for work...a real mess. After Monroe's death, Doris was asked to step in. She was box office bonanza and DEPENDABLE. Plus, she was the #1 ranked star in films.I didn't like Irene Dunne's version, I certainly thought that Marilyn Monroe's was inept and Doris Day's version was overblown.Among the three actresses/stars, Doris Day, of course was the best performer, but she was directed haphazardly in "Move Over Darling." If you compare her performance to Monroe's, you'll see a stark difference. Whereas Marilyn looked and acted drugged, Day was alert but following bad direction by Michael Gordon. On the DVD release of MOD, there is an extra feature "Doris vs Marilyn." Day wins.Tony Randall ("Let's Make Love") was once asked about appearing with both Marilyn and Doris. On Marilyn he said, "she had no talent at all! If you were standing off camera watching her do a scene, you'd shake your head and say, 'no, she'll never get by. But, the next day when you saw the rushes -- MAGIC on the screen! There was something she had going on with the camera. Hard to explain." On Doris Day ("Pillow Talk" "Lover Come Back" "Send Me No Flowers"): "Brilliant! One of the best actresses on the screen. She, herself, doesn't know how great she is. A natural." To me, it was painful watching Monroe in this role. I saw the outtakes and it was obvious that the rumors were true. Marilyn couldn't remember her lines, she was nervous and unsure...a total disaster. The only time she looked comfortable was when she was nude, swimming in the pool. In contrast, Day was the total professional. She showed up on time, knew her lines and finished the picture on time. "Move Over Darling" was a huge hit at the box office because all of Doris' pictures were at the time. I didn't like all of the picture, only parts. I thought Day was wonderful in the department store scene with Don Knotts and great with the slapstick through the car wash. She was also good in her scenes with Thelma Ritter. The rest was garbage.Monroe was even bad in the department store scene with Wally Cox. You could see how Cox was struggling...she was giving him NOTHING. Actors need feedback. If they don't get it from the other actor, their performance suffers. It must have been HELL acting with Monroe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inside look at a bad movie that never was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I also watched the TV special version of this. I would agree that this was destined to be an awful movie. But it is fascinating to watch the outtakes and other problems to see what was going on behind the scenes as Marilyn self-destructed.If you're a fan of bad movies that never were, also check out the I Claudius set, as it includes a documentary on the shelved 1939 film effort starring Charles Laughton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Thing This Mess Wasn't Finished!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I taped the "finished" product of "Something's Gotta Give" when it appeared on AMC. Being a fan of Marilyn Monroe's, I expected to like what I saw. The documentary showed Marilyn just as she has been described by many of her co-stars: confused, ill-prepared and generally "lost." By the time that Tony Curtis finished "Some Like It Hot," he almost hated Marilyn. Movie stars like Curtis do NOT like waiting around all day for their co-star to show up! And, when they show up, not ready to perform.Tony Randall said of Monroe: "if you were there watching her film a scene, you'd say, 'she'll never get by'...but the next day, you look at the rushes and MAGIC ON THE SCREEN." He felt, basically, that Monroe had "no talent." That the camera transformed her. Tom Ewell ("Seven Year Itch") said, "what you see on the screen with Marilyn, usually took up to 90 takes per scene. She couldn't remember her lines." More than any of her movies, I think that "Something's...Give" would have been awful, worse than Doris Day's overblown version, which was ill-directed. Dean Martin looked totally out of it, while Cyd Charisse did quite a credible job, much better than Polly Bergen, who was much too "acty" and over the top.Day, a much more skilled actress than Monroe, had her moments in "Move Over Darling," but the script was bad, and they should have used Day's own hair instead of those crazy wigs.Poor Marilyn's brain was not up to making ANY film at the time of SGTG. I must admit that she was much better when she kept her mouth shut (when she first saw her children on her return), but her scenes with Dean were God awful. The best thing she did was take a nude swim.Just compare Day's scene with Don Knotts and Monroe's with Wally Cox in the department store scene. Day and night. Day/Knotts was certainly better than the grade school calibre acting of Monroe/Cox.To be fair to everyone. I didn't like "My Favorite Wife," "Something's Gotta Give" or "Move Over Darling." Was there a "Thelma Ritter" in "Something's"?</fullReview>
