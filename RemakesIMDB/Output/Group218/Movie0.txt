		<shortDescription>The forerunner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the granddaddy of all the extreme Japanese horror movies that have emerged and gained cult status recently. Not only is it amazing that this film was made more than 40 years ago, but, more surprising still, it was conceived, written, part-financed and directed by one of the most classically-inclined of Japan's genre filmmakers. For some reason, Nobuo Nakagawa decided to suddenly turn his back on the period ghost stories which established his reputation, and create a contemporary exercise in Grand Guignol that was so far ahead of its time, his career never fully recovered.Most reviews of this remarkable movie understandably focus on its last 40 minutes, which constitute the most bizarre, gruesome and sadistic scenes in any country's studio-produced feature films up to that time. The picture's first hour is usually unmentioned, yet in some ways it's even more daring. Within a naturalistic framework, we're introduced to apparently normal main characters with faults not very different from our own. After a couple of accidental deaths, the characters migrate to a hell-on-earth masquerading as a nursing home. The story becomes a wild mixture of pathos and black comedy, with satiric attacks on the supposed sanctity of parents, the aged, the media, the police and authority figures in general. The earthbound part of the film climaxes with the mass deaths of the nursing home's patients, staff and visitors.Jigoku is certainly not for all tastes, but viewing it is essential to an understanding of the modern Japanese horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most memorable depiction of hell ever in the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jigoku" is an utterly amazing Horror film, possibly the best one to come from Japan. The film has gained infamy for being the first all out gore flick. To be honest, its a bit less bloody than I expected. I really don't care about how graphic or not a film is however and I was completely impressed with this one. Even though I'm an agnostic, I've always found the concept of Hell to be horrifying (maybe its my Christian upbringing). Because of this, "Jigoku" was quite an unnerving experience. Its an incredibly surreal film, one of the few horror films I've seen with absolutely no standing in reality. The film's first half has been called slow-moving, but I feel its an interesting meditation on life and death. The second half is when it truly comes to life with the most memorable depiction of hell ever in the movies.Part of the reason why the film works so well is the art direction and cinematography. "Jigoku" looks absolutely fantastic and is constantly dreamlike throughout. The direction by Nobuo Nakagawa is great also, as he knows the right moments to use a quick or slow pace. The screenplay is a bit ridiculous (why is it that the only two good and honest people in the film are the ones punished the most), but as with all nightmares it only seems illogical on reflection. The acting is campy to be sure but never distracting. "Jigoku" remains one of the greatest cult classics and a truly unique viewing experience. Kudos to Criterion for releasing another overlooked classic. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If good movie is sin Jigoku will surely take you to hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually find it positive if I can't categorize a movie and Jigoku surely gets the point from that. It's somewhat bizarre combination of drama, horror, film noir and art house where happy moments are more rare than good movies in Hollywood.While the hell sequences of Jigoku seem to gather most of the attention I think that the story as a whole is what makes this movie good. It proceeds fluently from disaster to another and while some events lead to unexpected results the script never leaves a viewer with a feeling that the twist was added just for the twist's sake (as is the case with many new movies).Technically the movie is awesome; good acting, great score (especially the haunting vocals) and beautiful cinematography. From modern perspective some of the hell sequences are way outdated (mainly the demons) while some look brilliant even today (settings like the river bank and some of the gore effects like the guy who gets flayed).I doubt that Jigoku pleases everyone but if you're into bleak and uncompromising movies this is almost a must see. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOUD and CLEAR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read about this movie when I was a kid. Never thought that much about it since I would probably never see it. Recently rented it off Netflix and WOW! Nakagawa's message comes through loud and clear across 46 years and the even wider cultural gap between US and Japan. Unusual stylization (truly hope to see this on a theater screen someday) is incredibly effective as a purely aesthetic experience (meaning you could turn off the subtitles and still be enthralled by the visuals and the music) AND as an elegy for the Japanese traditions of beauty and honor. You can read the various summaries in other posts. Suffice it to say this movie qualifies as a masterpiece if you don't go into it with "horror movie" expectations. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking in its day, but now seemingly little seen meditation on life and after</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read about and seen stills from this movie for years. I had heard how freaky and bloody and scary this movie's vision of hell was, but I never got a chance to actually see it. Finally I was able to secure a copy and I sat down to watch the horror.For the first hour of this film we watch as our hero lives a life that is more or less a living hell. More horrible, terrible things befall him and those around him than anyone outside of a soap opera has a right to expect. Very act is bound to damn someone to hell and it isn't long before our guilt ridden hero crosses over and experiences what true torment is. Its enough to make you want to laugh were it not played so painfully straight.What we see once we get to Hell itself looks great. Even some 40 years after it first marched across theater some of the shots of flayed flesh and disemboweled intestines are still shocking. The cramped and dark vistas are something out of a nightmare. Many tormented images you'd almost be proud to have on your walls.Is it scary a bit but its not the be all and end all that some had made it out to be. Then again the films images have been raided by others so it less shocking. I also find that some of the pacing is off and what may have once worked now borders on tedious.The film seems to be saying that all life, here or in the next world is miserable hellish and that no matter what we do we're doomed simply to suffer. A happy little film if there ever was one.I like the film but far from love it. The first part is very soapy and over blown, while the second is almost a catalog of horrors. I give it points for trying but I don't think it completely works.Should you see it?A coin toss. It really depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking, for gore and guts, its here but not enough to make you walk away happy. Are you looking for a meditation on sin, guilt and existence, you may like it, especially if you can get past the soap. If you want to see a technically well made film that doesn't quite work but influenced later films and which will provide some discussion over dinner, then try it.I give it 7 out of 10 for the parts more than the whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Japanese word JIGOKU translates to English as HELL. During the first half of this 1960 epic shocker, we follow some students take on a rather evil mentor. Most of the students are killed during various fits of rage. The second half follows these students in Hell. Though this film was made 40 years ago, the Hell scenes could still garnish an NC-17 if shown in a modern multiplex. Sinners are sawed in half, slammed in the jaw with spikes, limbs are torn. It's brutally frightening! Masterfully photographed and acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JIGOKU (Nobuo Nakagawa, 1960) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words can't aptly describe the assault on the senses that is JIGOKU but I'll try anyway: over-used phrases like fascinating, surreal, disturbing and unique instantly come to mind - but the film is all of these and more. By now, I have a fair number of strange Japanese films under my belt - but this one's something else entirely!From the stylized approach (shooting from odd angles and the occasional adoption of a greenish hue) to its plethora of arresting imagery (especially the gruesome body piercing - sword through neck, eye-gouging, feet stamping on huge needles, torso sawed in half, etc.), director/co-writer Nakagawa's vision of Hell is surely among the most visceral ever depicted on the screen. While its concept of establishing sections (or circles) of punishment for specific crimes goes all the way back to Dante Alighieri - though, as mentioned in the film itself, Buddhism has its own take on the subject - cinematically it anticipates the one seen in the Coffin Joe outing THIS NIGHT I'LL POSSESS YOUR CORPSE (1966). Still, with respect to both the microcosmic viewpoint of the plot and the film's vivid color scheme, it also reminded me of GOKE - BODY SNATCHER FROM HELL (1968), while its essential nihilism (I literally lost count of the number of people killed off during the first hour!) looks forward to BLIND BEAST (1969).The doppelganger element - in the DVD's main supplement, a 39-minute featurette, it's mentioned that the script was partly inspired by the Faust legend - heightens the film's already disquieting aura: Yoichi Numata as an emissary of Hell in human form (though he's not spared the painful retribution for his sins once the scene shifts to the netherworld) is especially effective; interestingly, the actor was disappointed by his own performance and admits now that he couldn't understand the role! However, I need to point out that - much like I had written of Ingmar Bergman's THE RITE (1969) - the plot reaches a level of implausible melodrama as to feel almost like a parody (even more so when considering the various characters' penchant for bursting into sentimental songs a' la the work of John Ford!).Anyway, while I found the DVD transfer somewhat dark, I'm glad to say that the copy I own is the 'Second Pressing' - this means that the problem concerning a 2-minute sequence, which previously got skipped when watching the disc on a DVD player, has now been fixed. Originally intended for Eclipse, Criterion's sub-label - back when it was supposed to release little-known genre/exploitation titles - I feel that the film is important enough to warrant its place in the official Collection.The bits from GHOST STORY OF YOTSUYA (1959) shown in the featurette were very intriguing and, hopefully, won't be too long in coming; still, I was equally itching to learn more about the various 'B' horror films by Nakagawa and production company Shintoho (which had actually started out by making such masterworks of World Cinema as Akira Kurosawa's STRAY DOG [1949] and Kenji Mizoguchi's THE LIFE OF OHARU [1952]!) whose posters form the extensive still gallery... Although I have to admit that I'd never heard of the film prior to Criterion's DVD announcement, Chuck Stephens - in his rather pretentious essay in the accompanying booklet (though he perceptively suggests that the pairing of the dead yakuza's mother and girlfriend may well have anticipated the deadly female relatives of ONIBABA [1964]) - believes that JIGOKU ought to be thought of in the same terms as such horror landmarks as EYES WITHOUT A FACE (1959), BLACK Sunday (1960), PEEPING TOM (1960) and PSYCHO (1960), films which collectively brought an unprecedented maturity to the genre. Needless to say, the film's greatest influence can be seen in the gore-drenched Asian exploitation cinema which survives to this day (interestingly enough, JIGOKU was itself remade twice over the years - in 1979 and 1999!).</fullReview>

After it goes to the "real" hell, you realize that hell is all the things that went undone in the mortal coil.You realize that if you don't want to live in hell later, don't live in "hell" now.A great psychedelic trip without psychedelic trappings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jigoku</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I think I know what you're here for: the Buddhist Hell scene at the end, that, without spoiling anything, offers some really oldschool splatter. Well, you should probably forget it. That scene wasn't made to shock you; it was made to shock 1950s and 60s audiences who were used to stately, formal, nearly stage-playish cinematic conventions--conventions that Jigoku follows to potentially alienating effect, despite its then unprecedented violence. There are gems of stylistic genius here and there, but this is of greatest interest to anyone into Asian mythology or the history of Japanese horror.The first half of the film is a thinly-veiled morality play crossed with a ghost story that, despite some heavy contrivances plot-wise, works fairly well dramatically as it slow-burns into inevitable purgatory. For all its syrupy melodrama, editing hiccups and various other low budget blemishes, Jigoku is a very poetic visual experience with many otherworldly images that will linger in your head long after you forget the film's flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking, genre-creating masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobuo Nakagawa directed a handful of horror/ghost pictures, but this is the most interesting of them all. A young man (Shigeru Amachi), indirectly responsible for a number of deaths, is sent to Hell for punishment. The Hell depicted here is the Buddhist version crossed with the Catholic version. Pools of fire. Torture. Lost souls doomed to walk in endless circles. Bodies flayed. Dismemberment. Flesh ripped from bones. The whole nine yards. The last half hour possesses an authentic level of hysteria as our "hero" attempts to extricate himself from the madness. Like "Kaidan" and even the "Female Convict - Scorpion" pics, this has a strong theatrical feel and is lit like an avant garde stage play. That this was made in 1960 is quite extraordinary for it foreshadows the extremes of cinema to come such as Japan's own "Guinea Pig" as well as 1964's "At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul" (from Brazil) and 1967's "Tonight I'll Possess Your Corpse" (also from Brazil). A groundbreaking, genre-creating masterpiece that is definitely a product of a more naive but less conservative era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maddening as hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jigoku" begins surrealistically enough, with artfully draped nude women in a chiaroscuro setting, bringing to mind some of the stylish and gritty Yakuza films of the '60s. Expectations of "Jigoku" continuing in that vein are quickly eroded, along with any semblance of logic to the plot. If you're reading a review that contains spoilers, I'll presume that either you've already watched it or have little interest in doing so, so a brief outline is worthwhile: Shiro is a university student who is engaged to a young woman. He's also an acquaintance (seemingly uncomfortably so) of Tamura, a thoroughly unsavory young man who seems to have some hold over Shiro, and be privy to incriminating secrets others hold. Tamura gives Shiro a ride one night, and Shiro asks him to take an alternate route, with unpleasant results: a drunken Yakuza, staggering down the darkened road, is (slowly) struck by Tamura's car, eventually killing him. Despite Shiro's protests that they should stop to help, Tamura drives on. The man's mother sees the accident and notes the license plate number. She vows to the man's widow, that they shall take revenge.Here's where the story takes a sharp turn from realism. Shiro, seized with guilt for his complicity in the drunken Yakuza's death (which consisted entirely of suggesting the route they took), wants to make a clean breast of it, but Tamura refuses, setting in motion what becomes a Buddhist story of guilt and punishment, both here and in the afterlife. Every person they encounter, it seems, has been responsible for the death of another...except, of course, Shiro who bore no such responsibility, having been nothing more than a passenger. And yet, despite his innocence and his mostly ethical impulses, he neither tries to defend himself, nor protest the injustice of his punishment. He's entirely passive; the most energetic thing he does is to shout various people's names at different points. (What is it with the Japanese shouting people's names?! Has it ever helped a character's situation in a film, much less in real life? If so, I've never seen it.) The story slows down to a crawl, with everyone dying and going to hell, whether or not they did anything wrong. And the methods through which they die are so improbable as to be farcical. High up on a suspension bridge, two bad people accidentally fall to their deaths -- despite a clearly visible grid of cables stretching like guardrails on both sides. Someone falls down one flight of stairs onto the tatami mat floor; apparently, a fatal end. A dozen old people die from eating little fish, caught that day, which have supposedly gone rancid. I couldn't help but think of the scene in Monty Python's "The Meaning of Life", where Death kills all of the members of a dinner party through tinned salmon, used in the mousse. The rest of the plodding story is set in the Buddhist conception of hell, and is played essentially straight from that dogma. Physical punishment is graphically meted out, with gratuitous eye-gouging, flaying and other sadistic punishments, shown for their shock value rather than for our edification. Shiro calls out for his daughter, floating off (to what fate?) on a lotus leaf -- as if shouting her name would do either of them any good. Never mind the fact that, in the story, she was only a few month-old fetus. Here, she's at least a month old baby. Go figure."Jigoku" contains some stunning cinematography, bits of a very good jazz score, impressive flourishes of color and other charms, but they are unable to save it from the plodding, illogical cautionary tale it becomes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this I don't even</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goddammit this was some supremely f*cked up sh*t. And the worst part is that it's from 1960. Yeah, this is the most disturbing film of that age I know of, it's even a pioneer on gore effects. It's also the last movie to be produced by Shintoho studio, which went bankrupt.Nobuo Nakagawa's Jigoku opens with a strange title sequence depicting undressing women and hell-related imagery repeated later in the film. It then shifts to a story of multiple people who are all made out to be sinners in the end. There's this main guy, Shiro the student, whose fiancée dies in a car crash and he later meets a spitting image of her (who we later learn is his sister). He has a nasty friend Tamura who shows up out of the blue, seems to know all about the other people's past sins, and we never really learn who he is. An alter-ego? A prankster? A demon? Anyway, he and Shiro run over some guy and then the guy's mother and some girl she knows try to kill Shiro and Tamura, who then show up at the 10th anniversary of a retirement home (I'm not even gonna bother elaborating on this). Basically, the plot gets really convoluted.All of the main characters are killed or meet death somehow, and the last 40 minutes show them facing troubles in Hell, which is sort of inspired by Buddhism and sort of by Dante's Divine Comedy because Hell is split into circles (some punishments are similar, like people walking aimlessly). The dialogue turns into a mess of people screaming and yelling out each other's names, and basically a lot of weird stuff happens. The punishments are unusually bloody and brutal for a '60s film. There are weird color filters, strange editing, stylish color palettes and camera tricks, etc. I'm not sure why the sister and the fiancée ended up there too, I mean, none of their sins were even touched upon or mentioned.The symbolism is pretty strong here. Most major events happen at 9 o'clock, because apparently the Japanese word for "nine" is the same as "suffering". Also, there is a lot of umbrella-related imagery. Other than the fact that it looks cool, I don't see why umbrellas are such a crucial leitmotif here. The color red is very pronounced and characters are often wearing it, like in the scene when Shiro wears a white shirt while Tamura wears a bright red one.The music is smooth early '60s jazz, which sounds good in the first part, but then gets all dramatic and heavy during the section in Hell. The cinematography is great and pretty unique, but the print is sadly pretty bad. One more thing though, the "The End" screen looks really cool.7,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gore-tastic Japanese flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jigoku is a bizarrely sinister film, one that has become an instant classic in the horror genre. It's known around the world as the first film that used gore to such a significant degree. In all of its bloodshed glory, Jigoku is also a frightening cautionary tale, which - through its brutally vivid imagery ? introduces the important religious matters, such as the afterlife and what it really means to repay one's sins in hell.Two students ? the first (Tamura) is the incarnation of pure evil; the second (Shiro) is a friendly guy, who just can't get rid of his devil friend ? run over a drunkard somewhere during the night. They flee the scene in a screwy fashion, leaving the man for dead. Unfortunately for them, it so happens that the dead man was a yakuza, and his mom was very close when the incident occurred, and she was able to remember the car's license plate numbers. Shiro tries to lead a peaceful life with his loving girlfriend, but is ultimately unable to due to a strange and horrible turn of events. First of all, only a day after the accident his girl is killed as the taxi they both were in crashes into a lamppost. Secondly, the old lady bound for revenge ? along with the dead yakuza's grieving girlfriend Kiyochi ? track the two students down.Shiro receives a letter, which informs him about his mother's poor state, and so he decides to travel to the retirement house in order to spend some time with her. Tamura is following his every move like a ghost, like a devil who doesn't let go and curses you with his presence. His evil aura drags everyone around into a state of deep existential angst. When in the retirement community, Shiro falls in love with a girl who is strangely similar to his late girlfriend. After the death of his mother and a huge wrangle caused by the discovery of a few unexpected love affairs (Shiro's father for one), the revengeful old lady and her accomplice arrive at the scene. From this point on, things get odder with every following minute. Kiyochi falls of a bridge after she attempts to kill Shiro. A few moments later, Tamura is shot dead in the exact same place, and lands lifelessly few hundred meters below. The final sequence of the first act takes places during one of the evening feasts. The dinner turns into a disquieting bloodbath so to say, when all of the guest and strangers die one after another, some of them poisoned, other strangled.Now it's time for act two, the one where all things gory start to happen. All of the sinners the audience has seen before are now in hell. And it looks exactly how people picture it. It's a dark and horrifying place, full of burning fire, with huge, bowls where people are being boiled, and with angels of death all around announcing punishments and tortures. Shiro is trying to reunite with his love and their unborn baby, and ? in the meantime ? every other character gets his or her comeuppance. In the most grizzly and violent manner people are sliced, mutilated, and so on. Finally they realize how harsh a punishment for a sin can really be.Watching Jigoku proves to be a disturbing experience to say the least, but its religious values are irrefutable. Blood and gore serves its purpose when all those sick-and-twisted people, whose sins were previously exposed, are united in pain and anguish, unable to change their lamentable fate. Even though Jigoku might seem too bizarre and ludicrous for some viewers, it's a highly recommended view for all the horror fans and Japan lovers alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go To Jigoku!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The seismic, tsunamic and nuclear events that transpired in Japan in March 2011 have served to demonstrate quite dramatically that sometimes, life on Earth can be a living hell. For a glimpse at a more traditional Japanese vision of Hades, though, one need look no further than Nobuo Nakagawa's 1960 film "Jigoku" (or, "hell"), a picture whose reputation seems to be on the rise lately, thanks in part to this great-looking Criterion DVD. I had only seen one of Nakagawa's 96 other films before taking in "Jigoku," and that was 1968's "Snake Woman's Curse," a well-done if lighthearted tale of ghostly vengeance told in the EC Comics manner. "Jigoku" is a whole different kettle of fugu, and easily the more impressive picture. In it, we meet a young student named Shiro, played by the handsome and very likable Shigeru Amachi. Newly engaged, his life takes a decisive turn when he is involved in a hit-and-run accident one night, and is unable to convince his demonic acquaintance, Tamura (Yoichi Numata)--the actual driver of the car--to report the incident. Before long, every person in Shiro's life begins to meet an early demise, in advance of the journey to the realm down under (and no, I don't mean Australia!)."Jigoku," though over 50 years old now, feels surprisingly modern, with great use of color and a strong emphasis on jazz, drugs and femme fatales. The film's first 1/3, the Tokyo segment, could almost be a Japanese noir, with its yakuza and nightclub elements. The central section slows down a bit, as Shiro goes to his parents' old-age home in the country. But even during this slow stretch, Nakagawa manages to hold our interest with some surprising bursts of violence and the utilization of moody lighting and bizarre camera angles. The film's final 1/3, however, is something else again, when virtually every character in the film is judged and suffers all the myriad torments and tortures in hell. In this segment, the patient horror buff is treated to numerous fire pits, skewerings, a severing of hands, flayings, eye gouging, the shattering of teeth, a lake of blood, cesspool fountains, a vortex of massed sufferers and on and on; truly, a hellacious environment, made even more memorable via the film's use of expressionistic sets. Do all the film's characters deserve such a horrible end? Hell, no! Shiro's only sin seems to be that he is a victim of fateful happenstance, and his fiancée's, some mere premarital sex. Enma, the so-called King of Hell here, can be SO strict! Regardless, this is some pretty impressive work. From its opening dirge regarding the briefness of man's stay on Earth to its closing image of "lotus blossom purification," "Jigoku" is a film that should keep all potential sinners on the straight and narrow....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, perhaps it's worth seeing once...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, is this a weird film and you've got to hand it to the film makers for making something this original! But, even with all its originality you have to wonder who would really enjoy this film or buy a DVD of it? After all, the narrative is confusing and gross---but not so much it isn't worth seeing (if you are curious) once.The film begins with two college students out for a drive. One is obviously evil and with his knowledge of things he should know nothing about, it's pretty obvious he's a demon of some sort. During this drive, they run over a drunk and while it really isn't their fault, they don't stop. The passenger, Shirô, tells his evil friend to stop but being evil, he doesn't stop. And throughout the first portion of the film, Shirô doesn't so much do evil but stands passively by and lets it happen--and ultimately condemns himself to an eternity in Hell. But, before he ultimately is killed, you get to meet his family and friends--who ALL turn out to be selfish and evil people.Once Shirô dies, the film enters a very surreal second portion where he is shown the various levels of this Shinto version of Hell. In each level there are increasingly awful forms of punishment because the sins the people have committed were increasingly bad. There really isn't any narrative--just LOTS and LOTS of bloody and vicious scenes. By today's standards, it's all rather cheesy and funny--but I am sure in 1960 it would have nauseated and horrified audiences. I wasn't really turned off by all this, I was actually bored--as it just seemed to go on and on and on.This is not a particularly pleasant film to watch--but hey, what film about Hell would be?! But on top of that, some cheesy editing and special effects (the car accident scene with the taxi is just badly done) and too much spook house gore make this an interesting but very dull film after about 80 minutes--and it runs 106 minutes. Not great, but VERY different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess this doesn't really belong with my more extreme reviews but for all it's stunningly beautiful scenes, it's heavily symbolic imagery and symbolism this still, even over 40 years, has a punch or two to unleash. It is for the most part a tragic tale that involves an almost laughable number of deaths and other misfortunes but hell always beckons. The last half hour or so is a considerably finely worked series of hellish landscapes with not a little graphic violence that could certainly not have been shown in the UK in 1960. Along the way there are many delights and a cool jazzy score. Fascinating, groundbreaking and most enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Fresh "Naraka" Is This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror film about the "Buddhist Hells"(an important distinction from Christian Hell. 1. You don't go to Buddhist Hell because of any kind of God, you go because of past Karma, and you stay just as long as is necessary, for the pound of flesh to be rendered so to speak. "Naraka" the Buddhist word for Hell, we are told when the film opens means roughly "abdonimal" or "excrusiating", and though it's concept is more abstract than the Wests, it's torture's are much more specific, and would make Eli Roth blush.The story, begins with young man, who get's in the wrong car with the wrong guy(Tamura, who just appears out of nowhere, and then usually just to cause trouble or point out others sins), who has a hit and run, with a drunken Yakuza. The two drive off, though our hero wants to go back, and from them on, everything in his life goes wrong. Girlfriend dies, mother becomes terminally ill, father revealed as an unrepentant adulterer and reprobate, a doppleganger of his girlfriend re-appears, and the girlfriend and mother of the man he killed are on his tail too, which all come together in one hellish night of murder, revenge, and accidental death that takes them all.The next half hour to forty minutes takes place in Hell. We watch a series of spectacles from the outer depths of purgatory to the inner rings of the vortex of torment, where our Hero after meeting his wife again (who may have been his sister, it's revealed, at least one of the dopplegangers was), goes on a quest to find the soul of his brother/son, who is shown on screen as a baby riding a leaf down a river of blood.Severed heads, flailing, a field of faces half buried (images I recognize from "What Dreams May Come" Hell sequence), and much, much, more.Jigoku, is one of the few horror movies I've seen, that has no pre-cursors, nothing has ever looked this, though plenty have tried since. There's elements of theater, b-movie conventions, theology, sharp editing and directing, and some of the best set design I've ever seen.Though over 60 years old, it feels surprisingly not too dated, and though bleak as any film about "Hell" could be, it's important to note that Buddhist Hell is more like a place for shedding psychic skin, than an eternal prison, as the last frame of our hero and his child on opposite ends of the wheel of torment, followed by a distant light shimmering in the darkness, would suggest.So...not to scary, but Brilliant. One of the best horror movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Land Down Under</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an old saying goes actions have consequences, it doesn't matter how deep you bury the truth or even how far you go, sooner or latter you eventually pay the price.This is one of the most bizarre and daring J Horror entries I've ever seen, it is no doubt one of a kind as it deals with a touchy subject matter Hell itself. It was really scary and disturbing enough to the point where it would make anyone go to Church or even consider taking up any kind of positive faith. But at the same time it was also bizarrely beautiful because of the fantastic imagery.Not much I can really say, the plot line is simple on sinners simply going to hell. The first half is really a standard setter just to justify the reason why the main character and most around him are going to the land down under. The main character Shiro is a bit sympathetic but to an extent as you feel he should know better. Shiro is unfortunately being influenced by his so called friend whom is pretty much evil incarnate. Why the hell Shiro would ever be friends with him is anyone's guess but anyway as we see the guy is leading him down a bad road from an incident that easily could of been avoided but wasn't as Shiro listens to his friend giving him the worst advice any person would give another. And of course it's all downhill for Shiro as bad karma just brews, left and right everything goes wrong to the point of his inevitable doom which is when things really get exciting or terrifying however you see it, but that's what were all really in this film for the visuals/journey to Hell.The hell sequence is fantastic, the only other film that has this type of sequence is one of the Coffin Joe films but that's a different story. The second half is literally a roller coaster ride of wild imagery, as you are just jettisoned with a barrage of dark, disturbing and beautiful images of all the torments of the Budist faith's version of Hell. There is just so much to see almost as much as a Mad Magazine or Where's Waldo book illustration art that it would take more than one watch to get it all.The production value of the Hell sequence is fantastic as it's all practical. From the gore effects, the make up work on the demons and ogres, but also the place itself was inspired by the paintings of Henrich Bloch and Dante's Inferno. There is just a lot of really disturbing things that happen which is terrifying on a deep seeded level as we see sinners are being punished in many different ways and pulled different directions. Heads are being decapitated, bodies sawed off, people being beaten by clubs of giant ogres, and more and more crazy things you just have to see to believe. It just goes to show that even if you escape you crimes in the mortal world you can never escape them in the spiritual realm.Thought the film isn't entirely doom and gloom as we see there is a sense of hope as we see Shiro's only salvation is the repent for his sins so that he can according to the Budist faith be given another chance in the mortal realm. In a way you could say that is part of the message of the film which to me makes this film both a Buddist but also Christian film as in both faith's it teaches us that it is never too late to repent, in order to be spiritually clean one must admit to their own sins so forgiveness can be attained and you gain spiritual freedom.Overall this is a solid J Horror film, like most their films it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but still if your a horror fan and are into J Horror then it's worth a glimpse.Beware of the consequences of your actions, you never know where they might lead you to.Rating: 3 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting and disturbing Japanese trip to Hell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jigoku is a very strange and disturbing 1960 Japanese horror film whose title literally means "Hell". The film opens with student Shiro (Shigeru Amachi) who reluctantly falls in with another student named Tamura (Yoichi Numata), despite Shiro feeling very uncomfortable with this morally void young man. When driving together one night, Tamura runs over a drunken Yakuza and kills him. Shiro, now racked with guilt, starts to see his life spinning out of control as his fiancé' (Utako Mitsuya) is killed in a car accident and his mother takes ill. Even worse, the drunk Yakuza's mother and girlfriend seek revenge and Shiro becomes surrounded with a group of people who, like him, all have sins to hide. Are Shiro and those around him truly on a path to pay for their sins? Director Nobuo Nakagawa boldly answers this question as the final act of the film literally takes place in Hell and eternal punishment is brutally given out to Shiro and the sinful individuals that came to surround him. The film takes a surreal turn as Nobuo gives us a visually haunting portrayal of hell and the diverse punishments suffered by those who find themselves there. Shiro might have been able to avoid this fate had he gone to the authorities and confessed but, now must not only suffer himself but, watch his fiancé' and their unborn child suffer as well. The other characters are also punished according to their sins and Nobuo takes us along for their suffering unflinchingly with some very disturbing sequences, some with unexpected gore. As this is 1960, most of the visuals are done in camera with just a few composite shots thus making this film even more effective. Jigoku may not be for everyone. It is a slow paced film but, that serves the story as we experience Shiro's guilt and the lack of morality by those around him, then are taken to Hell with them to see them receive their punishment. And it is a visually stunning and very unsettling trip if you're up to it. A bold and haunting example of 60s Japanese Horror cinema. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jigoku (aka Hell or The Sinners Of Hell) is a film that follows one man who seems to be forever burdened with hellish events. First he and his friend run over a Yakuza in the heat of the night and then his child-laden wife-to-be dies in a taxi cab accident after telling him minutes earlier not to take a cab. To top it all off, he gets sent to hell to spend eternity in excruciating pain. Before Jigsaw punished the humans he felt were useless, before Quentin Tarantino filmed violence and edited it to popular music?. there was Jigoku: a Japanese film which encompasses just about everything the horror genre would later come to gratify. Not just violence but it's characters fear and the sheer terror laid out by it's antagonist ? or in some cases it's protagonist. This may not be a perfect film but it has aged very well and it is a very effective horror movie ? the very first to utilise gore in such a way. A must for all horror fans.http://destroyallcinema.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Various characters descend into a type of Buddhist hell for their multitude of sins. Each individual is judged by the amount of sins they committed and punished accordingly. Film's main focus of tragedy is Shiro(Shigeru Amachi), a student in love with a professor's daughter. His "friend" is Tamura(Yoichi Numata)who has an uncanny ability to pop up out of the blue. Tamura is the source of misery for Shiro and seems to be some sort of demonic guide in leading him into constant trouble such as driving over a gang member and a car crash which takes the life of Shiro's beloved Yukiko(Utako Mitsuya). The film shows how Yukiko's death causes a domino effect of further tragedy with Tamura constantly around to smile winkingly as hidden sins come to the surface causing a giant death sequence resulting in a majority going to hell.The mother and sister of the slain gang member plot to kill Shiro and the mistreatment of the elderly at an old folks' home ran by Shiro's father are main focal points within the plot's structure. But, the film's gimmicky draw is Nobuo Nakagawa's artistic vision of hell. We see Shiri running through the cycles of hell trying to find and save the son he never knew he had as the infant travels on a lotus leaf! If I'm honest, I found this unintentionally hilarious at times, particularly the theatrics of hell. You just have to see the concoctions Nakagawa comes up with supplying surreal images of several characters suffering torments in hell. A vortex of suffering humans, feet sticking out of the ground like weeds, people imprisoned in head-locking devices, a man being severed in half, etc. It's really a tragicomedy. You can't help but giggle at some of the over-the-top performances in the film.</fullReview>

The film is a true work of art.Jigoku weaves the story of a young man who has a devil of a friend. He has a happy life as a good student, obedient son and beautiful, loving fiancé'. His devilish best friend has other plans for him though and takes his life into a turn for the worse in true Film Noir fashion. As the story progresses our hero is the hapless victim of a string of bad luck as his enemies and those closest to him meet their fate. Don't rue their loss however as we meet them again in the afterlife as they each fulfill their eternal destinies in the varying realms of hell. Can he save those he loves? Can he save himself?

		<shortDescription>Kind of a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked this one up on a lark and I was pretty underwhelmed. The opening is both stylish and genuinely creepy with its laments, wrapped corpses, and surreal hellscapes, and it segués cleverly into a college lecture hall where our protagonist, a young theology student it seems, is listening to a lecture on concepts of hell. It's by no means fair to say that it's all down hill from there, but the movie only intermittently reaches the same heights. There are deeply unsettling and scary moments, but they're balanced by lot of ho hum bits and few others that almost set one to giggling. The plot is a complete mess it pulls credulity to bits and keeps on ripping and its all so rushed that there's neither time to build any real suspense or develop the characters. This is another problem: The female lead is a stereotypical picture of what I take to be a traditional Japanese idea of womanly virtue and the protagonist is just kind of wishy washy and uninteresting. His demonic friend and tormentor Tamura steals every scene he's in; the actor was clearly having a blast chewing up the scenery. And he succeeds wonderfully in what (I presume) he's supposed to do, which is making evil look a lot more fun than our hero's imperfect handwringing sort of virtue. But of course all the plot and real world stuff is just to set up hell right? Well the hell doesn't redeem it. It's often beautiful in a sick sort of way (Brueghel has a run for his money here) and viscerally repulsive, but while it might shock and perhaps even awe the viewer at points it's more gory and repulsive than unsettling. I suppose my reaction might be culturally conditioned, perhaps it would get under the skin of a Buddhist much more than it did a (somewhat lapsed) Christian like myself, but this brings me to another point: The theology is harsh as well you know. Almost everyone's evil and even the people who've committed fairly understandable and, I'd think, forgivable sins end up in hell. I grew up in an avowedly evangelical church and their theology was much more forgiving and understanding of human weakness. Sometimes we seem to have landed in the world of those terror tracts some churches in my home town used to pass out; there's a definite air of grim disapproval (whether affected or genuine I can't tell) for the sinful modern world hanging over the thing that's so stodgy it's more than a little funny. I'll give it high marks for the visual style and for the cool jazz that floats through and most of the actors acquit themselves quite well (though some don't have too much to work with). But to say that makes a complete mess of plot, pacing, and characterization is, if anything, kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully done but really confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hell" is an incredibly enjoyable and entertaining genre entry with a lot going for it.**SPOILERS**Trying to move on in life, Shiro Shimizu, (Shigeru Amachi) finds that his involvement with Tamura, (Yoichi Numata) taints his relationship with his fiancée Yukiko Yajima, (Utako Mitsuya) as his disdainful attitude really sours her. When they both get involved with a car accident that takes it's victim, they again feel differently about reporting their involvement in the incident, and soon afterward, a series of personal tragedies affects him. As they both take the news normally, he starts to feel the pressure of the situation getting to him before lashing out at everyone, including Sachiko, (Utako Mitsuya) an old friend. When their behavior finally catches up to them, they find the eternal bowels of Hell are awaiting them for their punishments of the sins they committed in life.The Good News: There was some really great stuff in this one. One of the better features with this one is the incredibly impressive and enjoyable visual prowess demonstrated in the film. This is a highly visual film, with a large amount of time spent on simply creating wonderful images for little to no reason other than it's possible to do so. From inconsequential moments, such as the encounter on the bridge to the weirdness of the caricatures in the opening montage to their imaginary ideas of Hell, where shots feature select objects sit in the middle of the picture with a black frame around everything else for no reason other than it looks good or when it gets to the final act, it becomes far more prevalent as it's literally in the afterworld and is just a continuous stream of incredible images. From the interactions with the God of the Underworld to the scenes with them by the river and finally the conclusion, where the hero climbs along the cogs of a giant machine to rescue the spirit of his unborn child that is one of the most exciting and action-packed scenes in the film and is one of the biggest pluses in the film as a whole. The torture scenes are just as impressive, with the violence being off the charts and the sequences being incredibly well-photographed. There's scenes of teeth being knocked out with giant hammers, being trampled on by other victims and being carved up with various instruments, which is not only insanely graphic for the time but also just shot so well it manages to be completely fun and quite impressive. As they form a certain element of weirdness overall with these scenes, they combine to make for the film's best parts of the film and they make it so watchable on their own. The film also manages to become really entertaining in it's middle half with the big fuss involving whether or not their actions are well in keeping with traditional standards-and-practices, as it pretty much develops into a series of ethical and moral questions about what they're doing, which is such a drastic departure from the norm, and the way they're presented here with the situation constantly getting worse makes for some really interesting moments there. These here allow the film a rather nice pace where something is always happening, which is it's last big plus. These here make this one a relatively entertaining film.The Bad News: There really wasn't a whole lot of flaws to this one. One of the only problems here is the fact that, during the middle segment, it noticeably stops being a horror film and instead turns into a character study about the effect their actions have on them. This isn't incredibly exciting when it comes to being about a horror film. This one has a series of scenes that are like that, where nothing but drama inflicts the film and doesn't have all that much in terms of really doing much. It really needs to be streamed down and less intrusion with how much time is taken up by all the drama taking place. The scenes at the clinic and the first two conversations with the family are the prime examples of this, as they not only stretch the film out but really seem out-of-place in where they come from. It's the most damaging thing about the film, and really serves as it's only real flaw.The Final Verdict: One of the most visually-intriguing and enjoyable entries in the genre, this is definitely an exciting film with a lot to like. Those who prefer the Japanese films of this era with undoubtedly enjoy this one, as will those who place importance on images, while the ones who aren't into that should heed caution.Rated UR/R: Graphic Violence, Language, Brief Nudity and a mild sex scene</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell, as imagined by the Japanese.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It certainly helps that I'm often quite fond of Japanese movies, since I can see how this movie does not appeal to just everybody.This is basically one unique viewing experience, that can get quite artistic and unusual to watch. But that's just Japanese cinema for you. It's simply just a very different culture, with also a different style of cinema. I admit that you perhaps have to be a bit into (old) Japanese cinema, in order to fully appreciate- and perhaps also understand this movie.You could divide this movie in two parts. First you have a dramatic movie, with supernatural and horror elements in it, while the last part of the movie is purely set in hell, in which all of the movie its sinners have to pay for their sins.But it's Japanese hell, so it's not really something you are accustomed to seeing, when thinking off hell. It's nightmarish and very visually orientated. It plays on fears and torturing pains, while the movie at all times remains a classy and artistic one to look at.For an 1960 movie, it feels and looks surprisingly modern. It also isn't afraid to handle some daring themes and to feature some erotic moments. I can definitely see how this movie inspired later genre movies and Japanese film-makers. Its story gets told slowly, as is often the case with Japanese cinema. The story can get a quite hard one and confusing one to follow but not nearly as confusing as some people try to make you believe. Seriously, as far as old fashioned Japanese movie go, this one is pretty much straight-forward and understandable enough for western people, when you have subtitles available of course.But above all things this movie still manages to impress the most with its visuals. I really liked the directing approach of this movie, which also provided the movie with some at times artistic shots, that you are more accustomed to seeing in a good '70's movie. The editing on the other hand can get quite dodgy, if I really have to say something negative about this movie.A great movie, for the lovers of old fashioned and daring Japanese cinema at least.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I was pretty disappointed with this one. I expected something much more polished and sure of itself. Instead I got a jumbled mess of what could have been a great Japanese horror film. Everything seemed kind of rushed. There is a scene when the people are mourning the loss of a loved one and people are crying, but I felt no emotion. It jumped too quickly from the last scene and for that much emotion for someone we didn't really know was too much. There are parts that are good, particularly once we are in Hell. Certain shots are set up nicely and the atmosphere in Hell is spot on yet unique. How they all get to Hell is kind of ridiculous and that kind of ruined it for me. I also didn't like the ending. There is obviously a metaphor there but I don't see it. There is a big green wheel and the main character just keeps yelling for his baby. It's not believable or pleasant really. This wasn't what I expected, and this time that is a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The kind of film that sounds really exciting, and is interesting, but you wish it were a bit better than it is. Its reputation is based mostly on the final 40 minutes, where all the characters take a vacation to the bowels of Buddhist Hell (pretty much like Christian Hell, but with more lotus flowers). The first hour or so isn't much less hellish. A college student and his wicked friend mow down a drunk gangster in their car. The student, burdened with guilt (somewhat nonsensical guilt seeing as it wasn't his fault), starts seeing tragedy occur all around him. In just the next several days, all kinds of people with whom he associates die. It's never his fault, per se, but for some reason he always blames himself. That first hour is a little boring and a little confusing ? I was wondering if the guy was supposed to already be in hell. The hell part is pretty cool, but also fairly silly. What always works in Jigoku is the cinematography and art direction. This is a damn cool looking movie. I wouldn't particularly recommend it, but it's worth seeing just for the cool parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jigoku (1960) ** 1/2 (out of 4) A college student (Shigern Amachi) has his life literally go to Hell after he and a buddy accidentally run down a drunken gangster who jumps out in front of their car. Soon afterwards everyone in the student's life begin to die and his guilt eventually leads him to Hell. This is certainly a very strange and surreal film that has the same structure as the director's previous film Ghost Story of Yotsura as it gives us a lot of backstory before it gets down to the meat of the film. Perhaps because I'm from a different religious background I couldn't get overly involved with the story because I had a hard time believing so much evil and bad would come to our main guy just because of the accident that happened. He didn't do it on purpose, he felt bad about it and all the blame would go to his friend that was driving. For the student to be damned to Hell for what he did and to have to suffer through various deaths just seemed a bit too much for me and this dragged down the first hour of the film for me. After the hour mark when we finally get to Hell is when things begin to pick up with the bizarre visuals and (for the time) graphic death scenes. I've heard a few call this the first gore film and perhaps that's true as we get some rather bloody violence including a man getting cut into pieces, an eye ripped out and hands being ripped off. This stuff certainly isn't as graphic as the stuff of today but I'm sure it caused quite a commotion back in the day. The various stages of Hell were perfectly done and contains a lot of imagination. I loved the various stages that our student has to go through and many of them managed to be quite creepy. The scene where the people of Hell are begging for water was beautifully done. Perhaps a second viewing would change my opinion on the start of the film but as for now I felt it really dragged too slowly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Bad Japanese Horror Film from the 1960s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever watched a film so horrible that you simply could not reconcile its atrociousness with its glowing IMDb rating? I had this experience after watching Jigoku earlier today. The IMDb reviews were raving harder than a teenager after midnight ? with terms like "masterpiece" being thrown around, apparently on a whim. I was expecting this film to be pretty good. Nothing prepared me for the absolute disaster I was about to see.Where to begin? Let's start with the single worst aspect of Jigoku ? the acting. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the acting consists of some of the most systematically awful performances I've seen in any movie . . . ever. A typical bad film will have various moments of deficient acting, but Jigoku is systematically deficient, meaning that there are extremely long periods of time where just about everyone on screen is stinking the place out. For example, the latter half of the film ? which takes place in Japanese Hell ? is basically a 45-minute trainwreck that is the epitome of quintessential artificiality. The centerpiece of which is perhaps the scene with the lead character falling awkwardly after someone disappears near the river. But there are so many badly-acted moments that it would require booklength treatment to cover it all. However, the viewer should look forward to the food poisoning scene, which makes a Sci-Fi Channel Original Film look Oscar worthy.What else is wrong with Jigoku? Everything ? storyline, character development, etc. ? can be summarily described as unintentionally hilarious.Cheap, ineffective scares and downright stupid deaths are used. One such scene occurs midway thru when two people trip on a rope bridge. The movie then cuts to their stunt-dummies falling onto some hard rocks below. It was probably meant to be horrifying, but it came off as exceedingly funny. The character who runs over the Yakuza drunk was so damn slow in applying the brakes that it was reminiscent of Austin Powers when the steamroller was slowly approaching the screaming baddie from fifty yards away. The subsequent death of the girl in another car accident was also stupifying, especially considering how her boyfriend was sitting right next to her yet suffered no injuries whatsoever. Perhaps the funniest series of deaths take place during the punishment of random dudes in hell. Just look for the dude who gets "flayed", which will undoubtedly have the viewer rolling hysterically.At one point the movie shows extreme closeups of random people screaming at the camera, which gets very annoying.The finale has the lead character run in ultra cheesy fashion (in slow-motion) after his baby, which is strapped onto a big, turning wheel. I saw the baby on the wheel the first time, but the filmmakers inexplicably found it necessary to repeat the same exact scene over a dozen times. Imagine a 3-second scene being repeated over and over and over again every few seconds. It's almost as if the filmmakers weren't so much intending on depicting hell as they were attempting to INFLICT hell on the viewer with this pathetic attempt at film-making.To supplement the horrible finale with the spinning baby, the lead character jumps in an attempt to save the child, but mis-times it so badly that he ends up on the OPPOSITE SIDE of the giant wheel. I knew this guy was stupid, but it doesn't get any more moronic than that.Some gore (that was a ahead of its time) and a few scenes with fantastic imagery could have saved this one from the cinema sewer, but everything else is of such an unbelievably low quality that this film easily steamrolls to the bottom of the barrel.</fullReview>
