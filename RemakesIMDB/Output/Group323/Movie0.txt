		<shortDescription>Commenting on the comment "fatism" below</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fat person myself, I encounter prejudice every day. Movies are especially bad, because it is still considered okay to make fun of fat people. Most skinny people just assume that we're lazy. They think that we have the potential to be as thin as is considered "normal," but we just are too lazy to do anything about it. That is absolutely false (not that the skinnies would ever buy that, but I can at least try).Anyway, to get to The Nutty Professor, I found it to be one of the most sympathetic portrayals of fat people ever put on film. The only one that tops it is James Mangold's Heavy, although the protagonist's weight wasn't all that was harming his well-being. The Nutty Professor did have some physical comedy involving fat that one could take as funny, but I never felt that the jokes were degrading. The main reason that I feel this was so sympathetic was that, though he experienced life as a skinny stud, he did decide to be a fat man at the end. One can chock this up to formulae, but something that Sherrman Klump said at the end really touched me: "I could try to lose weight, but I'm always going to be a fat man, and you're just going to have to live with that." I think that a film where the screenwriters who were bigoted would have said something like, "I'll lose weight without this stupid formula." That's not what happened, though, and I'm glad for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Showcase For Eddie Murphy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A general nasty tone to this comedy prevented me from rating this a "9" or a "10," but it does have a ton of laughs, courtesy of Eddie Murphy. He's at is best when he's at the dinner table playing everyone but the kid. That is one of the funniest scenes I remember from any 1990s comedy. His humor is very crude in here (another PG-13 rating that is ludicrous) but very funny in spots, too. With that kind of humor, it's easy to go over the line of "good taste" which he does on occasion. Overall, however, Murphy is remarkable as all these characters. I believe he plays seven in all. This is probably his biggest 'showcase' ever on film, demonstrating his comedic talents.Even though this has a childlike-romance-type feel to it, and a nice message about bias against fat people, there are so many raunchy and downright nasty lines - mainly at the comedy club or the dinner table - that it's certainly not recommended for kids. This is a LONG way away from the original Jerry Lewis movie. Still....for adults, this movie provides a lot of laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine, funny, touching film???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, that's how I feel about it. And no one was more surprised than me.While I think Eddie Murphy is often hilarious, I don't care so much for his scatological humor. It make me think he wasn't toilet-trained properly.We get a fair amount of fart jokes in this flick, but they work because they fit in the context of the scenes, and the characters' motivations. They make sense first, THEN are funny, rather than the other way around (or just being silly because no one could think of anything funny to write). But overriding the gas glee is a thoughtful story about a fat man dealing with his weight and trying to find romance. The special effects that gave Murphy his blubber are truly astounding. It never looks fake. And above all this is the incredible screen chemistry between Murphy's Professor Klump and Jada Pinkett Smith. Smith is always genuine in her interest in Sherman; and his bashfulness and sincerity are truly endearing. I found this movie to be a pleasant surprise. I think you might, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Brilliance from Murphy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion this is one of the funniest movies you will ever see. This Eddie Murphy at his brilliant best playing seven different characters in the one movie. This is pretty much a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde routine with Professor Sherman Klump (Murphy) creating a weight loss formula which transforms him into Buddy Love (Murphy). The best scenes of the movie are the dinner scenes at the Klump house where almost every character you see is Eddie Murphy. Very few other actors could have pulled this off. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In order to gain the affections of a sexy colleague, and more importantly feel better about his overall self-deprecating image, shy, grossly overweight genetics professor Murphy takes an experimental serum that transforms him into a charismatic, testosterone-driven hunk. Things go quickly awry however when he starts to lose his own identity and battle his alter ego for complete control. This Jekyll &amp; Hyde formula is familiar but it's elevated by fresh, consistent laughs, clever and innovative gags, terrific make-up/special effects and a delightful performance from Murphy who's absolutely hysterical as he portrays each member of his family. Lots of fun. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the funniest movie I have seen in the longest time. It has become my all time favourite. I do not usually like to look at movies more than once but this movie has me going again and again. I have seen this movie no less than twenty times. I love the dinner scenes, especially Grandma on her recollections of her long lost "relations". It was really a scream at the Scream. I thoroughly enjoyed Reggie. He was unbelievable. So too was his singing. I hope the sequel is just as amusing. I think Eddie is a truly talented Actor in his own rights and I wish him all the best. I would really like to meet him though I hope he is not snubbish as are some actors/resses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer comedic brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nutty Professor" is easily deserving of being mentioned with the funniest movies of all time. This movie was nothing short of comedic genius. Eddie Murphy cemented himself as a comedy legend with his performance(s) in "The Nutty Professor". I would go so far as to say that I've never seen two scenes funnier than the two Klump family dinner scenes. For Eddie Murphy to have pulled that off so seamlessly only showed his range and his talent. The two dinner scenes were gut busting hi-la-ri-ous, and what made them so good is that you don't even realize that Eddie Murphy is playing all of those roles. The second dinner scene was particularly hilarious because of Professor Klump; although he never says a word. He was so humiliated by his family's actions that he had the most mortified look on his face, and a couple of times you could even see him attempt to cut his wrist with a butter knife. Priceless!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** 1/2Starring: Eddie Murphy (x 7), Jada Pinkett Smith, and Larry Miller.An obese college professor starts to fall for a pretty teacher. He doesn't think that people will like him if he was fat, so he uses a weight-losing potion he created on himself. It works perfectly, and the professor is extremely thin. Now, people treat him differently than when he was fat. But he soon finds out that the "thin" side of him has a mind of its own and is looking to get rid of the "plump" side forever.Murphy does excellent in all seven roles that are given to him. The scene(s) that really make it funny are the dinner ones. I will say that on a low note, Buddy is a little over the top.I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The theme of each of us harboring a darker side, just aching to get out and cause mischief, is an old one, but it truly flowered as literature in the age of Freud. Never before had our animal impulses been so -- well, repressed. The legs of easy chairs and sofas were dressed with tiny floor-length skirts. "Legs" were impolite, replaced by "limbs." A "bull" was "a gentleman cow." Virgins could be easily seduced because they didn't know the mechanics of what was going on. Chicken parts became "white meat" and "dark meat" instead of you-know-whats. Stevenson's Jeykll and Hyde were a perfect expression of this duality, the contrast between what we were and what we pretended to be. The theme has been enduringly popular because, to some extent, it's still an appropriate way to interpret culture. And it's also a flexible theme, one that can be changed to suit the times. If Stevenson's story was about sex (as was Wilde's "Portrait of Dorian Gray") then Jerry Lewis's 1963 movie, of which this is a remake, was about subservient conformity. This one is about physical fitness and narcissism.Never in my life would I have dreamed that someone could remake a Jerry Lewis movie that made Lewis's humor seem subtly elegant, but Murphy has managed to do it. Eddie Murphy's movie is often extremely funny but about as understated as a train wreck. I think the word to describe the hilarious dinner scenes that depend on open flatulence is "raunch." I don't know why we find it funny when someone farts. There are cultures, like the Samoans, in which it is taken for granted as an ordinary biological act and receives no more attention than a sneeze does in our culture. Murphy's entire movie is about at that level of raunchiness, outdoing Lina Wertmuller's "Seven Beauties," which has a corpse farting, outdoing Chaucer -- outdoing everybody.Murphy has a fantasy in which he is taken to the ER, filled up with gas, and the staff are unable to stop his body from balooning. He swells to a monstrous size, enveloping one of the doctors the way an amoeba absorbs a food particle, smashes upward through the building, strides gigantically through the city streets while people scream and run, reaches a hand through the upper-floor window of a hotel towards Jada Pinkett the way King Kong did with Fay Wray, reaches PAST Pinkett, and two huge sausage-like fingers delicately pluck the leg from a roast chicken next to Pinkett's bed. But that's not enough gigantism. Murphy gives this blimplike figure a spasm of intestinal gas which is released through the streets at hurricane force. A bum tries to strike a match and light a cigarette. The city is vaporized by an explosion the size of a nuclear bomb's. Okay, that's all. I think I'll quit while I'm ahead, something Murphy chose not to do.Sherman Klump, the fat man and the central figure, is a likable character. One of the reasons for this is that he is one of the few actors who isn't constantly screaming with rage or laughter. He speaks quietly and it's a relief, what with all the bedlam around him. But it's more than that. Murphy actually brings pathos to the role, and without Disneyesque condescension. What I mean is, Murphy ACTS for a change instead of being Murphy. (He doesn't bring much to the alter ego, Buddy Love, except even more Murphy than we're used to.) There is a scene in which Sherman Klump brings his date -- his first date -- to a nightclub and the comic begins insulting Klump because of his weight. Klump goes along with it genially at first but as the comic continues, relentlessly, humiliatingly, Klump's accomodating smile fades and is replaced with an almost infinitely sad resignation. (He's been here before.) He does well by the character in other scenes too.The subtext is disturbing. I don't know if Murphy realized exactly what he was getting hold of. Smokers having become pariahs, soundly trounced, insulted, and penalized for their weakness, we've been seeking other targets and the searchlight has fallen on the obese, the out of shape. "I can't help it," said the Chairman of a sociology department, "but when I see somebody who is overweight I just think of him as weak." (That's a sociologist talking.) Insurance payments are higher for the overweight. Some airlines now charge double the usual fare because fat people make their seatmates uncomfortable. I've seen bumper stickers in California: "No Fat Chicks," and a red circle with a diagonal stripe drawn through the silhouette of an overweight woman. I won't go into the many studies that have emerged from social psychology in the last decade or so, showing the social handicaps suffered by the overweight. I doubt that Murphy intended this movie to be so, but it is a stinging critique of our pitiless society as well as a very funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why so many people don't like this movie, i mean come on Eddie Murphy gives the performances of his career. Sherman Klump is a overweight College professor trying to find a way to move the cells in your body around to make yourself skinny. I'n a last second effort to prove his formula works, and to impress Ms Perdy, Sherman tries the formula on himself and then transforms into a very scrawny Buddy Love. Buddy then reeks havoc on society and on Shermans own life. This is a wonderful movie full of some great characters, one of the best is played by Dave Chappele who plays a stand-up comedian named Reggie. ***/****. A great movie, no doubting that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie Murphy shines in his Many Roles,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nutty Professor is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's a very funny and enjoyable movie, mostly due to the comedic genius of Eddie Murphy, this film easily could have been a disaster without a good comedic lead to hold it together, and thankfully Murphy did with over seven roles, and he shines in every single one, it is pure movie magic to believe that he plays the majority of the main characters in this, and it also won itself a deserving Best Makeup Academy Award. For the most part I enjoy the humour in the movie, although there are certainly too many fart jokes to the degree that it gets a bit irritating and the scene between Murphy and Dave Chappelle was unnecessary, I also felt like Jason was a very underdeveloped character, I enjoyed John Ales portrayal of him but we never get to know very much about him, I would have liked to have gotten a clearer indication on the friendship between him and Klump. A redeeming aspect of this movie that you wouldn't normally see in these types of comedies is that there is a lot of heart, the love story between Klump and Carla is very sweet and this is the engine that really gets the film running, having something like this adds an extra layer to the character and makes him more relatable for the audience. Funny and well acted, I would recommend the Nutty Professor to anyone looking for a good comedy. An overweight professor takes a special chemical in order to look good for a woman he has fallen for, but it has some disastrous side effects. Best Performance: Eddie Murphy Worst Performance: Dave Chappelle</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since day one, Eddie Murphy has been a favorite of mine - he's a great comedian (probably the greatest ever); has a great presence; great talent; a lot of charisma; is great with the ladies; a great writer and storyteller; a great entertainer all-around; etc., etc., etc!This movie, like 'all' of his others, is GREAT! In fact, I've never seen an Eddie Murphy movie that I didn't like. Sure, this movie pokes fun at people who're fat; naive; elderly; uncouth; etc...but, so does everyone else in real-life!?!? However, it also pokes fun at cocky and arrogant people (Klump's boss; Reggie the comedian; etc.), so...if you can accept and laugh at one group, accept and laugh at them all!Despite all of this, Eddie Murphy has gone way above-and-beyond with his portrayal of multiple characters - is there anything that this guy can't do!?!? To me, a talented actor makes what they're doing believable. An 'extremely' talented actor does this, but, also adds touches such as different voices, accents, personae, and, so forth. Eddie Murphy does all of that here!Anyone who down-grades a movie, a song, a painting, etc. because they feel that it makes fun of them - 'improve yourself.' One way of improving yourself is to become comfortable with the way you are, and, learn to laugh at yourself. If you can't laugh at yourself, you have no right laughing at all...mostly, because you're the same kind of hypocrite who laughs at others in secrecy!I find this movie to be a great work by an extremely talented and funny comedian, and, I really like it! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very charming film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a performance reminiscent of Peter Sellers in `Dr. Strangeglove,' Eddie Murphy turns in a tour de farce in `The Nutty Professor.' This was a film I had intended to see for a decade and I was certainly not disappointed when I finally rented it.Murphy provides a charming performance as shy, gentlemanly fat man, Prof. Sherman Klump. One cannot help rooting for the 400-pound professor to woo foxy grad student Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett Smith), rather than egomaniacal alter ego Buddy Love. Larry Miller is also fun as the smiling but malevolent Dean Richmond ? a type role he has played several times before.Of course the special effects wowed audiences in 1991 and they are still quite impressive. I haven't seen the 1963 Jerry Lewis version ? and pray I never have to, but I doubt that it had the charm of this production. Pinkett Smith adds not only beauty, but a warm grace and dignity to an otherwise chaotic scene of runaway gerbils, wild night spots and bizarre potions. David Chappelle, meanwhile, is entertaining as obnoxious stand-up comic Reggie Warrington. And, of course, there are the Klumps. Murphy outdoes himself as Sherman's dysfunctional, farting family. While I have no real desire to see the 2000 sequel, which apparently focuses on the Klump family, they do add some fun to the film.Overall, I would call `The Nutty Professor' a solid comedy with plenty of laughs, lots of charm, and even a bit of a message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Nutty Professor takes an old idea and fills it with great energy. The comedy is all over the map. It is silly and gross but also touching. On top of this, is a great performance by Eddie Murphy who is able to create 7 characters. The pace of the film felt right. Murphy's professor begins as somewhat dull and a little depressed. This bit of seriousness and the university setting in a few minutes builds a solid story. Because of this, the script can bring in pretty wild comedy without seeming too overdone. The special effects and dream sequences help make the Jekyll and Hyde story more believable and interesting. But even better is the terrific makeup which is so good that we forget that half of the cast is being played by Eddie Murphy. What I liked the most was that I really began to care about the professor, especially when he is cruelly insulted by a nightclub comic. The Nutty Professor is not a masterpiece. Sometimes Murphy's Buddy Love gets too obnoxious and the gross humor gets a little stale. But the film had a tough hurdle to get over, trying to improve on a mediocre Jerry Lewis film. Considering this, I am amazed at how good this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do ya like that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After several years of worthless movies (namely "Boomerang" and "Vampire in Brooklyn"), Eddie Murphy made his comeback with "The Nutty Professor", a remake of the Jerry Lewis classic. He plays overweight Prof. Sherman Klump, who invents a potion that turns him into the cool but mean Buddy Love.Overall, it seems that the movie is a big excuse to be crazy. And that's just what they do. Looking back on it, they probably could have done without all the flatulence, but that dream sequence was still a hoot. My favorite scene was either the parts with Dave Chappelle, or the whole end sequence.Obviously, they changed a number of things from the original version. Actually, I must have been only eight when I saw the original version, so I'll have to see it again. But either way, this is a comedy classic. And it just goes to show that Eddie Murphy does best when he goes for straightforward clever comedy and doesn't degenerate into things like "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" or "Daddy Day Care". A modern classic. Also starring Jada Pinkett (before she added "Smith" to her name), James Coburn and Larry Miller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This remake is obesely funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the the original version of "The Nutty Professor" with Jerry Lewis. But the remake is just as funny, even though I can do without the language there. The music is fun, the plot is great, and the pun is outrageous. To me, I got a lot of fat friends, but I would never make fun of their weight. Professor Sherman Klump(Eddie Murphy) is bright, reserved, and kind to everyone around him. Buddy Love(also Murphy) is slim, buff, and very obnoxious. When Sherman meets Carla Purty(Jada Smith), he would go to the extremes to have her. After the incident in "The Scream" Sherman becomes Buddy. And at "The Scream" Buddy puts Reggie(Dave Chappelle) in his place with all the "Your Mama's so fat..." jokes. That scene left me in stitches. I enjoyed the characters in the movie, including that nasty Dean Richmond(Larry Miller, "Neccsary Roughness") who is put in his place many times by Buddy and Alumni Harlan Hartley(James Corburn). This movie is funny all the way, just don't use it as a weapon on the obese. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: The Nutty Professor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy did a great job in The Nutty Professor with his role as Professor Sherman Klump/Buddy Love and also playing the entire Klump family. While watching scenes from the family dinners it is obvious what a great job Murphy did in this film. Each of the family members has their own personality and quarks that make the otherwise pointless dinners very enjoyable and fun to watch. The special effects and make-up used in this film are also amazing and they portrayed very real looking qualities.Sherman Klump, a very bright professor who is also dealing with an obesity issue, finds himself falling for a colleague, Miss Carla Perdy. Klump is convinced that he doesn't have a chance with Carla because of his appearance. He believes that he needs to change himself in order to get Carla to appreciate him so he decides to try a formula, which he has been testing on hamsters, on himself. The formula is a DNA restructuring chemical and when it is ingested by Klump he drops 300 pounds immediately. This skinny, obnoxious and loud version of Professor Klump comes to be known as Buddy Love. Buddy is very critical of people, especially obese people, and he is determined to take over Klump's body and his life.This movies main objective is to show that you should be happy with yourself. The jokes in this film were also carefully thought through so they wouldn't offend most viewers, especially overweight viewers. I found this movie to be more enjoyable than the original, starring Jerry Lewis, which has very few similarities with this version. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a little comic relief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny and has a important message in it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nutty Professor is about a professor named Sherman Klump, who is massively obese and always want to get thinner but somehow doesn't (must be those candy bars). One day a grad student named Carla Perty comes into Sherman's life and asks her out on a date. While on the date a funny man (Dave Chapelle funniest guy ever) makes fun of Sherman's size. After being mad about this, Sherman takes a serum he made to lose weight, but put too much chemicals or something in it, making Buddy Love, the thin, handsome Sherman who he becomes for a short while. This movie is funny but also has a message in it, to be happy with yourself. The ending's special effects are impressive, and the acting by Eddie Murphy is top notch, with him being 8 people and all. The acting by Jada Pinkett Smith is good, and having Dave Chapelle being the comedian Reggie was a awesome choice by the director. Most movies today make fun of fat people, and saying they are lazy and stuff, and being thin is "normal". The ending was very touching with Sherman saying, "I will lose weight, but I am still going to be fat. You are just going to have to live with that." That touches me on many levels. So in the end, this is a great movie that you should watch if you consider yourself obese or if you want to feel how it must be to be fat.</fullReview>

I can't believe Eddie Murphy did all of those characters. That's kind of amazing if you ask me. My favorite part of the whole film was when Buddy Love was making fun of that comedian with his jokes and then beating him against the piano. There were a lot of scenes in the film that were funny. This was better than the second film and when the Klump family is sitting all together and the mother sais "Hercules!Hercules!" That part was so funny.

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies of the '90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must be one of the most funniest movies of the '90s, or of pretty much all time. Eddie Murphy is great as Professer Klump, and well everybody else in his family. He could possibly be at one of his best roles of all time and I enjoyed his hero and villain part. Jada Pinkett Smith was really good as Professor Klump's love interest and I enjoyed her a lot.Overall the whole movie has at least something hilarious about it and I loved it. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Funny Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a comedy like this to make anyone who has ever felt fat feel a little bit better about themself. Eddie Murphy is the one to watch as he stretches himself into five or six different characters and moons over the lovely Jada Pinkett. He looks hilarious with that "little devil grin" that his role Buddy Love is always flashing. Larry Miller is a perfect comedy foil and John Ales is a funny if nerdy sidekick. This movie is a lot funnier than its dated and worn predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely hysterical remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nutty Professor" is a remake of the 1963 film starring Jerry Lewis, in which Eddie Murphy plays 7 characters! The basic premise is the same as a man who doesn't quite fit in changes himself in order to get the girl of his dreams. In the 1963 version, it was a nerdy professor, in this remake, it's a fat professor. Dr. Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) is a kind-hearted chemistry professor who takes an interest in fellow professor Dr. Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett). After a humiliating date in which Sherman was literally the brunt of fat jokes, he develops a formula which turns him into the thin, but overly obnoxious Buddy Love. At first, Buddy seems very charming to Carla, but every time Sherman takes a swig of the potion and Buddy emerges, his testosterone levels rise and he rages out of control, making him into a maniac. Sherman has to get rid of Buddy before he loses control of him completely.This movie is hysterical. One word to describe it. There are so many funny moments in this film it's unreal. Two dinner scenes with the Klump family (played all by Eddie Murphy) were so funny I almost fell to the floor laughing and Buddy's confrontation with a comic (Dave Chapelle) was also a non-stop laughing point in the movie. I know this film makes fun of fat people pretty bad, but if you look past that, it's a film that tries to make a point, where people should accept themselves for who they are and not try to be anyone who they aren't. This film is slightly better than the sequel (which was also hysterical) and it took the 1963 version to new heights with outrageous special effects, but sticking to the same type of story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The overweight professor Klump is developing a chemical that accelerates weight loss. When he tests it on himself it unleashes a thin version of him one Buddy Love, but has dramatic personality changes. Both men are trying to woo the delightful Miss Purdy, but only one man can stay forever and the race is on for Buddy to get the chemical that will destroy Sherman and for Sherman to stop him.Yet another Eddie Murphy come back period in time! After Beverly Hills Cop 3, Metro and Vampire in Brooklyn Murphy needed a hit and this broad comedy gave it to him. The plot is a loose remake of a Jerry Lewis film and takes plenty of basic jokes but manages to make them funny for the most part. None of it is subtle but it is mostly very funny.The weaknesses are of course that it is coarse and crude for the most part. Buddy Love himself isn't a good character as he is a total playa and you can't see why Professor Purdy would be attracted to him (save the one night club scene). But Sherman himself is well developed and is actually quite a sympathetic character and not just the object for fat jokes.The main reason it all works is simply Murphy himself. His characters are all great and the family dinner scenes are very funny if a bit crude and dirty. Outside of these family scenes the comedy feels like it is stepped down a gear but that's the heart of the film for me. Pinkett-Smith is really good and is sexy and sassy without overdoing the whole ethnic thing (talk to the hand etc). Support from Coburn, Miller and Chappelle is all good but this is really Murphy's show and it is never better when he playing 4 or 5 characters at once.Overall this may rely on the most basic of jokes ? fart, fat, sight and sex gags but it is still funny. And lets not forget, if we put this next to the terrible part 2, this looks like the very definition of subtlety and restraint!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie Murphy delivers a hilarious performance as the hugely overweight Sherman Klump (as well as six or seven other equally amusing characters) in a faithful re-make of Jerry Lewis' 1963 comedy classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1963 Jerry Lewis wrote and starred in the original Nutty Professor, as a hopelessly geeky chemistry professor who invents a serum that transforms him into the smooth and inexplicably charismatic Buddy Love. Eddie Murphy has adopted this idea and starred as a tremendously obese but extremely intelligent professor who invents a serum that does the same thing.The make-up is a significant part of this film, since Murphy plays a total of seven different characters (only one of which he plays looking at all like himself), and it is done spectacularly. The dinner scenes at the Klump household are some of the highlights of the film; Murphy plays the entire family wonderfully and hilariously. There is something to be said for the clever editing that gives the illusion that all of these members of the dysfunctional Klump family are all siting around the same table at the same time, even though the whole family (except for Ernie Klump Jr.) is played by the same man. Way to go Eddie.However, despite Murphy's delightful performance as the Klump family, his antics as the excessively confident and loudly obnoxious Buddy Love get very tiring very quick. In particular I recall the scenes where he finds the act of an offensive comedian to be the funniest thing he's ever heard. The whole scene where he winds up throwing the guy in the piano is just too childish to pay enough respect to the hilarious original (except for when Reggie, the comedian, took his hat off. THAT was funny). The re-make of The Nutty Professor is a well-made comedy. It is very faithful to the hilarious original, yet it also has a personality of its own. The film's message is exactly the same as the original, but the subtle (and some not so subtle) differences between the two make it worth the time to watch them both. The 1996 version took the advances of special effects and make-up and used them to add to the original story and make a bigger (but not necessarily funnier) film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy did a great job in The Nutty Professor with his role as Professor Sherman Klump/Buddy Love and also playing the entire Klump family. While watching scenes from the family dinners it is obvious what a great job Murphy did in this film. Each of the family members has their own personality and quarks that make the otherwise pointless dinners very enjoyable and fun to watch. The special effects and make-up used in this film are also amazing and they portrayed very real looking qualities."The Nutty Professor" is one heck of a nutty movie. It's especially dang funny when Professor Klump's family is on screen. They crack me the heck up. That's probably why there was a dang sequel to this, and it was called The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps. Anyway, I want to close out by saying I liked The Nutty Professor. This is another Eddie Murphy classic, and sits up there as 1 of his best, not the best but 1 of his best.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klump sweet character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) is an overweight professor at Wellman College. He's working on a weight lost formula that actually restructures DNA. Dean Richmond (Larry Miller) is not a fan of Klump who has lost him lots of donors. They need to get the last rich alumni Harlan Hartley (James Coburn). New teacher Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett Smith) is a Klump fan. When she accepts a date with him, he tries to lose weight. After getting embarrassed on the date, he decides to take his own formula which turns him into the smooth operator Buddy Love.This is not for anybody who gets offended by fat jokes. There is plenty of that plus loads of fart jokes. It's saved by a very appealing character in Sherman Klump. He's a nice guy. The romance is sweet with Jada playing a sweet girl. It's actually very sad when the comic picks on him. I like the guy but the fat jokes aren't funny to me. This is a nice take on Jekyll &amp; Hyde.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Nutty Professor (1996): Dir: Tom Shadyac / Cast: Eddie Murphy, Jada Pinkett, Charles Coburn, Larry Miller, Dave Chappelle: Inventive remake about brilliant ideas and absurd logic. Eddie Murphy stars as professor Sherman Klump who is insecure about his weight. He is surprised when a beautiful intern agrees to a date but after a humiliating experience he tests a potion on himself. This causes him to slim down into the egotistical Buddy Love. Eventually Buddy tries to take over completely even when Sherman wishes to restore his dignity. Grand idea with exquisite makeup by Rick Baker, and a grand-slam climax. There is vulgar jokes involving weight but the emotional core regards how Sherman feels about himself. Directed by Tom Shadyac as a much bigger improvement over the idiotic Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Murphy is brilliant in multiple roles. Sherman is far easier to accept than the dipstick Jerry Lewis portrayed in the comedy that inspired it. Jada Pinkett in fine form as the intern torn between both personalities. Unfortunately supporting roles are standard fare including Charles Coburn as a potential financial doner, and Larry Miller as the greedy dean who contains great comic lines but elevates no further. Dave Chappelle plays a vulgar stage comic whose insults backfire when Murphy takes stage and takes aim. Vulgar comedy with innovation and big laughs. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grossly overweight Prof. Sherman Klump, desperate to lose weight takes a special chemical that turns him into the slim but obnoxious Buddy Love. Sherman Klump is an incredibly fat and good-hearted man. He is a college professor on the verge of a breakthrough in DNA restructuring when he meets an admirer of his, named Carla, who is a teacher new to Klump's college. He is enamored of her, but is frustrated by his tremendous bulk. He then decides to test a formula on which he's been working on himself. He is then transformed into the lecherous swinger, Buddy Love, and romantic complications ensue. Roger Ebert wrote "Eddie Murphy's talent for comedy has been in eclipse during these lean recent years of flops such as "A Vampire In Brooklyn." But in "The Nutty Professor" he's back with exuberance and energy, in a movie that's like a thumb to the nose for everyone who said he'd lost it. He's very good. And the movie succeeds in two different ways: It's sweet and good-hearted, and then again it's raucous slapstick and bathroom humor. I liked both parts." It is quite an entertaining and funny film and that is the sign of a good comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is SOOOOOOO Eddie Murphy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typical Eddie movie. Typical in that he plays seven characters, six of them appearing in the same scene. Basically he plays his main character, the Professor, Buddy Love (the only character without heaps of makeup), his mother, father, brother, and grandmother. The skill at which this is done is shown in the two scenes when they are all sitting around a table arguing. I doubt this is because Murphy is cheap but rather because he wants to do it. The other thing that is impressive is the skill that goes into the makeup to disguise Murphy.The Nutty Professor is about a professor, Sherman Klumpp, who is incredibly fat. He is very conscious about his size, and after being torn to shreds by a comedian when he is out on a date with an attractive colleague, he decides to imbue a formula that he has been developing. Sure enough he turns into a handsome, slender, man who calls himself Buddy Love.Basically this movie has a number of themes and is based upon Dr Jeckal and Mr Hyde. I have not had the pleasure of reading the book, so I do not know the themes of the original (I think it has something to do with the beast that is within man), but here the roles are reversed. The beast is Buddy Love while the Dr is Sherman Klumpp. Klumpp may not be attractive, but he is a nice, kind hearted man while Buddy Love is a sexual tyrant who couldn't care less about anybody else. In fact, the more he becomes Buddy Love, the worse he gets.I guess the theme is be content with yourself. Even though Klumpp is hideously fat and his family are incredibly filthy, Dr Purty, the woman that Klumpp likes, thinks that he is okay. She not only went out on a date with him, but also tolerated his family. Another theme is that good looks doesn't always mean a good heart. Buddy Love is a womaniser who couldn't care less about what others think. He may be a fast talker, but that does not work on those who have come close to him, like Miss Purty.This is an Eddie Murphy film, and as such I like it a lot. It is a movie that one can watch while turning off ones' brain. Okay, there is a Jeckle and Hyde theme running through, but it isn't as serious as other rumours that I have seen. This is simply fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the enduring comedy classics of its decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) is one of the mainstream classics of the 1990s. It's a great comedy with an emotional center, focusing on a lonely, overweight college professor who falls in love with a beautiful grad student and takes an experimental formula to lose weight and become the kind of man the young lady would want. It's a twist on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, with the formula bringing out a new personality in the scientist.Not that many viewers will care, but this update is a pretty faithful adaptation of Jerry Lewis's original 1963 film of the same name, in spirit at least. I've seen Lewis's film only once, but enjoyed it very much. In Lewis's version, the professor is almost grotesquely awkward and nerdy before being transformed into the suave hipster Buddy Love. This remake adds the weight loss angle, although the formula still makes Buddy Love a confident, smooth-talking ladies' man. The coolest guy in the room.Everyone knows that Eddie Murphy is inside the Sherman Klump fatsuit, although the makeup and Murphy's Sherman persona are very effective. Most people also know that Murphy plays the other members of the overweight Klump family as well, Sherman's mother, father, grandmother, and brother. Again the makeup jobs are great and Murphy brings each character to life. The famous dinner table scenes are comedic tours de force. What many people may not know is that Eddie Murphy also plays the white Richard Simmons-like fitness guru Lance Perkins. I know some people assumed it really was Richard Simmons, but it's Eddie Murphy again in heavy makeup. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR showcases Murphy's great talent for playing different characters.Jada Pinkett, best known today as the wife/mother in the Will Smith entertainment clan, plays the fetching young colleague who admires Professor Klump's work and steals his heart. Klump sets her up with his slimmed-down alter ego Buddy Love, though it becomes clear that Buddy is a self-centered monster who lacks the sensitivity and kindness that the girl admires in the professor. Meanwhile Buddy plots to destroy Sherman once and for all and take over his body on a more permanent basis.Larry Miller plays the villainous college dean, James Coburn plays a millionaire interested in contributing to the school, and a young Dave Chappelle plays an obnoxious stand-up comic.The movie has a mainstream comedy feel, with some hammy performances and a rather low-brow sense of humor. (The Klump family relies rather heavily on fart jokes.) The film is dated by its mid-'90s fashions and music scene and the digital visual effects are noticeably phony (though still effective). But the 1960s version is hopelessly dated as a product of another era, too. Movies can't help it sometimes.THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is a top of the line comedy with some great work by the chameleonic Eddie Murphy. The movie succeeds because it's a comedy with a heart. We sympathize with Sherman Klump. He's shy, self-conscious about his appearance, embarrassed by his outspoken family. The film has a "be yourself" message. This Jekyll &amp; Hyde fable is a great concept, first realized by comedy legend Jerry Lewis and later updated for a whole new audience. I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sherman Klump, is a brilliant and a very fat man. One day he meets a beautiful and charming woman named Carla Purty, and he falls in love with her. He is aware to the fact, though, that he is a clumsy fat guy, while she is a young gorgeous lady. This makes him feel depressed, but he finds the solution for his problem. He decides to drink a potion which he invented himself in his lab. The potion makes him everything he wanted to be. The new him, Buddy Love, is the perfect solution for Klump, in his opinion. But is that what Carla really wants........Yes the film has plenty of fart jokes, and has been lambasted by. Any for being to in the toilets regarding the humour, but look deeper, and you have one of the most heartwarming comedies of the nineties, and a hilarious movie to boot.The scene in the club where Chapelle is heckling Klump, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, or really any comedy come to think of it, and this is down to the talent that Murphy has, yes he has made a few bombs the last few years, but this really shows his comic genius and great acting skills.The family scenes are brilliant and so funny, you really believe that all those characters are sitting round that table and interacting.Buddy Love surprisingly lets the film down. He starts off okay, but by the end he's just a pantomime villain who really really overacts.So all in all, it was a great return to form for Murphy, and like I've already said, proves that he is a really talented actor and comedian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murphy and Baker Really Bring it Home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nutty Professor (1996)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Hilarious remake of the Jerry Lewis film about the overweight Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) who comes up with a chemical that will turn anyone skinny overnight. Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes. Still, there's no question that this here is Murphy at his greatest and the Sherman character is just so great that you can't help but be won over by the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No (Fat) Joke, Sherman Klump is a Scholar and a Gentleman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior. In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme. If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in "The Nutty Professor" (hereafter "Nutty") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed.Actually, Sherman in "Nutty" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision.Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in "real life", without the padding).Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy.However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman.Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.</fullReview>

I wondered if it was partly hormones that led to this extreme reaction as I watched this movie again 14 years later with that son who had only heard it from the uterus."The Nutty Professor" remains quite entertaining. Buddy Love is still outrageously hilarious at times and the Sherman Klump humor can be lots of fun. I knew I'd mellowed out somewhat when I found all the fart jokes a bit tiresome and found myself genuinely moved by Sherman's message of self-acceptance.My now-14-year-old son couldn't get enough of all the manic craziness and begged to immediately watch the sequel on pay-per-view! So I'm letting him...This movie remains amazing for Eddie Murphy's multi-personage performance. (I also enjoyed seeing David Chapelle in an early incarnation.) This may not be for the ages, but it's a super-silly keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Professor Julius Kelp (played by Jerry Lewis) is a brilliant, if nerdy, chemistry professor at a small college. Tired of being mistreated by larger men and disregarded by beautiful women, he decides that he can use his knowledge of chemistry to improve himself. His experiment goes awry when an experimental formula turns this meek and mild dweeb into a bold, abusive and startlingly handsome lounge lizard--Buddy Love. When the formula shows an alarming tendency to destabilize at awkward moments, Kelp must try to keep his split personalities separate, as the object of his dreams, the delectable Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens), seems within his grasp. However, Miss Purdy's experience with the vain Buddy convinces her that he may not be her dream man after all, and that a better man might be a gentle chemistry professor! This is one of my favorite movies. Yes, there's no serious social commentary here, and the comedy is rather low, but what a ride! This movie is clean, and can be watched by the whole family (which I appreciate). The humor is quite quirky, which makes this movie fun to watch over and over again. This is another movie that I recommend for all families.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the last five to ten years, Eddie Murphy has gone rather down hill. He hasn't made an impressive comedy in a very long time. But Murphy certainly did deliver in the year 1996 as he acted out eight different characters thanks to the make-up, and the incredible comedic talent from the genius Eddie Murphy. This is certainly Eddie Murphy's best movie to date and I can't see him acting in another to beat this. For the movie, well it's a successful remake, with excellent humor, unforgettable characters and quotable dialog. A true comedy that makes nearly all viewers laugh into tears, whether its from Eddie Murphy's fine comedy acting of near eight characters, or just the simple quotes or scenes that make The Nutty Professor what it is, either way you look at it, it's epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Nutty Professor" is a very good motion picture comedy starring Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, and Eddie Murphy. Yep, the famed comedian plays six parts - seven if you count a slimmed-down version of one. The main character - a fat, brilliant, shy, decent genetics professor named Sherman Klump - is the most lovable figure in the whole piece. Sherman meets a very sweet young lady named Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett), a graduate student in chemistry, and the "chemistry" between Sherman and Carla is one of the absolute joys of this movie. BUT, believing that he would achieve greater social status by dropping a lot of weight, Sherman takes a swig of his new DNA-reconstruction formula and becomes the loudmouthed, brash, egocentric Buddy Love. And the plot thickens.....Here are my favorite scenes in "The Nutty Professor" (don't read any further if you haven't yet seen it). Sherman's father (Murphy again) unashamedly displays his excessive flatulence at the family dinner table. Standup comic Reggie Warrington (Dave Chappelle) bombards Sherman with a barrage of fat jokes; later on, Buddy Love strikes back! Sherman hilariously attempts to exercise. The pompous, butt-kissing Dean Richmond (Larry Miller) is in for a good joke when a hamster defecates in his coffee. As Sherman writes an equation on his chalkboard, his large girth serves as an eraser. A much more poignant moment occurs near the end at an alumni ball when Sherman tries to explain - and apologize for - Buddy's bizarre behavior, for which Sherman is of course responsible."The Nutty Professor" is an enjoyable film, both hilarious and touching at the same time. Prof. Sherman Klump ultimately learns a very valuable lesson: Whatever defects you may have, it is important that you love and accept yourself just as you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is "better" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it. Who has to be withdrawn is not george lucas but the last reviewer SAMPAT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, in my opinion, is an excellent, hilarious, and somewhat touching movie about being happy with yourself. If you ask me, Klump (Eddie Murphy) was a very brilliant scientist despite the fact that he sometimes let his alter ago get the best of him. However, when anyone teased him about his weight, I wanted to cry. This was especially true when he went out to dinner with Carla (Jada Pinkett). The reason for this is because Reggie (Dave Chappelle) and everybody in the club made fun of him. However, when Buddy (Eddie Murphy) took Carla to dinner, I felt really good. This was because of the fat jokes he and Reggie were throwing back and forth at each other. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everything about this film was spectacular, especially the performances. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent, hilarious, and somewhat touching movie about being happy with yourself to any Eddie Murphy fan who hasn't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, Sad, and Poignant Film at times!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy transforms himself with the help of the Oscar winning make-up team into an array of characters known as the Klump family, Buddy Love, and Dr. Sherman Klump, an overweight lonely professor. He becomes Buddy Love when Sherman develops a formula to thin him down but the formula does not last as long as he would like it too. It's not permanent. He becomes a full-fledged Buddy Love, the man who is thin and goes after the ladies unlike never before. The scenes with Dave Chappelle as the comedian who pokes fun and cruelty at the overweight Sherman is quite sad. Murphy delivers in his role and many roles on screen. As Dr. Sherman Klump, you like him the best because he is the kindest and sweeter than Buddy Love who only thinks about himself. As the Klump family, Murphy proves that there is nothing he can't or won't do to get a laugh at the audience. But enough with the fart jokes around the dining room table, the movie also includes James Coburn and Jada Pinket Smith as the woman of Sherman's desire who goes after Buddy but she does not realize he's the same person. It isn't the acting but the make-up that shows how Sherman to Buddy transformation can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie Murphy's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very long time ago, Eddie Murphy once dominated the box office with hits like 48 Hrs, Trading Places and especially Beverly Hills Cop. Quite a hat trick! All of these films were perfect vehicles for Murphy's talents. And whether in a starring or supporting role, he completely dominated each film through sheer enthusiasm alone.But every other film he made thereafter seemed beneath him somehow. They either weren't providing him with the proper material, or they were just pointless sequels merely rehashing past glories. By the time 1996 dawned, you were beginning to wonder if Eddie Murphy's talents were all but spent.But then he seemingly emerged out of nowhere with The Nutty Professor. A film that provided him with one of the best roles he'd played in years. I must admit when I first learnt of this film, it didn't exactly raise my spirits. Murphy starring in one of Hollywood's biannual remakes hardly seemed any different than the flat, unremarkable dross he'd been churning out for ten years solid.But its what this remake does with its idea that makes the film so entertaining. Not only does it finally allow Murphy to flex his muscles as a comedian, but its also clever, inventive and an absolute laugh riot.The original film starred Jerry Lewis as a socially inept scientist, who after drinking a wonder tonic, became a smooth, super-cool crooner. But the remake's redefinition on the same idea is positively inspired.Murphy plays an astonishing number of multiple roles here, but the main one, and the most sincere and heartfelt is Professor Sherman Klump, a grossly overweight scientist with a pure heart of gold. Very insecure about his weight, he gets all nervous and flustered around beautiful grad student Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett Smith).When he works up the courage to ask her out, they go to a night club where Sherman is insulted by a stand up comic. In a desperate bid to lose weight, he develops a weight loss tonic, and once he slims down, he becomes the wild, loud lunatic party animal Buddy Love!Buddy may be much more toned than Sherman, but he has none of Sherman's charm and warm personality. Buddy's wild and wacky adventures cause havoc in Sherman's life, leading to conflict between two disparate personalities in the one body. But once the genie's been let out of the bottle, its not so easy putting him back!After seeing the wasteland of Eddie Murphy's career from 1985 to 1995, watching The Nutty Professor is like experiencing pure, unadulterated delight. This is a really wonderful performance(s) from Murphy. All the more so because he's finally back on top form and moving at warp speed.In fact I think TNP may be that rare thing...a superior remake. And that's a very small niche indeed. Something reserved for films like 1986's The Fly and 2005's King Kong.It's completely reworked the plot of the original film (as all good remakes should do), and taken it in new and wonderful ways.Its a whole new spin on Jekyll &amp; Hyde. The overweight but kindhearted Sherman. And the ultra-slim but unhinged dynamo, Buddy.Through an astonishing makeup job by Rick Baker, Murphy so completely disappears into the character of Sherman. Even bulked up in a fat-suit and buried under 40 pounds of makeup, Murphy's natural dynamism continues to shine through.And he does a superb job of making Sherman a sympathetic character. That is what gives the film its conviction. Without it, TNP would be a gimmicky, one-joke affair that would run out of steam all too soon.But the film never does. And that's because of Murphy. He hasn't had this much fun in a role in years. But as entertaining as he is as Sherman, he is positively joyous as Buddy! Murphy lets out all the stops delivering a broad, anarchic, frantic performance. His motormouth going fifty to the dozen, from the moment Buddy shows up its one long line of highlights. And its full steam ahead! From Buddy doing stand up comedy of his own, to romancing Carla (and numerous others!), trying on tricks, fibs lies and deceptions like a whirlwind on acid, Buddy is mania on two legs!Murphy shows his astonishing ability for chameleon transformations too. Not only does he play Sherman, he plays the entire Klump family! All different too! Their dinnertable scenes, all bickering with each other are so funny you will literally bust your gut wide open!There's an interesting subtext at the heart of TNP. Sherman's conflict with Buddy seems almost true to life. Buddy represents the manic Murphy of yesteryear. And Sherman is the cuddly figure Murphy will become. And when Sherman eventually wins out, this is the path Murphy stays on. Makes the ending a little more poignant with foreknowledge of what's to come.Still, The Nutty Professor is a madcap masterpiece. With multiple Murphy's, no-holds barred material and laughs aplenty, its vintage Murphy at its very best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's better than it looks (less than 6 out of 10) and sounds (farting)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would rate it on the same level as the original 1963 motion picture. Both titles have their weak points but these weak points cannot put them lower than, say, 7 out of 10 mark.To start the analysis of this movie, it should be mentioned that "The Nutty Professor" of 1996 and "The Nutty Professor" of 1963 are very different, which makes them both enjoyable. The styles, the performances, the sets, the "crudeness" factor are various. In this one the idea of being fat is violently researched (the major difference from the old film) as well as the idea of being timid, obnoxious, self-important, and downright lean and mean.The low fart jokes and embarrassing topics are really not for the viewers with the Royal blood in their veins but to me they were very to the point and funny like hell. And these topics are so common among relatives when they gather (food, marriage, diets, health, etc.). All the actors did the right job and the leading actor did a number of good jobs.The scene with the atomic blow-up has stuck in my mind forever being so wickedly ridiculous. Another one is the notorious "dinner scene". Still another is the one where the professor goes with his girlfriend to "Scream" and gets offended from top to toe.This one is a groovy movie, like "Evil Dead II". Not for the squeamish ones, though the bad words and actions are never glorified here - they sound and look bad. This comedy also shows how the society changed (degraded?) from the 1960s to the 1990s. To me this flick is much superior (in "wit" and "laugh" factor) than, for instance, "Pulp Fiction" and "Kill Bill", which are hanging on the top list.The weak points of this flick are: the jokes sometimes get too far and too embarrassing in their crazy vocabulary and puns, the movie can be considered quite offensive by fat people ("politically incorrect"?), and something else that I fail to notice.To sum it all up, I cannot remember any other movie with Mr Eddie Murphy that I really enjoy. This comedy has brains and deep sarcasm pointed onto us, viewers. Every man has his beast inside and if that beast breaks out ... beware! I still like this one even after the third (or maybe sixth already) viewing - 8/10. Very re-watchable. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Energetic remake of a 1963 film, not subtle but effectively funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early days of his career Eddie Murphy demonstrated a certain level of anarchy that actually made him stand out from the crowd. He didn't take prisoners ? hilarious profanities came thick and fast, he subverted the whole issue of racial image brilliantly, and his on-screen energy was contagious. Somewhere along the line, Murphy seemed to get tamer and cleaner. Consequently he wasn't as funny as he used to be. The Nutty Professor marks a welcome return to the chaotic, vulgar, energetic side of Murphy. He still holds back a little (certainly in terms of bad language), but this is the first film since Harlem Nights in which he ignores political correctness and good taste, instead giving the audience the kind of devilish excesses they expect of him.Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) is an obese lecturer working at a college in America. The dean, Richmond (Larry Miller), thinks that Klump is a ridiculous buffoon and continually threatens to fire him if he doesn't buck up his ideas. But against his better judgement, he gives Klump one last chance to prove his worth. There is a possibility that the college might stand to receive a huge financial grant from a rich business-man called Harlan Hartley (James Coburn). However the successful receipt of the grant depends very much on whether Klump can dazzle Hartley by proving what innovative and ambitious work is being carried out in his science department. His most promising project involves a weight reduction serum that is being trialled on a hamster. Around this time, a beautiful new member of staff arrives at the college in the shape of Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett). She immediately takes a liking to Klump and asks him if he'd like to go out on a date. Sadly, the date goes horribly wrong when Klump falls foul of a stand-up comedian who taunts him mercilessly about his obesity. Thoroughly ashamed by the whole affair, Klump returns to the laboratory and in a fit of depression drinks his own weight reduction serum. It is at this point that he transforms into a super-thin, hyper-active ego-maniac who calls himself Buddy Love. To begin with, Buddy Love seems to be everything that Klump would love to be but isn't?. but as time goes by, Buddy's testosterone levels soar off the chart and he becomes an uncontrollable lunatic. In true Jekyll &amp; Hyde fashion, Klump finds himself having to fight against his own alter ego before he changes into him permanently! The Nutty Professor saw life before as a frantic Jerry Lewis comedy in 1963. In this remake, Murphy gives a poignant performance as Klump but saves his best for his scenes as Buddy Love. At these moments he becomes the much-missed Murphy of old, literally exploding with energy and brashness. There is a sentimental undertone to the film - about learning to live with and love yourself exactly as you are - but for the most part the film concentrates on Murphy's larger-than-life persona. The special effects are quite good, with some scenes in which Buddy/Klump transforms from lean love machine to obese professor before our very eyes. In an extraordinary climax Murphy's two characters actually fight against each other from inside the same body, his good half and bad half trying to beat and choke the life out of each other while a group of on-lookers watch in stunned bewilderment. There's nothing subtle about The Nutty Professor but, as broad, vulgar comedies go, it hits its goals quite effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph for Eddie Murphy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy hit a bullseye with THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, his affectionate and clever re-thinking of the classic 1966 Jerry Lewis comedy, in which Murphy plays no less than six different characters. Instead of being the buck-toothed, nearsighted nerd that Jerry Lewis created, Murphy chose to make Professor Sherman Klump an outsider from society simply by making him fat. Klump is a brilliant scientist whose personal life is pretty much non-existent, partially because of his weight and probably also due to the fact that his family probably scares off most potential girlfriends. Murphy also plays Sherman's mother, father, brother, and grandmother. There is one amazing scene, thanks to some remarkable editing, that takes place at the Klump dinner table, where Murphy is actually playing five of the six people at the table. It is not only masterful editing and camera-work but an astonishing testament to the genius that is Eddie Murphy, being able to create five distinct characters and have them realistically communicate with each other, but Eddie's strongest work in the film really is the character of Sherman...a warm and endearing character who evokes so much love and sympathy that there are moments where you will be close to shedding a tear for him. Despite the Academy's snobbery about comedy films, Eddie's work in this film is Oscar-calibre. Jada Pinkett Smith is lovely as his leading lady and Larry Miller garners big laughs as the dean of the university where Sherman works. The film did win an Oscar for Rick Baker's remarkable work in transforming Eddie into six different characters, and yes, that is also Eddie playing Richard Simmons on TV. A triumph to the genius of Eddie Murphy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is apparent that Eddie Murphy is first and foremost a multi-talented comedian than he is an actor. In '48 Hours' he came close to being a serious actor, but all of his subsequent movies were action films with comedy, or vice versa. In 'The Nutty Professor', he extends his base as a comedian with his latex make-up and costume development to look like someone he is not. Because he looks so ridiculous, it becomes farcical, making him successful at being a comedian and making people laugh. If he had continued in the trend of '48 Hours', maybe he could have been an early Denzel Washington or even a contemporary of Denzel, but because his career really kick started with 'Trading Places' and taking the baton from Richard Pryor, he has become engraved in concrete in Hollywood as the successor to Richard Pryor in feature film comedy. The other redeeming qualities of this film is the guest appearance of James Coburn (friend of the late Bruce Lee), as well as Jada Pinkett (wife of Will Smith).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The nutty professor is a terrific comedy. However, within my circles of friends, I found that many shrugged their shoulders and muttered "yeah... it was pretty good!" but few regarded it as "excellent." I don't compare comedy films to other genres. When I give this film a high rating, I do so because I believe that it compares very well with other comedy films, not because I regard it as a great along side Dances with Wolves, the Godfather and Shawshank! This film takes some rather silly turns at times, but overall, it keeps moving and the gags are "piss-funny" and the story has a touch of thoughtfulness and wholesomeness about it. The scenes at the family dinner table will go down in memory as two of the funniest ever captured on film. Also, I found that the film really struck a chord with those of us who have battled with the bulge before.But most importantly, I think it reminded Hollywood that they are capable of making good popular comedy without having to rely on same old cast (Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller) to pull through pathetic scripts and utterly stupid plots (eg... Dodgeball, Anger Management) or deliberately offensive, and usually 'out-of-context', inserts (eg, the terrible: "There's something about Mary"). I feel that Hollywood is wanting to be so politically correct these days that they usually resort to a neutral stupid story as a back drop to a couple of renowned 'comical' characters that are somehow supposed to fill in the gaps and make us laugh (case in point: that woeful "Analyse This"... and by the way, I didn't bother seeing the sequel). At least the Nutty Professor doesn't worry about poking fun at obese "minorities" and doesn't feel that it should stay clear of the odd fart joke! It was almost a return to old fashioned comedy and I greatly appreciated that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my fave films of all time. Undoubtly one of Eddie Murphy's best films. The film starts with a Huge, Fat Obese but kind and intelligent Man - Sherman Klump falling for the pretty Carla Purty (Jada-Pinkett Smith).He thinks that with him being fat, and after his failure with exercising, that the only way to win Ms Purty's heart is to lose weight quickly, he tries out his 'special formula' and becomes Buddy Love.Or in fact becomes Eddie Murphy, as this is the only character he plays without make-up and body suit.The film is very very funny, and my fave. scene is the dinner scene where Sherman has borough home a girl for the first time, and his family are very embarrassing, and take no consideration that he's abit shy. His father Cletus, Ernie and Grannie Klump are all very open and explicit, literally. They speak very openly about 'realtions' 'colon cleaning' and to say the least turn the table into a bio-chemical mess with infrequent gas attacks.The way Murphy morphs himself into these 6 characters (inc. mama klump) is quite staggering and(unlike the second film which was funny but could have been better) the film has good flow and the story is funny.I first saw this film when i was 8, and can remember how much my sides hurt from laughing, even now though i've seen it countless occasions (it's always on ITV2.....LOL) i still am in hysterics.I highly recommend this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Special effects have come a long way since 1963, but they are needlessly overused in the 1996 version of The Nutty Professor. Eddie Murphy changes size and appearance so drastically and so often that we could call him Eddie Morphy. He is terrific playing any number of characters, but all the technical fireworks eventually grow distracting and get in his way.Sherman Klump is a shy 400-pound university prof, an expert in body chemistry. He has developed a magic weight loss formula in the lab and decides to become his own human guinea pig. Zap! Fat Sherman is transformed into the trim, foul-mouthed womanizer Buddy Love. Now his dreams can come true, right? Well, not quite. Pretty Carla Purty, the object of his affection, isn't exactly in love with Love. There are some genuine belly laughs here as Sherman blows up and down, though one fart joke goes a long way. Twenty fart jokes seem to go on forever. Murphy creates a wonderful character in Sherman, and we feel his pain and embarrassment. This emotional involvement gives The Nutty Professor unexpected depth and shows what Murphy can do when given the opportunity.</fullReview>

This comedy works for another reason: for once Eddie M. is cast perfectly: he plays multiple roles. As himself--brash, arrogant, motor mouth--I have always had a bit of trouble accepting him as anyone other than Eddie M. showing off. But in this picture his own persona--the above brash etc.--is put to good use and is "in character" as Buddy Love. The revelation is the various other characters he portrays, showing a range and acting ability rare in any actor at any level. Perhaps in this film we see the whole Eddie M. And as a whole, I liked him and it, the film. I went away thankful that I had was able to resolve my reservations (actually, dislike) of this actor. I thank the makers of the film for the opportunity. The stand-off scene between Buddy Love and the other stand-up comic (a wonderful characterization) was per se one of the best (and maybe only?) of its kind. A breathe of fresh air in a fartstorm. Six-plus grade from jaime. Why go to Beverly Hills when the good stuff is just down the street at the state college?</fullReview>

The make-up is excellent. But that's about the only positive thing about this film.The Buddy Love character is nothing but a pimp. There are no redeeming qualities about him and you wonder why any woman would be attracted to him. He might be a good looking guy, but surely a woman with any sense would see what a jerk he is within a minute and that would be that. At least any sensible audience member should be able to. In the original, Love was a jerk too, but the Dean Martin-esque charactristics were obvious and you wanted to see more of him. In this film, Buddy Love is annoying and unfunny and not cool.There are plenty of fart jokes and similar humor geared towards those who might find Buddy Love cool, but for the regular, movie loving public, this film is a no go. Murphy could be the Peter Sellers of our generation. Let's hope he gets some material someday that's worthy of his talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nutty Professor Is A Funny, Funny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was about to put the video of this movie in, I was thinking that this would be another one of those funny movies, but nothing more. I was wrong! This is probably the one of the best Eddie Murphy movies that I've ever seen. The acting is great, especially on Eddie Murphy's part. It's amazing that he plays the entire Klump family (except for the little boy)! I deeply recommend seeing this movie. If you love Eddie Murphy and can't get enough of him, this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Job Eddie Murphy. Very Impressive Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just completed my third viewing of The Nutty Professor with Eddie Murphy. Needless to say, the first two times I viewed this movie, I was somewhat impressed with Eddie Murphy playing a total of seven characters in one movie. After watching this movie a third time- this time alone- I've concluded that Eddie Murphy is not just an actor, but an excellent one. This time I watched him BECOME the characters; interpret the characters; live the characters. The voices, the behavior, the physical demeanor, the reactions and counter-reactions and the emotions were developed in each character as if each Klump, including Buddy Love and Lance Perkins were played by individual actors- not one single actor. I now have a true admiration for Eddie Murphy the actor that I've never had before. His characterization of Professor Klump was excellent. Watch his facial expressions in each scene. And, oddly enough, the one character that was a total turn off to me was Buddy Love. I realize now that Buddy Love's obnoxious behavior was intended to be repulsive. When you couple the characters portrayed by Eddie Murphy with the script and supporting actors- who all played admirably- you come away with a hit movie. I think this is a flattering remake of the Jerry Lewis original and I encourage you to view Lewis' version also. For those who are reading this review, if you watched this movie once and didn't like it, watch it again and put yourself in the shoes of Eddie Murphy the actor. It's similar to sliding a size eight into a size twenty shoe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but with one lovable character and one irritating character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Age: 13Professor Sherman Klump, played by Eddie Murphy, is an overweight teacher who falls in love with a new teacher at his school, Carla Purty, played by Jada Pinkett. He wants to lose weight fast and begins testing his DNA restructuring medicines (to lose weight) on himself. The new product: Buddy Love, played by Eddie Murphy. Unlike Sherman, Buddy has a sex life, and he goes out with Carla also. There is also someone on campus trying to make big money with Sherman's potion, but he is more impressed by Buddy, who he thinks is behind all the real work.The Nutty Professor is quite a funny film, with a lovable and good character in Professor Sherman Klump, but it also has a character who you like at first, but then there's too much of him, and his quick tauntings get annoying and irritating. That character is Buddy Love. However, this character does not stop The Nutty Professor from being a good film. I enjoyed the conversations at the Klump family's dinner table and the whole idea of the miracle potion. The romance in this film is also better than expected, and I loved how Eddie Murphy played almost his entire family. The make up and effects done to make Eddie Murphy into a fat, overweight man like Sherman are also very good. Overall, the only annoying thing in the film is Buddy Love.Australian Classification: M 15+: Sexual ReferencesRating: 66 out of 100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stupid 'Nutty Professor'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the obscenities and vulgarities not unexpected from a Eddie Murphy movie, this version of 'The Nutty Professor' insults its audience with a flurry of stupid jokes and cheap shots. I do not know why they even chose to do a re-make of the great Lewis movie of 1963. It is devoid of any sympathetic characters, clever writing, good acting, and human sentiment. Save your hard earned dollars and watch the 1963 version instead. It is sad that they had to make this trash to satisfy modern audiences. With the original version, Mr. Love's character was so suave and cool, and the professor character was a great counterbalance to his 'other side'. Here, Murphy's character has no redeeming qualities to evoke any sympathy from us; with so many potty scenes and dialogue throughout, no wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like seriously this movie was so ******* hilarious I laughed at the fart jokes,and Eddie Murphy playing 7 CHARACTERS(he was the granny,the fitness instructor,the professor,Buddy Love,his mother,his father,and his brother,thanks to some special make up effects by Rick Baker who also did Susan Sarandon's transformation for Enchanted).The story is about a shy modest professor named Sherman Klumps,a man who is so shy to ask a girl on a date just because he is rather obese and his family are rather obese too. So since his a professor and all,he works on a formula that can turn obese people or obese animals into slim form. But when he tries it on himself he becomes the incredibly loud- mouthed,charming,womanizer,douch-bag Buddy Love. But when the girl that he fancy's(played by Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett),he realizes that you have to accept who you are as a person no matter if your big or small.I know this film may offend people who are obese but for people who want a good laugh I recommend this film as I am a HUGE FAN of Eddie Murphy.Overall im giving it a 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The long and tortuous road leading to happiness is paved by self-acceptance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin.And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue.Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters.But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience.Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come.Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled.Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I ?myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own.The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've gotta love that smile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with 'Beverly Hills Cop', it was the 'Nutty Professor' that cemented that signature Eddie Murphy smile as iconic. It's infectious and more often than not, serves to draw you more towards his characters. Although the protagonist is the sweet and unassuming Professor Klump, good old Eddie Murphy truly struts his stuff with the cocky, hyperactive alter ego, Buddy Love, the self proclaimed star of the show. The humour did, at times, descend to a very kiddish level with a comically obese man falling over and pushing things over, but the more mature hilarity really ensues with the 'embarassing family scenes', all the members of whom are portrayed by Murphy, underlining his prowess as a terrific multi character comedian regardless of age, gender or size. The chemistry between Murphy and Jada Pinkett was far from sizzling but Pinkett fulfilled the basic criteria of the love interest which allowed more attention to be shifted towards Murphy's two personas.A nice story which won't leave you in bouts of laughter upon finishing, but will bring more than a few throughout as you enjoy Eddie Murphy in his prime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy has a reputation in Hollywood of being hard to work with and his track record since the late 90's hasn't been a good one. It makes it hard to remember just what a comedy genius this guy used to be, and The Nutty Professor is a prime example of that. Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny. No matter what you think of Eddie Murphy, it is impossible not to laugh during this movie. The Nutty Professor is two hours of fun, and on top of that, it's a refershing kind of comedy that we don't really see much of anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sherman you sure do look fabulous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral.Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it.Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was.The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Round again for career recovery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy makes something of a career recovery with the best comedy he has made in the 1990s or 2000's. Competition for that title isn't much however. The best Eddie Murphy comedies are from th e 1980's.The comedy is strong and that is in large part to the earlier Jerry Lewis comedy making filming easier as th update has the previous movie to refer and revise from. Instead of Jerry LEwis's socially awkward and buck toothed Professor here Eddie Murphy is a heavily overweight professor. His problem is handled well by Murphy despite some unpleasant tone in the jokes, a characteristic of Murphy's comedies like 'Norbitt' where he has had a larger part of writing the script. For one of the best stand up comedians of the 1980's its strange how when Murphy is involved with the script the tone takes on something cruel and often not funny.The story centres on Murphy's use of a drug to change his appearance from being overweight. Like the Jerry Lewis character once the transformation has occurred there are unexpected problems as the professor's new confidence brings a Jekyll and Hyde aspect to him.Not the best of Eddie Murphy's films but playing more than one character allows him to show some versatility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Nutty Professor isn't 100% perfect starting off a little too slow, and perhaps not as enjoyably daft as its predecessor. But is it really that bad to warrant such a measly rating? No, it isn't. I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, but the Nutty Professor is actually a good film that manages to be funny and touching. Tom Shadyac directs snappily and there is a very nicely written script, not something that is absolutely exceptional but impressive in what it sets out to do. The film even looks beautiful, with some nice cinematography and lovely scenery. And the performances? Well, I can go on all night about how brilliant Eddie Murphy was. He was not only funny, he brought some poignancy to his seven roles and did it to perfection. Jada Pinkett Smith is a suitably attractive romantic interest/teaching assistant too. And of course the make up and computer graphics are fantastic. Overall, well played and really enjoyable, it doesn't deserve the low rating. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not watched the Jerry Lewis original, or any of his other work, for that matter. However, you won't have a hard time convincing that it's superior to this. I suppose at least part of the blame is Shadyac's. Then again, he doesn't seem to misstep that often, and he has given us two of Jim Carrey's best films, including my long-time favorite, Liar Liar. Sadly, he also made the two Almighty flicks, and he directed *this*. If you have not caught this 90-minute long poorly played game of "hide the fat-suit without drawing attention to it", I envy you. Notable only for having a magical TV that changes channels all on its own whenever it aids the plot, this thing is simply not funny. Well, Murphy does garner a genuine laugh or two, but if you're looking for him doing his schtick, there are far greater movies of that. The comedy here is all stupid, obnoxious, offensive(for the sake of bothering censors), at times disgusting and always based on stereotypes. Payback proved that Coburn can be hilarious. So can Miller. Jada Pinkett-Smith is in this, too. And Dave Chappelle. Why waste all that talent? The plot strains credulity to the point where it snaps in half, picks itself up, leaves you with the words "call me when the fiction you're following is less ridiculous" and goes on vacation. For crying out loud, the "tension" and developments are of the quality that you find in those sit-coms that last a single season, if they don't get cancelled even sooner. The effects are OK. All of the characters are one-note clichs. There are sexual references in this. I recommend this solely to those among you that refuse to listen to the warnings. This could have been special. Why was it made, when The Mask had just come out, anyway? 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked most of this movie, but I also found that money for special effects and prosthetics actually harmed the film--though I am sure teens and other undemanding audience members liked exactly what I hated about the film. I'm talking about the long and disgusting and crude segments featuring the professor's family, the Klumps. While it was fascinating to watch Eddie Murphy play almost all these roles alone and carry on many different conversations, the writing seems to have been done with a 7th grader in mind, with it's constant fart jokes and old horny lady references. All this distracted from what could have been an interesting romance, as I felt for the professor and really wanted to see him get the girl. But, because cheap laughs and special effects were paramount in this film, it's just a time-passer and missed a chance at being a standout movie. Unfortunately, the studio in its wisdom thought the Klumps were great for marketing and gave them their own film--God help me if I ever see that!! If I do, it will only be at gun point!</fullReview>

But for the most part, this movie broke my heart because I used to be over weight and recently dropped all the pounds, so I felt for Sherman. But I felt that the movie really over did it on the fat jokes because I know some people that exercise and do whatever they can to loose weight and it's almost impossible. So I felt that in some ways this movie was cruel and unrealistic. But it had a very sweet side and it had it's occasional jokes that could get a little laugh. So, I'd recommend over all, but then again, if you are very touchy on weight jokes, you might want to skip.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nutty Professor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura 1, Liar Liar), this is a fantastic comedy and career boost for the leading man. Basically Professor Sherman Klump (Golden Globe nominated Eddie Murphy) at Wellman College is the good hearted, overweight man, who one day meets and falls in love with gorgeous grad student and professor Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett Smith). He knows though that his weight is a problem, and he is very depressed. He does try to lose weight with exercise, but soon he takes even bigger action by drinking the potion/formula he invented in his lab, that decreases size. He is now Buddy Love (the thin, handsome and loud-mouthed Murphy), and as this alter ego he asks Carla to go on a date, and she soon finds herself falling for him. But after a while, Buddy is turning more arrogant, and Sherman is having problems with his personal and work life, particularly with his boss Dean Richmond (Larry Miller) and assistant Jason (John Ales), Buddy's name is even put on the door to his lab after a presentation in a restaurant to Harlan Hartley (James Coburn). In the end, Buddy is got rid of though by Sherman, he learns that he should be himself, and he gets a (final) dance with Carla. Also starring Dave Chappelle as Reggie Warrington, Jamal Mixon as Ernie Jr. "Hercules" Klump and I Like to Play Games' Lisa Boyle as Sexy "Glutious-Aminimous" Girl. The best acting from Murphy is not just Sherman and Buddy though, he also plays four other Klump family members, Cletus 'Papa' Klump, Anna 'Mama' Klump, Ida Mae 'Granny' Klump and Ernie Klump, Sr, plus on the TV, exercise enthusiast Lance Perkins. It is ultimately a Jekyll and Hyde love story. With great outtakes in the credits. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects. Eddie Murphy was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, in the right sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many a times those who are not of the right weight will often being ostracised by the outside world? Since almost the beginning of time, those who are 'fat' are just no good and those who are under the 'thin' category are in.I can actually sort of sympathise for those who are being ostracised as I watched this movie yesterday afternoon on the television here. Professor Klump (Eddie Murphy) is one big plump guy but he is a very smart person too. Though he knows (or so he thinks) that Carla (Jada Pinkett Smith) may not accept him for who he is on the outside, he went on to invite a solution for fat people to become thin quickly.It was really a hilarious result of many proportions. Carla even misunderstood him along the way till this party she attended. Professor Klump explained why he has to do it but he realised that no matter how much he tries to slim down, he will always be of that size.Sometimes we all are aware that being fat is not good to the health, but at times, looking at someone at the inside for once...is maybe alright and okay.Overall, the movie is what I say in the title. Funny, in the right sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than two, that's for sure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy was okay, but for the most part it is nothing special. What made this one good though is that it wasn't advertised so much you knew all the best jokes before you even came to the theater as was the case for part two. The scenes with Sherman's family are also better, as they are not over done as they were in the second one. They were also a surprise, as you didn't expect them. The story has Sherman played by Eddie Murphy trying to devise a potion to make him thin. He succeeds and becomes of course Buddy Love. Buddy Love is a lot better in this movie as well, as he actually has a couple of funny scenes. All in all this movie has some real funny moments and is a better movie than its sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is just painful in every possible way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be very honest, i've only seen a few parts of this movie, but that was just enough, and I have 0 desire to watch the rest. This "Comedy" is just so unfunny and insulting to the intelligence! it consists of fart humour, and other unfunny garbage that people seem to find funny nowadays, which is just sad because there are many other comedy movies that are far funnier and superior but they seem to get overlooked nowadays. even sex lives of the potato men was more watchable compared to this. eddy murphy's career has already been ruined because he keeps starring in awful movies like this. overall, if you haven't seen this movie, avoid it, and pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're really that much of a masochist, or an idiot who laughs at unfunny fart humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Good Moments, But Still Falls Short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nutty Professor" was one of the big hits of 1996, but overall the film is only average in the end. Eddie Murphy stars as a brilliant but very overweight college professor who creates a formula to turn himself into Buddy Love. There are some very hilarious moments and the film has some good messages about society, but "The Nutty Professor" just tries to do too much sometimes and this keeps the whole project grounded. The makeup effects did win an Oscar. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Offending to fat people? Not at all. This sweet-overweighed-professor- vs.-the-nasty-filthy-"fatists" story is a good-hearted idea ruined by the thin (excuse the pun) script polluted not by fat-hating but disgusting scatological jokes. They are sometimes targeted against the scummy people who torment the endearing professor, but being witty and sharp and pulverizing your enemy is not the same thing than this kind of ... well, writing. MY advice to the fatists: Stop polluting the world with your filthy perversions. My advice to the screenwriters: Make better scripts! Now this movie is like a nasty fat-mocking person: with all the tactics of the toilet seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original was better, this is just sad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Jerry Lewis is listed as an Exec. Producer on this remake, don't be fooled, it isn't anything like the great classic 1963 movie by the same name, which still holds up today! This screenplay version is sad because the Nutty Professor in this version has a huge weight problem. Fat isn't funny, it is sad and it goes for a cheap laugh because of it. As if the professor is a non-person because of his excessive weight. With the premise flawed unlike the 1963 original, the rest of the move falls flat. Eddie Murphy is great in other films, but this one took a cruel and unfunny twist to it. See the original and pass on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my "worst-ever" films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened to watch this film by accident with a friend and both of us were soon deeply embarrassed to be sitting in the cinema with people who actually enjoy this. The humour is totally obnoxious and the values are somehow all wrong. I also saw the version with Jerry Lewis and I don't think the two films are alike in the way they use humour. If Jerry Lewis bears any resemblance to another living actor than maybe to Jim Carrey (for example in "Me, Myself and Irene") but never to Eddie Murphy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Two Murphy's: one talented and human in the larger, good sense; the other a ghetto humor mugger. The two war with each other. When the ghetto Murphy wins, we get minstrel humor and flatulence. When the human Murphy wins, we get real funny stuff. The kind of laugh that is on ourselves instead of some other folks.Eddie Murphy is a talented guy. This is a humorless project. End of story.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy is not funny anymore. And in this comedy-version of dr Jekyll and mr Hyde, Murphy plays almost every role in the film, thus effectively preventing someone else from rescuing this horrible movie.Is that a computer-animated waistline the fat guy has? If so, it's the least credible animation ever.Sucky, sucky, sucky...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fatism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Roseanne or Drew Carey or John Goodman or Louie Anderson or Oprah made a movie that portrayed African American's as Uncle Tom's, Aunt Jemima's, pimps or any other stereotype, there would be an uproar. Yet the last acceptable prejudice, "fatism" seems a fair target for a man who should know better. Obesity is a disease. A disease with no cure and no successful treatment. When the word diet pops in your mind, remember that only 5% of people that go on diets are able to keep the weight off. This number includes the "normal" people who need to lose only a few pounds. Most people gain back more weight than they have lost. Americans, the most diet conscious people on earth, have more fat people than "normal" people. Fat is the norm, yet it is fine to portray fat people as ugly, socially inept, clumsy objects of ridicule. During the last 50 years, we have identified many prejudices and have tried to right the wrongs of our society. Don't let the last and possibly the greatest (no pun intended) prejudice continue. Boycott this movie and all movies that ridicule others because of their physical appearance.</fullReview>
