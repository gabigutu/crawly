		<fullReview>On the Nutty Professor DVD extras, Jerry Lewis says that he had been "enthralled with Jekyll and Hyde" since he was a kid. So it's only logical that he'd long to create this "Jekyll and Hyde comedy/musical". Oddly, The Nutty Professor tends to be read as only a comedy, in the modern colloquial sense of that genre term, as "a film that's supposed to make you laugh", but there's much more to it than that, and more intended than that. Which is probably a good thing, because even though I didn't laugh out loud very frequently while watching The Nutty Professor, I did enjoy it quite a bit, despite the flaws.Lewis--who also directs--plays Professor Julius Kelp, a bizarrely nerdy-but-stupid chemistry professor. He has a knack for conducting dangerous, unauthorized experiments in the presence of students. At the beginning of the film, he blows up his classroom yet again. On a later day, a football student who was denied permission to leave class early for football practice responds by stuffing Kelp into a shelf. Beautiful student Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens) feels sorry for Kelp and helps him unstuff himself. Stevens skillfully has the slightest gleam in her eye while doing this so that we can tell that Purdy has an attraction to the strange-looking professor.Spurred on by the incident--with both the physical abuse and the physical attraction as motivators, Kelp decides to give himself a make over. He first tries his luck at the local gym. When that doesn't work out so well he puts his chemistry knowledge to use and hits upon a potion that produces a Jekyll &amp; Hyde transformation. The Nutty Professor has Kelp trying to balance the two personalities, with the expected calamitous but humorous results.Although Lewis' Hyde character, "Buddy Love", is often said to be a skewering of his early comedy partner and pal Dean Martin, Lewis claims this wasn't the case. Both the nerd and the debonair but sublimely obnoxious hipster were supposedly amalgamations of different people Lewis had encountered over the years. Still, the similarities to Martin are difficult to deny; perhaps the character was partially a subconscious parody of Martin.In any event, Love is entertaining to watch--he's something like a glossy trainwreck. Or maybe like a suave Satan in a silk suit. Lewis makes both characters complex in their differences from their respective stereotypes. Kelp is the stereotypical "absent-minded professor", only the absent-minded professor is usually a wiz at his academic subject. Lewis paints Kelp as primarily a wiz at being a slightly sympathetic dork, where his cockeyed chemistry successes are more accidental. Love is the stereotypical overbearing but attractive-to-the-women brute, yet Lewis is quick to imbue him with an odd combination of pathos and flair, so that Love ends up being both more fragile and more talented/intelligent.Some of the material employing both characters is quite funny, but Lewis dwells on humor no more than a whole gamut of modes and emotions, from fairly serious horror material during the slightly overlong initial Jekyll/Hyde transformation to poignantly sad, touching scenes showing the crack in the Love armor. To an extent, the Jekyll/Hyde theme permeates the film in its shifting tones.One of those modes that works surprisingly well is the musical material. Lewis hired the superb Les Brown and other great jazz musicians to provide songs. Les Brown's "Band of Renown" even makes an on screen appearance, performing a couple songs at a college dance. Lewis isn't the greatest singer, but he does a passable job with an alluring rendition of "That Old Black Magic". There's also a great version of "Stella by Starlight" in the background of a couple scenes.The performances are quite good. Both Stevens and Del Moore, as Dr. Hamius R. Warfield, the college dean, easily hold their own next to Lewis, who does a remarkable job with the transformations. He's helped a lot by W. Wallace Kelley's cinematography. Kelley had a more than respectable, varied background, including camera experience on a couple Alfred Hitchcock films--To Catch A Thief (1955) and Vertigo (1958)--and Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments (1956). Kelley uses very subtle angle changes to make Kelp seem small and insignificant (aided by Lewis' physical contortions) while making Love seem like a big, macho guy.The production design is also gorgeous. Lewis directs his crew to fill the film with bold, unusual color combinations--most overtly in the rainbow-colored paints on the lab floor during the first Jekyll/Hyde transformation, the nice overlaying of purples and reds in The Purple Pit club, and the great, unusual coordinations of Love's suits.Whether you find The Nutty Professor hilarious or not, it has certainly been influential. Lewis considers this his best film. The American Film Institute placed The Nutty Professor at number ninety-nine on its list of the "100 Funniest American Films" ("100 Years/100 Laughs"). Both Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey have obviously been influenced by this film, as they have been by Lewis in general. And Andy Kaufman's disparate characters Latka Gravas (from 1978-1983's "Taxi") and Tony Clifton (a regular part of his live act) are direct parallels to Kelp and Love, even if Kaufman had other influences for those characters, as well.The Nutty Professor is also a "message" film. The dual "morals" of the story, in addition to the less conspicuous subtexts dealing with personal identity, are to not be afraid to be your true self and to accept others for their true selves--to look deeper than the surface level.Given such wide-ranging moods and aims, it's probably best to watch the film without genre expectations. That's not likely to make those averse to Lewis' shtick enjoy it any more, but for everyone else, The Nutty Professor is worth a look. It will surprise you with its diversity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Satanic Glow of Buddy Love's Lounge Suits"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most depressing symptoms of the phenomenon of "dumbing down" is the drastically diminished time-frame of people's imagination and empathy, which function well enough microscopically and telescopically (at a range of, say, two or three hundred years, or the day before yesterday), but which cannot make the small leap back thirty or forty years. It is surely on such grounds that Jerry Lewis's masterpiece, "The Nutty Professor", might be dismissed as "dated" or be found "unfunny". Ever since I saw this movie as a child back in the late 60s it has haunted my imagination, and taken on a mythic existence that floats free of its actual content and context. On recently viewing it again on a borrowed videocassette I was startled by the internal organisation of the movie, by its pacing, and by the fact that Kelp's odious alter-ego, Buddy Love, who dominates the movie conceptually, is actually on screen for so little of its longish running-time. Since childhood I had cherished Buddy Love for his wit, glamour and self-assurance, which contrast so strongly (and therapeutically) with the painful gaucheness of Julius Kelp. Only now, as a mature adult, do I fully appreciate just how fundamentally unlikeable he is.It is interesting to note that his allure works better at a distance: idolised by the hipster habitues of the Purple Pit, he is viewed with deep suspicion by Stella Purdy, even as he fascinates and intrigues her. "The Nutty Professor" is as firmly located in its milieu (the United States of the early 60s) as "War And Peace" is in its (Tsarist Russia at the time of the Napoleonic Wars); therefore, talk of "datedness" is beside the point. As an exact picture of life in 2001 the film is hopeless, but as a myth or parable, with Kelp, Buddy Love, Stella, et al., as archetypes, its power is undiminished. Jerry Lewis has never been happy playing it straight, and Buddy Love is as extreme and grotesque in his way as the hapless Kelp. He is also by no means entirely free of Kelp's flaws; his clumsiness during the slow dance with Stella shows how aspects of Kelp's personality continue to permeate his, and point to the incompleteness and volatility of the metamorphosis. Even his name, opportunistically extemporised for Stella's benefit, contains a deep irony, since, in spite of his superficial popularity and supreme sexual confidence, he is essentially friendless and incapable of deep feeling. If kindly Kelp is crippled by involuted intelligence, the sybaritic, self-seeking Buddy Love is stunted by affectlessness. (I am puzzled by the IMDb reviewer who found him insufficiently monstrous.)Buddy Love's glittering lounge suits emit a satanic glow, and Jennifer, the caged mynah-bird, is a kind of familiar to Kelp, whose Faustian alchemy effects his painfully achieved and all-too-brief transformations into this eerie nightclub singer who generally only appears after nightfall (his one diurnal appearance being a spectacularly successful bid to persuade the otherwise pompous college Principal to sanction his headlining performance at the Senior Prom). In view of their acrimonious split it is tempting to view the Buddy Love persona as an acerbic commentary on Lewis's erstwhile partner Dean Martin, but the character also contains generous helpings of Frank Sinatra, and is perhaps best seen as a broad swipe at the Rat Pack. The wider message of the film is that kindness and intelligence (which Kelp already possesses) are far more important than the kind of shallow and flashy qualities that invest Buddy Love with his powerful but limited appeal (the rapid wearing-off of Kelp's formula, whose ingestion is attended by such agonising side-effects, shows that such a persona is literally unsustainable for any length of time).Kelp's final speech at the Prom, when his appearance as Buddy Love has been cut catastrophically short, is indeed "heart-wrenching", but as both a summing-up of the main themes of the movie and a token of Kelp's increased self-knowledge, it is indispensable. This brilliant and disturbing film uses comedy as a vehicle to explore serious questions about the nature of identity. The Kelp who wins Stella's love is a better-integrated personality than either his earlier self or the grotesque alter-ego of Buddy Love, but a note of mild cynicism (defusing any hint of sentimentality in Kelp's Prom speech) is sounded when Stella pockets two phials of the formula put on sale by Kelp's formerly timid father (to whom he had entrusted it). (He had also entrusted it, of course, to his domineering mother, but it is perhaps significant to observe that the formula presumably only works with men.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry Lewis in Hilarious Jeckyl/Hyde Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best of the Jerry Lewis (sans Martin) films. The Jekyll &amp; Hyde storyline is the perfect outlet for Jerry Lewis' "physical comedy" genius. I bet the "French" were inspired by this performance, when they named Jerry Lewis their comedy idol. As a clumsy, yet lovable chemistry professor, the title character could hardly be considered a "babe magnet". When he discovers a magic potion that turns the nerd into "Buddy Love", his luck with the ladies appears to change. In the end, he learns that appearance is less important than character. A young Stella Stevens is effective as the grad-student love interest.This original "Nutty Professor" is heartwarming and funny without offensive language and double-meaning visuals. It is far superior to its 1990s Eddie Murphy remake. Especially for a juvenile audience, Lewis beats Murphy by a mile!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best version there is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Jerry Lewis version of this movie is still the best one ever. Irregardless of the special effects employed in the Eddie Murphy version, or the novelty of him playing multiple characters at the same time, the original has something the copycat doesn't - Jerry Lewis, still one of the best comedians on the planet. Lewis doesn't need the power of special effects or multiple roles to fully convey the story here. How he transforms from a nerdy professor to a suave and sweet-talking singing/dancing/kissing Romeo is a sight to behold. He employs acting techiques which manage to convince us that these are 2 distinct people with distinct personalities and characters. No one can top Lewis in his prime, and this is one of better movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That Old Black Magic"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Further to my earlier review, I would wholeheartedly endorse the opinion of other reviewers that the original Lewis movie is superior - vastly superior - to the crass Eddie Murphy re-make. Lewis's subtle points about Buddy Love (whom, I am unsurprised to learn, he loathed) are utterly lost in the Murphy version. If Lewis's movie fails as popular entertainment, it is because it makes extraordinary intellectual demands on its audience, requiring them to see beyond the surface glamour of Buddy Love to the moral rottenness and egotism within. Strangely enough, however, Buddy Love is not without pathos. There is enough of Kelp in him, together with the shakiness of his chemically-induced persona, to lend a faint suggestion of vulnerability. Perhaps even this is part of his satanic charm (he literally charms the pants off the college Principal). It is no coincidence that his calling-card number is "That Old Black Magic"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Usual, Far Superior To The Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My one line summary just about say it all. The remake did well due to the advancement of special effects, stage make-up and prosthetics. This film did not have that luxury. Jerry Lewis is fabulous as the gawky, quirky Professor. Both his natural comic acting talents and his natural straight acting talents shine through. When seen one after the other (i.e the remake and then the original or vice-versa) you can do nothing but agree with me that the original is the far superior film of the two. Eddie Murphy does his best with the remake and the sequel but the remake just doesn't have the class that the original has. Now I know that there are going to be those that say the remake must be better because there was no sequel to the original but lets be honest now, in todays day and age and as things currently are in the film world's state of affairs, if a film is (in the executive's and the board of director's eyes)successful enough, a sequel is always churned out. Back in the sixties when the original was made this very rarely happened if it happened at all. Those same people will also say that the remake made more money but that's because there are FAR more cinemas around now and it's effectively cheaper to go now even with a semi-bankable actor like Eddie Murphy. (A bankable name, for those that don't know, is a name that guarantees the film being successful regardless of weather or not they can act. Will Smith has somehow become a bankable name and he has less ability to act than Pavarotti does to tap dance. The list of people like that is too big to put them all in and quite frankly I don't want to spend the time doing so. The same thing regarding the names that can act but an example of one that can is George Clooney.).At the time when the original was made Jerry Lewis was the biggest box office draw of them all; I don't think that has ever been able to be said of Eddie Murphy. It's because of this that when you take into account how much money was taken on the original due to how many were able to see it and how many went to see the remake you will realise that the original comparatively took more and was therefore a better, no, not better, far superior film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best thing Jerry ever did...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get this off my chest first: I am not a Jerry Lewis fan. I've always found his comedic antics tiresome and stupid, and his telethons for Muscular Dystrophy are nothing but daylong snooze fests. But, at one point in his career, he was able to bring it all together and create one of the great comedy films of all time, "The Nutty Professor". A comedic take on the familiar Jekyll and Hyde tale, it's the story of über-nerd Professor Julius Kelp (played by Lewis) and his search for love and a better self-image thru chemistry?which results in him changing into a creosote-haired, obnoxious, hard drinking, sexually voracious yet musically talented Rat Pack swinger named Buddy Love (also played by Lewis). While Professor Kelp loves his student Stella Purdy (played by Stella Stevens) from afar, Buddy has absolutely no problem sweeping her off her reluctant feet ? until, that is, Kelp's formula starts wearing off and Buddy's tenor singing voice suddenly starts squeaking like the Professor's nasal twang! It all comes to a head at the senior prom where all the kids want to swing to Buddy's music but the formula wears off and Buddy/Julius (in a touching and almost-profound moment) has to face the reality of what he's done and that you'd better love yourself because you're stuck with you for your whole life. But Lewis shows that he could also direct, and pretty well at that. From the opening shot of test tubes boiling away with candy-colored chemicals, this has to be one of the most colorful movies ever made ? just look at the deep purples of the lettermen sweaters or the entire décor of the Purple Pit or the violent primary splashes during the first transformation scene or Buddy's suits ? especially his suits! Lewis has always denied that Buddy Love was based on his old partner Dean Martin but it's pretty obvious that Dino and Frank Sinatra (the hard drinking, arrogant, and supremely confident King of the Rat Pack) are the prime models for Buddy Love. But it's also interesting to see how traits from one character show up unexpectedly in the other, like when Julius proclaims during class that hydrogen "is a total gas" or when Buddy sings "That Ole Black Magic" and his voice keeps slipping into Julius'. And there's all sorts of other touches, like Buddy's intro into the movie: after Julius drinks the formula, writhes all over a chemical-splattered floor and transforms into a hairy Beatlesesque gray monster, the next scene shows the shocked reactions of people on the street as the "monster" walks from the University to the Purple Pit where the camera pulls a 360° turn and we see?Buddy Love in full swinger regalia ordering a drink called an Alaskan Polar Bear Heater that's got to be the most lethal combo I've ever seen served anywhere! This is the movie that shows why the French think this guy was a comedy genius - his particular brand of physical comedy is not only timeless but also totally independent of language. When you see Julius bopping to Les Brown's band at the prom, it doesn't matter if you're sitting in a movie theater in San Francisco, Paris, Timbuktu, or Outer Slobodia, it's damn funny stuff even if you don't understand a word of what he's saying. A truly funny movie that's perfect for the whole family.</fullReview>

Jerry Lewis' comic masterpiece (which he also directed) adapts the Jekyll-Hyde story to tailor form-fitting to his loose frenetic talents and comes up with two memorable characters: feeble social outcast chemistry professor Dr. Julius Kelp all chipmunk-toothed geekiness and bad hair becomes lounge lizard, charming bully Buddy Love (some say he was inspired by Dean Martin, which Lewis steadfastedly denied).

Favorite scene is the flashback of The Professors early life. His mother rules his milqtoast dad with an iron hand and in the background can be seen a toddler in a playpen who looks a little goofy. The close up reveals Jerry in baby PJ's. Then there is the legendary Alaskan Polar Bear Heater!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry Lewis plays lively two different characters as a chemistry professor and an elegant playboy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amusing and spasmodic comedy with the genius comic Jerry Lewis by relinquishing creative control and concentrating on the humor more than the fright , skilfully combining the entertainment with the amusement . To improve his social life, a nerdish , mild-mannered professor (Jerry Lewis who wrote seven scripts for the film by himself and two with Bill Richmond) drinks a potion that temporarily turns him into the handsome , but obnoxious, Buddy Love , a wicked impersonation of his old pal (though Lewis has repeatedly denied is a Dean Martin parody , but the proof is quite strong) .Enjoyable film with characters genuine and sympathetic , it is plenty of humor , tongue-in-cheek , side-splitting sight gags and amusement . Jerry Lewis is top-notch playing a double role as the timid , meek professor turned into a dashing debonair , slim playboy type with an irresistible attraction . It was widely believed at the time that the Nutty Professor's sleazy alter ego, Buddy Love, was a satirical swipe at Jerry Lewis's longtime partner, Dean Martin . The picture results to be a parody and comic variation based on the classic novel ¨Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde¨ by Robert Louis Stevenson . According to one of the trailers for this film, Jerry Lewis urges you to see this picture from the beginning, on penalty of losing your popcorn privileges , this spoofs Alfred Hitchcock's dictum that Psycho had to be seen from the beginning and his insistence that no latecomers be seated . In the co-starring role stands out Stella Stevens , surely the most gorgeous girl any professor ever had . Furthermore , watch rapidly to Henry Gibson in his film debut , Richard Kiel , Celeste Yarnall , and William Smith . The motion picture was produced by , directed by , and starred by Jerry Lewis , at his best . Colorful and shimmer cinematography in Technicolor by Walter Kelley . Catching musical score by Walter Scharf , including various songs sung by Jerry Lewis and special intervention of Les Brown orchestra directed by Les Brown . It's remade in 1996 as ¨Nutty professor¨ by Tom Shadyac with Jada Pinkett Smith and Edddie Murphy who takes a swig of his own secret formula and is transformed into the suave buddy ; and its sequel (2000) by Peter Segal again with Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, cynical and yet life-affirming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nutty Professor" never fails to amuse and touch me, no matter how may times I watch it. Kelp is an enormously sympathetic character whom nobody seems to like, while Buddy is an egotistical monster who dazzles students and staff alike. Lewis makes the point that it is not only Kelp who is unable to accept himself, but society is overly impressed by the flashy, the handsome, the glib and the shallow. Kelp's path to self-awareness isn't just a personal wake-up call, but an implied social critique.Stella is the only protagonist apart from Kelp who processes on anything other than a superficial level. Her kindness to the professor hints at a deeper attraction, at least to the point where she acknowledges his attraction to her. Yet, the two bottles of formula in her jeans' pockets implies an incredibly cynical double-standard. Yes, she prefers Kelp's sincerity, his love, his kindheartedness, but she'd rather have Buddy Love in her bed. Edwina Kelp, similarly, has been tamed into girlish giggling submission by her newly confident and, one must assume, sexually dominant husband.A couple of reviewers have mentioned that they don't find the film terribly funny. Have you had a fun-ectomy, people? Kelp's first visit to Dr Warfield's office (the seat, the watch, the fish, "your greens"); the business with his glasses having no home at the gym ("Actually, I'd appreciate it.."); the flashback to his parents early married life; Buddy ordering a cocktail; Buddy hijacking Stella's test ("Write nice!")......it goes on and on and on. Best bit, though, is Kelp's solo dance at the prom. Gets me every time, and I watch this flick at least twice a year...it certainly is a toe-tapper. Well, zip and I'm gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Classic, but Lewis' Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that people can be divided into two groups: those that love Jerry Lewis movies, and those that hate them. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground.Having said that, I am a confirmed hater of Jerry Lewis films. I find them sophomoric and excruciatingly bad, and each one has the same basic plot: Jerry Lewis' character is introduced, then he proceeds to stumble through the rest of the movie.I'll make an exception for this film; it is the one winner out of all of Lewis' losers. The plot has been described in detail here, but it's basically the Jekyll-Hyde plot placed in a college circa 1963, where nerdy chemistry professor Jerry yearns for the love of one of his students (Stella Stevens). Lewis' transformation from Dr. Kelp to ultracool lounge lizard Buddy Love manages to be both campy and fascinating.Great cinematography and good acting, plus a warm message and the luscious Stella Stevens make for a fine movie experience. As far as I am concerned, you can throw away all of Lewis' other movies and keep this one...it's a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Lewis stars, directs, produces and co-writes (with Bill Richmond) this comedy take on Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.The Nutty Professor is a film I adored as a child, and truth be told most of Jerry Lewis' films made a humorous mark in my spotty youth, but not many can now be viewed in adulthood and still tickle the rib cage with the same mirthful impact. The Nutty Professor still does to me now what it first did many many years ago.Reading some of the reviews around the internet you can see some people going a bit deeper than is really necessary, yes there are some interesting things to delve into if you so wish, (beauty skin deep, the meek rising, be yourself, social acceptance issues etc etc) but ultimately it's a comedy spin on the Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr Hyde story with Jerry Lewis in sublime pratfall mode.Lewis' reading of the "good &amp; bad" side of one man is basically he expressing he himself, and he has great fun with both sides of the character. There's some very funny sequences along the way, reference Kelp's attempt at bulking up at the gym and jitterbugging at the dance, and all things build to the climax where common sense prevails as the heart strings get tugged and the smile lands firmly on the face. Joining Lewis in the froth broth as the love interest is Stella Stevens, who is not only socko sexy and gorgeous - splendidly attired in Edith Head's figure hugging costumes - she also proves to be great foil for both of Lewis' characterisations. Awash with Technicolor and comic vibrancy, The Nutty Professor is a classic case of comedic film making done with invention and a sheer willingness to entertain. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Professor Julius Kelp (Lewis) is a kooky chemistry professor. He's extremely awkward, socially inept and a complete weakling. However, and this is important, he's a very nice and likable guy. However, Kelp is tired of being pushed around and he's also very lonely. Perhaps he can use his knowledge of chemistry to make himself into the man he wishes he could be. Unfortunately, like the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, this new facade is a hit with the ladies and is sophisticated...but he's also a major jerk. What's to become of poor Dr. Kelp? And, who will the girl (Stella Stevens) love--the nerdy professor or the slick lady's man, Buddy Love (also Lewis)?I had a rare privilege because I got to see this film on a big screen at the Turner Classic Movies Film Festival. And, the audience was crammed full of die-hard Jerry Lewis fans who laughed uproariously throughout the screening. Plus, Lewis made an appearance and talked at length about the film, life and much more--and was marvelously animated and youthful for a man of 88!I would have to say that although I don't think I thought this film was the masterpiece many have proclaimed it to be (I do think Lewis made some better films), it is extremely enjoyable and a few of the gags were hilarious (particularly in the gymnasium). I also appreciate how the film has heart--a nice message and greater depth than the usual comedy. One of Lewis' best films, certainly, and one that has exceptionally good timing and subtlety--something you just don't see in a lot of his comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this the secret of Lewis' greatest film....?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Lewis himself always considered this his greatest film. He's right. It is. We will never know what he had in mind when he came with the idea -- looks like a stab at a "goofy" version of Jekyll/Hyde -- but whatever it was, it worked. Years later, Lewis would boast to interviewers that he not only had the pleasure of making this film a success at the time, but he made money a second time when he re-sold the rights to Eddie Murphy. (Who used said rights to make a film of considerably lesser merit. But HEY if Jerry had a payday, I'm happy for him.) Frankly it is hard to discuss the contribution of the rest of the cast because, of this there is no doubt, Jerry steals the entire picture. (In most of his other films, he "attempts" to steal the picture, but rarely succeeds. Here he nails it. Big difference.) Stella Stevens is memorable even in a fairly understated performance. And the parrot does a good job too -- playing a parrot. I believe the sub-themes spinning around the way the Stevens character immediately goes for the "bad boy" in Buddy Love do have implications for the culture of the day, but the film is oh so much more than that. It is about the difference between who you are, and who you want to be. It is a must-see, a one of a kind. And as promised here is what may be the secret to Lewis' pitch-perfect performance. In an interview given years later by Lewis' son, the interviewer was told that Jerry did such a great job on Buddy because Jerry "was" buddy in real life. No acting required. Food for thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>who is buddy love?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>over the decades there has been a huge amount of conjecture about just who the buddy love character is meant to be skewering. the conventional wisdom has been that it is either a scathing indictment of Jerry's former partner Dean Martin or else that it is meant to be a very unflattering commentary on Frank Sinatra. i think that there MAY be elements of truth in both of those analyses. after all, an artist (&amp; especially a writer) sketches characters from an amalgam of several people he or she has known or at least met, most of the time. but i think that this character is meant to be a "scathing indictment" on Lewis himself. he himself admitted as much in his autobiography. now, i'm not apt to blindly believe everything Lewis says or writes about himself, but i think this is a VERY plausible explanation. over the years, many of you may have noticed just how grating Lewis can be in his private/public life. like when he appears "as himself" on TV talk shows or gives interviews or quotes about himself to the press. one of these things that particularly comes to mind for me was a quote that was printed (&amp; reprinted &amp; reprinted &amp; reprinted) many years ago. he was asked why he thought so much of the American public seemed to dislike him &amp; his reply was something like, "because i'm a successful, internationally famous, multifaceted, multi-talented genius." i'm paraphrasing there because i don't have the EXACT quote on hand. but i sure remember it pretty well, as do a lot of other people. this quote, of course, only added a lot of fuel-to-the-fire for people who already disliked him a great deal. if Lewis can be believed about the buddy love character being based on the darker aspects of himself that he saw IN HIMSELF, then Lewis is not MERELY an ego-driven, megalomaniacal, narcissist (although a very talented one) but is also a real person sensitive enough to take a hard look at his own shortcomings as a human being &amp; is brave enough to put that all up there on the big screen for anyone to see. -bobby cormier</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry Lewis delivers a hilarious performance, but heartwrenching and sometimes even dull scenes take away from what is nonetheless a classic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nutty Professor may star a man who is often difficult to endure and who sometimes makes a little too much of an effort to be funny (efforts which often induce embarrassed and uncertain laughter), but the character that Jerry Lewis created in The Nutty Professor is something to be admired. His transformation from the geeky Professor Julius Kelp to the overly confident Buddy Love is perfectly acted. A particularly memorable scene (especially as far as directing and editing) was the scene when Buddy Love transforms back into Professor Kelp toward the end of the film. Very well done and very entertaining.However, the comedic intensity of the film is diluted by the almost painfully heartwrenching speech given by Professor Kelp at the end of the film, as well as a crudely delivered message. I've never been too fond of films that slap their message (or significant parts of the plot, as with the latest Bond film, The World Is Not Enough) awkwardly in the dialogue. It gives the feeling that the makers of the film didn't have enough confidence in the clarity of the story, or they simply wanted to take the easy way out. My point is that I don't think that the speech at the end was necessary in its present form, if even at all. The audience should be left to at least derive some part of the film's message on their own. As a whole, The Nutty Professor is a very good film. It is entertaining, and at some points, hilarious. There have been countless imitations of this film, including a couple of respectable remakes with Eddie Murphy, and even a character on The Simpsons (Professor John Frink) that is based on Lewis' character in this film. There are a few slow parts that seem to drag on and become boring that take away from the sheer hilarity of the movie, but it is still a timeless comedy that could be enjoyed by virtually everyone.</fullReview>

The supporting cast which features some of Jerry's regulars(Del Moore, Kathleen Freeman, and Buddy lester) add to this delightful, zany, and comical remake of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. The wide-eyed, sweet, innocent Stella Stevens as Stella Purdie and the haunting background music of Stella by Starlight makes this an outstanding film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant. And not Dean Martin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Buddy Love is clearly a parody of Sinatra, "the Leader", the "swinger of swingers" - and perhaps a personal comment at the time on those whom Lewis' once-beloved partner now kept company with.When I saw this movie as a child (when it first came out) I just thought it was rather silly. Now as an adult, I think it's more brilliant every time I see it. There is nothing on screen that I know of that's like Lewis' portrayal here. I've begun to agree with the French. It's genius - and this film is adult entertainment. We're tremendously lucky for the creative, brilliant energy that was put into a "kid's film."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry Lewis's Most Successful Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help it. I find many parts of this movie hilarious. I know, I know. I keep telling myself, "Self, this is JERRY LEWIS -- and you're not French," but it does no good. It's a funny movie.The first half is especially good. Lewis, who co-wrote the movie and directed it, is Professor Julius Kelp, a chemist who is a hopeless nerd with buck teeth, a squeaky, nasal voice, and a straggly Beatles haircut avant la lettre. Lewis has a crush on one of his students. Understandably. This is Stella Stevens at her succulent best. He's much too shy to express his feelings towards her, and she in return is kindly, but that's all. Stalemate.Then Lewis concocts a potion in the manner of Dr. Jeykll and finds himself turned into Mr. Hyde, a new persona that takes the form of "Buddy Love." The love character is identifiably Professor Kelp if you know the story. Otherwise Love is a strangely magnetic, narcissistic playboy. "Hey, Sweetie, take off and get your lips pressed," he tells the lounge singer at the Purple Pit, a local student hangout, before he wows the crowd by playing and singing a jazzy version of "That Old Black Magic." (For the cognoscenti, that's Shelly Manne on drums and Red Mitchell on bass.) He singles out Stevens for his attentions and she's attracted to his self-confidence and talent but repelled by his love of self. "You deserve nothing but the best, baby, and I'm the best." The entire business leaves her confused.Lewis switches effectively back and forth a few times until the switches take on a life of their own, as in Stevenson's original story, and finally he loses Buddy Love altogether and turns into Professor Kelp while trying to perform at the Student Prom. His apology to the students and faculty could have come straight out of Dr. Phil or some Televangelist. "If you don't like yourself, how can you expect anyone else to like you? That's what I learned." No sense going on too long about the film but it's worth a brief comparison to Eddy Murphy's remake. Lewis's film is the more difficult of the two to pull off. For one thing, in 1963 the technology was limited. There were no effective fat suits and no CGIs. For another, Lewis's Professor Kelp's deficits are harder to define. He's shy, nervous, homely, and an egghead. His scenes at the gym, trying to build his muscles, are outrageous. Murphy's film, by contrast, is equally funny but easier to build gags around. Murphy's Kelp is statistically deviant chiefly because he's terribly fat. And it's easier to make fun of, and build gags around, people who are obese. Murphy's film suffers from gigantism and Lewis's seems constrained by comparison. That's not in any way to criticize Murphy's acting. He makes the character touching in a way that Lewis doesn't. But Murphy invites a dislike of Kelp, willy nilly. Nobody wants a fat person for a seat mate on the plane. And while the comedy in both movies is very broad indeed, Murphy's is REALLY broad! I never thought I'd find myself saying that a Jerry Lewis movie was tasteful, but next to Murphy's it is precisely that.In any case, this is enjoyable and the whole family will probably find it amusing. I mean, it's not challenging in any way, not thought provoking. But it is a successful comedy and should be applauded for being funny without hitting the audience over the head with a loud and raunchy crowbar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Not the Movie, Jerry's Kelp is a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen most of Jerry Lewis's movies (with and without Dean Martin) and this one is the best one for me.The picture is funny (some sort of comic Jekill and Hyde plot) with many hilarious moments (the gymnasium sequence, his first meeting with the school's Director and the second one as Buddy Love too, Jerry as a baby). But what I think is a real creation is Julius Kelp character, both psychically and mentally. The point is that the man is a complete jerk but at the same time he's a genius in his field.As Professr Kelp Jerry Lewis is funny just to look at him and as Buddy Love some dialogues are excellent (the guy is madly in love with himself). The supporting cast is most adequate specially Del Moore as Buddy Love's main victim. A most entertaining and funny movie - with a "message" included-clearly superior to Eddie Murphy's recent remake (even with its technology handicap). Once more the original is better than the copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Living Through Chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Nutty Professor Jerry Lewis created one of his most endearing characters and the only one that another comic also adopted. Eddie Murphy who changed the last name from Kelp to Klump did not do an imitation of Lewis. He created his own milquetoast professor who starts experimenting with life altering potions. In fact Murphy created a whole family of characters for his two films. Jerry did not have the computer graphics available to Murphy, but his Julius Kelp who morphs into Buddy Love does quite all right with just Paramount's makeup wizardry and his own talent. When you think about it Jerry has joined some pretty distinguished company with John Barrymore, Fredric March, Spencer Tracy, and Boris Karloff all who played Dr. Jekyll on the big screen.Those guys weren't playing it for laughs though, Lewis did see the possibilities of humor in this deadly serious story. He also mined a lot of pathos from both Julius Kelp and Buddy Love.It's a simple story, Jerry is the world's ultimate nerd in Professor Julius Kelp who gets bullied by all. After a bad session with the college football players he decides that Dupont had the right idea, better living through chemistry. He does his Jekyll thing and from the ultimate nerd, Lewis becomes a candidate for lounge lizard of the century, a man auditioning for admittance to Sinatra's rat pack.One thing I have to say, that college seem to be caught in time warp. In 1963 kids were no longer listening to Les Brown and his Band of Renown. Yet that is their musical entertainment for the spring prom. Personally I think it would have registered better if say The Beach Boys would have been the entertainment, far more contemporary for 1963. But that would not have allowed Jerry a little chance to spoof the Rat Pack and his old partner Dean Martin.Jerry's Professor Kelp is someone you really care about and that's the secret of The Nutty Professor's enduring popularity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who'd a thunk it, that Jerry Lewis had such depth as to hide away inside this film insidious innuendos aimed at his former partner and friends? On watching this film for the umpteenth time, this time with my children, it suddenly struck me that perhaps Jerry is really being ultra slick and slyly ribbing Deano. In the middle of the movie, when as Buddy Love he is visiting the dean of the school, mention is made of some obscure duo whom the dean notes he didn't know they were still together (i.e.Martin and Lewis)and in explaining the significance of this to my kids, it clicked! Lewis, in his portrayal of Buddy Love as the consumate hipster, is taking broad swipes at the hep cats Martin now hung with, seemingly more so at Sinatra's crooning and thuggery, and the lewd and bawdy lifestyle. It seems to me that Lewis is illustrating the absurdity of it all and that virtue was really his in the end. I could go on and on, but will only if further urged.</fullReview>

I have to admit, there were times I found myself disliking Buddy Love because he was so arrogant with Ms. Purdy. For someone watching the movie to dislike a character, the actor must be doing an excellent job getting his part across to the viewer. I was really impressed when Buddy Love sang "That Old Black Magic" at the piano. Jerry Lewis is a very good singer. If you haven't watched this movie, I would recommend it. Thanks!</fullReview>

It was the first time that Lewis allowed this side of himself to be seen. And, the way he dances in and out of it is sheer genius.Maybe Stella Stevens was a bit 'lame' - she was never a great actress, anyway.

		<fullReview>Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde" is a big drama that I always love. For "The Nutty Proffesor", this movie really spoofs the classic novel without the senselessness. Dr. Kelp(Jerry Lewis) is a bungling chemistry professor at a college who does great work of teaching. But when his concoctions goes horribly awry, he's a danger-prone goof waiting to happen. So when a jock stuffs him in a closet full of bottles, Stella Purdy(Stella Stevens) helps the timid professor out. When the gym does nothing for Kelp, he goes to the extremes of getting stronger. He drinks a potion he concocts and BOOM! Buddy Love. He stops traffic with his looks, and he looks intimidating even for the college jocks. I liked the part where he asks for an Alaskan Polar Bear, and the bar tender ended up being "cold and stiffed". It was a very funny movie all the way, and Stella get the Professor for a long trip. And the wink means, UH-OH! Man, that Jerry Lewis classic is more like a true classic to me. Lot's of laughs, and plenty of slapstick. One for the books. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film over ten times it still made me laugh my head off. Jerry Lewis was absolutely hysterical and memorable in his performance as both a nerdy teacher and cool guy. What i enjoyed about the movie is that it's not overdone with special effects like the 1990's version that starred Eddie Murphy. Lewis &amp; his co star Stella Stevens had good chemistry, she actually liked the professor more than the suave cool dude.Professor Julius Kelp (Lewis) is a nerdy chemistry teacher and unattractive guy whose ignored by the beautiful women and ridiculed by students and fellow teachers. Oneday after an argument with a student over leaving early he gets humiliated in front of his class including Stella Purdy (Stevens) the object of his desire. Fed up with the jokes and abuse he creates a powerful potion that transforms him into a sexy and debonair man named Buddy Love.But the Jekyll &amp; Hyde routine proves to be more difficult than imagined because the effects of the potion wear off at the worst times and Kelp has to run away before anyone discovers the truth to the mystery of Buddy Love. However the truth is finally revealed during the senior prom and he explains his actions to everyone including Stella who admits that she loved Kelp more than Buddy and in the end they get married.For fans of classics I recommend This timeless comedy gem it's funny , original and enjoyable</fullReview>

I would said it is one of the most honest cinematographic versions about Robert L. Stevenson classic, even translated to the sixties. That is why this film should have be watching absolutely by everybody, be showed at primary and secondary schools, every kind of universities and of course at all cinemas of the world from time to time. It is, as someone sensible already told, fairly Jerry Lewis best film, his masterpiece, because it is one-and-only. It is Lewis greatest performance, the top of his funniest gangs indeed. Stella Stevens is unforgettable and all the casting is irreproachable under Lewis direction. The American "patsy" make jokes of packaging, arrogant and authoritarian people. And value the unaffectedness, spontaneity and industry. Something that is worth while. At last his experiences with the color are very achieved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea, so-so movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nutty Professor" is Jerry Lewis' original take on the Jekyll and Hyde story in which the Hyde character, lounge lizard Buddy Love, is almost unrecognizable as a monster. The monster actually looks and sounds much more like the real Jerry Lewis than his over-the-top caricature of a buck-toothed bumbling professor. Buddy Love is talented, handsome, and witty. He is also so thoroughly detestable that Jerry Lewis claims to have hated every minute of every scene in which he had to portray the character. Add to this the occasional flashes of comedic brilliance which Lewis brings to all of his films and we have a classic depiction of the social outcast trying much too hard to be something he isn't.Unfortunately, unless you happen to be a big fan of the Jerry Lewis of the 1950s and 60s, you will probably consider this movie to be only mediocre. I think most people, like myself, believe that his humor hasn't aged well and we simply cannot view his films in the same way as the audiences who made Lewis the top box-office attraction of his time. The humor is predictable and repetitious. Add to this a romance which makes absolutely no sense (and completely overlooks one with Kathleen Freeman which could have) and a closing speech that pounds the moral into your head just in case you missed it. It's a classic, but it's a tedious classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lewis's Hyde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be Jerry Lewis's most acclaimed vehicle made during the height of his popularity. While I'm not a fan of Lewis, this one does have a lot going for it. It's a reworking--a parody of sorts--of the familiar Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story, which has had an interesting history in film and other media, including comic books. The movies (and I'm mostly referring to the 1920, 1931 and 1941 Hollywood versions) are a reworking of the original novella, as well (which is, of course, common in adaptations). The result is a shared heritage removed in many ways from Stevenson's original. Not unfortunate, I think, but interesting. "The Nutty Professor" fits right in with this progression.I didn't find it a remarkably funny experience--much of it falls flat and seems specifically aimed at an audience foreign to me (campy 60s pop culture, for example). Everyone other than Lewis seems in need of acting lessons, a better-written role, or something amusing to do, but that doesn't matter. Lewis is delightful. His geek professor Julius Kelp is a well-honed character--the typical role that Lewis made his career out of. His Buddy Love is what's special about this vehicle; it works because it really is the Hyde--a suave egocentric--to Lewis's Jekyll (who looks more like Hyde). Buddy Love may very well be closer to the real Jerry Lewis, but it's the antithesis of the Jerry Lewis image, or persona. This movie doesn't need to be always funny; it's worth seeing just for Lewis's play on his own image.Furthermore, the Eddy Murphy remake is void of this concept, or any interesting reworking of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or this 1963 original. And, its humor is in very poor taste. Not Lewis's movie; it is family entertainment--and is clever, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another work of art from the Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. Beyond writing a straight, common review of how funny or not so funny this movie is, i would like to make some points. Yes, i am a 60's child that grew up watching Lewis, Clint Eastwood and his spaghetti westerns, corny TV shows like Lost In Space, The Time Tunnel; enjoyed watching Elvis gyrating with babes on the beach, and was enthralled with the rudimentary art of the TV cartoons in the 60's. But here is one point: today, the youth understands humour as something that is wide open and that has no bounderies. That means anything goes in comedy nowadays: sex, drugs, perversion of all kinds, profuse swearing, strong condescending attitudes, acidic cynicism, manic depressive characters that will sometimes spit out a funny joke attached to a body part, a sex act or followed by a huge toke from a huge joint. Well, i am old enough to know that humour is not limited to what today's media dish out. There are many kinds of humour; of course some types of comedy originated from way back and because it was from a somewhat distant past, lots of youths will quickly dismiss it as UNfunny. What is funny is like " Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder": what is funny to one may not be funny to another. But what I find disappointing is the trend, the current, the direction comedy takes today. It seems to ignore the value of physical comedy, satire, slap stick, Vaudeville and so on. In the past, some of the best comedy was seen in duos, on stages of variety shows, etc. Mainstream TV still offers in modest ways those comedy styles (SNL of the 70's, 80's, SCTV, In Living Color) but nothing like Martin's Laugh In or The Carol Burnett Show delivered. Back then comedy was for the whole family, now comedy has a parental guidance warning. If someone like me dares to surf the channels to find and enjoy cleaner comedy, I will certainly hit a brick wall. That is the sad part of this issue: the present offers very little options in terms of a broad choice to comedy types. So, aside from this essay approach to my take on Comedy, this movie is one of many good comedies Lewis created. Many of his movies showed creative comedy that did not need fancy special effects or CGI to be funny. In fact, when people mention that Eddie Murphy's version is comparable and that his scenes with multiple characters he portrays "at the same time" is false. The effect seems to have Murphy doing the characters all at once but of course, they were each filmed then edited and CGIed to look as one event. Well, Lewis did not have CGI and advanced special effects with which he could play. But despite that technological absence, he pulled it off masterfully, with the techniques typical of the times. And then there are those small moments, details that express a subtle humour that is not loud, obnoxious or full of disrespectful attitudes. The scene where you see Lewis sitting deep inside a chair, chatting with his university chair person. The timing is classic, the sound effects support the comedic moment and, best of all, Lewis' expressions are what makes for a curriculum of comedy worthy of any college. His movies show us many examples of his unequalled talent in physical comedy, his ability to play with his voice, his face, his limbs and his admirable talent to portray many different personalities, characters with comedy that points out the humanity in even the least likable of characters (like the gangster in The Family Jewels). I agree that many of the films he directed were filled with flaws of all sorts but so are many, many other movies directed by other people (Clint, Spielberg and Hitchcock among others). The scripts were not always the best in Jerry's movies but they held their own and they survived because of Jerry's humour. we also do understand that Jerry had the habit of building his movies as series of skits, strung together with light hearted script. His movies were pure entertainment of the joyous kind, like most comedies of the past. They were not depressing, full of nudity, graphic sexual acts, scenes of death, gore and vulgarities of all sorts. They were light, happy, unpretentious and only wanted to make you laugh, that is it. If today's youth views his movies and fail to laugh when viewing, then i cannot help them, I cannot cure them, and i must move along with my generational differences and take to my grave what I enjoyed during my childhood and throughout my whole life. Call me old fashioned and that is more than fine with me. If i was to try redemption for our modern society, i could say that one of the last physical humorist of our times, who saw it fit to make movies almost comparable to Jerry's, would be Jim Carrey. In the 1990's, we saw him perform a similar type of comedy as Jerry's and it was refreshing to me. But by then came a huge wave of comedians that thrived on the F word and bodily functions to make people laugh, and that is when I stopped laughing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, but Entertaining for the Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up watching Jerry Lewis act in the 1950's, and he was always very funny. However, I did not care for his suave transformation character in this movie, because the cool guys during the 1960's did not wear that much greasy hair dressing, so I felt that was way out of place. (He wore greasy hair balm in real life I believe at this time Well - yuck!) If there were men like that, they would have been slapped left and right acting like this character did in real life. I suppose he was trying to be the obnoxious cool guy anyway, but I really hated him acting this way. Stella was perfect for her part. Very cute then, but I was so glad her character didn't fall for this Buddy Love person. I think to appreciate this movie, you have to understand or have lived that era. I like the different format Lewis used when at the end of the movie, all the actors/actresses walked out and bowed their parts as if having made a stage show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best then Eddie Murphys version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why the hell did Hollywood have to reboot this gem?! Honestly I think this is just far better then Eddie Murphy's 'Nutty Professor' version. Jerry Lewis was so amazing at his role especially his characters fake name 'Buddy Love'. If you are a girl or gay, he would melt your heart at his singing and his handsome looks. I just felt fuzzy and just felt a good vibe while watching him. He was just adorable haha!Stella Stevens who plays his love interest was absolutely beautiful, she definitely should've been considered a sex symbol during the 60's. She is literally stunning if you ask me! I definitely would consider this the best Jerry Lewis film I've ever seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Jerry's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Jerry's masterpiece -- his Annie Hall -- the one for the ages that will be re-watched however the rest may (or may not) endure.Jerry-as-professor is a variant on Jerry's usual screen idiot, but with amusing double-talk, and good physical comedy. He also manages to convey real pathos under all the clowning.Jerry's smarmy "Buddy Love" character is surprisingly complicated -- an ass and a bully, but with hints of vulnerability and pathetic drunkenness. "Ain't enough you got the best? You want me to be on-time too?" The character anticipates his "Jerry Langford" in the King of Comedy. It's a self-less performance -- playing an unflattering part very very well. The alluring and wide-eyed Stella Stevens helps too. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To improve his social life, a nerdish professor (Jerry Lewis) drinks a potion that temporarily turns him into the handsome, but obnoxious, Buddy Love.I had a rather low expectation for this film, because Jerry Lewis as the professor is such an absurd, stupid character. But to see the transformation and his range, I was actually quite impressed. He can be stupid or suave and does equally well in either role.The real actor in this film is Stella Stevens, though. She, like Lewis, has something of a transformation between her day and night roles. And it is equally as dramatic. Yet, she never seemed to achieve his level of fame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just in Time Jerry Lewis Makes a Movie that Cannot be Ignored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director-Writer-Star Jerry Lewis' Timing was Perfect, because He Made this, His Masterpiece, at the Very Last Moment before Pop Culture Changed Dramatically a Year Later with Beatlemania. It was Done in the Last Gasp of the Rat Pack and Rock n' Roll as We Knew it. It was a Time when the Plasticville Fifties would Shortly be Shoved in the Dustbin of History and a More Mature, Philosophical, and Challenging Freedom in Art would be Forthcoming and a New Zeitgeist would Zip onto the Scene.There's No Way the Hybrid (Dean Martin-Frank Sinatra-Jerry Lewis) Buddy Love could have Passed for Anything Resembling Hip just a Year Later. So Jerry Lewis Snuck this One in just in the Knick of Time. It is the Movie that All of Jerry Lewis Movie's are Compared, With or Without Dean Martin. It's so Representative that it is Accurate to Say that if You Only Ever See One Jerry Lewis Movie, See this One.The Film is Enchanting with its Classic Dual Personality Story, Effervescent Technicolor, Stunning Leading Lady, and the Jerry Lewis "Charm" of Silent Slapstick, Sight Gags Galore, and Smarmy Sentimentality (that rarely worked so well for Jerry). It is His Best Remembered Movie, His Most Popular Movie, His Most Critically Acclaimed Movie, and it has the Ability to Soften the Most Hardened of His Critics to at Least Acknowledge there is a Talent at Work Here.The Depth and Greatness of that Talent is Up for Debate. But this Movie, while Containing a Goodly Amount of the Jerry Lewis Schtick, is Undeniably an Entertaining Oddity with so Much Vibrancy on Screen it is Difficult to Ignore and Must be Considered Art. The Sight Gags, Always a Highlight in Jerry's Films, are Fantastic here and there is an Equal Amount of Drama to Balance the Silliness and the Transformation Scene Contains some Terror.Overall, it is Widely Considered the Peak of Jerry's Success both Critically and at the Box Office. He would Never Again be as Good or such a Phenom. Although Hardly Done Making Movies, He would Never Again Come Close to this Type of Terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Jerry Lewis role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up on Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis during the 1950s, Martin was the straight man, and excellent crooner, while Lewis was the silly comic. I remember when we learned that Martin and Lewis were breaking up their team and most of us could not understand that. Why would they break up their act.As an adult I now understand that, after a while you just want to do something different. And they both had that opportunity.In this movie Jerry Lewis is a Chemistry professor, Professor Julius Kelp. He is typically nerdy, with prominent buck teeth and poor eyesight. In his spare time he experiments and discovers a potion that has amazing properties. When he drinks the elixir he becomes Buddy Love, with a personality quite the opposite of the nerdy Kelp. He is a pianist and lounge singer, a snappy dresser, is abrasive to everyone, but somehow managed to catch the attention of a pretty girl.That pretty girl is a 20-something Stella Stevens as Stella Purdy. She was indelibly attracted to Buddy Love, and even she couldn't understand why. She also happened to be a student in his Chemistry class.(As an aside, I once had a boss who in the 1950s married his college English professor, so the idea of appropriate student/professor relationships is not far-fetched.) So the fun in the movie is seeing the nerdy professor with the nerdy Jerry Lewis nasal voice becoming the suave Buddy Love with the golden baritone voice, and without the prominent buck teeth. The problem was, the elixir only lasted a short time, and sometimes Buddy returned to being Kelp on-stage, and actor Lewis handles the voice changes superbly.A fun Jerry Lewis comedy. SPOILERS: In the end when Buddy changes to Kelp on-stage, he relents and explains himself. Later Stella consoles him, and says she would rather be the wife of a professor instead, making Kelp happy. But his gregarious dad has decided to sell the elixir, $1.00 a pop, to those who wanted to be a different person. Starting with the professors students in class!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nerdy or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Nutty Professor", (1963), the Professor (Jerry Lewis) is a "nerd" trying to become a well-built man. He tried three different methods of making himself buff. When the Professor finally found the method, he used it repeatedly to keep up the act of his changing image. Because the Professor struggled with being a nerd, he was desperate to change how he looked.The Professor's first attempt to become "buff" was working out at the gym, which failed miserably. The Professor's second attempt was to try to take pharmaceutical drugs to enhance him self, but the medical doctor refused to prescribe him anything. His final attempt to enhance him self he used was a magic potion, which worked well. The Professor was ignored by most of his students and staff and as a result made him to change his image. The Professor was medium height and dark haired. The film accomplished its task to improve the Professor's look, but it seemed to be a very lengthy process. Because the Professor worked on his project alone, it took the film awhile to get to the point of the movie.In the 1960's, the production companies had less technology than available in this day and age. The film's original version was black and white. The cabinets in the Professor's classroom were outdated. They looked similar to what is in a doctor's office. The Bunsen beakers were long and skinny. The Bunsen burners were larger than they are today. The costumes were perfect for the movie's era. The white lab coat the Professor wore seemed to add just the right setting for the film. The imaging was very dark. It was darker than a film today. The Professor wore the black rimmed glasses suited perfect for the "nerdy" look. The experiments the Professor created would make an enormous explosion almost every time he created one, which made for excellent suspense in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for a variety of reasons not stated in most reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie fits into the broad categories of "comedy of manners", "satire" and "farce." The French playwright Moliere was a master of such comedy, which relies on character types that are played off against each other. The characters are not just stereotypes, but crudely exaggerated stereotypes -- and the resulting comedy is broad, brash, and almost cartoon-like. You either like this sort of thing or you do not. I love it when it's done well -- whether by Jerry Lewis or by Carol Burnett.The extremes of character I've mentioned carry over into everything else. Exaggeration is key to the comedic effect.When Jerry, playing an extremely nerdy, socially inept and absent-minded chemistry professor, inadvertently blows up his own class room, it sounds like a nuclear bomb going off.Later, when he is summoned to the college president's office for a stern dressing down, both he and the president do a masterful job of playing to stereotype. The president is vain, arrogant, cold and imperious. He gives Jerry such a lengthy silent treatment that you almost start to look at your watch. But this attempt at intimidation utterly fails because Jerry is much too socially inept to realize that he is supposed to be intimidated.The extremes of exaggeration and contrast carry over into Jerry's dual roles as the nerdy but good-hearted professor who can be bullied with impunity (Dr. Jekyll) and the arrogant, conceited, bullying hipster Buddy Love (Mr. Hyde.) The tight structure of the underlying comedic conception is demonstrated by the mirroring that takes place -- with the conflict between Jerry's two opposite characters being reflected in the relationship between his parents. Because of the chemical formula that Jerry invents in order to transform himself, the role between the two parents ends up being reversed, with the bullied father finally cowing the bullying mother.Other notable aspects of the movie are the wonderful big band and swing music, not unlike the equally enjoyable music found in Jerry's other great movie "The Patsy." The hipster suits that Jerry wears as Buddy Love are classic in their own right.And there's a feeling of spaciousness that accurately reflects how America felt in the fifties and early sixties.Then, of course, there are the very thinly disguised references to the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc.) The Buddy Love character is actually an exaggerated rendition of a how a lot of people were during that time. And the dialog accurately reflects that.I think Jerry Lewis makes a lot of people uncomfortable not because his comedy is bad, but rather because it is too good and cuts to the quick in places where people are sensitive.But that's just something that great comedy does when it is farcical, satirical, and -- as in this case -- a comedy of manners that pokes fun at character types.What is it that they say about stereotypes? "The trouble with stereotypes is that they are so true..." And sometimes, people just don't like what they see in the mirror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mention The Nutty Professor these days, and you'll most likely get a reply like "oh yeah, that Eddie Murphy flick where he played his whole family..." Or words to that effect. Well, it all started here. Jerry Lewis' Julius Kelp/Buddy Love combo is a marvellous creation, the Kelp side being the more comedic in nature although the Love side no less so. Word has it though, Lewis was more like Love than Kelp.This basic Jekyll and Hyde tale is simplistic in plot but offers a wide range of comedic opportunity. Lewis is on fine form here, wringing the most out of the concept. Kelp being put on a cupboard shelf, trying out at the gym, Love charming the pants off the dean, all classic moments. The pace is a little slow in places and viewers watching for the first time may only find it funnier the second time around, but if you enjoyed the remake, you might just enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Je m'excuse, but this is a visionary and fascinating movie. Professor Julius Kelp is Lewis's usual nebbish multiplied to the third power, a compellingly grotesque nerd. He chemically transforms himself into a womanizing swinger, Buddy Love, who is also compellingly grotesque. Calling this a Dean Martin rip is a little too easy - instead, I think this is Lewis's fantasy about what the world would be like if he, not Dino, joined the Rat Pack. That Vegas showbiz greaseball clearly comes from deep inside the man even as he showers him with contempt. His comic judgment is never completely reliable, of course, but he's throwing a lot of sh*t against the wall here and much is brilliant, especially the sound gags. And while he's on counterpoint to himself, he hasn't forgotten to hire a reliable foil: Stella Stevens, as a college swinger who uses the word 'nor' in everyday conversation. There are times when Stell looks as though her patience is being severely tested, but that's OK - in this film she is almost a centerfold Margaret Dumont. And while her final gag may render Lewis's big message completely incoherent, who needs big messages from Lewis anyway? Del Moore is great too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lewis remains the "dark star" everyone finds hard to like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry's greatest film, far superior to the Murphy remake. Many audiences find Jerry's persona(s) childishly overbearing, relentlessly needy, narcissistic and inappropriate for comedy. It might be better then, to experience his work as tragic farce. Particularly in this film, the characters have affinities with (Absurd) literary themes of the double and the Idiot in the writings of Gogol and Dostoyevsky: misfits who try too hard to conform or be different and embarrass themselves and everyone else. Even an episode of "Roseanne" found the family "adopted" by such a character, Burt, who was overflowing with the milk of human kindness. Roseanne comments, "how did you get this far in life without someone driving a spike through your head?" Aside from the homage to Jerry on "The Simpsons", Krusty the Klown, only Robin Williams can match the overtones of helpless desperation in his work. For example, his "Patch Adams" and "Jakob the Liar" have shades of a Lewis film considered too extreme to release, "The Day the Clown Cried", about a clown who led children into the gas chambers of a concentration camp. Robin Williams remains, if not the missing link between Lewis, Polanski's "The Tenant", and Fassbinder's "In A Year Of Thirteen Moons", the black hole at the end of the continuum....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This character study about a chemistry professor who, thanks to a potion he drinks which improves him physically but ruins his character does have a valid point.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, which has to be one of Lewis' best, both as a director and as an actor, is not only funny, but it is also a good character study. Jerry Lewis is very adept at playing two roles, both as a not-at-all cool and nutty chemistry professor, Julius Kelp, and as a "cool", "suave" man, Buddy Love, who has great singing ability. There is a valid point to be remembered, that being that while there is nothing wrong with, again, being cool and suave, don't become so unbearably obnoxious, so much that you are disgusting. Del Moore is definitely excellent as the high-strung college dean Dr. Warfield, Kathleen Freeman is hilarious as the dean's secretary, and Howard Morris, (later Mayberry's Ernest T. Bass) is as side-splitting as ever; all make the movie comical as well. And too, Les Brown and his Band of Renown definitely make for a great drawing card, and, more than this, the very appealing Stella Stevens is quite a beautiful icon. I have watched this movie many times and it has always "thrilled me".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in bed with Flu on a Saturday afternoon, flicking through TV channels when I stumbled on this gem of a movie. To be honest, I didn't know this film existed &amp; didn't realise the Eddie Murphy version was a re-make. Well Jerry Lewis is a thousand times better than Murphy &amp; plays the 2 characters in this comic Jekyll &amp; Hyde twist with amazing skill. Buddy love is played with a certain pathos &amp; glimpses of Kelp's character are often present. The portrayal of Prof Kelp is beautiful &amp; how a 6 foot tall actor can play a little man so convincingly is beyond me. The supporting cast certainly play second fiddle to Lewis but Stella Stevens &amp; Del Moore do a great job.Simpsons fans will immediately notice that Prof Frink is very heavily based on Prof Julius Kelp (essentially a carbon copy &amp; Jerry Lewis even played Prof Frink's Father in a Simpsons episode). The Nutty Professor could almost be a cartoon with the OTT characters and sound effects but it's the script &amp; Lewis' performance that make it shine. The only real downer is that its very dated now &amp; probably won't appeal to the young audience that it was originally intended for. It is a little slow in places &amp; just how old are Kelp's students? Stella Purdy looks young enough but the rest of the class look like they're 40 plus.In conclusion, it's an excellent family film with a strong moral story &amp; is far better than the crude 1996 re-make or the horrid sequel - The Klumps (there are rumours of a 3rd one. Please spare us!). So The Nutty Professor 1963 is well worth a watch if you've never seen it before &amp; if you have seen it, maybe it's time for a reminder of Jerry Lewis' talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bumbling, bucktoothed chemistry professor Jerry Lewis (as Julius Kelp) stumbles upon a potion which changes him into a swinging and attractive, but rude singer named "Buddy Love". Mr. Lewis' beautiful blonde student Stella Stevens (as Stella Purdy) is attracted his "bad boy" alter ego, but not "The Nutty Professor". Lewis' version of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" dabbles with something darker along the way, but ends with a simplified "beauty is only skin deep" message. If it had stayed dark, it might be better, but it also may not have enjoyed the contemporary success...During his first rendition of "That Old Black Magic", Lewis lets too much schtick in, but otherwise this film features the star in great form, with two of his best characterizations. Even gestures and facial tics are finely tuned, rather than thrown about haphazardly. If you wonder what all the fuss about Jerry Lewis is about, you may be more likely to see it in "The Nutty Professor" than anywhere else. The message about beauty is gender specific here, which leads to another of the film's appeals - Ms. Stevens is stunningly beautiful and tightly attired, as the perfect woman is expected...Some see Lewis bad side as a swipe against former partner Dean Martin. Their relationship wasn't always good, but the comparison of "Buddy" and Mr. Martin was unfair. Martin surely saw the truth. Lewis did not act like the goofy characters he played in his movies. He was more like the ultra-hip, swinging "Buddy Love". This film plays with the dark side of that character, which could be seen in several entertainers of that generation, not just Lewis. The so-called "Rat Pack" led by Frank Sinatra had this quality. The group had an essential mean streak, but it wasn't Martin. Lewis' "Buddy" was his own.******** The Nutty Professor (6/4/63) Jerry Lewis ~ Jerry Lewis, Stella Stevens, Del Moore, Kathleen Freeman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definitive Jerry Lewis film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time this month. I was impressed by Jerry Lewis's acting performances and the range between his two characters of nerdy, clumsy professor Klump and his alter ego, suave, obnoxious playboy Buddy Love.Jerry Lewis directed and co-wrote the screenplay for this film. Along with acting the dual lead role, this is very much a definitive Jerry Lewis film.This is the character Lewis is best remembered for and now I understand why, after all these years. This film was released the year I was born. "The Nutty Professor", 1963 is better than usual for a Hollywood comedy, so I'm a little surprised it's lowly rated here at IMDb.com, only a 6.7 score. Memory weakening over time? It might be because of the age of the film. I saw this film for the very first time last week and consider this a classic and masterful comic acting performance by Jerry Lewis. If I saw this film years ago as a child, I would have been a long time admirer of Mr. Lewis.The writing has a little more breadth and depth than usual for a comedy film. This is an obvious Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde story, updated for it's time. There's the rich, vivid colors of the art direction, a good script and good acting overall. I usually set my expectations low for comedy films. The obvious highlight and a reason to see the film all by itself, is Lewis's dual role performance. He plays them both very well and the contrast is always entertaining. An odd thing about the story is it's supposed to be set in a university, yet there is a prom at the end of the film. Proms are a high school, not a college tradition. This would also alter the love interest story of the professor and a female student, Stella. Professor Klump appears age 30 - 35, Stella is either 18 or 22. It's important to note that a large age difference between a man and a woman, in a romantic relationship, was more socially acceptable, at the time of this film.The actors portraying the students all appear older than high school and typical college age. The supporting actor casting is a weakness of the film, but one easily forgiven. It's the story, direction and acting that matter most.Jerry Lewis was part of the very popular and highly successful comedy team along with Dean Martin. Martin and Lewis worked together from 1949 to 1956. By the time of this film, Lewis had considerable experience playing his original goofy sidekick character and decided to also do the Dean Martin suave playboy character.I recommend this film to those interested in experiencing an inspired and classic comic acting performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Interesting than Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nutty Professor," made at the height of Jerry Lewis' writing and directing of his own films, is an anomaly among the Jerry Lewis canon. Although nominally a comedy, the amusing moments to be found here are surprisingly rare. Lewis' fans may laud this as a comic masterpiece, but the title above ? borrowed from a Leonard Maltin review of the film ? is a better distillation of what it has to offer. But though "The Nutty Professor" may not have many laugh-out-loud moments, it's still a movie that stays with the viewer, because it's ultimately more a thought-provoking film than a funny one.The plot, such as it is, has been adequately summarized elsewhere. Basically, this is a variation on the Jekyll-and-Hyde theme: Jerry's Prof. Julius Kelp, smitten with the lovely Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens), tries to win her over by concocting a potion that transforms the buck-toothed, awkward Kelp into handsome, debonair Buddy Love ? who nevertheless is thoroughly detestable.Both the contemporary advertisements for the movie, and the film itself, use irony and misdirection to introduce Kelp's transformation. One of those movie posters is split in two: the top portion shows "mad scientist" Kelp gleefully mixing chemicals, while the bottom shows Stella tossing a frightened glance over her shoulder as the tag line asks, "What does he become? What kind of monster?"Likewise, the first time that the film reveals Kelp's Buddy Love persona, it's done in a long point-of-view shot from Kelp/Love's perspective, as onlookers stop what they're doing to stare at the new "creature" ? until, at last, the camera spins around to reveal that Kelp has become, well, basically Jerry Lewis playing himself. This was undoubtedly an on-screen first, as Lewis was no longer playing either the high-voiced "kid" (as he referred to his usual screen persona), and he's no longer the buck-toothed, pathetic Kelp, either. Movie audiences in 1963 must initially have been confused that Kelp's formula turned Kelp into a well-dressed sophisticate instead of the horrible monster hinted at in both that movie poster and in the transformation scene itself (when a hairy clawed hand is shown in close-up during Lewis' vigorous rolling around on his laboratory floor).But then, as one reflects on the creature that Kelp *does* become, one has to wonder if maybe "monster" isn't the best description of Buddy Love after all. Yes, he's smooth, handsome (Lewis was only 36 at the time, and quite good-looking) and an accomplished crowd-pleaser ? but he's also short-tempered, insulting, and domineering toward Stella, at one point ordering her to wipe off her lipstick so he can commence kissing her. It's really a no-win situation: either she can have the clumsy, weak, and awkward professor or the suave, handsome, but ultimately abhorrent Buddy Love.It foreshadows, in some ways, the relationship between Julie Andrews and James Garner in 1964's "The Americanization of Emily" ? Julie Andrews' character Emily is horrified at the thought of Garner's character, Charlie Madison, dying on the beaches of D-Day. But then she's equally horrified at the prospect of him *not* dying when she finds out he intends to take the coward's way out. So she can either have a live coward (in which case she doesn't want him) or a dead hero ? but either way, she loses him.And so it is with the puzzle-box Stella is trapped in with Kelp/Love. In his real persona, Kelp isn't really someone with whom Stella will likely want to spend the rest of her life; Kelp needs a mother (or a keeper) more than a girlfriend. And while she finds the debonair aspects of Buddy Love hard to resist, she still recognizes that, at bottom, he's a rude, arrogant jerk.The movie doesn't entirely resolve this dilemma. Kelp may make that moving speech at the prom about "being yourself," and Stella may appear to choose Kelp at the end ? but she's still got two bottles of Kelp's formula in her back pockets as they run off . . . perhaps to take Buddy Love "out of the closet" occasionally when she grows bored with Kelp.Despite this not really being a comedy, it does have its amusing moments ? Kelp removing his wet shoes to stop their squeaking, only to discover that it's his *feet* that are squeaking; Kelp disappearing into the college president's chair when he sits down, then apparently being able to support his entire weight on the thickness of a magazine; or Kelp putting his entire sleeve into the punchbowl at the prom. (Note, of course, that it's always Kelp, never Buddy Love, who provides the comic interludes.)And whatever other problems this movie may have, it still *looks* great. The film's colors ? whether of Buddy's suits, of Kelp's laboratory chemicals, or of the successive outfits Kelp imagines Stella to be wearing in one scene ? are so eye-poppingly bright that Technicolor deserved separate billing as another character.Though a great comic when he was at the top of his form, Lewis (like Woody Allen) apparently wanted to be remembered for something besides comedy, too. All in all, "The Nutty Professor" ? like its characters Julius Kelp and Buddy Love ? is a strange amalgam: too often farcical and fantasy-driven to be taken as a serious meditation, yet too serious (and too bereft of funny moments) to really be a comedy, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the long impressive history of Jerry Lewis films, it is very difficult to select one which truly represents the famous comedian. For me, this is his tour de force. Lewis plays Professor Julius Kelp a humble, intelligent, innocuous, dedicated scientist who believes in his work. Then again he also plays Buddy Love an overpowering, egotistic, overbearing and impressive social presence. Learning he is in love with Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens) he attempts to win her over, but is unable due to his cautious introverted life. However upon discovering an experimental formula, he is transformed in his alter ego Buddy Love who has little trouble becoming the center of attention anywhere. The problem is Miss Purdy who although is attracted to Mr. Love, is hoping Professor Kelp will eventually chose her. In addition, the fabulous formula which transforms the shy professor, has a time limit which can lead to embarrassing situations. For Jerry Lewis, master comic, this movie highlights his real life persona and establishes him as a true performer and a comedic genius. This film is easily recommended to all. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of two I call "My favorites."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This and Cinderfella are my favorite Jerry Lewis movies, with this one slightly above Cinderguy.I won't detail the story, as hundreds of reviewers have already done that, but I will say that this is light years ahead of Eddie Murphy's attempt and a million times better. This is genuinely unique, funny, and endearing, where its successor is somewhat flaccid and self serving. Jerry Lewis's Julius Kelp is human, thoughtful, and intelligent. Eddie Murphy's Sherman Klump is stupid, idiotic, and just plain sad.If you're interested in seeing a quality comedy, made when comedy was intelligently funny, or even dramatically funny (containing a quality of humanity), this is one I can highly recommend. If you're one of the generation x'ers who can't seem to "get" intelligent comedy, then by all means, embrace "comedy" that thinks bathroom humor and stupidity are funny. Yes, go rent Eddie Murphy's work and leave this one on the shelves for someone with half a brain.This is sweetly endearing and entertains.It rates a 7.9/10 on the black and white scale from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry Lewis' funniest movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Murphy remade "The Nutty Professor" in the mid-1990s but the original co-written, directed and starring Jerry Lewis is a funnier film. Lewis plays Professor Julius Kelp, a chemistry professor who is enamored of one of his students, Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens) Julius realizes Stella is out of his league, she is very pretty and he is the ultimate nerd, picked on and dissed by everyone who knows him. So, Julius develops a chemical formula which allows him to become a cool, suave ladies man, and he calls himself "Buddy Love". Stella sees through Buddy's posturing and thinks he is mostly a self-involved jerk, but is nevertheless somewhat interested in him. Julius eventually learns an important life-lesson and is able to attract Stella for the man he really is. This is a funny movie, Buddy in an obnoxious way is very amusing, so this picture gets a grade of B+ and a strong recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry Lewis's best, and Stella Stevens has got to be one of the hottest women out there!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Nutty Professor" remake some years ago should make us recall the original. Since this was back in the days before scatological humor, they rely on Prof. Julius Kelp's (Jerry Lewis) ultra-nerd personality - complete with a bowl haircut and buck teeth - for the bulk of the comedy. They must have had fun filming that opening scene where he antagonizes his superiors! OK, so relationships between teachers and students are unethical, but could any man not want to be in a relationship with Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens)? I mean, now there's a hot babe! My favorite scene was when he first drinks the potion and ends up resembling something from a John Carpenter movie. As Buddy Love, he looked kind of gross (too much grease in his hair).All in all, this is a comedy classic. The "Simpsons" character John Frink was obviously based on Julius Kelp. Something for everyone to see. Also starring Del Moore and Kathleen Freeman (the nun from "The Blues Brothers").PS: After this movie, Jerry Lewis and Stella Stevens didn't see each other again for over thirty years. You see, she made a series of movies with Dean Martin, and could only be friends with one of them. So, she finally met Jerry Lewis again right after a "Damn Yankees" performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The funniest film ever to be produced. Yes thats right it beats "Some like it hot"!!! Excellent acting,writing and directing by Jerry Lewis makes this a masterpiece and classic. There is only one Nutty Professor worth watching and that's this one. The film is very watchable, it doesn't matter how many times you see it it's still as funny as the first time. There are lots of classic bits in it, my favorites are when Kelp gets drunk as Buddy Love and has to teach a class, when he goes to the ball and dances and also when he walks up the hall with squeaky shoes takes his shoes off and the squeaks get louder. The music for this movie is also brilliant, the songs match the story line and Jerry has got quite a good voice! Everyone should watch this movie, i feel sorry for the people that have never seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that Ol' Blue Eyes has been safely translated to the Big Casino, the truth about "The Nutty Professor" can finally be told: Buddy Love IS Sinatra! Let's not pussyfoot around this fact. One or two of your earlier reviewers come close to admitting it (hernebay, and dodge196, who refers to Sinatra's "crooning and thuggery").There's nothing remotely comparable in Eddie Murphy's re-make(s). A 1963 audience would have registered instant (if uncomfortable) brand recognition when presented with the all-singing, all-drinking, all-brawling Buddy Love. Maybe Sinatra saw the joke, although this doesn't really seem very likely. More likely he never saw the movie! Just as well for Jerry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nutty isn't enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The typical Lewis schtick is cute, but it isn't enough to carry the film (especially without a strong straight man for Lewis to play off), and apart from a couple of very brief bits with Howard Morris, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR offers nothing else. The story is uninteresting, Stella Stevens's startling beauty doesn't make up for her lack of acting talent, some of the dialogue (e.g., the lover's leap scene) is so stilted as to be painful to listen to, and Lewis insists on beating us over the head with the incredibly obvious moral.Perhaps the worst thing is that nothing we see on screen justifies the adulation Buddy Love receives from everyone he meets. Lewis isn't a bad-looking guy, but come on: he's Jerry Lewis, not Paul Newman (or even Dean Martin). As for his singing, he's OK in a gather-'round-the-piano sort of way, but he's not nearly up to a professional standard. Buddy is also obnoxious and annoying, and his line of patter wouldn't impress a child, let alone a moderately intelligent adult. The discongruity between what the film shows us and what it tells us is simply too jarring for the film to succeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Millennials Guide to Jerry Lewis 101</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With exceptions of the comedy team of Martin and Lewis movies during the 1950's This classic masterpiece of split personalities is the Paramount of Mr. Lewis's movie career. I can't think of a better introduction to the wacky and unpredictable world of the Jerry Lewis genre. This movie shows the panoramic range of characterization. On one hand you have the meek, stumbling professor Kelp. On the other hand you have the suave, over assertive and obnoxious Buddy Love. Part of the Lewis genius here is that Jerry to this day boasts about the fact that he didn't use any facial makeup to alter the characters. Instead he used mime and over- expression to make his alter imaginary beings different. The big debate about this movie is who is Lewis portraying while playing the part of Buddy Love? Some say Dean Martin; others say Frank Sinatra. I beg to differ. I say It's just Jerry being himself. I watch Phil Donahue (The Father of the daytime talk show circuit), program back in the early 70's and Jerry Lewis was the guest. Jerry was under fire from irate woman in the audience about where the money/donations go for the Muscular Dystophy Telethon which he annually hosted every Labor Day? Jerry facial expression changed instantaneously as he fires back at the hostile audience and I thought for that moment of the Buddy Love character. Lewis also quoted as saying every person has an ugly hostile side to the their person. Oh did I mention this movie has a moral to the story, Kelp at movie's end says quite simply,"You might as well like yourself. Just think about all the time you're going to have to spend with you, and if you don't think too much of yourself, how do you expect other to? Sit back and watch the master at work. Familiar TV icons appear in this movie the likes of Henry Gibson (The Poet) from LAUGH-IN, Norman Alden (Irate Father-In-Law) from My THREE SONS, Howard Morris,The wild Ernest T. Bass ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW and Marvin Kaplin from Alice and Choo Choo on Top cat Cartoons. What Lewis movie would be complete without the bubbly Kathleen Freeman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest Film Ever. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, in case everybody doesn't already know it, Jerry Lewis is a comedy legend. He paved the way for all the comedians today like the Jim Carrey's and every other comedian who "borrows" routines done by Jerry. I will never forget the first time I saw "The Nutty Professor" back in 1988. I thought it was (and this is a word I rarely use when describing films) brilliant. Two quick examples. For such a funny film it is remarkable how during the prom scene at the end of the film it turns completely serious and drives home the moral (if there is one) of the film, which is "You might as well like yourself". And the scene where he first appears as Buddy Love, when he walking down the street and you have not seen him yet, and the reactions of the people on the street (could they be looking at a monster?) that part is like I said, brilliant.I sincerely hope that Jerry Lewis receives the highest civilian honor (The Medal of Freedom) before he is gone because he deserves it for all he has done for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Jerry is much loved and appreciated. And rightly so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is remarkable and entertaining. It is part comedy, part science fiction and part social commentary. Jerry Lewis is brilliant. He plays three aspects of the same character - an over-intellectual introvert; a pushy and obnoxious extrovert; and a toddler. Lewis carries the movie. The story is endearing. It depicts a man struggling to be taken seriously, and the extremes he is willing to go to obtain happiness. Stella Stevens is wonderful as the female lead. She is perfect for the role of college student and confidante. Several scenes are hilarious, especially the one involving the meeting between Buddy Love and the bossy president of the college, played by Del Moore. The story is a take off on the Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde format, but with an amusing spin and an upbeat resolution. Jerry Lewis is both goofy and sharp. He also sings several songs, revealing an excellent singing voice. This is a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Nutty Movie!,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1963, Jerry Lewis co-wrote, directed, and starred in "The Nutty Professor." Fifty years later, the humor in this movie remains as fresh and as relevant as ever. Among the bonus features is an interview with Jerry, who explained his take on the "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" story. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote about the good and evil that exists in all people. Jerry's story split his main character's personality into, to quote him, "funny and not funny." Trust me, Jerry Lewis knows what's funny! Jerry also clarified that Buddy Love was an amalgam of all the rude, obnoxious people he's observed in his life. In no way was the Buddy Love character based on Dean Martin. Speaking of characters, Professor Julius Kelp is the quintessential nerd, brilliant in his understanding of chemistry, but clueless in relating to people. Stella Stevens as Stella Purdy is not only sexy and beautiful, she's not overshadowed in her scenes with Jerry, which is no easy task. Del Moore (1916-1970) is great as the frustrated Dean Mortimer Warfield. His scene reciting lines from Hamlet is hilarious. Kathleen Freeman (1919-2001) turns in another solid performance as the dean's secretary, Millie Lemmon. It's no wonder that she was in so many Jerry Lewis movies. Howard Morris (1919-2005) is perfect in his brief scenes as Julius' father Elmer Kelp. From the explosive opening, to the heartfelt conclusion, "The Nutty Professor" is a comedic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nutty Professor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only really found out that the popular Eddie Murphy film was a remake after reading the original version was featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so naturally I wanted to see it. Basically nerdy and unattractive chemistry scientist and teacher Professor Julius Kelp (Jerry Lewis, also directing and writing) has no social life and concentrates more on his lessons, and often chaotic personal experiments. After being bullied and humiliated by one of his students, he decides he needs to become more manly and learn to defend himself, and not long after doing this he gains attention from beautiful student Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens). Julius decides eventually to make a new serum in his lab in order to gain the confidence he needs, and after drinking it there is a momentary monster state, but then the real results happen. The next thing you see is the handsome, debonair and egotistical rebel Buddy Love (also Lewis), who is of course the Professor after drinking the potion, and he makes his move on Stella. She at first completely despises him, but his ability to get away with virtually anything just from his mouth she finds herself drawn to him, but after so much time he dashes off before the formula wears off. While Stella is confused wondering where this new man her life has disappeared, and almost transfixed thinking about him, Julius knows that this new persona he has created is arrogant, but he can't help enjoying the attention he gains. As the two personalities, there are the small moments where their opposite voices and mannerisms pop up to the confusion of others, and Stella is almost completely in love with Buddy who is making an impact with his musical talent and "charm". The prom comes into play and Buddy does his thing on stage, but before things go too far the formula effects fade away, and Julius comes back to confess all. In the end he has learnt a valuable lesson about accepting who he is and not trying to be someone he is not, Stella admits that she knew Buddy wasn't right for her and confesses feelings for him, and the formula looks like it could go out on the market because of the parents having it, but Julius and Stella decide to licence it and keep the money made. Also starring Del Moore as Dr. Hamius R. Warfield, Kathleen Freeman as Millie Lemmon, Elvia Allman as Edwina Kelp, Howard Morris as Elmer Kelp, Milton Frome as Dr. M. Sheppard Leevee and Buddy Lester as Bartender. Lewis is fantastic as both the buck-toothed loser with the high pitched nerdy voice and the cocky, self-loving and hilariously mouthy hipster, and Stevens is good as the lovely blonde girl stuck in the middle. Obviously there is a big part of me thinking I prefer the Eddie Murphy version, with all the motor-mouth and obesity jokes, but this original has some great highlights, the witty script, the fantastic use of colour, and its own brand of slapstick, an entertaining comedy. It was number 99 on 100 Year, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Lewis movies are often fun to watch but yet they aren't really the most consistent ones. That is also really the case with this movie. It's really entertaining and has some truly hilarious moments in it as well but it also has a weak story and some weak story-telling.The movie starts of so well and promising but it runs out of steam about half way through. The movie starts to drag at points and it also start to repeat itself. This is all really due to the story, which consists of one great premise but is lacking in true development or a compelling enough story, to keep you involved with its characters. Now days this movie wouldn't even work at all, not in the very least due to the fact that it's about a college professor falling for one of his students. It's also the reason why in the 1996 Eddie Murphy movie version of this movie they changed the love interest in a teacher as well, instead of a student.But despite all of the complaints I have about this movie, it was still one that I enjoyed watching throughout. Some of the comical moments are nothing short of great and as a whole the movie remains still a perfectly entertaining one. Jerry Lewis is really great but above all things also really convincing as two totally different persons within this movie; A very nerdy professor and a slick, smooth talking womanizer. Both characters are the complete opposite of each other and they don't even look the same, which not due to any make-up but simply due to Lewis' interpretation of the two characters. I also really liked Del Moore in his role, which was very entertaining as well.A movie that is great to watch for some laughs but one that is still very lacking at its story and story-telling department.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

This version doesn't hold a cup of tea to the Eddie Murphy one (man, talk about hilarious!) I found the Jerry Lewis version boring and not funny at all. Maybe because crude humor wasn't accepted at the time and things had to be toned down. And maybe because they didn't have the special effects technology like they do now.I don't remember much from this film. I remembered the special potion wearing off when Buddy Love was conversing with the girl. He simply jumps over the shrubs in embarrassment.

		<shortDescription>Dreadful. The beginning of the end for Jerry Lewis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the title character's alter ego, Buddy Love, this film shows the real-life demise of a great talent. What exactly happens to people when they reach the type of super stardom that Jerry Lewis attained by the time he made this film is a mystery. Is it the incessant hounding of the media for any tidbit of opinion? Is it the special treatment you receive from everyday strangers? Is it the red carpet lifestyle given gratis to those that need it least? Certainly huge piles of instant money and a golden rake has something to do with the loss of ones grip on reality. Regardless, the list is long and prestigious of those that have fallen from talented super-star to just another loud buffet marquee. The irony is they inevitably think their current work is actually eclipsing that of their earlier, Sting sans `The Police' comes to mind. The Nutty Professor is the point, in my opinion, where Jerry Lewis proverbially `jumps the shark' with his career. In the film, mild mannered college professor/geek Julius Kelp, played by Lewis so far over the top it is annoying (complete with mail order bad teeth), experiences a Jekyll and Hyde type transformation into alter ego, the swinging and suave Buddy Love, played with so much grease in his hair it appears to continue onto his face as well. Written and directed by Lewis, the project fails at every level he is involved, sometimes with unintentional comedic effect, such as how old and out of touch the college students are. Over all, the movie is very annoying. The script, when it makes any sense, is cliché and boring, the sight gags are dated and mostly sophomoric. The characters Lewis dreams up are unimaginative, but by far, the most painful aspect of this film is how much the monster, Buddy Love, resembles Lewis' actual latter day persona. It feels as if Lewis thinks deep down the audience does envy Buddy. Have you ever watched Lewis do a Larry King interview and thought, "what is he thinking? Doesn't he know he looks like a conceited ass?" He has a way of even making sucking on a mint look pompous. I found the entire experience of the Nutty Professor to be repulsive, and this is coming from a life long Martin and Lewis fan, as well as a fan on some of Lewis' solo work. The film would be a complete loss were it not for the very watchable Stella Stevens, inexplicably attracted to Buddy, the appearance of Les Brown and Band, and an over all cool feel that most films made in the early sixties possess. Out side of that, however, you may be better off watching Michael Jackson dangle young children from 5 star hotel windows. 3 out of 10 stars, entirely for Stevens and retro hipness.</fullReview>

I just cannot buy a cleaned up Jerry Lewis making people stop on the streets. I didn't really like the Eddie Murphy version either, but it was funnier in my mind. I did like seeing a small part by Henry Gibson pre-Laugh-in. I will not be seeing any other Jerry Lewis movies in the future, unless I move to France or something.I just can't believe some people think this is the funniest movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terribly Unfunny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Nutty Professor" is what you get when you cross Jerry Lewis as an actor and Jerry Lewis as a director: A mind-numbingly unfunny comedy that tries to be something it isn't. I think it's safe to say that the 1996 remake (or just a film with that shares the same name) is not only funnier, but also entertaining--and that's pretty sad, because the remake wasn't even that great.Jerry Lewis plays a crazy dork-of-a-scientist that creates a...er...creation that makes him "hunkier" and more hip. Feeling more self-confident than ever before, Lewis hits the streets in his new persona: Buddy Love. He (Buddy Love) then sparks relationships with women and becomes suave and vogue--until his new persona starts to ultimately take over and causes trouble.Jerry Lewis not only directs a boring film here, but a terribly pretentious one, too. How are we to care for a character in which there is no depth or emotional attraction? I couldn't care less about what happens to Lewis' character, nor those who come in contact with him. It seems Lewis thought that by setting up a few gags he could forget about character development and no one would notice. Perhaps, as a summer fun flick, you could get away with this, in a sense. But you know what you can't get away with? You can't get away with it when the film is not funny--the only thing Lewis relies on to carry his film is nonexistent. No matter how dull the character study was in Eddie Murphy's 1996 "The Nutty Professor," you have to admit it was at least kind of funny--I barely laughed at all in Jerry Lewis' take on the story. The script writing by Jerry Lewis and Bill Richmond is like colliding together a horribly unfunny blend of humor and a terribly boring, slow-paced plot. Jerry Lewis as the barsinger-type-hip guy was incredibly boring and lasted about ten minutes--way too long for something so unfunny.Jerry Lewis has put together an unfunny, boring, pretentious, unimaginative film that had inspiration but not enough charm to carry off the project the whole way.1.5/5 stars - John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy, as we all know, is subjective, but I defy anyone to point out one funny bit in this movie. I'd never seen it, but thought it would be fun for my 7-year-old son and, with JL revisionism run rampant, I was interested to see what all the fuss was about. So one Saturday night, we ordered a pizza and rented "Nutty Professor."We thought this movie would never end. I caught my son looking at me questioningly throughout, as if to say, "When does this start getting funny?" It was mindless, pointless and aimless. I suppose bits like the health spa scene might have brought a smile in 1963, but I found the picture overall to be unbearable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lewis has no talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slapstick is the most pathetic and sophemoric form of humor. Lewis is annoying and grating as both the suave buddy love and the nerdish...whatever his name was. I hate this movie, and the french are insane for liking this guy. I know this guy Matt Hoch who loves Lewis, and that is so funny, as he is the least talented performer of any era ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; Bad Of 'The Nutty Professor'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics consider this to be Jerry Lewis' best film. Not being a big Lewis fan, I can't comment on that, but it offers - at least in this day-and-age - a number of good and bad features.THE GOOD- This has a much nicer tone to it than the re-make, of course, (restrictions back then when this was released). The speech at the end of the movie by the professor (Lewis) was outstanding: touching with some profound statements. Some earlier comic bits were funny, beginning with Lewis in the Dean's office. Perhaps the best humor was simply provided by Lewis making faces when he played the nerdy science prof. His other character is not appealing, but it's not supposed to be. However, I got tired a seeing a cigarette dangling out of his mouth. (This was supposed to be a takeoff on Dean Martin). Stella Stevens was a pretty woman, except for the excessive eye makeup that was the style of the '60s. Some of the dated expressions in here were funny to hear.THE BAD - A number of Lewis' bits were not that humorous and his singing was atrocious. Why almost all entertainers - comedians, actors, etc - back then thought they were also good singers, is beyond me. You can just fast-forward through Jerry's songs.SUMMARY - If you are younger and-or watched the Eddie Murphy re-make first, you'll be disappointed in this.</fullReview>
