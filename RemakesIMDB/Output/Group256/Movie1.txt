		<fullReview>You just can't get away with this stuff anymore. In the first ten minutes, Burt Reynolds has beaten his girlfriend, stolen her car, gone on a massive police chase, dumped the sportscar off a bridge, then attacked two cops. Oh, and he's the hero of the movie, too.Nowadays the remake -- starring Adam Sandler -- is rated PG-13 and he's a total wimp. Back in the '70s you could get away with being vicious, sexist, homophobic and racist and live to tell about it. In 2005, Adam Sandler says the F-word in one of his movies and parents are banning the film companies.Yup, this film is clearly racist, homophobic and misogynist. Women are treated as sexual objects throughout, from the opening to the part where a prison warden's intern requests sexual favors from Burt Reynolds in return for handing him a movie-reel he needs.African-Americans are portrayed as racist tough guys who are better than the whites at football, and they call whiteys "honkies" and other such words. In return all the whites are racist towards the blacks and it creates an interesting tension.The homophobia sneaks into play when it's suggested one of the inmates is in love with Burt Reynolds. Quite a funny scene, actually."The Longest Yard" was one of Robert Aldrich's most successful films and many claimed it was him "selling out," but viewed 30 years later this really does stand apart from many of the other sports-comedy films of the decade. What is so special about "The Longest Yard" is probably that it plays like a mix between "Cool Hand Luke," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Smokey and the Bandit" -- it's got car chases, it's got sports, it's got funny stuff, BUT it also spends a lot of time developing its characters and creating some very dramatic sequences.This is well directed, gritty, and fun -- not as much a "comedy" as you might expect, it is actually more serious. By the end of the film we've come to root for a bunch of murderers and rapists and even Burt Reynolds, and let's face it -- when was the last time you saw Burt Reynolds in a movie and actually LIKED his character?! A classic of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burt Reynolds plays Paul Crewe, a reprehensible character discovering, in a prison, dignity and esteem? You see him, at the beginning of the movie?as a rising star?beating up a woman, stealing her car, drunken driving, insulting cops in a bar, resisting arrest? He's seen so funny when he insulted the miniature cop who's about to arrest him, while the cop's partner is laughing openly? Eddie Albert was very charming when he meets Paul Crewe at his arrival to Citrus State Prison? Aldrich wanted to play Warden Hazen as the guy who had the veneer of normalcy, the veneer of being a good executive, the veneer of keeping it all together till it starts unraveling? He really was just a despicable, oily, warden type? In one game scene, we see him over and over again, getting up just with that same look of shock on his face? Ed Lauter (Captain Knauer) is wonderful? He runs the football team? He is a bad guy and he represents everything that is wrong with that prison system and everything else? He changes as a result? And to see that is just so delightful? He's got the classic Ed Lauter's scene at the end? James Hampton plays Caretaker, the character who brings the team all together and pushes Burt's character ahead to win the game? Ray Nitschke plays the toughest, meanest linebacker in football? Richard Kiel, Bob Tessier, Charles Tyner, Michael Conrad, and Harry Caesar give the film a certain veracity, you almost thing you are in jail?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real men; no schtick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Longest Yard" does not depend on the tiresome innocent-man-behind-bars schtick to evoke the inmates' humanity. Crew, Caretaker, et al are not men because they have been falsely accused, but because they maintain their manhood under conditions of mental and physical cruelty. Their humanity isn't a plot or script convention, but the core of their character. It's refreshing to discover that you're cheering for criminals despite their unapologetic bravado. IMHO, the best "prison" film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this flick again last year after I don't know how long, at first I wondered why I used to really like this film. But after watching the whole thing to the end, I remember why. This is one of those films that generated a whole bunch of "copy-cat" movies, none which are even worth remembering (or seeing). Sure, it's a macho-man movie, but it works, and to see the talent (both actors and ex-pro ball players) on the screen, this is a movie you can watch over and over. By the way, it was refreshing to see the widescreen DVD version which was just released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Football and prison is a recipe for brutal mirth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disgraced former pro football quarterback Paul Crewe is sent to prison after a drunken night to remember. The prison is run by Warden Hazen, a football nut who spies an opportunity to utilise Crewe's ability at the sport to enhance the prison guards team skills. After initially declining to help, Crewe is swayed into putting together a team of convicts to take on the guards in a one off match, thieves, murderers and psychopaths collectively come together to literally, beat the guards, but Crewe also has his own personal demons to exorcise.This violent, but wonderfully funny film has many things going for it. Directed with style by the gifted hands of Robert Aldrich, The Longest Yard cheekily examines the harshness of gridiron and fuses it with the brutality of the penal system. The script from Tracy Keenan Wynn is a sharp as a tack and Aldrich's use of split screens and slow motion sequences bring it all together very nicely indeed. I would also like to comment on the editing from Michael Luciano, nominated for the Oscar in that department, it didn't win, but in my honest opinion it's one of the best edited pictures from the 70s.Taking the lead role of Crewe is Burt Reynolds, here he is at the peak of his powers (perhaps never better) and has star appeal positively bristling from every hair on his rugged chest. It's a great performance, believable in the action sequences (he was once a halfback for Florida), and crucially having the comic ability to make Wynn's script deliver the necessary mirth quota. What is of most interest to me is that Crewe is a less than honourable guy, the first 15 minutes of the film gives us all we need to know about his make up, but much like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest the following year, The Longest Yard has us rooting for the main protagonist entering the home straight, and that is something of a testament to Reynolds' charm and charisma.The film's crowning glory is the football game itself, taking up three parts of an hour, the highest compliment I can give it is to say that one doesn't need to be a fan of the sport to enjoy this final third. It's highly engaging as a comedy piece whilst also being octane inventive as an action junkie's series of events. A number of former gridiron stars fill out both sides of the teams to instill a high believability factor into the match itself, and the ending is a pure rewarding punch the air piece of cinema. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the greatest football film ever... period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burt Reynolds plays Paul Crewe a real man's man. After showing his woman who's boss, he splits in her car and after a great chase scene, the police find him in a bar. So the ex-football player is sent to prison, where the warden offers to shave off some time if he makes a team of the convicts to fight (and lose to) the guards' semi-pro team in a pre-season game. Every part of the movie screams greatness. From the excellent acting all around, to the superb casting (Adam Sandler can't hold a candle to Burt in this movie, that remake is gonna be horrid) Ed Lauter is a great heavy , to the great tension-filled football game that comprises a good deal of the latter half of the movie. This is one of the exceedingly too few MAN's movie and they sadly don't make them like this anymore.My Grade: A DVD Extras: Commentary by Burt Reynolds and Writer Albert Ruddy (Among the best I've heard); 11 minute "Doing time on the Longest Yard" featurette; 11 minute "Unleashing the Mean Machine" retrospective; an exclusive look at the re-make (looking absolute crap); Theatrical Trailer;Trailers for "The Longest Yard" remake, "Coach Carter", "Macgyver: Season 1", and "Tommy Boy" Eye Candy: Anita Ford in a red see-thru number</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Gotta Be A Football Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Longest Yard refers not to the territory gained and lost in a football game. For Burt Reynolds its that prison yard that he's in for the next 18 months. Reynolds isn't one of the noblest athletes ever to grace the National Football League. He was a quarterback who was thrown out of the game in a point shaving scandal. Now he's doing time for stealing his mistress's Maserati and causing a lot of havoc and mayhem when she called the cops on him.The Longest Yard starts to look a little like From Here To Eternity where Monty Clift's company captain Philip Ober wants him to box for the post championship. Reynolds really isn't interested in playing football any more or helping warden Eddie Albert out with his semi-pro team of prison guards. But he's got less redress than Clift did in the army and Reynolds is not a person to make too fine a point of resistance.What Reynolds suggests is a tune-up game with a squad of the inmates to play the guards to keep them in a fighting edge. Sounds real good to Albert who has a mean streak in him that Reynolds is slow to realize. There's a lot of possibilities to inflict some legal pain and for him to reassert his authority.The Longest Yard is first and foremost about what Reynolds will do when the crisis comes. His track record doesn't suggest any heroics, but some people do surprise you.The antagonists Reynolds and Albert are given good support by director Robert Aldrich's picked cast. Foremost among them are Ed Lauter as the chief guard, James Hampton as the team manager, and Charles Tyner in a particularly loathsome role as a prison stoolie. He will really make your skin crawl.Bernadette Peters is also in The Longest Yard as Albert's secretary with the delightful name of Miss Toot who takes advantage of her position with a little sexual harassment of the prisoners. I do love that Dickensian name that was given her for this film. The only other female of note is Anitra Ford who is Reynolds mistress and whose Maserati he appropriates. When Burt says he earned that Maserati you can well believe it.The Longest Yard is in a class by itself, a sports/prison movie. A film that created it's own genre. That has to count for something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disgraced ex-pro football player Burt Reynolds is sent to prison after dumping his lover's car in the drink and assaulting two police officers; once behind bars, the oily warden coerces him into turning the other inmates into football players to compete with the guards in a game. Great story for a funny farce, but "The Longest Yard" isn't all cartoonish fun, it has some dimensions, and director Robert Aldrich is easy on the transitions in tone. The inmates look a bit long-in-the-tooth to be playing an extended, crushing game on the gridiron, but Reynolds' comic double-takes are very amusing, and the supporting cast is full of colorful characters, particularly James Hampton as Caretaker, Michael Conrad as Scarboro and Bernadette Peters as a secretary (whose beehive is a punchline all on its own). There's too much emphasis on what a jerk warden Eddie Albert is, and too many shots of him looking aghast, and Ed Lauter's menacing act as the chief guard is tiresome, but the movie is surprisingly low-keyed and looks convincing. The split-screen visuals once the game gets going are fantastic, showing Aldrich's keen eye in capturing different behavior, although the game itself seems to go on forever--these players would be passed out from sheer exhaustion--and the warden's threats still hang in the air, unresolved. *** from ****</fullReview>

It's been a good dozen years since I last saw it and it's amazing how much of the movie I was familiar with -- about every scene. Prison movie, football movie, Burt Reynolds movie, even has a pretty good car chase! This is without a doubt a man's movie. Is that sexist? I don't want to be but it really is. I am not saying women can't watch it and enjoy it just as much as their male counterparts, but this is what being a man is all about! Don't give me no Pretty Woman or Steel Magnolias on a Sunday afternoon, give me football, hard hitting American football! Thank you director Robert Aldrich and thank you Burt for this fun and well acted 70's classic!--A Kat Pirate Screener</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one were to look at a Burt Reynolds film resume from over the years, he would have to look long and hard to find many gems. In comparison to some of his films such as Smokey And The Bandit II, Cannonball Run, and Stroker Ace for example, The Longest Yard is not only a gem, it's the Hope Diamond. Reynolds plays down on his luck, ex-NFL quarterback Paul Crewe. Seems he was kicked out of football for shaving points in the game, and is now relegated to servicing his rich girl friend. One afternoon, when the girlfriend makes the mistake of interrupting his football viewing, Crewe steals her Maserati and drives it into the nearby bay. After a quick car chase and a funny scene when Crewe is arrested in a bar, he is sent off to prison. As it turns out it is just not any ordinary prison. It seems Warden Hazen (Eddie Albert)hires the guards on their ability to play football. It also seems Hazen has arranged for Crewe to be sent to his particular prison so that Crewe can organize a football team of the inmates, quarterback them, and play a game against the guards. A totally preposterous plot it is, but that's part of what makes this film so enjoyable. The Longest Yard works so well is not because the acting is Academy Award stuff, it's because Producer Albert Ruddy and Director Robert Aldrich seemed to have found the perfect cast for the roles they inhabit. Having played football in college, Reynolds fits the role of quarterback Crewe perfectly. Eddie Albert as sleazy Warden Hazen, will make you forget about that thing he did called Green Acres. James Hampton, who has floundered around in Hollywood as a character actor, has his best role ever as Caretaker. Crewe makes Caretaker his manager because it seems he has a knack for obtaining certain contraband that would otherwise be out of Crewe's clutches. Some of the items he acquires are not only funny, but there's also a certain service Crewe has to perform to get some of them. I'll not tell you what it is but leave it to you to see the film. Michael Conrad, who plays aging ex-football player Nate Scarboro, also joins in the fun when he agrees to help coach Crewe's team on the slim chance that the inmates might pull an upset. Let's just say some of his coaching ideas are unique, as our many of the coaching ideas in this film. That's OK because it only serves to add to the fun.Harry Caesar as Granville, the first black player to join the team, shows there are more than enough reasons for him to play football. It takes Granville being humiliated by the guards trying to discourage him from playing before the other black inmates join in the fun. In the scene where the guards are demeaning him, he doesn't get rattled, yet we can sense his rage beneath the surface. There's also Pop(John Steadman)who has been lingering in prison for a few extra years because he once punched a certain guard who became a Warden. He becomes the team's trainer, and has one brief but memorable moment with Crewe during the football game.What most people remember about The Longest Yard is the big game, but everything leading up to it is just as enjoyable. There is the favor that Crewe has to do for the Warden's secretary (Bernadette Peters with the strangest hair do I've ever seen). The scenes where Crewe is recruiting the inmates are classic, especially when he interviews a couple of inmates named Samson(Richard Kiel), Shokner (Robert Tessier) and Indian (Sonny Sixkiller). When the team begins practicing, how they go from being really really bad to fairly decent is as entertaining as the rest of the film.As for the football game itself, it is undoubtedly one of the most hilarious sporting events of any kind to be put on the big screen. Aldrich takes each moment of the game and makes it count. If you have never seen the film, it'll have you rolling on the floor. If you have seen it as I have many times, just thinking about it will bring a smile of recollection to your face. You'll see things in this game you'll never get the chance to witness on Monday night football.If there are any missteps in this film, they are minor. One is a detestable slimy inmate named Unger (Charles Tyner) is introduced into the story when it is not necessary. He is here only as a plot device to do two things, the first is to carry out a despicable act, and the second is because of Unger, Crewe is forced into a bad decision late in the film. It would have been easily to find a way to do this without introducing Unger into an otherwise enjoyable film. Despite that, there is no doubt that you'll enjoy The Longest Yard, even if you don't like football. Aldrich, Ruddy, and Reynolds have scored a touchdown and a two point conversion. When you score like that you get my coaching grade, and for The Longest Yard it's an A-. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tongue and Cheek satire and sports movies generally are not exactly two movies genres that you combine together, however Burt Reynolds did not believe that, and as a result he starred in a movie that manages to be funny, poignant, intense, and everything in-between. I really don't know how the writers, producers and directors came up with something that turned out to be so awesome. The Longest Yard is masterful, it is funny, but it isn't a comedy, there is a lot of football but it is more than a just a sports movie, this is a hard movie to classify and maybe that is the reason it is so good.Burt Reynolds plays a washed up football player who winds up in the slammer for drunk driving. While there the warden asks him to put together a football team to go up against the prison guards, who play in a semi-professional league. The prisoners are an interesting group of misfits and criminals, played perfectly by the various character actors in the parts. Burt Reynolds manages to be a brilliant lead of all of these crazy cons, and is perfect in this part. This movie is great but it doesn't exactly scream out greatness at first. This is a movie where you will be half way through and you will realize this is just a great movie to watch.Aside from the fact it is just an off-beat movie it is hard to understand why this movie is so good, I don't know why myself, the jokes are not really laugh out loud hysterical, but it becomes apparent the reason this movie is so good is because it really ventured into areas that few films had, and while there are references to racial problems, homosexuality, although very muted, prison violence, crooked law enforcement officials and other issues rarely discussed on screen.What I am surprised at is that these issues become prominent, and something you heed in the movie, and at the same time the over the top satire merges with this movie perfectly. Even watching a movie like this as compared to other comedies that raise marginally controversial issues like racism, such as Police Academy, Police Academy sort of makes a comedy out of racism and sexism, and to a lesser degree a movie like Caddyshack, but this movie puts the comedy and the controversial issues together, not making them one, but two completely different facets of the movie. Normally when you have a movie that is as intense as this it is hard to have such satirical elements in a movie and be a good movie, but this movie combines the two elements so effortlessly.This is definitely an underdog movie, in that the prisoners are supposed to lose, they are a bunch of cons that rarely if ever played football, and have no chance going up against a semi-professional team. The characters, too numerous to name make this movie that much better. The movie also is a prison movie, and is successful at that, this is one of those movies, everything just clicked right, and the result is near perfection. One reason to watch this movie is Eddie Albert, as the ever smiling and smugly pleasant prison warden who is the mastermind of the entire affair, he is just perfect here, so meticulously uttering every word to the point that he looks like he is in pain, and he is perfect in the role. James Hampton also has an excellent part as Reynolds' sidekick in prison. This is just an all around great movie excellent in so many different ways.I watch a movie like this, and I wonder why there are so few movies like this today, movies so offbeat but funny, movies that actually have decent acting, movies that are this interesting, instead of typical silly fare you would get like a dumb teen movie or a dumb action movie. This movie is priceless in a way. When I first heard of the movie I didn't think it would be that good, but when I watched it I realized why it was Oscar nominated and so well thought of. I don't know why it clicked, but it did, and the result is a film definitely worth seeing, and one of the best of the 1970s.</fullReview>

Those poor sweet prisoners, being taken advantage of by those sadistic guards. Then there's the warden, Mr. Douglas from Green Acres, Eddie Albert. Rotten to the core. Bert Reynolds is his mugging best, first selling out, then winning one for the Gipper. It is violent, raucous, ridiculous from the stolen uniforms to the cross dressing cheerleaders. I am a non violent person, I knew everything was designed to work over my prejudices and my primitive feelings of revenge. And yet, when the game started, I was transfixed. I don't get it.

		<shortDescription>when Burt was a star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burt Reynolds was one of the biggest stars of the '70s, but like a lot of '70s stars (Faye Dunaway, Michael Serrizan, Karen Black, etc.) other decades have not been so kind to him. Here he stars in one of his finest films, "The Longest Yard," made in 1974, directed by Robert Aldrich, and also starring Eddie Albert, Michael Conrad, Ed Lauter, James Hampton, and Bernadette Peters.Reynolds plays Paul Crewe, a football player who goes to prison after he hits his ex-girlfriend, steals her car, and runs it into the river. He's a football player with a scandal in his past, when he was suspected of shaving points off of a game.The sadistic warden (Eddie Albert) wants him to organize a football team for the prisoners so that they can play the guards. The real agenda is that on the football field, the guards will be able to practically beat the prisoners senseless. With the help of Caretaker (James Hampton), Paul chooses a football team and starts training them. On the day of the big game, he gets an offer that he should refuse but might not be able to.This is a really fine film. I wouldn't call it a comedy, but it's one of those movies where you wind up rooting for the bad guys. Reynolds' character learns self-esteem, pride in his work, and also a sense of camaraderie. The football game itself is very exciting."The Longest Yard" is a film that holds up well, and not the usual type of prison movie you'd see today. And Bernadette Peters' hairdo is a no-miss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good prison drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is admittedly manipulative and quite violent, and being filled to the brim with references to The Dirty Dozen and the corrupt regime of President Nixon, it can be a little heavy-handed. These aside though, it is very well made with crisp cinematography and an imposing building for the prison, and the comedy is boisterous and comes by thick and fast, and it is pretty hard to beat with this on showing loyalty, dignity and liberty. Robert Aldrich directs with panache, the music is very good, the story is gripping, the script is sharp and the acting is excellent. Burt Reynolds exudes star quality as the imprisoned football professional who is forced to organise a team of convicts against their own guards, and it was nice to see Bernadette Peters as the Warden's secretary. But it is Eddie Albert who steals the acting honours as the sadistic warden. Overall, a very good prison drama, and definitely recommended. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The warden of this spectacularly clean correctional facility is Eddie Albert. His corrections officers are a semi-pro football team. Now, before I continue, I want to mention that I am so little a follower of football that I don't know what a semi-pro team is. Baseball -- that's the game for me. And the team? The St. Louis Browns.Anyhow, Eddie Albert is a mean mother, although peanuts compared to Strother Martin in "Cool Hand Luke." He wants one of his inmates, Burt Reynolds, to put together a football team out of that motley cohort with the intention of having the guards' team clobber them on the field in front of thousands of people.Eddie Albert's team of correctional officers loses. With the help of some very savvy (and extraordinarily big) experienced inmates, Burt puts together a team that knows everything, from how to play cleverly to how to play dirty.We've seen it all before. The sports story about the despised subordinates who develop enough spirit to apply themselves and win. I can think of "The Bad News Bears" and "Victory" offhand. But nobody cares, not even Robert Aldrich, the director. It's designed to be fun.I've always admired Burt Reynolds as a person. He's strikingly handsome, athletic and fit, doesn't take himself or his profession seriously, and is without guile or pretense.That's part of the problem with his movies. He seems to glide through them being himself, with the notable exception of "Deliverance", into which he put a good deal of effort. He worked hard on his own movie, "Sharkey's Machine" too, but the level of subtlety there was about what it is here, which is to say, not very much. Reynolds is his usual affable part-Italian, part-Cherokee self. His lines are thrown away. The humor -- hell, all the testosterone-driven values in the movie, dramatic as well as comic, don't rise above the level of drive-in movie fare. It just looks more expensive.Well, I'll give an example. Before the game, the inmates are dispirited because their beloved manager was murdered. The head honcho of the corrections officer's team enters their room, snarls, "See you on the field," and then butts his shaved head through the wall. In case you didn't find that meanly amusing enough, he punches his fist through it too and leaves without another word.And yet it must have found a sizable enough audience. A remake appeared some years ago. In any case, others might find this more enjoyable than I did. I didn't find it so bad as to be insulting. It just didn't strike me as very interesting or particularly well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the biggest (if not THE biggest) box office stars of the 70's, Burt Reynolds, was well cast in 1974's "The Longest Yard". A former college football player at Florida State University, Reynolds plays Paul Crewe, a former pro quarterback who has disgraced himself by throwing games. He lands himself in prison after slapping his girlfriend around, stealing her car and assaulting two cops. The prison, Citrus State, has a semi-pro football team comprised of the institution's guards and is run by the power hungry warden Rudolph Hazen (Eddie Albert). At Hazen's behest and to make his prison term as peaceful as possible, Crewe agrees to assemble a team of fellow cons to give the guards a scrimmage. This of course sets up the final third of the film."The Longest Yard" is entertaining through and through; there is not one sequence in the movie which drags on. The interplay between Reynolds and his collection of convicts is a riot. Fine support is given by character actors Michael Conrad, Harry Caesar, Richard Kiel and Robert Tessier as cons. Real life NFL stars Ray Nitschke and Joe Kapp, representing the guardsmen, lend authenticity to the live football action. Ed Lauter (Capt. Wilhelm Knauer), the leader and quarterback of the guards, provides an excellent counter to Reynolds character.If there is a disturbing element to the film, it is the knowledge that one watches this movie rooting for the convicts- the worst society has to offer. This is effectively off set by depicting them humanely while showing the guards as racist and demeaning. The stereotypical southern prison suggests some of these cons (especially the minorities) were more than likely railroaded or at the very least given harsher sentences than they deserved.This movie was typical of the times for its gritty and impoliticly correct themes- a breath of fresh air compared to today's ultra sensitive society. And the recent remake, as usual in these instances, doesn't compare to the wit and fun of its predecessor; Adam Sandler couldn't hold Burt Reynolds' jock as an entertainer. One of my favorites!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Prison Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Longest Yard was an extremely well put together movie about prison and football all at the same time. I thought that this would be an all sport styled movie basing on the game of football, but it was more than all of that. It had the drama/comedy/sport genres all tied into one definitive movie. Burt Reynolds did fairly well for this kind of movie, as you normally see him doing Smokey and the Bandit movies which base around a huge car chase throughout the entire movie. So with this step up he really gives an all out entertaining performance as Paul Crewe and the characters really make the movie in a special way.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing as this year this movie will have it's 33rd birthday, it has had a great legacy. I saw the remake with Adam Sandler, and that made me want to see this version. I didn't expect to like this, as I've had pretty bad encounters with movies made from 1980 or earlier.But...I did like this. For a movie that's 33 years old, it's long and has a touching story. Burt Reynolds was great as the hero.It is long. I'm not calling it a bad thing, though. This story is really too great to only be told in 90 minutes. Over 2 hours is a long time for someone with no attention span, but I can stay for a long time.If you can stay in your seat for 120 minutes and like these movies, rent or (I strongly suggest to) buy The Longest Yard. It has a great legacy, and it isn't about to die yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Flew Over the Goal Post.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ex-football star quarterback Burt Reynolds is now a convict in a prison run by sadistic warden Eddie Albert. Albert persuades Reynolds to put together a team of fellow inmates (all misfits of course) to play against his team of prison guards. Naturally Albert wants the game fixed so his group will win and a dilemma forms for Reynolds as he has the possibility of an early release, but he will have to turn on his newfound friends. Interesting comedy of the 1970s that has a razor sharp edge to it. Reynolds and Albert have a sparring match of wits throughout and the supporters are all right on target. The big finale takes up nearly half of the movie as the big game becomes almost interminable in the end. Cameos by real NFL players abound as well in this touchdown maker. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was filmed at the Reidsville Penitentiary in Reidsville, Georgia. The prison is located in Tatnall County in South Georgia. A portion of the movie was filmed on my property which consisted of approximately 1500 acres of land adjacent to the prison property. I was present for much of the filming and enjoyed the experience. The movie is memorable and Burt Reynolds was in his prime. You will no doubt recognize a number of stars in the movie, such as Eddie Albert, Michael Conrad, Ed Lauter, and many many others. Enjoy the movie as it truly demonstrates the mentality of certain of the officials that existed in that day and time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, it is a load of fun. No prison movie I can think of is so removed from the experience of a prison, even as one experiences it, an oxymoron. We are exposed to a warden, Rudolph Hazen (Eddie Albert), who becomes increasingly contemptible, ultimately even more so than the guards (that is not always the case). This distinction also reflects a reversal (somewhat) of the passions felt earlier in the movie. But it's best to have the focus, the villain, at the top, isn't it? OK, "The Longest Yard" is not really a prison movie, sort of like Florida, in which this film is set, is said not to be a Southern state. The concept of the film provides the crescendo, the climax, which we look for but do not always get in a prison movie or other movies, and also takes us out of the prison.Burt Reynolds plays an ex-football star (Paul Crewe) who has wound up in a Florida penitentiary, and who leads the inmates in opposing the guards in a tuneup game requested by Hazen, in pursuit of the goal of a semipro championship. The championship has eluded the guards in the past, and Hazen wants it even more than the guards themselves. Crewe is in prison for reasons other than the fact that he had previously thrown football games. Nevertheless, that theme re-emerges between Hazen and Crewe, portrayed excellently by Reynolds and Albert, who are joined by, besides ordinary actors, football greats Ray Nitschke (guards), Joe Kapp (guards), and Sonny Sixkiller (inmates). There are some intense and nasty prison scenes, but the pigskin is the thing.Well, OK, "The Longest Yard" is also different from other prison movies because of the presence of much humor, focusing on Crewe himself, Crewe's love interests (more interesting out of prison than [Bernadette Peters] in), and various inmates, such as George Samson (played by Richard Kiel, of Jaws renown) and Connie Shokner (Robert Tessser). The film gets you to cheer for the "murderers and rapists," of course, as we are told, "these people never had nothing, Crewe, you had it all.." Indeed, the script is very effective in galvanizing us to favor the prisoners as the events transpire (bonding by leadership; the prisoners are black and white, of course, and the guards all-white, natch). Hazen, meanwhile, is a sadistically cruel cheat, and this is one of many reasons viewers do not feel cheated at the film's finale, which is as good as it can possibly be. An All-American and macho movie, yes, but it should be enjoyable by all.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Young people can learn a great deal from a skillfully played football game."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I saw this film back in the Seventies I manage to recall it with particular fondness. There's something about Burt Reynolds' character as the flawed underdog hero that makes you want to root for him along with his band of merry misfit convicts. For even though they're all incarcerated for various crimes against humanity, they appear to be more sympathetic than the brutal guards who play for semi-pro glory under Warden Hazen (Eddie Albert). I remember thinking that Albert was miscast when I first saw this, calling to mind his Green Acres TV character, but I have to say, he really gets into his role here and is particularly effective as a villain.The film makes effective use of a variety of real life pro football players, guys like Ray Nitschke (Bogdanski), Sonny Sixkiller (The Indian) and Ernie Wheelwright (Spooner), thereby lending some additional authenticity to the game scenes. I know there's already been a 2005 remake starring Adam Sandler, but wouldn't it be something if they made another picture using the Cincinnatti Bengals as the all-prison team? You can't get any more real than that.What I think I enjoyed the most about the film was the integrity shown by characters like old Pop (John Steadman) and Granville (Harry Caesar), and eventually even Paul Crewe (Reynolds) himself. You can't help but think of them as honorable men even if they made mistakes in their life that wound them up in prison. There's also the humor in bits like the swamp reclamation scene, the 'broke his 'f...ing neck' scene, and the Bogdanski ball-breaker sequence.I'm not one for repeated viewings of the same flick but I've seen this one a few times over the years and I still get a kick out of it. I guess it helps that I like Burt Reynolds, but there's something about the picture itself that makes it memorable as well as entertaining. I like the idea of the underdog getting his revenge against The Man and sticking it in his trophy case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 70s standout and Burt Reynolds' most impressive film performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE LONGEST YARD (1974) is one of my favorite movies from the 1970s. On the surface, it's a by-the-numbers pre-Rocky underdog lighthearted comic tale of an eclectic mix of rural prison inmates, who band together to form a decent football team to challenge the semi-pro prison guard team. But it has a lot more going for it underneath as well. The movie has several running themes: morality, racism, inhumanity, camaraderie and does it with such ease and aplomb that puts to shame most so-called "better", "more serious" movies that hit these topics head on. These ideas fit like a glove within the plot and story of this timeless film.Burt Reynolds (in his greatest performance) stars as disgraced former pro quarterback Paul Crewe, who was banned from the sport for point-shaving. Crewe gets into an altercation with his girlfriend, steals her car, then she has him arrested. He is sentenced to 18 months in a rural chain gang prison. Crewe just wants to do his time peacefully so he can move on. But the martinet prison Warden Hazen (the esteemed Eddie Albert in his greatest film role) forces Crewe to put together the inmate football team (called the "Mean Machine") to take on the guards to showcase the talents of his semi-pro team, but also to demean Crewe and his fellow inmates.Reynolds and Albert are so smashingly good in their protagonist-antagonist roles that they were both worthy of Oscar noms. Their final confrontation is one for the ages.The superb supporting cast includes Ed Lauter (as hard-nosed head prison guard Capt Knauer), Michael Conrad (as former footballer Nate Scarboro, who had a shortened career due to a bum knee), James Hampton (effortless as Crewe's sidekick and team organizer Caretaker), and Harry Caesar (as hard-working, dignified, and athletically gifted Granville).Directed by Robert Aldrich, THE LONGEST YARD is one of the rare "man's man" films out there. But it doesn't come across as a cliché, chest-pumping exercise in testosterone, mainly because the characters aren't one-dimensional. Each key character is given enough detail to humanize them to the viewer. The big football game is one of the most realistic ever filmed, interspersing realistic, long-view shots of the game action with sideline scenes. No surprise that Reynolds looks so convincing on the field as he was a football player in real life before turning to acting. Both the football ending and the actual movie ending are among my favorites of any movie ever...A classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having experienced the many Burt Reynold's road flicks throughout the mid/late seventies and early eighties you'd expect him to, in the very beginning as he's being chased by cops in a stolen hotrod, to get away and avoid all punishment. Nothing doing.Burt, playing a has-been football star, is sent to a backwards Florida work-camp where he's called upon by a power hungry warden (Eddie Albert) to start a team of convicts: who end up challenging the prison guard semi-pro outfit with a start-up game. Before that we experience the ragtag cons, ranging from giant Richard Keil to killer Bob Tessier to Reynolds himself as quarterback, improving their chops until the big game, consisting of Altman/M*A*S*H like split-screens showing all the action and then some.The best scenes involve Reynolds and manager James Hampton interviewing each brute as possible team members; or scenes before the plot's underway as Reynolds survives the swampy chain-gang. But things never get too intense as the entire film - despite some seriousness and creepiness (thanks to prison rat Charles Tyner) - remains with a wink, grin, and signature chortle: a template of Burt's work to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulative, But Brainless Fun For 2 Hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, a brainless-but-lots of fun flick and very fast-moving one, typically sleazy (er, "gritty," as critics preferred to call them) movie of its decade.In the 1970s, who better than make a thug into a lovable, good guy we all want to root for than Burt Reynolds? Box-office-wise, Burt was the hottest thing going in the '70s and playing a lawbreaker seemed to be tailor-made for him, from "Smokey And The Bandit" on down the line.The shock in this movie was seeing nice-guy Eddie Albert play the mean warden, but he pulled it off convincingly. Most of the characters in this movie are over-the-top, but that was the idea.This movie manipulates all of us to root for the prisoners in the big football games against the prison guards. In essence, that's the story in this film: a big football game played between prison inmates and the guards. Along the way, Burt gives us his normal glib-but-entertaining wisecracks and personality and we get some wild characters to go with him, such as the very likable "Caretaker" (James Hampton).Burt is macho enough, as the quarterback here, for the guys to respect him, and still be a ladies' favorite. I can't say the same for Richard Kiel, but "Jaws" (as became later in a James Bond movie), was always fun to watch. Some real-life pro goons, like Green Bay's Ray Nitchke, join the cast for some gridiron realism.In the end, its a clichéd, but fun two hours of escapism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aldrich's film could go all the waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy...............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film of this nature typically would start with me saying, "I hate sports films", but those words will not escape me this time. I still feel the same about sports films, but in this instance, Reynolds coupled with James Hampton (giving the best performance of Caretaker), and the sinister Captain Knauer (played by Ed Lauter) just meshed extremely well that even the most pessimistic of sports cinema viewers can enjoy this golden nugget from a creative era of film. I liked the confident Reynolds that had already come to grips with his inner-demons that nothing seemed to matter to him in his main life, so going to prison helped him find himself. I loved this dynamic because in most films it is the polar opposite. Getting out of prison means you discover yourself, not the other way. Also, I never felt trapped. This is tough to do with a prison film because the walls are constantly reminding you where you are, but in fact, Aldrich and his cast brought the prison to life, giving it a character all of its own. Reynolds was perfect for this role. He embodied the lightness of the scenes, while bringing a professional level of acting to the role. He was funny, but not juvenile funny, but sophisticated funny. He controlled his scenes, giving those around him a chance to create moments of their own. Not to go too off topic, but Sandler made his version a "Sandler movie", while with the original ? it was obviously an ensemble piece. Everyone fell into their roles with ease, such as Eddie Albert as Warden Hazen, who demonstrated a level of power while revealing his weaknesses. He was evil, but didn't need the slicked hair or looming lights. We knew what he could do, what he had done, and what he was willing to do to win. The final scene will didn't need music to intensify, Albert brought it all himself. The same, as stated before, can be said for Lauter who embodies evil with Knauer. Without drooling too heavily on myself, everyone was phenomenal in this film ? the actors were assembled with a delicate stick which allowed each to build this cult film.When sports films take 47 minutes for the game itself, one worries that character development goes to the wayside. This is not the case here. Robert Aldrich gives us plenty of moments of fresh air prior to the epic football game to build up to the sad moments and the climactic moments. It is pure cane-sugar watching him take us from character to character, giving us just small inch after small inch, until the final moments. See ? I am drooling quite a bit. Absolutely, there were some dull moments to this film ? the game was lengthy, but without complaining I would say that it was essential to the story. While I loved the the major players, when it came to the game, I did get lost on whom was whom during the heated battle. Maybe it was just me, but I needed stronger characters during the game. I wanted to make sure that I could identify who was who by some characteristic ? but I think this was just because of the time difference. Sandler's version you knew who was who because it was modern players ? my knowledge of sports is weak, so I had trouble following the big names in the game. That isn't to say that it detracted too much from the film, but for me it was a bit annoying.The only aspect that I have to criticize is the way the game was filmed. The editing was sharp, hey ? it won an Oscar, but when the editor uses boxes to make the game seem more exciting, I was just distracted further from the game. I could see the reason to bring some style to the game, but the boxes, different pans, and multi-angles just felt cliché and randomly inserted to keep the attention of the viewers. The game was strong enough, it didn't need this snappy "special effects" to strengthen it. It made me anxious to watch it, kinda epileptic if further questions need to be asked. It just didn't fit. It felt like someone else took control and created the environment where the beginning didn't match the ending. If that style of film-making was used during all the practices, than maybe it would have been considered annoying, but it would have been consistent. Choppy consistency ? maybe that is my point here. Either way, it wasn't a big compliant, just an area I had trouble connecting myself to.Overall, I surprise myself when saying this, but I liked "The Longest Yard". It is the foundation for the "Mean Machine" and (grumble), the Sandler remake. I am impressed by the power of the characters and how well Reynolds took this role and played with it. The opening sequence solidified his character, and up until the ending he never let me go. Who couldn't enjoy Reynolds demolishing a car than going to get a drink afterwords. Hysterical. Aldrich was a perfect fit for this film, and it surprised me that the producer of the "Godfather" would choose this as his next project ? but seeing the final product, it doesn't surprise me. It was a well balanced film of both comedy and a slice of drama. It wasn't childish humor, but something that one could laugh at a second time. He controlled what could have been a chaotic film by allowing each to grow on their own to define themselves. The unique perspective of using athletes and actors was creative for its time, giving us the realism of the game before our eyes. Aside from the choppy editing near the end, I thought this was a perfect balance between sports and comedy.Mean Machine! Mean Machine! Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>QUESTION: Why that Remake? This ORIGINAL had so Much Going for it, and Burt Reynolds, Too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prison Film, now there's a breed of Cat all its own. And it is one 'Genre' of Movie that seems to always resurface every once in a while and bring new wrinkles and variations, in accordance with the customs and mores of the particular time then present.Surely we all have had some favourite movie that could be classified as a Prison story, at least partially. As a 'list' of some representative films, at least partially in this column would be: THE BIG HOUSE(1930) with Wallace Beery and Chesteer Morris, I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG(1932) with Paul Muni, THE SECOND HUNDRED YEARS (1927),THE HOOSEGOW(1929) and PARDON US(1931) all 3 Laurel &amp; Hardy.Others over the years would include; EACH DAWN I DIE(1939), BRUTE FORCE(1947), Elvis in JAILHOUSE ROCK (1957)COOL HAND LUKE(1967, PAPPILLON(1973))and even the recent SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION(1994).* So, we take the unmistakably winning charm of the Prison Film, blend in generous portions of Drama, Pathos, Humor, Action and Farce and we have a Comedy, in the Classic sense, and a good sample Prison movie for the Mid 20th Century 1970's.The crowning touch was the cast. A true gem stem to stern, the players in the story performed as a well coordinated unit, a sort of repertory company. Just about every player does his job to the utmost, within the framework of the story of course.The star of the show, one Burt Reynolds was a Molvie Actor who was just about at the very pinnacle of a great carer. He had demonstrated a definite versatility in the roles he took, of which there were many. The spectrum ran from DELIVERENCE(1972) to SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT (1977). But the Public seemed to prefer him in a semi-serious but carefree character.Other than the Star, Mr. Reynolds, the cast included: Eddie Albert as the treacherous, underhanded backstabber of a Warden. Bernadette Peters as the WEarden's Secretary and just about the only Female seen after the opening sequence. Michael Conrad as veteran Footballer/Convict, Nate Scarborough, who becomes the heart and soul of the Con's Football team. James Hampton, best known as 'Hannibal Dobbs' on "F TROOP"(1965-67), was "Caretaker", and the biggest back-up to Crewe's Coaching and Team organizational Set-up.Other's who deserve a mention(as really all of the cast does, are:Ed Lauter and Ex Pro football Players Joe Kapp(The Waklin' Boss), Mike Henry and Ray Nitschke as the Prison Guards. Harry Ceasar, John Steadman, Charles Tyner, Michael Fox, Bob Tessier, Richaed Kiel. Former U of Wassington QB, Sonny Sixkiller, has a good supporting role as convict"Chief" Anita Ford (Woo, Woo, Woo, woo!) is a real eyeful as Crewe's angry ex-girlfriend.So, his Paul "Wrecking" Crewe was a has been, top College and Pro Footballer, a Quarterback by trade. And it's not just Father Time and Mother Nature that have "benched" his career. We get some smatterings of the story, but not the whole truth. In short, Paul Crewe had been involved as the central player in a "Point Shaving" scheme's with some Underworld Gambler types.(It would seem that the story has plenty of relevance today!) At the time of release, THE LONGEST YARD must have been considered a better than average release of the yearly Paramount Pictures' output. We can remember that there was a promotional poster of Burt as Paul "Wrecking" Crewe, with the offer being touted on an offer sheet/coupon that was available in the supermarkets.Having been thought of and promoted even as a comedy, it is a strangely complex movie, displaying many different levels of story telling. While, it's true that it is a great film to be viewed as a Comedy with an audience, it also has a few serious strands running through the fabric of the scenario. Love, happiness, success, loyalty, class and exploitation are all examined as they relate to the guys at the Prison and to all of us in this weary World.NOTE:* There are a lot of films, which while strictly speaking, couldn't be considered to be 'Prison Films', do have a great component of Prison themes in them. Two of Chaplin's come to mind; first is THE PILGRIM (First National, 1923)and the feature MODERN TIMES(Chaplin Company/United Artists, 1936).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reynolds, near the beginning of his wild ride to fame, is close to his sexiest in this cheeky, rough, but very entertaining, prison/football flick. He plays a careless, disrespectful kept man who is jailed for theft when he shoves around his benefactress Ford and takes off in her car. Thanks to his credentials as an ex-pro football player, the prison warden Albert requests his aid in coaching the semi-pro team, consisting of the prison's brutal guards. Chief guard Lauter refuses to allow Reynolds to have any input, but Albert recruits him in another way, asking him to form a team made up of convicts so that the guards' team can build up their strength and strategy. The film details his selection of the players and the trials they undergo in order to make it to the big game, a game which takes up nearly the entire second half of the movie. Reynolds starts the film off with longish hair and a moustache and sports a hilarious, yet very sexy, 1970's pantsuit. He then gets a haircut and a shave and looks even better. His smart-aleck charm and affinity for football are on full display here. His interactions with the various cons give him ample opportunity to do what he does best. Albert is a far cry from his amiable sitcom persona and is surprisingly intense and even scary in his role. Hampton plays one of his better screen roles as Reynolds' right hand man and friendly know-it-all. Other familiar actors such as Lauter and Henry as guards and Conrad and Tessier as fellow prisoners dot the cast. Quite surprising as well is a cameo turn by Peters as the impossibly-coiffed, amorous secretary to Albert. Known primarily for her stage work at the time, she received the role through her friendship with Reynolds. The film takes its time telling its story, letting Reynolds potentially unlikable character win over the audience as he wins over his cellmates. Filming in a real prison (located in Georgia, despite the film's Florida setting, and overseen by none other than Governor Jimmy Carter) and on sweltering outdoor locations help set the right mood. A crowd-pleasing, even inspirational film to many a young man, it was remade by Adam Sandler in 2005.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard that Adam Sandler was coming out with a remake of this movie, I nearly winced. Not necessarily because I'm not the biggest Sandler fan, but because this movie is a classic in the sports film genre, and you don't mess with a good thing. Later, I found out that Burt Reynolds co-starred in the remake, so I figured it might be worth a shot. With that in mind, I rented the original and watched it again.My first reaction was "So THIS is where that Skynyrd song came from!" (I'm kidding, of course). Burt Reynolds (himself, a former college football player) stars as Paul "Wrecking" Crewe, a disgraced quarterback who got into trouble in a points-shaving scandal some years back. The movie starts at the peak of his contempt, where, in a drunken rage, he assaults his wife, steals her car, dumps it into a bay, then tries to beat up the cops who arrest him (and this is all during the opening credits!).The real story takes place when Crewe is sent to prison, where the warden (Eddie Albert) has a singular obsession with football, to the point that he manipulates Crewe into assembling a team among the inmates for an exhibition game against the guards.Now, if I go any further, I will be forced to send up a spoiler alert. What I can say is this film launched (or re-launched) the careers of Bernadette Peters, Michael Conrad (of "Hill Street Blues" fame), Richard Kiel (who plays Jaws in two James Bond films), and Ed Lauter, who went on to have a prolific career as a character actor (including an appearance in the Sandler remake of this movie).Some of the scenes seemed stilted here, and some of it was racially-biased (but this was Florida in 1974 -- They hadn't quite grown up yet), but much of the film holds up. By the way, the editing of the football game itself is among the best I have seen in film, and it undoubtedly was the source of inspiration of how the TV show "24" is presented.ESPN calls it "the best sports movie, period", and there are many arguments in that favor. As for me, I'll take "Field of Dreams", but this comes in at #2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Football Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burt Reynolds officially became a superstar with 1974's THE LONGEST YARD, one of the greatest feel-good football comedy-dramas ever made. Reynolds plays Paul Crewe, a disgraced ex-pro football player who is sent to prison for destroying his girlfriend's car (one of the great chase scenes in cinema history). Upon his arrival at a Florida prison, Crewe is coerced by the Warden (Eddie Albert), who has a semi-pro football team comprised of prison guards, to put together a team of convicts to play his guards and that's where the fun begins. Reynolds turns in a 100-megawatt movie star performance in this film as Paul has to draft players, train them, lead them, betray them, and win back their trust before the final whistle blows on the game. The recruiting and training scenes are smart and funny. Reynolds gets solid support here from Albert, in a slick performance as the slimy warden, James Hampton as best pal Caretaker and Michael Conrad as Nate Scarborough, another ex-footballer who has been jailed and agrees to help Crewe coach the team. The prison drama takes second place to one of the greatest movie football games ever filmed, with some striking split screen images between the game and the various elements of its audience, from the people in the stands to the prisoners laid up in the infirmary. The recent remake by Adam Sandler doesn't diminish in anyway the entertaining joy that this instant classic provides and continues to do so no matter how many times I watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly entertaining prison / action comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I' ve seldom been a great fan of "guy movie" kinds of comedies (the "rowdy" kind), but even I have an idea of "good" vs. "bad" vs. "merely okay" ones. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think of this one in that third category. In spite of the main actors, and all the great supporting ones. One thing that's always bothered me about it - I think the Ed Lauter character should' ve been a GENERAL "vicious guard" (if that phrase makes any sense), instead of one who actually murders a prisoner (wasn't he the one who did that?). That way, when he gives that disgusted look at Eddie Albert's character at the end, it could almost be thought of as some new-found sympathy for the Reynolds character (at least, compared to Albert's). One lopsided reason I have for liking this one is the actress Anitra Ford (one of the "Price Is Right" models for some time) at the beginning. I always wish, along with that five-minute scene, there had been some kind of "backstory" for her character and Reynolds', showing how he became this "kept man." That's another thing - even though he's pictured as a "jerk" during this first part, the looks she gives, and the way she talks, make her a sort of over-the-top "harpy", making it seem like there's no "good guy" in this fight. Maybe a backhanded compliment, but she's very convincing that way, in just a few minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent film in my opinion, with a really good story, Burt Reynolds is brilliant!. All the characters are fantastic, and while I have yet to see the remake I loved the original, plus Burt Reynolds is simply amazing in this!. It's extremely well made and very well written, and I thought Eddie Albert was fantastic as the sadistic and asshole Warden, plus it has some exciting Football action as well. I loved the ending as it had Burt running in for the touchdown in slow motion as that was really neat, and the scene where Burt is driving/running away from the cops was really funny as well, as it was cool how he outsmarted them, plus It also has some good serious moments as well, as some of the scenes with Burt Reynolds and Eddie Albert were quite intense!. Richard Kiel is also very good, and Ed Lauter played the asshole Capt. very well, plus I believe this is one of Burt's best roles!. This should be even higher then 7.1 in my opinion, and it's also underrated as well, plus I loved the ending as it made me smile. This is an excellent film, that's a classic in my opinion, with a really good story, Burt Reynolds is brilliant, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. Robert Aldrich does an excellent! Job here with fantastic camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at an extremely fast pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Burt Reynolds is amazing here, he is extremely likable, funny very charismatic surprised me with his awesome football skills and was just amazing he is the movie as far as I'm concerned and while I'm sure Sandler is good as Crewe I can't see him matching Burt's performance! (Burt Rules!!). Eddie Albert is brilliant as the sadistic asshole warden he was extremely unlikable I hated him, he also had some very intense scenes with Reynolds. Ed Lauter is fantastic as the asshole Capt. he was also quite unlikable although he did a cool thing at the end to the Warden. Michael Conrad is great as Scarboro he made a good team With Reynolds I loved him. James Hampton was awesome as the Caretaker he was likable, as it was very sad what happened to his character. Harry Caesar is excellent as Granville he was quite likable and rather intense. John Steadman is wonderful as Pop he was full of life, I really liked him. Richard Kiel is awesome in his role he was very funny and seemed to be enjoying himself. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Longest Yard (1974) Burt Reynolds, Ed Lauter, Eddie Albert, Michael Conrad, James Hampton, Richard Kiel, Harry Caesar, John Steadman.Spoilers herein."The Longest Yard" has been classified as one of the greatest sports comedies ever made. There is just one thing I don't understand - is it really meant to be that funny? The only comedy I found in the movie was just dark humor during the prison scenes, but that couldn't add another whole genre to the film, could it? Former pro quarterback Paul Crewehas been arrested for grand theft auto and assault on a police officer and has been sentenced to do time prison. Warden Hazen of the prison wants to give Crewe a chance to help his guards in football, and is inspired by Crewe's idea of getting a team of inmates to face off against the guards. Crewe accepts the offer and becomes the quarterback of the team that he knows he cannot let down.Burt Reynolds does good as the rebel against the guards, though his character isn't particularly likable. This worked in films like "Raging Bull", because the film wasn't supposed to be sweet or funny at all. In comedies, main characters are supposed to have something to like about them, and Paul Crewe isn't a character that you can have much sympathy for, which is one of elements that fails in "The Longest Yard". He does play a much more convincing Paul Crewe than Adam Sandler does, however.This film does have something that the original was missing though- it was much fresher. The script does a lot better here than it did in the silly remake, which added in too many dumb references to McDonald's and homosexuality. The rest of the cast is pretty good, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel's role as the giant Samson. "I think I broke his f****'in neck!" Overall, I just felt like this film was somewhat dated and runs at a pretty slow pace. But the final half hour of the movie, like the remake, is entertaining enough to be watched at least once for fun. I found this slightly better than the new one because it has a much more real feel to it, and it just succeeds for being a good film. If you want a great film about the teamwork of football, see "Friday Night Lights". 3.5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cons Vs. Guards equals a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Longest Yard is about former pro quarterback Paul Crewe who is sent to jail and is challenged by the mad Warden to put together a football team of cons to play against his guards so they can tune up for the pro's. Paul must pull together a victory with the help of his manager Caretaker, Coach Nate, and football team of inmates with attitudes against the guards. But when Caretaker gets murdered, at half time of the big game the Warden threatens to pin the murder on Crewe unless he throws the game for the guards to win. Now under orders, Paul must decide on helping his team or helping himself. Now this film is a drama with sports and comedy thrown in. Burt Reynolds is cool as Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe and Hampton is great as Caretaker. Eddie Albert is wonderful as the sadistic Warden and I loved Richard Kiels performance as one of the football cons, Samson. The plot is well made up with a great cop car chase at the beginning to the tense hardcore football game at the end. The acting is great from all the cast and the action is packed. But there are down sides, like some of the scenes are so slow and boring you loose interest in the story. But the story picks right up after the scene is over If you enjoy dramatic sports movies like Rocky or Raging Bull, you'll love The Longest Yard. Longest Yard gets the big 7, a bit slow in half the film with some cheesy camera angles but a good film overall. You'll have a good time, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A minor classic. Confirms what Groucho Marx said re Burt being one of the best comics he had seen for years. Unger's use of the F.O. expletive is one of the times it works perfectly. Also loved the Laurel and Hardy routine with the mud. Eddie Albert is the perfect villain. Cant imagine remake measuring up. I think there is an error re the car he steals in the opening. A different make than one referred to by owner. Joe Kapp played in CFL for B.C. Lions Sonny Sixkiller had a cup of coffee with Argos. I can't think of anything that doesn't work. The last scene when Crewe retrieves the ball carries the drama to the end. "Historeee" the warden is done.</fullReview>

Add to this several top notch football players including Joe Kapp (who people forget was the first QB to take the Vikings to the Super Bowl) and you understand why the game sequences look real.A strong cast like this deserved a little less predictable material.

		<shortDescription>One of the best sports films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film follows a professional athlete who tries to find some redemption when at his lowest point. Burt Reynolds stars as Paul Crewe, a former NFL quarterback who has had a run in with the law. Crewe finds himself in Georgia prison where football is as much an institution as the law. The warden, played perfectly by Eddie Albert, sponsors a semi-professional football team comprised of the prison guards, and what he requests from Crewe is a practice game between the guards and an inmate team lead by a former NFL star, Crewe. Crewe then is charged with forming a bond amongst criminals, men who don't trust easily or typically feel fit to follow a leader. It's amazing to see how these men come together and by what means.What makes this film so great is that Reynolds moves, talks and acts like a football player, which he actually was in college as a running back at Florida State. This performance suits him so well, because he easily could've been the character he portrays in real life. His "devil-may-care" attitude, so often his trademark in film, is at its pinnacle in this film.The football scenes are some of the best that Hollywood has ever produced, not like overly stylistic like Any Given Sunday, or the overly comedic films like Necessary Roughness. It captures the sport very simply and without it appearing to "staged". A large part of this is because the supporting cast is made up of former professional and college players and a few NFL greats like Ray Nitschke, as well. The climactic scene is brilliantly shot, especially for 1974.Overall, this movie has stood the test of time as a classic representation of both sport, the underdog. and more importantly, Burt Reynolds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider this one of Burt Reynolds better movies. Actors who played pro football helped with the make-up of the movie (Ray Nitske, Joe Kapp). Reynolds practically had to fight to get the inmates respect, and then almost lost it when he tried to throw the game. He realized, almost too late that the warden was not a man of his word. Michael Conrad gave an excellent performance as Nate Scarborough, the ex-pro player turned con. It seemed like a role tailored for him.</fullReview>

And the story, written by Tracy Keenan Wynn is strange, however; it has plenty of funny moments and great details.Director Robert Aldrich, best known for directing "The Dirty Dozen", which was an unforgettable war movie, takes a few key elements for that movie and transplants them here with no problems. As for the game itself, I was either thrilled or laughing my butt off, but it felt like being in the stands, watching a high school, college, or pro game.Overall, it's rip-roaring fun.</fullReview>

That is showcased brilliantly in this film.This film is over 30 years old, yet its themes of betrayal, enlightenment, grit and determination are still echoed on football fields every September through December.

		<fullReview>The first half of The Longest Yard consists of Burt Reynolds smirking his way through a typical good ol' boy 70's flick, getting away with things that would NEVER pass today. A few things are worth a chuckle, but Burt seems way more interested in cracking up at his own stuff. We would pretty much see the same performance in Smokey And The Bandit, Parts I and II about 4 years later. When the big game itself starts, though, the gloves come off and the movie comes alive. The game takes up a little less than the final half of the movie, and I was a little startled to see it happening so fast, but it keeps your attention the whole way through, with many hilarious moments. My personal favorites are the clothesline from Samson (Richard Kiel), and the original way the Mean Machine took Bogdanski (Ray Nitschke) out of the game ("He's not breathing!"). To tell you the truth, it's almost worth skipping through the first half, and just watching the game itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no good guys here,just varying degrees of badness.Even our "hero",Paul Crewe(Burt Reynolds),establishes early in the film that he is far less than perfect.After all,he does end up in prison.At first,his fellow inmates resent Crewe,the former gridiron star,and see him as someone who had it all,and tossed it in the garbage,whereas they have had nothing their entire lives.Crewe is given an "incentive" to put together a football squad to play against the more established football playing guards,by the prison's warden,devilishly played by Eddie Albert. As I said,there are no real heroes here,but it is clearly established that the guards are the worst of the two evils.I am an avid football fan,and there are many films about the sport that I love,and this one tops the list.It's my all time favorite in the genre.Great casting here, which includes a mixture of top notch actors,and former football greats such as ex-Packer great Ray Nitchke,who definitely add to the charm of the film.In Burt Reynolds hit and miss career,this one is definitely a hit,disagree though he may.For football fans like me,this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why didn't Sonny Sixkiller wear # 6?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a prison picture but without question the highlight is of course the Football game between the convicts and the prison guards. It features a number of former pro football stars to include Ernie Wheelwright, Ray Nitschke, Joe Kapp, and Ray Ogden. Reynolds plays a former pro quarterback who runs afoul of the law and finds himself in a prison in which the warden has a thing for football. A game between the wardens own team made up of his guards and a team comprised of convicts is scheduled with of course Burt calling the plays. One thing I couldn't understand regarding the casting was why former U of Washington star quarter back Sonny Sixkiller who led the nation in passing and even was on the cover of Sports Illustrated (Oct. 4, 1971) and appears in the film as one of the convict players was not given a jersey with the number 6 on it which he wore at Washington? (He wears # 30 in the film) It left me with a `Why cast Sonny Sixkiller in the movie and make him a football player if he's not going to be able to wear number 6?' But then again Ray Nitschke wears # 61 when his number with the Packers was 66.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burt's Best Almost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burt's second best film behind Deliverance but far more entertaining. A perfect blend of action comedy and drama with Burt in his prime in a football version of the Dirty Dozen-1. Great supporting cast of ruthless guards, warped inmates and a hateful warden played brilliantly by Eddie Albert who again teams with action director Aldrich after previously playing hateful officer in Attack. Almost all other sports films are very inept in their depicting sports activity but not here the climactic football game between the guards and inmates is exciting fun and looks like a real game!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this film on TBS. Still entertaining, but dated. It was interesting to watch the football scenes, I love the game. The split screen part I just totally hate. Some of the lines and actor where a little to unbelievable for the realistic 00's we live in now. The ending is great, and the movie is worth a watch I give it a six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burt Reynolds plays an ex-professional football player turned prostitute who hates himself and lands in prison. In there he is forced to train a bunch of convicts to be football players so they can play a game against the prison guards. Through this he gains confidence and leads his team for an all-out, no holds barred game.First off, some posters have taken this film way too seriously. They complained that the movie has us cheering convicts that are rapers, murderers, etc etc. Come on! This is a FANTASY! How many prisons would let convicts and guards have a football game? None! So get over it...this is a no-think, brutal, dirty and very funny movie.It moves very quickly and there's some clever use of multiple screens when the big game starts. Also, you don't need to know or like football to enjoy this movie. I don't like it or understand it but I loved this movie! Seeing Burt Reynolds so young and full of life is incredible. Also he gives a pretty good low-key performance. Eddie Albert is perfect as the hissibly evil warden. There are only two women in the film--a woman who is cruel and pushed around by Reynolds at the beginning and Bernadette Peters with a most interesting hairdo.Rough, rousing, ribald comedy drama fantasy with a great football game. Don't miss it! Best line: "Stick this in your trophy case".Only complaint--why does the "cheerleading squad" composed of all black men in drag? It adds an ugly tinge of homophobia and racism. But then again this IS a guys flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inmates take on the guards in a football game at a prison. In the opening scene it is established that Reynolds is an arrogant and misogynistic ex pro football player. And he's supposed to be the good guy. The film is supposed to be a comedy but any attempts at humor fall flat. The script and direction are both inept. There's a football game that takes up about 45 minutes of the film and it's clichéd and poorly executed, with random and distracting use of split screen. The final drive by the convicts doesn't even make sense, as Reynolds purposely garners unsportsmanlike penalties on two consecutive plays while trying to win the game.</fullReview>
