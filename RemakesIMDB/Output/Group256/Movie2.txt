		<shortDescription>Top class Brit flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You simply cannot put this movie down, a great all British cast and a great all British sport, being British and a great lover of Manchester United, i was up for this film and it didn't diasappoint me in the slightest. Vinnie Jones was brilliant as Danny Meehan and Jason Statham as the 'Monk' was simply classic vintage stuff. The match is what the watchers of this film want to see and it is fantastically constructed, just one tip of advice, don't p*** of the 'Monk'10/10 stars, classic stuff</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could understand not liking this movie if someone was expecting Citizen Kane (and if you were, you should be flogged). For a straight to video/cable movie, it had great prod. value, sharp dialogue, and a great supporting cast of Guy Ritchie characters. Throw in some solid football and you have a film to help you forget the worries of your day. The commentary by the two Bobs alone makes it worthwhile. Jones is good, but Statham steals the show in almost all of his scenes. Like the original (The Longest Yard), it was made to entertain the audience, not to provoke some deep introspective thought on the existence of God. See it, rent it, buy it! If you cant discern the heavy British slang, throw on the subtitles. If you don't have a DVD player, how in the hell are you managing to read this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unmatched soccer movie, great prison film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of sport movies and I am not able to watch a soccer match without dozing off, but this one got me. A sympathetic cast I know from the Guy Richie's Snatch with lovely variety of British accents, this film features a lively plot, very funny quotes and a good physical humor, elaborate shots, and an interesting range of prison characters. No matter the characters are rather flat, this simplification I was willing to accept, since the story was so good.Even though I may have seen better prison movies, and even some that are similar in plot; the Mean Machine is unmatched in the rather distant, ironical view of the prison world, honoring fair-play and manly virtues. Moreover, I was very happy not to see any homosexual relationships among the prisoners, no matter the actual prison reality. (On the other hand, I liked the bookie, he had a style.)All in all, I enjoyed this film very much. Do not expect food for thought but rest assured this is not a dumb entertainment either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1-0 to the Mean Machine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Machine is an English reworking of Robert Aldrich's 1974 beefcake Burt Reynolds starrer, The Longest Yard. Substituting Gridiron for Soccer, director Barry Skolnick, along with his roll call of British "faces", is only aiming for one market.That of the footie worshipping clan that primarily resides within the United Kingdom.Very much a long way from competing on the same playing field as Aldrich's superior movie, Mean Machine does have enough about it to make it an enjoyable viewing outside of the excellently constructed soccer match that fills out the last third of the piece. But with the film's reputation being far from good, the chance that many others feel the same as me are pretty remote. About as remote as Accrington Stanley winning the English Premiere League one feels.The problem would seem to lay with the first hour, violence and humour thrust together does not always yield great rewards, and so it be with the wet behind the ears direction from Skolnick. Caught between a tough portrayal of British prison life and outright slapstick, it's an odd bedfellow that Skolnick can't quite get right. And with Guy Ritchie on the sidelines donning the "supervising producer" shirt, one can't help thinking that Ritchie would have made substantially more with the material to hand. But as "I" say, there's enough there for the discerning fan of blood and banter.Led by the watchable Jones, the cast, outside of the miscast David Hemmings as the Governor, pull out the stops to entertain the terrace faithful. Danny Dyer haters will enjoy him getting knocked about as he plays simpleton Billy Limpet, while Jason Statham is a joy as Monk, a Jock that even the Jocks are afraid of. While also putting in scene stealing shifts of note are Jamie Sives, Vas Blackwood and Omid Djalili. It's no piece of work to rank in the higher echelons of British movies - or sports movies in general for that matter. But in spite of its soggy formula and over reliance on the template film it's working from, it's very funny at times, and if you like soccer? Well the actual match is well worth the wait. 7/10Footnote: The Longest Yard/Mean Machine was met with another re- imaging in 2005 with Adam Sandler as the disgraced lead protagonist. Proof positive that it's either a formula that many can't resist? Or that it's one that some feel still hasn't yet met its potential?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a disgraced national football coach who gets imprisoned for assault. He coaches the prison football team to play against the guards.While watching the first half of the film, I was so sure that I would not enjoy it. All the roughness and senseless violence put me off completely. However, as soon as the football match kicks in, I was amazed by the way it lifts my spirits. The match occupies 30 minute screen time, but there is not a second of boredom. Instead, it is so mightily engaging and thoroughly intense. It felt as if I was there to experience the match, and just like everyone, I was hoping for the ultimate pride that would last forever. I am truly impressed by the incredible story telling of "Mean Machine".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Keenan Wynn's 'The Longest Yard', Fletcher adds Brit wit to the screenplay as Skolnick directs a splendid film. Of course the story isn't anything new (like most sports flicks) but the humour brings out the charm. The characters are fun to watch and funnily enough the actors have famously starred in Guy Ritchie films. It's as if they were in prison for the crimes they committed in those films. But, just to avoid any misconception, this isn't a crime-flick and it's very different from the Ritchie films, both in style and content. One doesn't have to be a football fan to enjoy it as the entertainment value is universal. The football match sequence was hilarious and if only the real matches were half entertaining! All the actors do a fine job but it is Vinnie Jones who carries the movie and it's nice to see him as a guy who gets beaten up in comparison to the tough guy roles he's typecast in. Overall, this is a fun little film, not one to be taken too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant enough British Drama with a great cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vinnie Jones plays Danny Meehan, a retired footballer who disgraced his country by cheating an England v Germany football match to win a bet. The movie begins after his retirement with him speeding around town in his sports car, drinking from a bottle of Vodka, being chased by Police. He then proceeds to beat up the Police Officers and needless to say, he gets arrested and sentenced to 3 years behind bars.In prison he swiftly brought back to reality and reminded that behind bars, he isn't a footballer and the prisoners and guards haven't forgotten what he did in that England v Germany game. Danny Meehan is then ordered to captain the prisoners in a one off football match against the guards.The best thing about Mean Machine is the cast, if you have watched other British Films around this time you will recognise so many of the supporting actors from films such as Snatch, Lock Stock, Football Factory. Not to mention, Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, Danny Dyer, David Kelly &amp; David Hemmings! The cast is fantastic but the characters are even better, it has a great mix of different people, serious one, funny ones, stupid ones &amp; of course the prison nutter(i.e. the Monk!).The Story is of course predictable, it has many cliché moments &amp; it certainly doesn't offer anything new. But it is entertaining! The first half of the movie has quite a serious feel to it, it moves along very fast &amp; doesn't offer much character development. I didn't really feel like I connected with any of the characters , which is a shame as they were so many unique characters involved! The second half of the story, when they start to train for the football match &amp; the coverage of the football match itself is much more light hearted and funny, there are many laugh out loud moments. The coverage of the football match is absolutely fantastic, the best part of the movie by far. Bob &amp; Bob as the commentators are hilarious; football commentators could take a note out of their book! The way the match is filmed is also perfect, a lot of sports films are let down by the camera angles &amp; the speed of the action but in Mean Machine I feel the director got it spot on. You could really see what was happening and I think this was made easier by Bob &amp; Bob! Overall Mean Machine is an entertaining movie but far from perfect in my eyes. I have seen the Adam Sandler ? Longest Yard before seeing this and I think that spoiled it for me, it is basically the same story and I had no surprises whilst watching this. The Second half outshines the first by quite a way in my opinion. I feel like they could have offered more in the first half of the movie, Character development, more tension, make you feel for the characters more. As I said before, the football match was brilliant and hilarious and saved this movie for me. This is certainly worth a watch and is entertaining enough to pass the time.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant final third, and a good Jones, despite the flaws this is an above-average sports/prison drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If sometimes just lacking the creativity and vitality of the 1974 film, this is an above average sports/prison drama. There are some flaws though, one or two of the characters are thinly sketched, the plot is a touch simplistic and the first half hour just lacked the energy of the latter half of the film. That said, this is well worth watching. The whole film is excellently filmed and directed, and the soccer scenes are very well done. The final third is absolutely riveting, and really makes you want to see what the outcome is at the end. The music score is fine, and the performances are very good. Vinnie Jones is convincing in his first leading role, and David Kelly is stellar as the benevolent Doc. The best pieces of casting are (despite the accent) Jason Statham as maverick keeper and Jason Flemying's rather unconventional commentator. In conclusion, this is a good film. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this flick. Perhaps because I always enjoy sports related flicks, or because I am a huge fan of Vinnie Jones, thanks to Guy Richie, or maybe because I am in love with Jason Statham, also thanks to Guy.But why I watched it in the first place was because I had always enjoyed The Longest Yard with Burt Reynolds, in fact the only flick of his I enjoyed, and was very happy to see a British version of the football classic. I loved the characters, the seamless transition from American football to European football, and the accents. Vinnie Jones gives yet another great performance, and it was nice to see so many characters return from Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels as well as Snatch (great flicks!).I give this flick 4 1/2 stars, only because it didn't showcase "Monk" enough for my tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the original Burt Reynolds movie, I had mixed feelings about this movie. On one side as a traditional football (soccer) fan and not a fan of American football, I though I'd get more enjoyment out of it. On the other side I love the original movie so much it would obviously suffer in comparison, and let's be honest Vinnie Jones is no Burt Reynolds. Plot In A Paragraph: A disgraced former footballer is sent to jail for three years for drunkenly assaulting a police officer. Once there the Warden wants him to train the guards football team, he refuses, after a while he agrees to play in, and coach a team of cons to play the gaurds in a one off match.Whilst not as enjoyable as the Burt Reynolds version, it is a lot of fun with Jason Statham stealing the show as The Monk!! While Danny Dyer gets a lot of laughs, likewise Vas Blackwood as Massive and David Kelly is touching as Doc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Meehan(Vinnie Jones), a former captain of the English national football team who was banned from football for life for fixing a match between England and Germany, is sentenced to three years in Longmarsh prison for assaulting two police officers after a lengthy drinking session and driving wildly to a local bar, whilst in prison he gets asked to coach the guards but refuses. Meehan (Jones) then goes on to make a team of convicts, with half the people in Longmarsh not liking him it wont be an easy task.This film is very good; it involves violence &amp; humour at the same time. It's not for younger viewers due to the language &amp; violence involved in some scenes. I like this film because of its story line &amp; casting.I would give the film 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now thats how you make a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mean Machine is a remake that keeps at least some sense of originality by sending the movie to America's older Cousine (UK) and switching the sport from American football to the original football give the movie a twist rather than a straight sh*te remake (the longest yard 2005). The good of this movie is that Vinnie Jones actually looks the part rather than Adam Saddler who doesn't look owt like a AF player. One thing to add is that rugby and American football is all about fouling and ramming normal football isn't so to get a voilent movie out of football takes alittle imagination rather than AFnote that not only is it funny, dark ,violent and dramatic it as the Monk (jason statham) a true phycopath that ''hate Hannibal the cannibal'' who's not only scary but funny and believable rather than the one in the remake of the longest yard who really just looks like a dopey inbred played by a wrestler ( who can't act)over all I rate this movie 10/10 witch is overrated but i want to give this movie some credit....A remake of an American classic turns into a British classic</fullReview>

Danny Dyer "Tommy Johnson" The football factory provided some very funny moments showing his status as not just a swearing buffoon of British acting. The match drags on and the commentary during the game is unbelievably childish and the match would have been a lot better without it. Also I cant see how they can portray all of the prison staff as racist low lives that beat cheat and steal.Oh an who can forget Massive.... It's Ironic! I cant see a sequel or any of that nonsense but one of the better British films of the past few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite man is 'Monk'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie 3 times and every time I enjoyed it even better. I am totally bored off the American accent of the Hollywood films. Different British accents in this movie removed the rust from my ears. Two commentators were the best I've ever heard. Monk was the most colorful character in the movie, although was given a limited role. I prefer European movies to US movies most of the time. In US movies a hero saves the world, the nation, the city or the whole universe. They spent lots of money on special effects, the artificial scenes, costumes, etc. But those films lack something that I found it difficult to explain in English. Despite their limited budget, European movies like "Mean Machine" manage to affect the audience emotionally and have a better recallability ratio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean Machine is one of the great Ska Films from the UK. ska films also noted for brit flicks such as lock stock and two smoking barrels and the more known snatch, have blended the same ingredients from there previous films to create another screen gem. Vinnie Jones, considering his background plays a great part and plays it well, helped greatly of course by the other strong characters. Maybe not being fully understood by American audience, the characters, either realistically or stereotypically, represent prison life be it screws, cons or the big men. i felt it managed to have violence without being over violent and still spread in a good few laughs, never forgetting bob and bob the commentators. of course the ending was a tad predictable but any other way would make it depressing, the underdog always wins. overall a good film for the budget, with a dashing of low key actors making it memorable and kind of cult film. an A grade</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie IS funnier than Snatch, if you are the kind of person that likes to enjoy true cinema, without unnecessary digital enhancing effects, a clean and original story line, then this movie is for you.This is actually a remake from another movie, the difference is that this time the its a real Football (the original version American football). The main character first came to public notice as a professional footballer, playing in the English Football League. Noted as one of soccer's hard men, he leap to fame when a photographer at a match snapped him "marking" Newcastle United's Paul Gascoigne by grabbing his testicles, so he knows the sport, does relate to his real life and I actually like him as an actor. His character in snatch, Lock stock and two smoking barrels, and other great movies,on the same style where great too! Don't miss the opportunity to watch a great flick!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mean Machine starts badly, poor acting, TV movie quality, cheesy storyline and Vinnie Jones very wooden. Every prison movie cliche is there and it is awful for the first thirty minutes.Then things start going right, Vinnie looks a lot more comfortable and the movie starts to get going and goes from strength to strength with loads of gags and some occasional violence to break things up a bit.However, what this film is about is Football (Soccer) and what it delivers in so-far as Football action is excellent, I doubt if any film has captured the sport so captivating and also so funny!I came out of this film happy that I had been well entertained for at least an hour, grit your teeth for the first thirty minutes and then sit back relax and watch some excellent Football action!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see 'Mean Machine', I could not help but think back to the original version (starring Burt Reynolds, and known as 'The Longest Yard'). I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the story had been updated.True, football (Soccer) had replaced American Football, but the story remained the same - how a fallen star gains the respect of those who envy the fact that he had it all and blew it, whilst they never had the chance to be anything other than what they are. Vinnie Jones does a good job of playing 'Danny Meehan', and the supporting cast complements Jones' fallen star - Vas Blackwood, Jason Statham and Jason Fleyming are all convincing as convicts, as well as other SKA Film regulars (you'll recognise them when you see them).The only (potential) criticism of the film is that one main similarity remains between this version and the original version - what type of film is this? For the first 45 minutes, you could be mistaken for thinking it is a drama. For the last 45 minutes, it may be a comedy. But this in itself is not a strict criticism. Having a varied theme does, on occasion, work in favour of the film - it is versatile enough to allow each character to develop and grow on the viewer. Indeed, towards the end of the film you might find yourself cheering for characters you might have despised after the first half-hour of the film.Overall, a solid update of a film that, despite not offering as much as it possibly could, is definitely entertaining. And if a film manages to entertain a viewer, then it has served its purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vinnie Jones - about as Welsh as Sean Connery - was the worst footballer ever to play for Wales.I realise that's rather a rash statement but I'd back it up by saying he was the worst player ever to turn out for Wimbledon,a team not known for their adherence to the "Beautiful Game" ethos.His fame - apart from nearly crippling Liverpool's star winger in the second minute of the 1988 Cup Final - rests mainly on a photograph of him squeezing boy - child Paul Gascoigne's testicles in a tender moment.That really says all you need to know about him. Reading his Filmography just now I am mystified at the number of movies he has graced with his presence.Is it just me? Anyhow,"Mean Machine" is typical of the no - brainer bullet - headed roles he accepts as to the manner born. Appalling overacting by everybody,limping direction,Am - Dram production values and a script written by a computer set to "Cockney " mode.....and they're the good points....

		<fullReview>Call them old re-cycled clichés from the past perhaps, but this film, with Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham's impressionable performances, is worth seeing before this film hits the video stores or cable! At least, their characters are equally as funny and wild as The Longest Yard-`Burt Reynolds' bunch! Of course, this is one heck of a guy's movie where cheers are for cons, and jeers for their `screws'! Still, it is one British comedy with loads of silly goofs, strengthened by a fantastic soccer game to hold the viewers' interest. Only wish all soccer games do bring equal excitement! This flick is one mean drama that takes the whole cast to kick up laughter! Yep, good old British `tavern' parlance? if the viewers have a knack for Cockney accents and slang! I'm not a sport fan, nor am I fond of ruthless and insensible nudging, but I literally behaved like a stadium spectator, guffawing boisterously while watching one team demean another. Each team does have its psychotic players with their crazy antics! Tough charlatans and their power struggle out on the open field! Blimey! Lots of scenes making my brains rock and belly shake! The erratic `Mambo Jumbo' music score certainly builds up steam. No doubt, I'll have to try to get used to `Irish Eyes Are Smiling' strumming up in samba beat! But overall, the music compilation does well to yank up the moods. The camerawork frequently diminishes my eye-focus in my attempt to catch up with the actions and wit! Just one big soccer field for landscape, but there's enough living action to captivate the eyes! Some cool `aerial' camera-shots too! But atlas, this is not the sort of film that will present food for thought once it's over. Everything is predictable, as in many sport-flicks. Laugh while events last! And believe that the only credible thing about this movie is the extensity of a corrupted man's gambling woes that goes with sport, as portrayed by the villainous Hemmings! Of course, there's one learning lesson that gets through this flick: it takes meanness to fight meanness! Surprise? Of course not! What else can one expect from a bunch of toughies, involved in a rough sport and within a sinister environment! Rules, therefore, are meant to be broken and there will be plenty of vicious manipulations up everyone's sleeves! And how each culprit tackles it is a laughing matter! I sure had fun watching this flick?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply, the greatest film ever made. Simple as that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, one must discuss our protagonist, Vinnie Jones. Such a diverse actor allows this film to truly play to his strengths. At one point, I thought he was going to cry, but of course not - he is a man. Invariably, other than the truly great performance of Mr. Danny Dyer, the best caricature performed by diverse acting quality, the stand out performer is Jason 'The Monk' Statham.In his three glorious lines of dialogue, Statham esquire (our god) gives an incredible embodiment of an accent from some vague region in the north. It was only after following upon further research on the great man that one discovered that rather to my great surprise his locale was not of such an area, but instead of midland descent. Arguably, one may consider that 'The Stath' does not need lines, but instead is brought alive by a script that relies on the expressive capability of his face. This gives brevity and a continual sincerity to his humble beginnings.The prior reciprocity displayed between both Jones and Statham adds a great deal of gravitas and a hapticity that one can truly grasp, much like this very review. Their footballing credentials whilst at grammar school (1978-1983) therefore supports the particular bond depicted on screen. Statham's career in diving is substantially exhibited by his abs which are clearly shown in his inaugural scene. These are quite simply hewn from obsidian, and connote a particular majesty in his on screen presence. Criticisms with the film are few, but fraught. In particularity, the scene of a coital nature between Vinnie 'Mean Machine' Jones and the governor's receptionist is quite frankly appalling. More needs to be made of Statham's abs and moreover his truly masculine body art. Also the governor's eyebrows require their own role and are wasted on such trivial application. Despite this, the film is literally perfect. This is delineated through a true stamp of quality - the Umbro branding, which is extraordinarily consistently prominently well placed. In summary, this film personifies the true nature of English heritage and the argument that Jason Statham is indeed on his way to becoming a true national treasure, such as Gary Lineker. This film indeed (re)devines the vernacular of modern day sporting cinema and such should be inducted into the cinematic hall of fame. A must for viewers of all ages, especially lovers of art house theatre.-Da Boiz-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A British remake of an American movie, there is quite a lot to like here, not least that it is quite funny at time.Vinnie Jones is, it must be said, not the greatest actor in the world, but he does have screen presence, and he has decent soccer skills (no surprise there). The rest of the cast out-act him, though, with the exception of Jason Statham who should never have been asked to perform with a Scots accent. Jason Statham is to Scots accents as Seth Rogen is to ballet.The film is a game of two halves, Brian, the first half being training and the second half being the match itself. And,while the outcome is never in any real doubt, the match is managed sufficiently well to keep up a decent level of suspense as to what will happen, especially when David Hemmings' weaselly prison governor weighs in with a late penalty (so to speak).Good, undemanding fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mean Machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this title mainly because of the lead actor, and that it had football involved somewhere, so I watched it. Basically ex-England football captain Danny 'Mean Machine' Meehan (Vinnie Jones) is in jail for drunken driving and assault on two police officers, but because of his celebrity status he isn't much liked by all the other inmates, especially as he let them down in a crucial World Cup game. He keeps his head down for a little while until the opportunity to change the lives of the prisoners by putting one over on the guards. Led by Danny, the prisoners are trained ready to face the guards in a football match. So it comes to the match, and not even the death of Doc (David Kelly) gets them down, and they start really well. There is a point when Danny is threatened by the Governor (David Hemmings) that he could get a longer sentence, as he might have been involved in Doc's death, but he knows they have to win, and it is after they win that opponent Burton (Cape Wrath's Ralph Brown) gets him out of trouble to enjoy victory. Also starring Creep's Vas Blackwood as Massive, Robbie Gee as Trojan, Geoff Bell as Ratchett, Footballer's Wives' John Forgeham as Charlie Sykes, Smack the Pon's Sally Phillips as Tracey, Danny Dyer as Billy the Limpet, Jason Statham as Monk, Omid Djalili as Raj and Jason Flemyng as Bob Likely. Jones is a good rough character, and all the supporting actors, particularly Hemmings, Sykes and Statham add good support, while it takes a little while to get to, the football game, well, and maybe a little of the training for it, is fun to watch, a real boys movie. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally, I'm a fan of any British; that doesn't count me as an unfair person. When I'm talking for movies, I'll like to be honest and fair, because I love cinema...So... I'm a huge fan of European cinema, specially for French &amp; British.This particular "kind" of British movies, the "so-called" ACTION-COMEDY ones, specially the kind of movies like the "Snach", is my TOP FAVORITE kind.This one, "Mean Mashine", is a quite good movie to watch. So, why I voted with "7"? Simple... If you're a fan of Vinnie Jones (as player or actor) and the incredible Jason Statham, you can't vote something below "7"! Of course, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" &amp; "Snach", are two of the TOP British movies, with really clever scenario, fantastic directing and great acting.But... in this movie, you'll find yourselves laughing many times, by the unique British humor and... phrases!"Bollocks"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vinnie Jones put's in a steady performance as Danny Mehan. Danny Mehan (jones) is an Ex-England international who has been thrown in prison for match-fixing football games. As the film unravels, you gradually start to get into the film and the witty humour is quite amusing at times. The whole story eventually builds up to the main event, which is a football game. The Cons Vs The Guards.This quickly paced, highly entertaining film is packed with action.............. If you love football and love violence, then this is a film for you.The film starts off a bit slow, but the last 30 minutes (the match) easily pays off for the wait. You may the find the build up to the match slightly dull, but stick with it and the gamble pay's off.This film has action, humour and highly entertaining actors. On the whole, a good film............. especially for football mad fans!!</fullReview>

I liked the story and the humour was fantastic. I just loved Monk, played by Jason Statham. In the movie he's referred to as "the Scot that even the Scots are afraid of". If you liked the Longest Yard, you would definitely like the Mean Machine. And if you like soccer, it's a must to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, for starters, it's not the best movie in the world. Blimey, it's not even the best to come out of England. But it was a good flick. Vinnie Jones puts on an excellent performance that, while slow at times, really makes for a good movie. The superb cast help Vinnie to pull this one off. Stephen Walters deserves more than a fleeting glance at his name come the end of the movie. His performance made the movie enjoyable, even if he is "the bad guy." He just put so much emotion into the character that it couldn't be anything less than good. And Jason Statham as Monk... you have to love the guy. Jason Statham has lately become a favorite actor of mine. His performance as monk added a level of delight to the movie that I haven't seen in a long time. The quick edits along with the music changes... Brilliant! My hat goes off to the entire cast of this flick. It's a great time... even if it seems like it might not be at first, and a few poor edits and scenes that I would have cut aside, I'd recommend it to anyone who feels up to it.By the by, This refers to the Original UK cut found on the region 1 DVD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are watching this film, you will know not to expect great scenes of emotion and intensity. A football film starring Vinnie Jones is always going to be one thing, and luckily this is it. A brisk, simple and highly appealing knockabout comedy. Most of the comedy comes in the final minutes, as our heroes play out a football game the plot and result of which have long been known. However the humour during this game is of a very high quality, and Statham's character of The Monk seemed enormous fun for Statham, and is truly memorable for the audience. Put simply, if you enjoy Guy Ritchie films then you will enjoy this as simpler fare. Forgettable (excepting The Monk), but highly watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are after pure entertainment go and see Mean Machine. From the first scene of Vinnie, drunk and driving the streets of London in his convertible Merc away from the cops to the final sound of the ref's whistle, Mean Machine is a rollicking good ride.It's full of the cliched characters reminiscent of the the BBC's Porridge. The bent "guvner", the psycho prisoner Nitro, the screws and the horny secretary, but it's this kalidescope of characters that the audience is comfortable with that kicks the movie along, when you know the result of the film when you take your seat. Vinnie Jones shows his true soccer style with some beautiful work on the field and does a credible job as Danny Meehan, the bad boy of soccer imprisoned for drink driving while disqualified. Jones gets the opportunity to extend his acting range perpetuated in Lock Stock and Snatch.In the days of big business and globalisation ie: the establishment pounding the hell of us with taxes and over regulation, it's good to see the little man score a point for you and I. Mean Machine is not academy award material. It's just pure good fun highly recommendable if you want to escape for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best football movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film being very biassed towards not liking it. I am a big Vinnie Jones fan, but, lots of people are still yet to be convinced as to his acting abilities. I also think the best role for Vinnie would be one where he just gets to kick the living crap out of everyone. So the thought of his character being the opposite of this did put me off a little. I was also worried about the tagline "from the bloke who produced Lock Stock and Snatch" because it could have meant it was living on the past glories of these two films, also a lot of the cast were in the previous films as well. I was VERY wrong about these assumptions, although it wasn't the role I love to see Vinnie in, it showed his all round acting abilities and showed he can deliver a line or two when neccessary! He also didnt rely on the football aspect a lot which was another fear of mine. The film can be seen as similar to Lock Stock and Snatch but this one settled for the humour a lot more and didn't really need a clever ending or twist like the other two films did. The football scenes aswell were excellent and very well worked out, and first time director Skolnick can be proud of this. Definitely one of Vinnies best shows and has set out his point to Hollywood that he can play any part they want, hopefully it will set Vinnies career to an even bigger high and get him the lead roles in a big budget hollywood film.</fullReview>

Those of you who walk into the Cinema comparing it to Snatch and Lock Stock will automatically be disappointed as it fails to live up to those classics (despite having half the cast). As far as humour goes, it does beat Snatch but not Lock Stock. It's by far the most lines Guy Ritchie has given Vinnie Jones in a film, and at times it does seem to centre around him. However some superb acting from Jason Statham playing monk (a fellow lunatic Scotsman) help take the limelight from VinnieIf you like football and you like Guy Ritchie's sense of humour (and his casting from previous films) then you should go and see this film.Scott*10/1/02</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vinnie Jones' first starring role was chosen perfectly. Like the man himself, the film is about a football player who gets himself into trouble.Unfortunately, that's about all that is perfect about this film. I had great trouble trying to work out if this was a gritty, violent prison movie or a comedy. One second you'll be watching a prisoner being butchered by another - then you'll be given a visual gag and some funny lines... then left to wonder if the violence had any relevance at all.If your a Vinnie Jones or footy fan, then you will probably enjoy the last segment of the film. The football match is actually quite entertaining, with some great moments from Jason Statham.Jones actually does very well in his first major role, being the only thing that made Mean Machine watchable. I'd go as far as saying that he is a better actor than he is a footballer (which probably isn't saying much). Jones is a talent to look out for, but first-time director Barry Skolnick isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I can't comment upon the film in relation to Robert Aldrich's original I'm not in a ideal place to talk about the plot or the film's success as an adaptation. I can however consider how the movie presents itself to those in my position - how it stands on its own. It revolves around Vinnie Jones in the same way a local supermarket would collapse to the every need of a celebrity who opens it. Only this celebrity is worth it. Cast with more than a couple from the Guy Ritchie school of movies, the film has it's really funny bits, mostly centred around the star-struck Billie and numerous 'dumb-as-anything-but-quite-sweet-too' charcters. It is however as predictable as a Bash Street Kids cartoon (and borrows some of the story lines aswell.) "Injury time, 10 seconds to win the game, who will the hero be?" What saves the film are the touches of emotion which are carried off so well: scenes with the saintly Old man and when Vinnie wells up in desperation of life in prison while on his bunk. Indeed I believe there's a moving and thought provoking film out there waiting for Jones to appear in (and I'm not joking.) Within the year he'll go serious and really pull it off (Oscars one day?!) Until then he'll have to avoid the films that look like they were made during the lunch break on the filming of Lock Stock.</fullReview>

Lots of prisoners are angry that he threw a game. He befriends smuggler Massive and elderly Doc.

Though this is a remake of sorts (The Longest Yard being the original), I have always been a fan of Britflicks and this is no different-- it exceeds the original in many ways.The trouble is, I am not sure I agree with the selection of Vinnie Jones as the lead. He is a strong actor, no doubt, but I think he better serves a film as a member of the supporting cast-- he cannot carry a film on his own. Instead, this film belonged to the supporting cast (Statham, especially.) Regardless, it is a great film to pass a couple of hours and to keep one entertained.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember my parents telling me they liked this movie a lot after seeing it on Sky Movies . So what you ask ? Well it turns out my parents absolutely detest football so as entertainment this must have a lot more going for it than just soccerWhat becomes clear very early on is that it's not really a sports movie it's a prison movie as former England international Danny Meehan ( Vinnie Jones ) is jailed for three years for assault . To be honest the screenplay exaggerates the English/British penal system somewhat as Danny is assaulted by sadistic screws and rubs shoulders with inmates doing 30 years and meeting Monk who has killed at least 23 people But who said this was a documentary ? It's entertainment for the masses and it does succeed . It's interesting to note that that this was based on an American movie from the mid 1970s and the Brits have done a far better job adapting this than the Americans did with those two movies that starred Michael Caine and by some irony the only real problem this movie suffers from at a producer level is that it's perhaps a little too parochial , I mean would anyone in America understand what the characters are saying ? And since one of the producers is Guy Ritchie he deserves some congratulations to passing the directing helm to Barry Skolnick and letting him direct his way . Weren't audiences getting tired of people emulating Guy Ritchie's directing style by 2001 ? As it stands we have only a recurring cast from LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barrels to suggest Ritchie had much of a hand in it So congratulations to the producers for making a relatively entertaining and commercial British movie . When I come to think about the idea of re-making a mainly forgotten American movie starring Burt Reynolds seems like a stupid idea but it works . I bet this movie will still be more highly regarded this time than the Hollywood remake THE LONGEST YARD which is released this week</fullReview>

The dialogue and the facial expressions have just been cracking us up.

Look out for the characters - the Monk, The 2 game announcers, they make the movie very funny and entertaining.All of the characters were very amusing. Rent these other movies and then watch Mean Machine again and maybe you will appreciate it more. Rent: Snatch Lock, stoke and 2 smoking barrels.

		<shortDescription>Not a bad football/soccer and prison film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1974 American movie, The Longest Yard, Mean Machine is about an ex-pro footballer/soccer player who is sent to prison. Hated at first, he gains friends when he begins to coach an all-convict soccer team against the prison guards' already-established team.I haven't seen the original so I can't compare them but I found Mean Machine pretty enjoyable. Vinnie Jones does a good job as Danny Meehan and it's nice to see him in a role where he's not the scary one. I liked the subtle humour as well, from Massive's ironic name to the unpredictable Monk (the crazy "Scot even the Scots are afraid of" - convincingly played by Jason Statham) to the pair of commentators, Bob and Bob at the final match.The DVD I saw included audio tracks for both the original UK theatrical release and the "domestic" (i.e. American) release. After watching the original, I learned that the American had a few words re-dubbed to make the language easier to understand for these audiences. I then watched the second version and didn't find much of a difference between the two. There were some things that the character Nitro said that were noticeably re-dubbed (which didn't help much considering the way he shouts!) and a few slang terms were changed to more international expressions. I think some reviewers of this film may have been unaware of this and so complained about the more obvious dubbing.The only one I actually found helpful was when a character says he's in prison "for [an abbreviation]." I didn't catch what he said and the American version replaced the letters with "assault and battery." I found one change a bit puzzling though: Mr. Sykes gives the governor of the prison tips for horse racing, writing letters next to his choices on a newspaper. After losing money on a false winner ("W"), Sykes explains to the governor that "it got smudged in the rain. It says EW: either way." This was changed to "EW: to place." I thought the original was quite clear and the new one no longer matches the letters.Overall, it's not a bad film. I liked it enough to watch it twice and if you like football/soccer and prison films, there aren't many that combine the two to choose from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mean Machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Vinnie Jones early performances where the world had not yet tired of his gritty, cockney, tough guy act. Yet shockingly this movie isn't about Jones being an unstoppable tough guy, it kinda is him being a tough guy though, just not the dialog free tough guy he usually is. In this remake of US movie 'The Longest Yard' Jones plays the main role which does actually require some genuine acting on his part. Not a great deal of course, lets not get carried away here, but some emotion is required and displayed.The plot is a simple one, Danny Meehan is a top football (soccer) player fallen from grace. Done for match fixing, then caught drink driving, followed by an assault on two police officers. In prison he makes friends and enemies as you would expect, but its the prison guards and warden who are the real problem unsurprisingly. So to fix this solution, Meehan manages to organise himself as a coach for the inmates, so they can have a match against the guards, because that's just what you do in these types of situations. The perfect way to defuse all hostilities amongst everyone, problem solved. I mean honesty...what could go wrong?I think its pretty obvious not to expect a classy emotional drama here, this isn't award winning stuff. However, I do think its obvious to expect every single tiny prison cliché in the prison movie book. For starters Jones is pretty much playing himself here, when he played professional footie he was of course the tough nut (the Brit footie fans will be well aware of this), and here he plays a tough nut footballer, with a slice of emotion, but essentially its just Vinnie Jones. The prison is your standard British board and lodgings, typically looks a bit old school, almost like going to a boarding school of sorts, not that I know about that. The guards are of course a mean, abusive bunch, the gov is corrupt, and you have the stereotypical array of prisoners. The happy-go-lucky guy, the rasta type guy, the nut job, the psycho, the fat Middle Eastern guy, the wise old Irishman, and the head honcho with his personal enforcers. Needless to say its kinda obvious who does what, who says what, who gets beaten, who gets done in and what happens every step of the way.The cast are the shining light here though, its like putting a Guy Ritchie flick, a Matthew Vaughn flick and a Nick Love flick in a blender, and this is the result. You have virtually everyone from British comedy, film and drama here, Jason Statham (with more hair!), Danny Dyer, Ralph Brown, Vas Blackwood, Robbie Gee, Geoff Bell, Jason Flemyng and Omid Djalili. You're literately only missing Tamer Hassan, Dexter Fletcher, Frank Harper and Alan Ford for a full house. I don't even have to explain the characters they play, you can pretty much guess, Geof Bell is obviously a nasty guard, Brown is the head warden and the rest are a colourful collection of cockney inmates (what else).Its the films mood that swings from one extreme to the other and confuses you. Naturally the film isn't a serious drama, but it does have moments of realism that aren't anything to laugh at, nothing horrific or gory, but emotional and at times slightly cold. Again this does tie in with other Brit flicks by the directors I've mentioned, the movie has that edgy, twitchy side to it where you know anything could happen and it could be nasty. Yet at the same time its almost like a farce or spoof at times, with slapstick comedy, some characters are mischievous buffoons. Take Statham's supposed maniac character, he looks the part and for most of the movie you think he will do something violent, but he ends up being part of the comedic relief. On the other hand, one inmate character called Nitro clearly starts off as a bit of comedic relief, but towards the end he becomes a scary, dangerous and intense character. This guy seemed like he belonged in a Daniel Day-Lewis drama.A definite roller-coaster for your emotions which kinda works at times, ultimately feels very British (duh) and also kinda cheap looking. Nothing special to offer, nothing really new, but it does fit snugly into that now well known British cockney geezer flick genre, made famous by Guy Ritchie. So if you like that kinda thing then I'm sure you'll get a kick outta this (pun intended). It just about does enough to keep engaged...mainly to see Jones acting skills, and maybe the odd cameo by the odd ex-footie players. Bizarrely the director actually tries to portray Jones as some sort of super skilled ex-footie star in this movie, he does realise actual British football fans will probably watch this right?5.5./10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weird mood setting in an entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story rolls in nicely, building the necessary background on the reason why Meehan gets into jail. It also develops nicely by having the prison story details quite complete. We have the protagonist, the antagonist, the traitor, the inmate boss, the guards, and the sleazy warden. It comes complete with the loss, team bonding and trust building story elements, those classics of a prison story. Yet the finale competition swaps all the almost tense serious aura of the prison into a somewhat comedic display of violence, complete with the hooligan style music, and the hilarious commentaries. Vinnie Jones acted out quite okay for this movie. It's just about right because in some ways, it doesn't need an acting skill to play Danny Meehan because Vinnive Jones' previous football career was in quite the similar fashion and nature. Jason Statham, with its less dialog, did give a great color to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend got me all hyped up about this movie, saying it's funnier than "Snatch" and "LSTSB", but my verdict is somewhat different. After the first hour or so,(which is almost on the line of pathetic) the movie takes a turn and actually gives some very funny moments, more or less all of them including the munk(that scene with the heavy metal music is hilarious). But as for the rest of the movie(excluding that guy who spat everytime he opened his mouth) it's one of those quickly made cheap B-class flicks that usually end up on Blockbuster shelves, untouched. But since there are some "fancy" names involved and the Brits love football this movie has apparently become infamous and well known. It's not that bad, but considering who was involved in it, it's a disappointment. 6/10</fullReview>

But the editing, the shakey plot, and the dreadful cliches, combined to consign this movie to the 'made for T.V.' bucket.To be fair, there were some great performances, and Vinnie Jones, despite some critics sniping, has shown that he can hold the lead role with ease and style. The film was manufactured, and contrived, and while enjoyable to brit-film fans, it has not the character or innovation to compare to other British releases.While for an hour we saved the nation in the world cup, our mothers and the other mature people, chatted about serious things, and then dumped us in the bath before dinner.</fullReview>

THE MEAN MACHINE is a remake of the movie 'the longest yard'. it is pretty rear that i find a remake of a movie better than the original. so if you haven't see this movie and you are a soccer fan or you don't like soccer this movie is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The frilm from A Director who wants to be another Director...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> ?Triumph over adversity' is a theme played out many times within the realm of cinema. Unfortunately, films that center themselves upon the buildup for that one event often suffer from certain traits that reduce the film to a mediocre status. Such is the case with ?Mean Machine'. From the school of Guy Ritchie filmmaking, this film is another British Import that is produced by Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels) and whose Director wants to be Guy Ritchie. First Time Director Barry Skolnick adapts the Burt Reynolds film ?The Longest Yard' and creates this aggressive dramatic comedy which instead of using football as the sport in which the American version relied on, the sport of choice in English terms is ?futball', or as many know it - soccer. The discerning viewer who has familiarized himself with previous Guy Ritchie films will easily spot out the many characters within this film that have appeared in both of his two prior films. That is not to say that this film will be a breakout hit for Director Skolnick, but instead this proves to be a mediocre film that will be remembered as good but not great. The film will be remembered as somewhat of a mixed prison-soccer film and may seem quite antiquated at times with its' formulaic ?triumph over all attitude'. Vinnie Jones (Guy Ritchie films, Swordfish), who was once an English soccer player, stars as Danny Meehan; a brilliant English soccer player who had it all, until he lands himself in jail after fixing a soccer match, drinking himself silly and beats on two police officers. Once in jail, the educated viewer will no doubt see the obstacles presented to Meehan, as he must battle abusive guards, a corrupt penal system and other prisoners who want him dead because they lost money when he fixed the match. Yet as time progresses, our hero overcomes these obstacles and makes friends with all the horrible characters in the prison and rallies these men in what can turn out to be 90 minutes of freedom within the thick, white, prison gates. At the request of Prison officials, Meehan is given another chance at soccer glory and is asked to transplant his soccer skills and experience as the coach of the Convicts team at the prison. In hopes of profiting from this, the Prison Governor arranges a match between the Convicts and the abusive guards. One interesting side note is that these vicious criminals who are serving severe sentences seem to be harmless as a gang of misfits lead by the all mighty Danny Meehan. The villains in this piece are the abusive guards who are at the center of this conflict and that serve as the main reason for the role reversal aspect in the film. Besides the film's many incongruencies and bland storytelling, the Directing of the film is lifted straight from Ritchie's style yet simply does not pack that wallop both visually and energetically as Ritchie's films. Skolnick fails at capturing the intensity of the climax, which is the soccer match, which on many occasions can be deemed horribly strewn together. Many quick cuts and scene wipes cannot make this film a refreshing film that will be remembered. The most noteworthy aspects of the film are the characters that although underdeveloped, force us to root for them. Even though these supposed criminals appear to be a bunch of spoiled children. That said, I am a heavy soccer fan and was in awe when Jones showcases his soccer skills; be on the lookout for what he can do with a small tennis ball. Yet, despite the film's build-up to a disappointing culmination, the film was never in contention for being a superb film. From its' promising opening, the film wastes no time at establishing its' motive and direction. Yet, it opens like a cheap made for TV film and then slowly builds its' way in what is to be expected a great finale. The characters in the film despite attempting to be the victims in all of this seem inconsistent and somewhat trivial. We are aware that the film is meant to be a comedy but how can these men who are serial killers and rapists get along so well and work in cohesion for the good of the game? An example, Ritchie regular Jason Statham plays ?Monk' a violent, vulgar criminal who has evil intentions constantly. Yet once given the chance to wreak havoc against the prison guards calms himself somewhat and plays as part of a team? On a final note, the comedy is a little repetitive. How many times is it funny to see someone kneed in the groin in a 99-minute film? See the film and find out. Giancarlo's Rating: **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bastard child of Greenfingers, Lock Stock, &amp; Longest Yard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just found this at my local library, and I was surprised I hadn't heard of it before. Now that I've seen it, I can see why it had gone unnoticed. Featuring a cadre of the main actors from "Greenfingers" and "Lock, Stock, &amp; Two Smoking Barrels", when the opening credits rolled and I saw "Based on the film 'The Longest Yard'", I went "Uh oh". Being an American, is it unpatriotic of me to say I this is nearly the equal of the original? Of course, there's very few movies with Burt Reynolds that are worth more than a glance("Deliverance" being a huge exception). While "The Longest Yard" tried to be so hip and anti-establishment, "Mean Machine" is just fun, and we get to see David Kelly play a sweet old fart. Now there's a surprise, but he's so good at it! One-time sex symbol David Hemmings gets a big nod just for his eyebrows, which are massive, but he has this air of barely-controlled rage that I always enjoy, such as in "Last Orders", and I enjoyed seeing Vinnie Jones with long hair. Hey, it's only about an inch long, but that's long compared to most of his roles. There's some pathos, a tiny bit of sex, and some barely-adequate, mostly slapstick &amp; boots in the groin humor. My favorite funny bit was the football commentary by Bob &amp; Bob(Jason Flemyng &amp; Jake Abraham), and the fact the guards' side wore kit that looked like Barstoneworth United("Ripping Yarns"- "Golden Gordon") All in all, as a prison movie, this is no "Green Mile". It's barely up with "Lucky Break". As a soccer/football movie, it's no "Goal!", but it's better than what I'd expect "Soccer Dog" was. It's fun, I was entertained, and that's not a bad thing. The only truly terrible thing is it forced me to look back at the work of Burt Reynolds for this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mean Machine" was a crisp, "thud"-packed film that didn't fight with clichés, but instead gave us an action-comedy that only the British can conquer. While most will complain that this film doesn't do justice to the original, I must ask if Sandler's did either? "The Longest Yard" wasn't a groundbreaking piece of cinema, and to see a British team remake the film, it is almost like a smile on our American faces. How often does that happen? So, without seeing much of the other two films, I went into "Mean Machine" with a clean slate, and enjoyed every moment of it. This was a fresh film, commercial in every since of the word, but fresh for what we decided to remake and slaughter.I hate sports films. With this film I thought I would watch and return, without giving it a second thought. I thought it would be another cliché moment of the underdogs beating out at the last moment without anyone skipping a beat and winning the female lead at the end. We have all seen these before, and it is the cliché ride that most sports films seem to fall. While "Mean Machine" was similar in nature, what lead to those final moments was really what transformed this film to above average. Vinnie Jones is tolerable. Actually, he is better in this film and shows more range with "Mean Machine" than I have seen him grapple in years. Sure, he was fun in the Guy Ritchie films, but it was fun to see him play the lead this time, while Jason Statham played the muscle. I loved, and in fact love his body of work, David Kelly. He was phenomenal as the older mentor in this film. What made "Mean Machine" stand out was the cast, the trouble I had with Sandler's film was that everyone was fighting to get the best joke in, everyone wanted to be in a scene with Sandler or Rock, but in this one, everyone had their own voice and logic. There were actual characters in this film, ones that stood beyond themselves and created the world we were viewing. With any sports film, there is that inconsistency that could transform the film into a very flat picture. That was never the case here. Jones and his crew gave us direction from point A to point B without missing a beat. Doc, Burton, Massive, Monk, Ratchett, and Sykes brought the prison alive and made us root for a game we have nearly disregarded in America.The weakest part of this film had to be the story. While the characters gave the story a voice as well as characters to root for, there was just something lacking with the story. It was strong, much stronger than most sports films of the same nature, but there was just that level of punch missing that you would expect from any typical British film. The direction may have had something to do with it, but not completely. I can't put my finger on the issue, and I think it has to do with the ability to recycle films ? there is always something missing from each carbon copy. I need to see the original, but alone, "Mean Machine" was directed eagerly, but lacked the depth in the story. I wanted to see Danny's downfall in the beginning, I wanted to know more about him prior to his jail time, the idea of him fixing games seemed minimal in the overall scope of what Danny had to do with playing the guards. I needed that knowledge of whom he was and the struggles that he was facing. Sure, it wasn't meant to be this grand bio-pic, but something (as short as it was needed) had to be there. Maybe I am pulling at straws, but as I look at this picture as a whole, it was a stand-alone film that prided laughs (intelligent ones) as well as hard hitting action, but it needed something more. I could watch this film again, and I would go through the motions, but something was missing. It was like having the best piece of pie in the county, but realizing later that a scoop of ice cream would have been nice as a side. Unknown director Barry Skolnick places this film together well, but I feel as if he could have done more. I didn't need another "Lock, Stock", but I needed something that grabbed me further into.Will I buy this film? Yep, I think I will just because I loathe the 20-minutes of the Sandler version and prefer to give others a taste of what decent remakes are like, but I cannot say that it is the best film watched. My review seems scattered at best, and as I read through it again, I don't think I have quite the grasp on this film as I hoped. I liked it, not loved it, and I could watch it again, but not too often. Bubbles have more consistency than I do with "Mean Machine". Maybe it was Charlie Fletcher's screenplay, but honestly I think I am just grabbing at air. I think what could have toppled me with this film would have been some special features. Something to show me how it was made, an audio commentary to give me a voice for the director, something that would have made me look deeper into this film. "Mean Machine" isn't bland, but I needed a better flavor.Overall, I liked it. I am growing tired of this review and think it will throw others off the trail of this invitingly fresh film, so I am going to stop. I think everyone should watch this. Sure, it doesn't have the bathroom humor of Sandler's version, but it does provide the Brits an opportunity to demonstrate that their "football" is just as exciting as ours.Grade: *** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Longest Yard is a classic Robert Aldrich movie of the 70s. A brutal, funny American Football movie that I have enjoyed everytime I viewed it. So a remake set in England and swopping to football (British style) was more of a curiosity. And a pleasant surprise.Although an almost carbon copy of the original, the film seems more like a homage than a remake, and it makes a change for the Brits to remake a Hollywood classic, and not the other way around.Vinnie Jones, in his first lead role, proves that he's more than an ex football star himself, and actually can act. But once again Jason Statham walks away with the movie, as madman Monk.Very funny in places, quite violent, but it passes the time and is very entertaining. And it makes a change to see football being filmed in an interesting way. Could have been worse...it could have been Escape To Victory 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"THE LONGEST YARD" W/SOCCER HOOLIGANS INSTEAD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MEAN MACHINE (2002) ** Vinnie Jones, David Hemmings, David Kelly, Jason Statham, Jason Flemying. Pointless British remake of "The Longest Yard" with real-life former football star Jones in the Burt Reynolds role of a recently inducted member of a prison run by the unscrupulous Hemmings whose curriculum includes a nasty grudge match between the criminals and the guards. A few chuckles interspersed amidst the brutal teeth clattering on-field violence largely thanks to Jones' co-stars from Guy Ritchie's flicks, Statham as a psychotic goalie and Flemying as a phlegmatic color commentator con.

		<shortDescription>An interesting and fun remake of "THE LONGEST YARD".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally hate remakes, but I enjoyed "MEAN MACHINE".Comparisons are unavoidable with a remake to a popular film, and this is no exception, yet it maintains it's own in a way that an American remake might have not.This time, our superstar is Danny Meehan played by Vinnie Jones. He's a far cry from Burt Reynolds' Paul Crewe, but he's rowing in the same boat, nonetheless.Danny is a has-been sports idol, who lost his stardom due to shaving points off a critical game in his career. After getting arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct, he meets up with the sport all over again, by coaching a team of inmates to go up against the prison's guards in a major/minor game of football.The situation is basically the same, yet there are a few twists here and there to keep things from getting too familiar. The largest of which is that we're dealing with Britain's football, soccer. It is this turn that proves beneficial in giving this film it's own identity.Albert S. Ruddy, the producer of the original, has arranged for this revision, and seems to know all the right chords to make this an effective feature, as well. The performances are key. Jones does a great job carrying the picture, and it's nice to see Jason Statham joining in the fun, although his role seems a bit hampered by too little screen time. The "holier-than-thou eyebrow performance-of-the-year" award must go to David "Oh, my God, is that really him?!" Hemmings as the crooked warden. He's no Barbara Steele, but he'll do.Overall, the "MEAN MACHINE" is an entertaining film and definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible, terrible film. Truly awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it's finally been confirmed to me as if I needed another confirmation that Vinny Jones is an over rated one trick pony, and he doesn't even do that trick very well. The re-make of mean machine is simply awful. The whole thing look swashed out, and that's how it feels. The football, which at least should have been great was so incompetently shot it beggared belief. Some of the script is remeniscent of the original, but it's always a bad sign when there's more than one writer credited as it confirms suspicions of a confused muddle. Not good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Quite Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a really bad movie. Not very creative or funny. All the director did was watch "The Longest Yard" and then re-write it for soccer. He changed very little and added nothing. I like the actors that were assembled here, but they are wasted. If in fact you have ever seen the movie "The Longest Yard," you already know ahead of time what is going to happen next in this movie. What I was hoping for was that the director would try to enhance the story, but he did not even try. Some of the commentary used by the prisoner announcers during the big game was amusing. However, overall, you have a tired screenplay and actors trying way too hard to overcompensate for it. Weak effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that funny or interesting but distracting enough nonsense to appeal to slightly drunk male football fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Meehan is a former football star and former captain of England at the top level. However when a drunken binge leads to an assault on some police officers, Danny finds himself in prison where the welcome is less than, well, welcoming. Struggling to fit in and threatened by guards and prisoners alike, Danny accepts the offer from the gambling warden to stage a football match between the prisoners and the officers. However with few willing to stand up with Danny (and against the screws), things look like they will be near impossible.One of a couple of remakes of The Longest Yard, this film goes for a straight remake but with a UK setting. Despite it occasionally having a serious edge to it, this is mostly a film about laddish jokes, banter and sports. It could have had interesting subtexts about corruption, the impact of sport on society or the corrupting nature of power/authority but instead it just goes for the lowest denominator every chance it gets. In this way it marks out its territory and its target audience and never really aspires to much beyond this. It is a shame really because it is clearly trying serious things but they just come off as clunky and not developed properly. The effect of this is that it regularly knocks the wind out of the fun aspect that only occasionally gets up a good head of steam.The cast do the best they can regardless and, in fairness, they do OK. Jones is pretty convincing in most scenes and only struggles when he is called upon to convey emotion or carry the serious stuff. Blackwood is good value in a silly role. Statham nicely sends up his martial arts personae well. The rest of the cast are so-so and fit in with the general so-so level the film is working on but you do have to wonder why Sally Phillips bothered to show up for such a pointless character.Overall a basic sports comedy. It isn't very funny, doesn't have much of interest and it isn't much cop. At the time I was shattered and just looking for something brainless to fill a bit of down time ? on that level it worked for me, but only just.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never seen Burt Reynolds in The Longest Yard you won't have to listen to me compare the two, with that said,, I loved the all British ensemble cast ,, Jason Statham obviously did a nice job ,, but to me Mr. Vinnie Jones steals the show, I love him in everything he's in it seems.. this movie is about a national soccer hero who screws up in a major championship game is ridiculed by his countrymen,, winds up in prison,, and organizes a soccer game between the inmates and the guards. stirring and compelling look at prison life in a foreign country as opposed to most movies where it's all based in the United States of America. I love all of the British accents, the scenery in the movie is also very nice, above average picture , story of one man leading a group of men to a greater cause, in an otherwise dreary everyday existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prison Guard soccer team play the inmates. Immature C grade film that might appeal to some males I suppose. One Fly Out Of Five</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vinnie Jones has made his name in film in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Gone In Sixty Seconds and Swordfish. Before that he was a tough man football player in the U.K..So here in Mean Machine we have him playing Danny a former professional Football player and getting busted for laying down in an international soccer game and then assaulting police. He lands in prison.The head of the prison, played by David Hemmings, dragoons Danny into coaching and captaining a football team, which will play a team,made up of the prison guards. Lots of money is riding on the game.Sounds childish? It is. Mean Machine is a film about sport, which would have to be one of the most difficult types of films to make, especially if the mood is meant to be comic. Sport is theatre already. Attempting to dramatize what's already high drama is likely to be a let down; especially once the film actually enters the sporting arena. The climactic football game in Mean Machine, when it finally occurs, is a hollow shade of the real thing. These boys should be ashamed of themselves.As far as the humour goes, well I don't think it's funny to maim an opponent on the sporting field. It might be impressive, but never funny. But that's where I part ways with the fans of films like Lock Stock and Snatch who reckon that's it's even funny to seriously maim someone with indifference.Comic violence done to stirring music isn't entertainment. It's just violence. Adding insult to injury by putting this is a sporting contest isn't going to win too many votes from me.One Broken Fly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictably bloody awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didnt expect this to be a work of art or to be up for an acadamy nomination but i would have liked this to have at least have had something original or even funny to watch.Everthing about this film is bad.Where do i start? The acting is bad ,for some reason the words are lip sinked after the scenes were shot as if it is foriegn langauge film . I can only presume this is because the cast couldnt get it right in front of Camera or perhaps its because the dialogue was so bad when the director watched the film back that he had to change it later. The story is so , so, predictable and you can guess what will happen after a minute of the start of the film. None of the characters are interesting and are all steryotypes that are badly acted by a cast that is embarrasing to watch. Especially the Liverpudlian bomb maker who had to gob a pint of flem everytime he spoke.Now that actor needs locking up! All this without mentioning the pathetic climax of the film..the match. The game is played on pitch that would not look out of place at Highbury or The Valley and is surrounded by what is so obviously a carboard perimiter wall. The players wear brand new kits with Sponsorship!!!! and there is tempory terracing and commentators !This is in a prison for christ sakes!!What was the director thinking of? The football scenes are bad , and thats just Vinny Jones ! and the outcome is so predictable it stinks. This pile of pants fits into the catagory of most films about soccer, For some reason it seems to be very hard for people to come up with a good film about the best sport in the world . The only one i can think of is Fever Pitch and that more of a love Story. Dont bother with this tripe. This goes into the bin along with There's Only One Jimmy Grimble and When Saturday Comes. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a film can make your jaw drop every few minutes, purely due to its sheer unadulterated awfulness, its hard not to be biased and overlook the good aspects. But luckily, Mean Machine doesn't have any. Vinnie Jones is crap (and I thought he was fantastic in Snatch), the humour is painful (literally; are you really going to find someone getting hit in the knackers funny 5000 times?) the acting is quite repulsive (and highlighted greatly by the truly toe curling score - believe me, I feel SICK just thinking about it), every cliche is present and correct with nothing fresh added, and there is one half decent one-liner.I felt cheated when I left the cinema, and I didn't even have to pay to see it (got one of those passes innit!!). A waste of time, money, talent (Well, maybe not) and ten times more embaressing for the British film industry than ALL of those worthless Lock Stock rip offs that have been cluttering up video shelves for what seems like an eternity. Hate it, hate it, hate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this film as a free rental and I must say I am glad it is free. This is a pathetic ripoff of one of the greatest football movies ever. I am actually at a loss for words how to describe how bad it is. For some reason I thought it would be a sequel of some sort to the Longest Yard, but was fooled. It is nothing but a cheap immitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid Horrific Idiotic Trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vinnie Jones plays an ex-soccer star who winds up in prison where he must try and stay alive, and win a soccer match. There, the entire film summed up in 24 words.Mean Machine is an appalling mess with every single prison film cliché you could imagine. Really, every single one. Of course, it's not meant to be taken serious. It's not like the film is supposed to be about anything else than the climactic match between prisoners and guards. Not that it's got anything to do with soccer. Rather, it's a poor excuse for letting people punch, kick, and jump on each other.There's a sort of surreal comedy that elevates the film from being just another bad film, to being one that makes you wonder why anyone would want to see it. It's as if the cast and crew of Lock, Stock..., and Snatch had some leftover film and decided to take a day off and shoot a film just for kicks. Otherwise, I can't see who would finance utter crap like this.Then again, judging by the editing, music, cinematography, script, directing, acting, and (I would imagine) catering Mean Machine must have cost next to nothing. You have to be a real fan of Jason Staham's abs if you're going to find any pleasure watching this drivel, otherwise - don't bother. [1/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually I've already seen The Longest Yard about 30 times so I'm pretty p***ed I dropped $25 on this piece of crap. Snatch Meets TLY Meets Natural Born Killers. There's nothing new or interesting or FUNNY in this thing. Just a blatant copy for idiot soccer fans with aspirations of the Big House.I would have thought Matthew Vaughn and Mr. Madonna could have come up with something a little more engaging than this. Pitiful. This thing SUCKS. You've been warned. 0/10</fullReview>
