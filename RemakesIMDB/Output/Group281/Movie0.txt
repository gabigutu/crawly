		<shortDescription>Best I've Seen in a Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original Troma film of which this is based, but I've been looking forward to this one and it was worth the wait! The movie is very well paced, were thrown straight into the horror in the first 10 Min's (and this being a film by Darren Lynn Bousman (saw 2,3,4), there is plenty of horror on show)! Were barely introduced to the characters when the blood starts pouring, but i still found myself caring for each of them! With no sense of what was going to happen next or who was going to die, i was permanently on the edge of my seat! The show belongs to De Mornay, her performance as Mother is as chilling as Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, cool and calm on second but deadly the next. With some memorable deaths, each totally unexpected, and a few twists along the way, i found this film a real surprise and one every horror fan especially should check out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hand That Messed Up Many Cradles!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now THIS is the type of horror movie remake that I ? and surely many other avid genre fanatics with me ? certainly don't mind seeing! The new film by Darren Lynn Bousman, who should have turned his back on the "Saw" franchise much sooner, is loosely based on a 1980 flick with the same title. The original "Mother's Day" is an extremely low-budgeted and trashy production from the infamous Troma Studios. That film is obscure and totally insignificant, but at least the basic premise shows enough potential to entertain audiences even 30 years later. I really wished this is how horror remakes were usually handled. There's absolutely no necessity to recycle near-perfect classics such as "A Nightmare on Elm Street" or "The Fog". We need more directors who dig up forgotten gems and unleash an updated and vastly superior version! "Mother's Day" basically your average thriller about a bunch of people getting home jacked and then subsequently submitted to humiliation, torture and emotional agony. The difference here, however, lies with the entire cast of characters. The homejackers are a totally unseen kind of dysfunctional family and yet the victims are often even more antipathetic. You know, the type of obnoxious and cowardly people prepared to sacrifice their so-called friends in order to save themselves. On the same night a tornado is about to pass through the area and cause a lot of damage, three brothers are on the lam after a failed bank robbery. The youngest one has a lethal bullet wound in his stomach and the three seek shelter in their nearby parental house. Unfortunately, their mother and sister were evicted a couple of months earlier and the house now belongs to Dan and Beth Sohapi, who're just having their friends over for a party. The Koffin brothers take the entire bunch hostage, but then their mommy arrives? Mother Koffin is an intelligent and sophisticated mature woman but, as to be expected, also a deeply disturbed and dangerous psychopath. The homejackers will not hesitate to kill, but the large amount of lies and deceits between the owners and their guests threatens to destroy them even sooner. "Mother's Day" is an exciting and occasionally even suspenseful horror tale full of gruesome torture/murder sequences and pitch black humor. It has to be said that, with a running time of 112 minutes, the film is a tad overlong and suffers from a few tedious moments near the finale. By that time, even the remarks and behavioral ticks of the mother are becoming a bit derivative. Speaking of which, the titular role means an awesome comeback for early 90's vixen Rebecca De Mornay. She was hot in that period thanks to popular thrillers like "Guilty as Sin", "Never Talk to Strangers" and especially "The Hand that Rocks the Cradle" in which she already portrayed a lunatic nanny. De Mornay hasn't starred in anything significant in nearly 15 years, but now she's back and she looks more ravishing than ever. "Mother's Day" contains numerous bloody and hard-to-stomach images, including the eerie intro set in a hospital and a couple of excruciatingly painful confrontations between victims and kidnappers, so it will definitely be popular amongst young horror fanatics. The film does lack that typically raw and brutal edge, but you can hardly blame Darren Lynn Bousman for that, because true exploitation films are nearly impossible to come by these days. As stated before, this is the second film in which the young director showcases his exceptionally talented skills. This and particularly "Repo! The Genetic Opera" are really cool movies and I hope Bousman doesn't return to the long-extinct "Saw" series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MOTHER'S DAY ? CATCH IT ( B+ ) Ever since I heard that gorgeous &amp; brilliant Deborah Ann Woll (True Blood) has been signed on to do a thriller called "Mother's Day" I was anxiously waiting for its release. Finally last week I got hold of Mother's Day and trust me it was more than my expectations. It's not like common violent movies which start with blood &amp; gore. The gore in the movie increases as the situation in the movie gets worse &amp; worse. Director got the perfect cast to play "The Koffins", who invade in a house thinking their mother still lives there and hostage 8 people in the basement. The Koffins are brutal and would do anything to get what they want. Rebecca De Mornay as monstrous mother is powerful &amp; ruthless at her heart. Patrick Flueger as eldest Koffins brother is impressive along with crazy angry Warren Kole. Matt O'Leary is shown being shot &amp; Deborah Ann Woll did a good job as crazy isolated Koffins sister. Among the hostages the girls by far stand out from Jaime king to Briana Evigan, Kandyse McClure, Lisa Marcos &amp; Jessie Rusu everyone did a fantastic job. Among the boys Frank Grillo and Shawn Ashmore did a great job. Alexa Vega &amp; A.J Cook cameo was Okay it was like a "SAW touch". Overall a Mother's Day is a perfect movie to watch &amp; enjoy on your Weekend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie...Great acting by Rebecca Demornay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across this movie out of the blue, and I'm really happy I did.I wasn't expecting much because of the name, 'Mother's Day'; it sounds like a cheap production.Let me say that I enjoyed this move way more than the remake of "I Spit On Your Grave" and "Last House on the Left".I was disappointed to see that it only has a 6 star rating, while the other 2 are slightly higher.The movie does start out a bit slow but if you hang with it until the end there are a few scenes that made this old horror movie lover wince, and that's saying a lot.The acting was pretty solid, and Rebecca Demornay was absolutely fantastic.See it if you enjoyed Last House on the Left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal but highly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another home invasion movie but one with a bit of a difference. Allied to the usual psychopathic housebreakers is the added ingredient of their mother. I didn't really buy into the set up as it's pretty far fetched however that's not really the point of these movies so it didn't spoil it for me. Rebecca De Mornay is manic and slightly over the top as the ruthless mother of the psycho's. The rest of the cast put in surprisingly convincing performances. The film takes plenty of twists and increasingly brutal and at times unrealistic turns but nevertheless always remains horribly watchable. You do almost at times question why you are entertained by the horrific happenings.The film is very brutal and there are quite a few unpleasant scenes so if you don't like these kind of films you won't like it. For horror fans though this is a well made and very watchable film which is as unpredictable as you could wish for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never seen the original but this one's awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another remake that has been churned out from Hollywood over the recent years, and although I've never seen the original I can't really compare the two, but this as a stand alone movie is really good well paced slasher/thriller.The plot = Three brothers on the run from the police after a botched bank robbery. Unable to escape the small town they're in due to road blocks covering the exits. They make their way back to their old house where they hope to find Mother, whom is the mastermind behind these group of criminals. Unbeknownst to the brothers, their mother recently lost the home due to a foreclosure and it's now the new home to a young couple, who just happen to be having a little house-warming party. The brothers hold them hostage, as they await the return of Mother.I've only ever seen clips of the original, but from what I can tell that this is almost completely different, such as the setting instead of in the backwoods America we get a suburban house-hold in which I was slightly disappointed, being a huge fan of backwoods survival flicks, but accepted and understood the necessity for the change. The backdrop definitely made it a more realistic take on the story, which seemed to be what the filmmakers were going for. With all the changes, the movie is now more of a home invasion crime thriller than the horror flick that many might've thought it'd be.The performances in this movie are top notch especially Rebecca De Mornay who plays the sadistic mother showing the audience a kind (yet still devious) and sadistic side of her character and the great lengths that she'd go to protect her family, and it's also nice to see her back in movies again I loved her in "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" back in the early 90's. Other great performances came from recent slasher stars Jaime King (My Bloody Valentine 3D) and Briana Evigan (Sorority Row) they were great together, Jaime King hits all the right notes especially in her scenes alongside Rebecca De Mornay.All in all this movie was violent and brutal at all the right times and offered some decent tense parts that involved our hostages attempting to escape, definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent remake of Troma's schlocky 80s original. Story has three criminal brothers on the run from a bank robbery gone wrong and they plan to hide out in their childhood home. Unfortunately it's not their home anymore, so they take the couple living there and their party guests hostage and violence becomes the order of the day; especially with the arrival of the boys' psychotic mother...It's bloody and bloody intense as director Darren Lynn Bousman updates the original to modern times. Featuring torture and humiliation, it's not what you would call a comfortable date movie experience, but the makers manage to blend the trashy exploitation of the source with today's horrifying home invasion themes with considerable success. The narrative is not perfect, with leaps of faith required for some twists and credulity is stretched to breaking point, but with Rebecca De Mornay on fire as the mad matriarch, the flaws are easily forgiven. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cast, Great Acting, Runs Too Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sadistic members of a villainous family return to their childhood home, which has since been sold, and terrorize the new home owners and their guests.Right off the bat, I have to give full credit to Rebecca DeMornay. She knows crazy, and she knows how to make it both believable and intense. Despite any flaws this film may have, I find it hard to imagine anyone faulting DeMornay for her role.Also, I have to say this is a noticeable improvement over the Troma version. I love Troma, and there are enough differences that this could be seen as a different movie rather than a remake, but the production value and professional cast involved made this a top-notch film.That being said, the film's biggest problem is its length. Running almost two hours, the plot is far too simple for such a length. Cut ten or fifteen minutes out, speed up the pacing, and you have a good film. I kept thinking the confrontations were too long -- get down to it already. I have to admit I lost interest near the end...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far-Fetched, But A Pretty Good Look At Group Dynamics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is actually pretty silly. A group of eight friends are having a party at one couple's home. That couple have only just moved into the house a couple of months before. Unknown to them, the previous owners of the house were a completely dysfunctional criminal family. One night, fleeing from the police, the family arrives back at their own house and take the eight hostage, looking for money that they claimed had been being sent to the house for them. The story was standard home invasion stuff. There was nothing especially interesting about it. There's a lot of violence and a lot of blood. People get hurt and people get humiliated. Standard stuff. What makes this rise above other movies with a similar story, though, is the study of group dynamics involved.There is of course the dynamic of the dysfunctional family. The three kids have an overbearing, demanding mother who insists on being in total control of their lives and has kept them isolated, allowing them no friends and home schooling them to keep them isolated. She's devoted to them - and they are to her - but in an obsessive, unbalanced kind of way that leads to a tragically sad and hopeless family who have no concern for anyone but themselves.More interesting was the look at the dynamic between the eight friends who find themselves as the objects of this nightmare. I suppose that when faced with any kind of crisis, a group can move in two directions: they either pull together and support each other, or they fall apart and turn on each other. In this story, it was the latter that occurred. Few of the eight came across as noble, or even as particularly good friends. They were selfish and they allowed fear to control them. It became very much a "look out for number one" type of environment, to the point at which you weren't sure if couples really cared much about each other, and where friends trying to kill each other became totally unsurprising.I enjoyed the group dynamic portrayal very much. It was well done, and - in spite of it being set in the context of a far-fetched movie - it was surprisingly believable. Frankly, the last scene of the movie isn't necessary. It takes an already far-fetched movie to yet another unfortunate extreme in "far-fetchedness!" That aside, though, this was a surprisingly exciting and relatively interesting movie that doesn't just go over the well-worn "home invasion" plot. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a lot of respect for the 1980 version of Mother's Day, but I don't think it's a very good movie. I find it to be silly when it's supposed to be brutal, and brutal when it wants to be satirical. Still, I can't deny it has a certain charm and really tries to have a sense of fun about it (and sometimes even succeeds). The remake is only tangentially connected to the original, but it's a much better movie even if it loses its funny bone.This time around, the psycho hillbillies invade the tranquil (or is it?) lives of young, successful suburbanites instead of having city folk end up on the loonies' home territory. Ike, Addley, and Mother are joined by little brother Johnny and sister Lydia; the two additions to the family don't make much sense until the end. Anyway, the boys are on the run after a botched bank robbery in which Johnny was shot. They head to their childhood home since they don't know Mother lost the house and it has new owners. The new owners and their friends are gathered around for a birthday party when the boys arrive, but it's certainly no party once Mother and Lydia arrive.What follows is pretty standard in most home invasion and "normal people trapped in a nightmare" flicks: secrets and lies and selfish behavior blur the line between the good guys and the bad guys, there's some decent gore, more than a few intense moments, and a good performance by Rebecca De Mornay as mother. There are a few clever nods to the original, and once in a while the remake has as much of a sense of bad taste fun as its predecessor. Don't go looking for much silliness though - this one is straight horror. Another thing the two movies share is a terrible "shock" ending, although the remake's is better than the original's.While watching Mother's Day 2010, I had a realization: The Devil's Rejects (which this movie feels a lot like) was a less cartoony Mother's Day 1980, and Mother's Day 2010 is a less cartoony Devil's Rejects. Even that may not sound like praise, it is. I found Mother's Day 2010 to be one heck of a ride, and I recommend at least one viewing.ff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a straight remake of Charles Kaufman's 1980 cult favorite Mother's Day. Bousman &amp; his Co. what did here is sometimes what we can regard as "re-imagining" an idea or plot. The premise and even the characters are almost significantly different here as the redneck family in the woods replaced by an extended family of criminals under the influence of a psycho-Mom and instead of having just 2 boys, this time mommy dearest got three sons and a daughter! So it all started when after a bank robbery gone wrong, three brothers on the run from the law head for home, not knowing that their mother has already been evicted from the house. The new owners and their guests, gathered for an ill-timed birthday party, become the brothers' accidental hostages. As one of the brothers is already wounded; one of the hostages, a doctor, he is forced to treat him. And later the brothers' mother, the cold blooded gang leader, and their sister arrive. The way Bousman's version quickly set off to unfold the whole scenario I really started to appreciate &amp; like the film as it progress with good pace &amp; violence. But then, probably after the first-third or half, to make more than an 1 &amp; half hour long film out of a hardly 60 minute story line, it really becomes an excuse to pit the hostages against one another. Forcing them to fight among themselves under imposed scenarios along the lines like "we will kill you both unless one of you kills the other first" not only grows tedious within the confines of the film, but it reminds that even when Mr. Bousman already left the SAW franchise, the tired Jigsaw twisty-tricks are still, intentionally or not, pretty much alive on his mind with the same old question..."what would you do or how far you would go to survive?" Thus, although having a fine premise &amp; cast, it becomes bit annoying in few funny &amp; stupid moments. And last but not the least, the ending! And that was the major disappointment. Overall, only considering the gore, violence &amp; the pace of the film it was fairly entertaining. Worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three imbeciles are running from the law after a bank robbery and head to the house where they used to live that is now occupied by Beth and Daniel Sohapi. A party comes to a sickening halt when the bank robbers crash the party and threaten everybody's lives when Mother demands to know where the hidden money is, giving out a few harsh lessons in the process. This is a nominal remake of the original. Considering I didn't care for the original, my expectations were minimal for this one. I ended up being pleasantly surprised with this suspenseful and brutal thriller. This one isn't just about vulgarity and shock value like Troma's Mother's Day, this one has many interesting subplots at play, ranging from the loss of a child, adultery, betrayal, fabrication, among other things. It is a much more well-rounded script and let me just say that it will hit you with all the tension and violence. We get a pool ball smashed on someone's hand a few times, nasty wounds from the result of a face bashing. We also get vicious stabbings, but the worst might just be a face that is blown off with a shotgun. The acting is very good. Everyone is flawed in some fashion and far better looking than the Troma version, since it is very modernized and not set in the woods. Rebecca De Mornay is chilling as Mother. What I loved about her character the most was the clever ambiguity. She's a polarizing figure that alternates between sweet and sadistic. It always kept me on my toes. Rebecca is no stranger to crazy roles. Jaime King is excellent as our heroine. Her vulnerability was just perfect and she was easy to root for. Frank Grillo is a bit of a scumbag, but he played his part well. Shawn Ashmore does the nice guy routine very well. Briana Evigan doesn't have as much to do, but she's solid. There is an "Are you kidding me" moment at around 85 minutes in, but the thing that knocked me on my ass the most was the ending. It was downright cruel, but extremely effectiveFinal Thoughts: This one has a mean streak like no other. You'll wince a few times, even if you're a huge horror fan like I am. I personally thought it was a solid movie and much better than the Troma version. Speaking of the Troma version, I'm gonna have to revisit that one. It's been quite a while7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting home invasion - Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let us face it - There are many home invasion films around. For some reason, I really liked the momentum of this film and also the fact that there were quite a number of different characters involved. For some reason it gives the viewer an opportunity to find a character they sympathise or identifies with and root for.Also the way that the sadistic "Mother" manages to "read" all the hostages, and come to some interesting conclusions. Quite clever! There is also some things that actually lingers with the viewer after the film is over. One seriously wonders about the actions of some of the victims, and whether they acted to the benefit of the entire group, or if their actions were somewhat selfish. I enjoyed that aspect of the film. This was not a bad film at all. Don't expect prize winning stuff, but for this genre of film, it is indeed worth a watch! Also enjoyed the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing twist that leaves you on-edge the entire 112 minute span.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unsuspecting trio of brothers invades a home their mother once owned after a bank heist--not knowing that a new family resides there now. After their cradle-robbing mother shows up, the deranged family terrorizes the new residents in search of something they'd sent to the house, hoping their mother had received, but that she never did. Viewers tend to view remakes as a nuisance and a waste of time, some bad twist of the original that does it no justice. However, upon viewing this "Mother's Day" remake, I was pleasantly surprised. Actors like Patrick Flueger, Warren Cole, Jaime King, and Rebecca De Mornay made the film an amazing spin of the original, possibly even better. For the first time I'm actually admitting that a remake was significantly superior to its original piece. In addition to the spectacular acting put into this film, the plot and story line picked up quick and left me on the edge of my seat, unable to look away as event after event flowed seamlessly in a perfect sequence. The 112 minute span of the movie was used wisely and I really give props to Darren Bousman for the amazing directing he did on this one. I definitely recommend this film to fans of horror, terror, and themes of home invasion, and anyone just looking for an actually decent remake.</fullReview>

There is probably a good movie in here somewhere but the writing and direction were so artless that it was tedious to watch. Apparently it's a remake of an old Troma film, I've never seen it but it must be better than this (edit: apparently I have seen it, I rated it 6/10 but I don't remember anything about it). If anyone is still reading and really wants to know, Mother's Day (2010) is the story of the dumbest possible people doing the dumbest possible things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother ALWAYS knows best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite sharing the same name as the 1980 Troma release, this gripping and visceral thriller has very little to do with it, instead taking its inspiration from a real-life home invasion &amp; massacre. "Mother's Day" 2010 is grim and ugly, there's no denying it, but it really commands ones' attention and constantly keeps viewers on the edges of their seats. After their heist goes badly, a rabid pack of vicious criminal brothers returns to what they think is still their home but is now owned by somebody else. Soon, their mother (Rebecca De Mornay) arrives to take stock, and charge, of the situation, and she lovingly prods her offspring to commit the most heinous acts imaginable. Director Darren Lynn Bousman, a veteran of the "Saw" franchise, keeps this thrilling and bloody at all times, allowing each of his actors to make a vivid impression. Moreover, the victims are portrayed as being markedly flawed and not always terribly sympathetic. Still, screenwriter Scott Milam and Bousman jerk our emotions around with ease; the homeowner, Daniel (Frank Grillo) may well be a cheater, yet of course you can't help but feel for the guy when the Mother burns a picture of his deceased child. And, for all of their flaws, the antagonistic family does look out for each other. It's these psychological elements and layers that make this more than just simple entertainment, and in the movie, like many others before it, makes that important point that ANY of us can be capable of killing another person provided we're properly motivated. The cast is excellent; everybody brings their A game, with De Mornay dominating the proceedings like a true force of nature. This performance can easily stand alongside her iconic villainous portrayal in "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle". (She still looks great, too.) Even if this movie goes off in a decidedly different direction than the original film, it does deserve a fair bit of credit, as this is one movie that is able to maintain a lot of intensity, even as it runs close to two hours. It also shows a lot of brevity in the end, as it offers the kind of downbeat resolution we don't see in movies all that often. Perhaps in reference to the late actor Frederick Coffin, who played Ike in the 1980 movie, the last name of the criminal family is Koffin. A character is named Charlie Kaufman, after that movie's co / writer / director. Pay close attention and you'll see Charlie's brother, and Troma head honcho, Lloyd Kaufman, on a TV monitor. Filmed in and around Winnipeg, Canada (my hometown). Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

Unlike most genre fans, I've liked most of the reboots Hollywood pushes out including "My Bloody Valentine," "Friday the 13th," and even "A Nightmare on Elm Street." When Darren Lynn Bousman's retooling of "Mother's Day" landed on my front porch, I was interested in seeing what the man behind the first three "Saw" sequels and "Repo! The Genetic Opera" did to the 1980 original. I think the movie is well-done and keeps the viewer in suspense throughout the whole thing. It's not so much a horror film as it is a psychological thriller which leaves you disgusted at what people are capable of if put in undesirable circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of "Mother's Day" was not particularly successful, and yet I could see the potential for a compelling crime drama in which human nature is put under a microscope for close examination. The second half was a catastrophe, director Darren Lynn Bousman and screenwriter Scott Milam allowing it to devolve into a sadistic bloodbath. At that point, it becomes just another faceless slasher film, its potential tossed aside in favor of cruelty, elaborate death scenes, and cheap gore effects. Clearly, they entrusted this film to the wrong director, whose familiarity with the horror genre has thus far done him no favors. I eagerly await the return of the Darren Lynn Bousman who helmed "Repo! The Genetic Opera," the audacious and delightfully campy musical film about organ repossession.Essentially an in-name-only remake of Charles Kaufman's 1980 horror film, "Mother's Day" begins with a brief prologue sequence in which an anonymous woman dressed in a nurse's uniform infiltrates a hospital and steals a baby from the maternity ward. She escaped only because a man in scrubs, presumably another member of her family, was there to graphically stab the security guard in the neck. We then flash forward to the present day ? or, more accurately, to 2010, the year this movie was intended to be released in theaters before being pushed back numerous times (and will now be seen in three cities for a grand total of four days before being released on DVD). That's when we meet three brothers on the run from the law after a bank robbery gone wrong, the youngest brother, Johnny (Matt O'Leary), having been shot and their accomplice having fled with all the cash.They're hoping that their mother can provide them with safe haven until a getaway can be arranged. But when they return to her house in a neighborhood of Wichita, they discover new furniture and all her possessions gone. They don't yet know that the house was lost in a foreclosure and that she now lives in an RV. The new owners are Beth and Daniel Sohapi (Jaime King and Frank Grillo); they're being joined by six guests as they celebrate a birthday in the basement. It isn't long before they become aware of the break-in and become hostages. This is the point at which their mother (Rebecca De Mornay) finally enters the picture and takes full control of the situation. She's a bizarre combination of a polite domestic, a firm disciplinarian, a fierce protector, and a homicidal maniac. She will repeatedly state rules to both her children and the hostages, and she will punish anyone who gets out of line.Getting her sons across the border will require money. Her boys explain that they slowly mailed her $1,000 in cash. She obviously never got it, seeing as they didn't know about the foreclosure. This means, then, that Beth and Daniel have been receiving it. They both claim to not know what she's talking about. Mother orders everyone to hand over their debit cards and to write down their PIN numbers. She then instructs her son, Ike (Patrick Flueger), to take Beth to an ATM and have her withdraw everyone's money. As they go off into town, Mother searches the house for any trace of the money, which she believes Daniel is hiding. She will also employ physical and psychological manipulation in the hopes of extracting information. In the meantime, a party guest named George (Shawn Ashmore), who claims to be a doctor, is forced into treating Johnny's bullet wound. He eventually meets Mother's daughter, Lydia (Deborah Ann Woll), and tries to make her see that she has been controlled through a series of lies.The idea of a desperate situation revealing a person's true colors is indeed a good one. The first half of the film shows promise in that regard, the hostages slowly exposed as being less than authentic. Unfortunately, the filmmakers push for contrivances that could have been transplanted from the plot of just about every soap opera ever made. Ultimately, we're left with very few characters that are even remotely likable. Not that characterization matters in the long run; the second half of the film, which begins when Mother promises Johnny that he will not die a virgin, deteriorates into a nihilistic, random, and needlessly violent series of death scenes. They don't quite add up to a full-blown gore fest, although specific shots come pretty darn close.A final revelation, which actually does little to endear Beth to the audience, paves the way for an ending that amounts to little more than overkill. That overkill even factors into the equation can only be attributed to a failure to adequately follow through on several subplots. Had all the loose ends been tied up, perhaps then we would have had a more appropriate ending, one that doesn't rely on manufactured and implausible thrills. In the hands of a different writer and director, "Mother's Day" could have worked as a humanistic crime drama. Alas, it was handed to filmmakers who care more about carnage than genuine fright. How this movie managed a four-day theatrical run, I'll never be able to figure out. Certain films aren't worthy of being projected on a big screen, even if only for a limited time.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I'm sorry, this review DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS but What a film! Having not seen the original, and unknowing to my mind that this was a remake, I stumbled across this film after seeing the Trailer back in 2010... I can't say I am a huge Rebecca De Mornay fan but she really pulls off a powerhouse performance as the "Mother" in the movie.I can't say that the film gave me a horrific feel because it didn't. I'd say it's more of a suspense-thriller and a good one at that. The torture scenes are quite brutal and like nothing I've ever seen before in a 'Home-Invasion' film or any kind of horror film for that matter.When I watched this film I was quite surprised at how De Mornay's character comes to know the party guests individually, briefly stepping into their personal lives, having not met any of them before she enters the house. For example, the scene in the kitchen when Annette is helping her with the ice cream and De Mornay gets a bit personal with her and says "It must have been hard for you after your daddy left..." How would she know her dad left if she didn't know her? One would wonder.I also felt that De Mornay's character didn't look very 'Vicious' enough; the clothes she was wearing etc. When you get an evil and dark character in a movie you imagine them to look darkly dressed in black, that kind of look ya know? But I felt she looked rather genuinely innocent for the role &amp; very soft spoken. I mean, Anjelica Houston from "The Witches" scared me more and that was a children's film! De Mornay's appearance here seemed to only say it all with her eyes, she had that look where her eyes would go wide &amp; details like that only shown me her nasty side. The whole 'cruel to be kind' attitude just shone from her throughout the entire movie. You'll see what I mean when you watch the film for yourselves.It's definitely recommended for those who are fans of Rebecca De Mornay, you won't be left disappointed &amp; I assure you this movie will have you on the end of your seat from start to finish.Ace film!</fullReview>

From beginning to end it was one horrendous brutal slaying after another. What are movie fans turning into? Is this where we have come to? And the ending was completely wrong and unforgivable. I assume all those involved are pleased that I found this so repulsive. I think this is sick filming. I am sorry I turned this on and even sorrier that I watched it.

		<shortDescription>Great little movie, Brilliant Rebecca but needed editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to admit I am a huge Rebecca De Mornay fan, so I am probably biased, but this was a very effective little suspense flick that just keeps on punching. I remember when this was previewed there was talk of Oscar buzz for Rebecca, but then I heard the releasing company went bankrupt or something and the theatrical release never went ahead. Sad when you consider how much rubbish does end up getting a release. Rebecca owns the movie with one of the best performances by a female lead in years, with great support from the rest of the cast. Direction is good and unobtrusive, but the film does drag a little at times, maybe a more ruthless editor could have just trimmed 5 or 10 minutes out to give it a kick along that it needed. All in all, a flawed classic, not for the squeamish tho. Pity to see Rebecca showing up doing guest shots on dull TV cop shows now. (Hawaii 5 0)This seems like a terrible waste of talent to me. She needs Tarantino to give her a career resurrecting role like he did for Travolta. Ironically they are now about to star in "I am wrath" which sounds like every revenge flick ever... :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's Day is a solid movie that starts out well and eventually devolves into the standard uncreative norms of movies of this type.Mother's Day is less a horror/slasher film and much more of a thriller, but it sometimes thinks it wants to be a horror movie, and there seem to be several thrown in scenes where the director notices that there has not been human blood for a few minutes and decides to change that.Rebecca De Mornay does a solid job as the mother of a band of psychos who come back home only to find that a normal family has moved into their house and is having a party. The kids come home, holding them all hostage and the fun and games begin. Other than De Mornay, the characters are all stock characters, where any hint of originality or creativity is abandoned quickly.As mentioned before, this movie should be a character driven thriller with focus on a stressful situations and moral choices, but it too often degrades into poorly done torture porn which is much less interesting.De Mornay's character is particularly inconsistent, which is a shame as if the direction was better she could have become a cult film classic. This is the true shame of the movie, it is a unique film that continually tries to fight off its personality for the cliché.I was at first pleasantly surprised and then let down by this film. Keep expectations low, enjoy a few good scenes and lament what could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Really Enjoyable Home Invasion Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an attempted bank robbery, 3 brothers head to their home to take refuge. However, as they arrive, they realise that it's not their house anymore and it now belongs to someone else. They take the house owners &amp; their friends hostage, and call their mother. Mother arrives, and after some back &amp; forth explaining, she informs their hostages that they will be let go...as long as they obey her rules and allow her to get what she came for. However, Mother's rules start to get broken one by one, so she is forced to teach them a lesson. As tensions start to build, the hostages become more &amp; more desperate to find a way to escape before Mother &amp; her boys decide to teach them one final lesson.Mother's Day is a really good psychological thriller filled with a good amount of tension and suspense. It doesn't take long to get going either, which is good because I've seen home invasion movies before where they just seem to drag on before anything of note really happens. That definitely isn't the case with Mother's Day. There honestly isn't a slow part in the movie as the pace is kept up really well, and there's a nice wee twist at the end also.Some people have said it was "poorly acted". My behind it was poorly acted as the whole cast do a stand-up job, especially Rebecca De Mornay as Mother, who is basically like an evil Martha Stewart. Patrick John Flueger, Warren Kole, and Matt O'Leary all do great jobs playing the sons, especially Kole who is just plain vicious. The majority of the characters are quite likable (apart from the obvious ones), but you do start to feel less sorry for some of them because of what some of them do and have done.The only thing that's a bit over-the-top is the amount of times that people get battered over the head with heavy objects and still get up as if nothing was wrong. Apart from that, Mother's Day is a very enjoyable ride.Great movie, well filmed, and well acted. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another horror film where a bunch of psychos torture and kill innocent people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three brothers are speeding away from a bank robbery. One of them has been shot and needs help. They drive to their mothers house...unaware that she no longer lives there. She lost the house in foreclosure. Now a young couple live there and are having a party with a bunch of friends. The psychos take over and get their mother (Rebecca DeMornay) to come and help them.This is yet another movie where psychos torture and kill innocent people. Personally I can't stand those types of movies. They're unpleasant and sick--not scary. This is just one more of them. Even worse the acting is so good by everyone it's hard to shake off. The only surprise is that there was no gratuitous female nudity (that's a plus). WAY too long to with a stupid ending. The only reason to watch this is DeMornay. She's incredible in her role. She's so likable but she will kill people without blinking an eyelash. The final fight between her and the "final girl" will have you cheering for DeMorney to get what's coming to her. But it's VERY unpleasant and far too long. I give it a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was actually fascinating good. It was a little bit psycho logic, which I personally like. As you may, or may not know is that this is a remake. Although you wouldn't even notice it, because the remake doesn't look just a bit as the original. I was very impressed by the performance the actors gave. It's very well acted by everyone. And as hard as it sometimes is for movie makers to get this done : Almost everyone was likable, even the villains were likable! If i really search for a bad thing I would say that in the beginning everything was a bit confusing, you didn't know who was who and what it had to do with each other, but see, this is a personal thing. Also hard was reminding names, This because the movie starts with the action very fast, you haven't even met all the characters. But these were really details which can easily be ignored. The movie was not either scary or either gore. It had the right proportions of everything. Anyway I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's day I have never seen the original Mother's day. I don't think you need to, to enjoy this little gem. The main storyline is Beth Sohapi and her husband Daniel has recently bought a house that belonged to a mother and her lunatic grown children (Patrick John Flueger, Warren Kole, Matt O'Leary and Deborah Ann Woll). I am actually kind of surprised the brothers could rob a bank considering they lost the only phone to stay in touch with their mom. It appears that the mother lost the house to foreclosure. The brother's after a blotch robbery go to that very same house thinking it is still theirs. The new owners are throwing a party, and of course all hell breaks loose, literally and figuratively speaking. To add to the mess there is a tornado brewing outside. Believe me this is not your typical paint by number movie. This psychological horror-thriller brings the goods. The first ten minutes alone of this film is worth watching! I had heard a while back they wanted to do a remake of Mother's day. Since I did not have any desire to see the original I wrote this movie off until I saw a preview, it looked like a film I wanted to check out. I did not know what to expect when I heard it was from the director of the Saw movies. I could see the similarities between this movie and the Saw films. Luckily the writers were smart enough to stay realistic in the torture scenes and killings. The movie really belongs to Rebecca De Mornay who steals the show as Natalie 'Mother' Koffin. She looks better than ever. Her personality is a lot like a rattle snake. She can be very sympathetic one moment and then vindictive and evil in the next breath. Jaime King who's is no stranger to horror plays Beth Sohapi . I loved her in Bloody valentine and she is going to be in Silent Night. I thought the character Beth could had been a little more emotionally stronger. I did think Jamie King did a great job with her scenes. I am personally a fan of hers. Some other familiar faces are Briana Evigan from Step-up 2 and house on sorority row. She looks all grown up as Annette and without giving too much away has an uncomfortable dance scene. Shawn Ashmore (Frozen) who is becoming a favored of mine also stars. Lyriq Bent (Saw movies) and Kandyse McClure (Carrie TV movie) are in the film too. The action is non-stop and there are plenty surprises in the storyline. AJ Cook (Criminal Minds) has a neat little scene in the film. I really loved how the film in the beginning and the end had that eighties feel, how they used to make horror films. I also liked how one of the brother's Addley reminded me of the original cover of Mother's day with his suspenders and t-shirt. Nice touch. I only had a few small complaints about the film. Some of the scenes led me to believe some of the characters would do something and when they didn't, I felt a little letdown. I thought Beth needed to be a little stronger. Things I liked the about the film is how fluent the film was. Does not get bogged down or get boring. I was surprised over which characters I begin to care about. The movie has a strong opening. The acting is also strong for this type of film. The film has a great soundtrack. Barrels of donkeys by Killola are my favorite song which is not mentioned on the soundtrack. I personally do not understand why this film was shelved for two years! I wish more remakes where handle the way this one was. I give the movie an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It baffles how a movie this solid could have been exiled to DVD release?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How this movie was overlooked by all the studios for theatrical distribution is a cinematic crime. Mother's Day a remake in name only is a nifty, brutal, character based, psychological horror thriller of the best kind. The film centers on a group of friends partying at one of the couples new house. While enjoying themselves three men break into the house one of them badly wounded. With all the commotion the man of the house so to speak goes to investigate and learns of the intruders. Brutality ensues both physically and mentally. Especially when you learn that the men are brothers and their mother and sister arrive. This is when the games really get kicked into high gear. Now I don't want to spoil anything but the film blossoms both creatively with gory violent set pieces and an intriguing play on the psychological aspect of the situation. Unlike many others Mother's Day delivers on all it's genre's promised gory goods. It earns it scares with a nice buildup of suspense and solid character development. Rebecca DeMornay as "Mother" is so good in the lead villain role it's scary and even creepier is how she manages to come across as such a motherly model to everyone in the situation. Jamie King is also great Beth the films main heroine with some underlying issues that are explored as the film commences. Frank Grillo is also great as her husband Daniel. And Brianna Evigan, Shawn Ashmore, Matt O' Leary, Deborah Ann Woll of True Blood fame, Warren Kole, Patrick John Flueger and the rest of the supporting cast are solid players. It's been a while since I've seen a genre film with such good performances and that goes for the direction and screenplay as well Daryn Lynn Bousman may have started off on some questionable Saw sequels (the better of them in my opinion) , the horrid 11/11/11 and the great Repo! a genetic opera but this may very well be his crowning achievement so far. Too bad that it was pretty much swept under the rug when so many other silly films are released every weekend undeservedly. So if you're in the mood for a grown up genre flick that delivers the bloody good check this one out, it won't disappoint. 4/5</fullReview>

It starts off giving you a hint of what to expect for the film's outcome. The storyline is top-notch and well-thought of. The characters are given a lot of depth and background that it feels very real. Rebecca De Mornay delivers a magnificent performance as the sadistic 'Mother Koffin'. This is probably one of the most darkest crime films I've ever seen. I don't comprehend why its considered to be a horror, but oh well. Though the ending of the film is a large letdown.

		<fullReview>Using the 1980 classic as an extremely vague springboard, Mother's Day hops into 2010 successfully shocking and scaring, as its inspiration did 30 years ago. Rebecca DeMorany proves she is still the mother of all bitches two decades after she terrified yuppie moms around the globe in "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle". The pacing is great, I usually find myself bored during the third act of most scary movies, but this one had me on the edge of my seat. Like most great slasher flicks, this movie will have you yelling at the screen "Don't go back in there!" or "What the hell are you doing??". There is enough gore and nasty moments to please horror fans and repulse the general public but it is not completely over-the-top (like the "Saw" movies). Jaime King is once again very likable, sympathetic and relatable, she did a great job in the "My Bloody Valentine" remake and she is on point here. Nice job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very competent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mother's Day (1980) was one of the many "B-movies" I saw during the '80s, and I honestly do not remember it with much precision nor particular affection, so I started watching its remake with low expectations and knowing that I would not be able to make too much comparisons to the original film. And very surprisingly, Mother's Day (2010) ended up being a very competent remake which offers substance, emotional impact, irreverence and even social commentary in its well written screenplay.I generally distrust of the films which are supported by the "home invasion" premise, because that is almost always employed as a cheap trick to create conflict and force violent situations without cultivating interesting characters nor a solid story (two examples: The Strangers and the remake of Black Christmas). An exception from that sub-genus which comes to my mind at the moment is A'l Interieur, which used the same formula in order to create something fascinating and unique. Mother's Day (2010) does not reach the level from A'l Interieur, but I appreciate the fact that it created a complex chain of relationships, secrets and betrayal between its characters, something which makes it infinitely more interesting than most of the movies from the sub-genus.Mother's Day (2010) offers some grotesque and disturbing scenes, and not only the ones which spill gore with such an enthusiasm, but also the ones which most evidently show the sickly relationship between the mother and her sons. What takes me to Rebecca de Mornay's extraordinary performance, which is absolutely credible as a simultaneously terrible human monster and as a loving mother willing to do anything in order to protect her family. Jamie King brings conviction and an adequate emotional weight to her character. And another member from the cast who stands out is Shawn Ashmore.The complains I have against this movie is that the screenplay occasionally makes some traps and that it also includes some forced elements. However, that does not avoid me from recommending Mother's Day (2010) as a very interesting horror film.</fullReview>

The people who made this clearly do not understand hostage or criminal psychology, let alone have any common sense or practical knowledge of protocols observed by law enforcement. I would love to call it a coincidence to find the only 12 people on earth who may react in these ways to these situations, but I cannot find it in my faculties to convince myself it takes an entire hour and fifty minutes to present them. I dare anyone to find a nail gun without any mechanical safety measures, then, if you can find that, find me a peacekeeper of any kind who wouldn't radio in after being shot and instead proceed to present himself to the person who just shot him. I only ask, did no one out of an entire film crew suggest maybe revising the plot to make the characters and situations realistic, or even comprehensible? Did not one human, in the entire production process did no other person find it, at least, implausible? Is Scott Milam (Writer) an Inuit recluse with access only to half destroyed People magazine back issues and a Dutch dubbed copy of the 1980 film Mother's Day? In it circles does one find the financing to make something as awful as this when it: A) isn't even culturally, artistically, or socially relevant or B) is a movie someone already wasted their money on 30 years prior? I am off-put by all remakes. Sequels are bad enough, but just making the same movie twice is abhorrent and despicable, especially when one doesn't have the ability or resources to improve it. Watch anything else. Please. Reruns of Webster, a local theater production of Nell, your clock for 1 hour and 50 minutes. ANYTHING else.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, three criminals on the run decide to crash their party, which happens to be the boys' old house. They call their mother and from then on, the suspense begins.This movie's plot is a bit like Funny Games and the suspense models after The Strangers, but it does its thing originally.

		<fullReview>No way. This is a wrong movie, the plot completely wrong. From the beginning you feel they all gonna eat it, I had a small hope that they'll make the "mother" suffer at the end, but the script is to stupid for even that. It gives her a prize. No vision in this film only bad gore and cry baby. I rate it stupid. Some of the actors do play fairly good, but not being able to understand their motives doesn't help accepting them. In a movie I need someone I can relate to, here none. Not the crying and sniffing victims neither the bad guys who seem to act more by stupidity than anything else. I really would wish that they'll stop making movies about making other (inocent or not is not the point) suffer and getting off on top. Hated it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie gave me such a pound in my heart, i am a fan of briana evigan, and since these victims in the film have to go through many deadly risks, ill say it kept me on the edge of my seat, hoping she or the other characters i liked wouldn't die, i give this a ten, because not a lot of movies give me that. i say you try to like a character, and hope they don't get killed by these criminals, i usually don't have high hopes for these kind of straight to DVD movies, but this was just WOW. i had no expectations and no idea what this was about, and the fact that some characters were shown not dead yet, made you root for them once more, and for the first time i have seen, the slutty extra lasts up to the final 10 minutes of the film, they usually don't stick around that long, i give her character and writer props, for keeping the kill order un- expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tornado is nothing compared to mother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead.... Well, just one, and its not super important to the story I know the tornado never really hits. But even if an F5 hit directly on top of the house, mother would have kicked the crap out of it.I heard about this a few years back (2009 ish) and upon hearing about it, especially the cast. I was hoping for a winner. Did my best to keep expectations low-ish. I really really enjoyed this picture. It was a tad long... But not enough to turn me off.OK, obviously, mother was amazing. She was ICE COLD! Every line, every tick, every subtle movement... This role was alllllllllllllll her. Debra anne woll (sp?) got a lot more out of the film than i thought she would. I love her on true blood, it was great to see her in a completely different role. The brothers were effective... But there roles got a little old a little too quick.The party guests were mostly real. Which is where they got me. Almost all of the guests were damaged in one way or another waaaaaaaaaay before the break in. These are imperfect people who don't exactly deserve to die, or live for that fact. Overall... I do recommend, if you see the trailer, or read description, and itsounds like it might be up your alley, do yourself a favor, stop reading, start watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beth and Daniel Sohapi are celebrating in their recently bought house with their friends.Beth and Daniel have lost their son in an accident, and Daniel has a secret affair. Thieves and brothers Izaak 'Ike' Koffin, Addley Koffin and Jonathan 'Johnny' Koffin are fleeing to the house of their mother in Stonewall after a heist of the First Omaha Bank.Johnny is seriously wounded by a shot and the gang has been double-crossed by their partner who took the stolen money.When the criminals arrive at home, they discover that their mother lost the house two months ago and now Beth and Daniel are the owners of the place.They violently dominate the nine adults and George, who is a doctor, is summoned to help Johnny. Ike calls his mother and sister to join them in the house.The deranged mother calms down the friends and tells them that they will leave the house early in the morning, after the tornado that is threatening the city.However, when she learns that Ike has been sending money for her for two months, she decides to know who has received the letters and kept the money, in the beginning of a night of horror and sadism for Beth, Daniel and their friends....Another remake of a film I have never heard of, is an exciting premise, but it's one of the most disturbing and sinister films of the year.One cannot deny the power of DeMornays portrayal of the mother, and she ranks up there with one of the screens most psychotic villains.never flinching in the violence, she remains calm throughout the majority of the film, and for a while, I really thought things would go okay, when she arrived at the house, but they just go more extreme.To say that the film is violent is an understatement, but coming from the director of some of the Saw films, I was expecting a little gore, just not acts that made me feel dirty, and a little helpless.For instance, one of the brothers makes two random girls kill each other so the other can live, but just shooting the other anyway, stuff like this isn't really needed, and although I never really criticise a film because of violence, this was not needed.The hostages are not very nice people, but some of the things that they endure makes you sympathise with them. If a man is having an affair, you instantly dislike him, but when the same person is watching a woman burn pictures of his dead child, you cannot help but side with him.The story and narration are great and performances are good too, it's just some of the content leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth and kind of ruins the overall product.And then there's the ending.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though entertaining, a nonsensical plot leaves you underwhelmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca De Mornay is always a great villain in every capacity and this is no different. Her performance is fantastic and generally keeps the film from falling. The rest of the cast do an adequate job, but it is De Mornay who keeps the tension high and makes sure the thrills come fast.The film is shot nicely, just enough gore and violence to keep you wincing, but not too much that the film is driven by it. The script though nothing special gives the villains of the piece something to play with. The victims however seem to fall at this hurdle speaking the same lines you expect to hear from this type of film. Jaime King is the biggest disappointment, her performance is flat and her characters motives are idiotic.The plot is the biggest problem here, the holes in the plot can be seen from space and characters just don't mesh into the story properly. Despite an intriguing premise and knock out lead antagonist, Mother's Day falls in with a lot of sub-standard mainstream horror/thriller's of the moment.I enjoyed the film a lot, but the plot holes unfortunately left me feeling underwhelmed. I spent more of film tutting at it than sitting back and enjoying it. And I'm pretty sure the intention of the film wasn't for me to be rooting for the "bad" guys at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those films that starts out like one of the worst ever, but by the brutal conclusion it actually turns out to be okay. You have to possess a pretty strong stomach for some of the content, which includes impalings, exploding heads and scalpings. But if you're a bit of a sicko like moi (don't tell my doctors) you'll fit right in, as well as appreciate some of the effective use of psychological tension throughout. The screenplay isn't vaguely believable, and some of the line readings will make you wince. But as a completely OTT horror is does the job, and De Mornay makes a great super-bitch.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie the other night after hearing about it on the internet. The movie came out in 2010 and I am a little embarrassed to call myself a horror fan because I have not heard about it until now. The reason for my embarrassment is because this movie is great. Its brutal, twisted and the acting is actullay pretty good by most of the cast. Its the most you can ask for in a horror movie these days.This movie is about three murderer/robbers who are on the run from the law. They plan on hiding out at their mothers house but unknown to them their mother has been foreclosed on and she lost the house. Now new tenats occupy the house and when the robbers arrive they hold them and their house guests hostage.This movie had my heart racing from start to finish. Easily one of the best horror movies I have seen in a while and I pretty much watch everyone their is. This movie is brutal and a very enetertaining ride.

		<fullReview>Returning to their home like normal following a botched bank robbery, a group of criminals begin to terrorize and torment the new owners for the money they believe is being hidden away from them, forcing them into a deadly battle to escape.Hyper-stylized remake that has a lot of rather poor points rather detrimental in nature. The most obvious is the film's extremely long running time which has a lot of extra time in useless scenes or subplots that drag the film's running time out, from the useless antics of the group out on the errands to the different failed escape attempts as the group bickers and complains about everything, leaving this one exceedingly long. Another rather big problem is the stupidity of the villains, since not only do they fail to keep a check on the group but the whole manner of stumbling into the situation is lazy and feels way too contrived, as well as denigrating into a typical Torture Film routine to deliver the majority of it's scares. While the big confrontations are rewarding action scenes and there's plenty of gore to be had, it's too flawed to overcome them.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's day is very enjoyable and will no doubt please horror fans, especially slasher/killer movies. This is quite a movie. Despite familiar materila, it keeps you guessing at every turn. Although the film itself is great, perhaps making the mother much more older, not to mention more evil, would have been ideal. If this is a remake, why did the filmmakers decide to make her younger instead? The mother in the 1980 movie was approximately 10 years older, and probably more evil (I haven't seen it yet). If you remember from about 20 years ago, De Mornay did a similar role in "The Hand that Rocks the Cradle". Actually, that role was much different in tone, that calling it similar is probably giving it too much credit.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mother's Day" actually turned out to be far more nice than I had expected it to be. Which was a nice surprise, obviously.This movie was really captivating, in the sense that the storyline was well thought through and nicely executed by the director, Darren Lynn Bousman, but also in the sense that the people cast for the various roles really did great jobs with their characters.The story in "Mother's Day" is about three brothers seeking refuge in what used to be their house, running from the law enforcement. But the house is now owned by someone else. And the new owners and their friends end up being taken hostage by the brothers, who call for their sister and the head of the family, their mother. The situation becomes very dire for the hostages as the fabrics of sanity in the criminal family is coming undone.Aside from a very compelling and well written storyline, then the movie also had a great gallery of interesting characters, and the movie really allowed the actors to let the characters come to life and even had room for character development and growth. This applied to both the psychotic family and the hostages alike.Natalie 'Mother' Koffin, the mom, was played by Rebecca De Mornay, who really carried the movie so nicely. And I must admit, that I thoroughly enjoyed seeing her in this role, and it was a nice flashback back to 1992 "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle". She did an amazing job in that old movie, just as she did an amazing job in "Mother's Day". But she wasn't the only one putting on some very memorable performance in this movie; Patrick John Flueger (playing Izaak 'Ike' Koffin), Warren Kole (playing Addley Koffin) and Jaime King (playing Beth Sohapi) also put on very memorable performances in their roles."Mother's Day" was sort of disturbing in many ways, as it portrayed some rather dark sides of the human psyche, portraying how cruel people can be and just to what extremes some people will go, and to what extremes people can be pushed. And at the same time, there was a very realistic feel to the movie; brought on by great directing and great acting. The movie was certainly very captivating and managed to keep me entertained from start till end. And there was a couple of nice turns and twists to the storyline along the way, making the movie not as predictable as it otherwise could have been.If you enjoy a good thriller, then "Mother's Day" is definitely well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intensive home invasion flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once seen, never forgotten. That's my feeling regarding Rebecca De Mornay's role in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE; she was one of the most chilling psychopaths ever seen on screen. Others must agree with me, because she repeats a similar role in this home invasion horror story that's apparently a remake of a Z-grade Troma movie from yesteryear.MOTHER'S DAY is an unpleasant film, there are no two ways about it. Much of the film feels like a glorification of violence, and the rest is all about the suspense building up to the next violent encounter. The storyline is simplicity in itself ? a household full of partygoers having a good time is invaded by some on-the-run criminals, who think nothing of murdering anybody who gets in their way. Much of the 'entertainment' value ? if you can call it that ? comes from second-guessing who's going to be the next to bite it, or attempting to work out how the good guys are going to extricate themselves from the situation.I tend to enjoy home invasion movies, not because of their subject matter, but because it's relatively easy to make a successful one. The single location settings bring claustrophobia to the audience and characters, and I always enjoy seeing the captives turning the tables on their captors come the climax. Funnily enough, I recently saw the LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT remake which covers much the same ground as this movie, with much the same style.One of the benefits of MOTHER'S DAY is a pretty large cast which allows plenty of situations, showdowns and scenarios to be explored. One thing that quickly becomes tiresome is having the criminals making the hostages commit violent acts on one another, derivative gestures that are way too reminiscent of the SAW series (with whom MOTHER'S DAY shares its director). The cast is mixed, with De Mornay giving a typically intense performance that really pays off, but Jaime King is so poor as the supposed heroine that you'll be rooting for the bad guys to wipe her out. Supporting players like Lyriq Bent and Shawn Ashmore are much more interesting, but get short shift from the screenplay.Also watch out for the silly twist ending, which is a step too far for this viewer and an entirely unsatisfying way to tie things up. In fact, the whole back story bookending De Mornay's character seems pointless; villains work better with less exposition, not more. Keeping the action within the house would have tightened things up nicely. Still, MOTHER'S DAY works well as a grisly, thrill-a-minute '70s throwback and horror fans should be in their element.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked out the IMDb rating and the positive reviews on the cover and said what the hay.Simple premise in the vein of "Funny Games", "Desperate Hours", the "Last House on the Lefts", or if you're looking for a comparison for something that's equally as bad, try Nicolas Cage's "Trespass".Too many nonsensical situations here. At one point there's one bad guy, Rebecca Demornay, and another bad guy who is incapacitated - yet the 5 cowardly critters in the house don't mount any charge or fight.Rebecca's kids are too old to fit their character's submissive behavior, and the whole premise comes off as pretty stupid.Then the film tries it's Sunday best to use shock value to recover some sort of semblance of a memorable film. At that point it became a laughing stock. I honestly think this was one of the most entertaining films of the year in terms of comedy, but I'm pretty sure that's NOT what they were going for.Don't hold your breath, but this one could hang on to a top 10 worst of 2012 spot.I would definitely pass on this one.33/100 Not quite as bad as "Trespass", but it was a really close race. Grossly overrated here!</fullReview>

Very tense and pretty scary in the fact that this movie could actually happen. Imagine having a party with your friends when a group of criminals with guns show up thinking it's their house. What would you do. This movie is made for me by the fact that Rebecca De Mornay is playing a similar character that she played in "Hand That Rocks The Cradle". She has the same level of "normal-creepiness" that is makes her seem at once normal and insane. To me that is creepy. This is a good watch.

It is suspenseful and it has great actors in it. The story moves along fine and it's plausible (in the context/world it resides in). It isn't for people who cannot stomach violence though. Not everything is explicitly shown on screen, but quite a lot is.I'm not sure about the ending. But then it's not easy to find a good end to this story.

		<fullReview>For almost as long as horror films have been in existence, remakes of horror films have also been made. Through the many decades of horror cinema, fans have seen plenty of very solid remakes, some of which even surpassed their source material ('The Thing'). Over the past ten or so years, however, remakes have become more prevalent in mainstream horror, and the majority of these remakes have either been completely unnecessary ('The Omen') or just downright awful ('One Missed Call'). Every once in awhile, though, there comes a gem from the pile of filth that is the remake market. The most recent diamond in the unoriginal rough comes from 'Saw'-regular Darren Lynn Bousman.'Mother's Day,' the remake of the 1980s Troma classic, focuses on a young couple who, after growing tired of the hustle &amp; bustle of city life, hit the real estate jackpot when they nab a lovely suburban home off the foreclosure market. Unfortunately, it's also the former home of a family of murderous criminals who seek refuge there after a botched bank robbery. Now, trapped inside during a tornado warning, the house's new owners are kidnapped &amp; forced to nurse one of their injured captors back to health.One thing that will always set a remake apart and give it a chance to succeed is simple originality (even if an "original remake" is quite the oxymoron). This is clear by looking at some of the top-tier remakes like 'The Thing,' 'Dawn of the Dead,' 'The Fly,' and so on. On the contrary, films like Gus Van Sant's 'Psycho' prove that cloning films only yield wasteful disasters. Darren Lynn Bousman, who has quickly become a well known name among horror fans for his work on the 'Saw' series and 'Repo! The Genetic Opera,' has created a film here that belongs to the first group. This is mainly because 'Mother's Day' is barely even a remake. In fact, it's just about completely different from Charles Kaufman's original schlock source material. It's actually a bit confusing as to why they'd call it a remake at all instead of making it its own separate entity. Granted, this has happened in the past with "remakes" like 'Day of the Dead, where the films mare almost completely unrelated. With a movie like 'Day of the Dead,' however, there's at least a built-in audience that would increase the profits of the remake as opposed to Troma's 'Mother's Day,' which doesn't exactly hold the same esteem as Romero's 1985 classic film.Regardless of its remake status, however unnecessary that tag may be, 'Mother's Day' works fantastically well on its own. While the basic story has been done many times before, this film does it much better than most. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best home-invasion films out there. Scott Milam's script is a fantastic combination of palpable suspense, gut-wrenching violence, and shocking human drama. Darren Lynn Bousman's direction is also a nice breath of fresh air for the genre, bringing the great writing to life. But perhaps the shining light of the production is the outstandingly wicked performance by Rebecca De Mornay as the mother. Her unsettling c almness and ability to own every scene definitely makes her one of the best female horror villains ever and helps to set 'Mother's Day' apart as one of the best horror films of recent years.Overall, if you're looking for heart-stopping thrills and masterful horror, don't hesitate to give this one a look.Final Verdict: 8/10.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good "extremely loose" remake of a rather ridiculous Troma film of the same name.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a disastrous bank heist that sees a friend of theirs set them up &amp; their brother shot &amp; wounded, two brothers break into the house that belongs to their mother, or that they think still belongs to their mother, as it turns out she lost the house due to bank disclosure &amp; find that there is a couple now living there, who have decided to invite three couples over for a party. Taking the group of friends as hostage, they contact their mother who soon arrives with her quiet, shy withdrawn daughter &amp; plans to torture &amp; kill the group of friends, unless they tell her where her money is that kept getting sent to the house &amp; of which one of them has decided to keep for themselves.REBECCA DEMORNAY who no doubt will always be remembered for her psychotic babysitter role in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, makes for a very good villain &amp; plays the role of the mother quiet well. Director DARREN LYNN BOUSMAN does very well behind the camera, setting up a series of suspenseful, tension filled edge of you're seat moments, along with filling the film with many torture scenes that look very painful, such as a victim being dosed in alcohol &amp; burned with fire, while her friends watch, a guys fingers are bludgeoned with a cue ball, various stabbings, a person is killed with various poisonous powders, hot water poured into the ear drums of one of the victims, various shootings, an attempted rape, a half blown off head &amp; that does not include the psychological tortures that both the victims &amp; the villains goes through. Add to that &amp; Bousman has been able to secure himself with a very talented cast that makes their characters all the more interesting &amp; the film comes out a winner in almost every single way. PLOT SPOILER BELOW!!!!!!!!Like SAW IV, Bousman uses a neat twist ending...by placing it in the opening half of the movie!, before finishing the ending off in the last couple minutes of the film, that leaves itself a set-up for a sequel. By having a baby abducted from a hospital nursery by a woman dressed as a nurse while her son kills a security guard, one assumes it's one of the boys or the seemingly non violent daughter that the mother has abducted &amp; raised to be her own &amp; that the scene was set years ago, however as it turns out, it is the surviving heroine's child that she gives birth to three months after the incident that the psychotic mother has abducted, however this makes for a somewhat bleak &amp; unsatisfying ending, wherein evil is never punished at all &amp; the good, innocent victims are hardly avenged of the wrongs that were done to them &amp; the film goes on for far to long (112 minutes) with Bousman not seemingly knowing when to quit.Despite the title &amp; the fact that a couple of the boys are named after villains in the original movie, the film is not a remake of the really bad Troma classic of the same name (which in itself was a rip-off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre &amp; Deliverance), who's plot included three girls hiking in the woods only to be abducted by two psychotic hicks &amp; their sadistic mother in their backwoods home. This MOTHER'S DAY is a home invasion flick, that despite the tension &amp; tortures &amp; vicious killings is not a horror film at all, but a taut suspense film, with more murderous boys (three) plus a daughter &amp; set in a suburbia, but way better than the original film &amp; just like the original film of the same name, there is no evidence whatsoever that this takes place on a Mother's Day, in fact the original 1980 film was only called that to cash in on other holiday themed horror flicks like HALLOWEEN &amp; Friday THE 13TH. Basically MOTHER'S DAY is yet another torture porn film &amp; unlike the original, which never took itself to seriously, everything is dead serious here. Demornay looked to be headed for big things in the 1990's, following the hugely successful THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, but after a few short years, fell into made for TV movies &amp; direct to DVD films. Shot in 2010, but not released until 2012. Look for TROMA founder LLOYD KAUFMAN in a cameo as a salesman on the TV.*** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Effort...Would Benefit From Extreme Editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good case of a Director in desperate need of a friend. A friend that can say that's too much or do we really need that, or let's pull back a little here. Self-indulgence can be terminal, or at least destructive. This is a film that wavers between engrossing and gross. Case in point. Did the scene in the hospital operating room need to have a close-up of flesh being removed from the patient's wound? This is the result of an ego-maniacal filmmaker. A patronizing point aimed at the cutting edge and shot with hand-wringing sadistic glee.The better parts of the home invasion are horrific, but tense situations are diminished by the scattering of pseudo-psychological scenes that are amazingly amateurish. The placement of people in a "we ALL are capable of killing" predicaments are there, not for any insights, but just as an exercise for the Director's self-aggrandizing.A homeschooling Matron would give this homework assignment a C and would probably write in red..."good effort, would benefit from extreme editing".An overall impression is that perhaps maybe this movie maker could use a bit of Mothering and not left to run amok, and could surely benefit from some discipline.</fullReview>

The Genetic Opera. Therefore it is not surprising that it has blown away it with this film despite desafortunadísimo of his argument in this and other pages. The director inspires - and only slightly - in the movie of the Troma shares with that title, infinitely inferior, directed by Charles Kaufman with best intentions to results. What makes Mother's Day a masterpiece in my opinion, is the treatment of the characters. All, there are few, they are absolutely credible and they act as one expected to do so, in some interpretations, highlighting of Rebecca de Mornay, wonderful. In his hour and peak of footage you grab the guts and not you loose a minute up to a final climax not by expected less worthy. Tension, adrenalin, nerve in its purest form and direction rather than remarkable. If you are fans of the genre is impossible I disappoint them. If they aren't, just after seeing they become. Compulsory. The best: family psychopath led by the recoverable De Mornay. The worst: no lasting three hours longer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the original back when VHS was king &amp; the only thing I remember about it is the opening city scenes were filmed in Jersey City, my hometown.A backhanded compliment to be sure but I'll take what I can get.As to this film, what a waste of time.I hate that a movie like this comes along &amp; it encourages the worst kind of audience interaction possible since I spent the majority of my viewing time screaming at the screen for the victims to do something while the onslaught of evil kept happening over &amp; over again.I shouldn't be shocked that this comes from the man who brought us the first Saw since the original Mother's Day may've influenced that film but when are these neo horror filmmakers are going to get the concept that no one tunes in to see 2 hours of victims being victims.If you're rooting for the villains then they're something psychologically wrong with you.A pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...because I kept laughing all the movie! The hostage characters are so stupid that you don't care what happens to them.The villains are so lame and predictable! The only thing you can rescue is DeMornay...even her acting is a clon of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle...There are 2 or 3 scenes where you ask yourself "really? is this happening? I think I saw it in 100 movies similar to this one" During all the movie you have a sense of Deja vu and you start lo lose interest for the film because the people are so empty of motivation and the director try to do something that others have done better in recent years...Hope for a sequel, this time with Steve Carell!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite an amazing film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I'd heard a lot of hype going into the screening and was skeptical that it'd be able to live up to what's been said about it. Suffice it to say, I have no complaints with the film. Mother's Day is a well-crafted, suspenseful horror/thriller that hearkens back in many ways to the original Saw since while Jigsaw's traps in the original Saw were gruesome (as were the results), the focus was not on the over-the-top gore but rather the rising tension, fear and desperation as a situation spirals out of control for both the Koffins and the victims.From the opening moments of the film, the plot just builds steam and never, ever slows down. The one time I checked my watch, it wasn't out of boredom: it was in the vain belief that perhaps if I checked, I'd discover there was more time left in the film for me to enjoy and savor the characters. The entire ensemble gives incredible performances, from Rebecca DeMornay's disturbed but endearing portrayal of Mother; to Aaron Ashmore's role as doctor to a wounded member of the Koffin family; or the rest of the cast, who each play unique and beautifully damaged characters.Coming from his stint on the Saw films, you might expect a Mother's Day film directed by Darren Lynn Bousman to be incredibly violent. Instead, Bousman wisely plays much of the gore off-screen, with the true horrors left to your imagination. This isn't to say that there aren't gruesome deaths in the film. There's enough to hint at the bloody and violent end to a few characters, but Bousman makes clear that violence isn't a gimmick in this film. The gamble pays off and the film is far more spine-tingling and cringe-inducing than if all the violence was shown in its entirety.A horror/thriller (this film does not neatly fall within the confines of either) with a cast this brilliant is an incredibly rare proposition. The film is a face-paced, white-knuckled thrill ride that will leave you satisfied...and filled with dread.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebecca De Mornay is over the top, yet highly entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'MOTHER'S DAY': Three Stars (Out of Five)Darren Lynn Bousman (the director behind such popular B horror films as 'SAW II' through 'IV' and 'REPO! THE GENETIC OPERA') helmed this remake to the 1980 cult classic of the same name, written and directed by Charles Kaufman (who also has a bit part in the film). I never saw the original but based on the synopsis alone it seems the filmmakers took a lot of creative liberty with this retelling. The film tells the story of a sadistic family of crooks and killers who terrorize the residents, and guests, of their old home after a botched bank robbery. The family is lead by their domineering mother, Natalie Koffman (Rebecca De Mornay in an over the top, yet highly entertaining performance), who they all excessively idolize and look up to. The film was written by first time screenwriter Scott Milam and co-stars the likes of Jaime King, Patrick John Flueger, Briana Evigan, Shawn Ashmore and Frank Grillo. It's extremely dark, ugly and violent and filled with unlikeable characters resorting to animalistic behavior. It's not the type of horror film I generally enjoy but it does work on some levels and De Mornay is a crowd pleaser!After a bank job goes awry, and one of the robbers is shot, three brothers, Ike (Flueger), Addley (Warren Kole) and Johnny Koffin (Matt O'Leary), flee to their mother's house in Stonewall. What they don't know is that their mother, Natalie (De Mornay), was forced to foreclose and give up the home two months earlier. It's now owned by Beth (King) and Daniel Sohapi (Grillo) and their having a party with friends in the basement when the three brothers barge in. They take the couple and their guests hostage and force one guest named George (Ashmore), who's a doctor, to help the wounded brother Johnny. They then call their mother and wait for her and their sister Lydia (Deborah Ann Woll) to arrive. Once there Natalie discovers that her sons had been mailing her money, there at the house, which they need to flee town. The residents claim they haven't seen any money but Natalie won't take no for an answer and the night turns in to a long and gruesome one as she continues to terrorize the hostages until she gets what she wants. The movie has some great gore and some interesting villains, especially De Mornay's Natalie, but there's no one in the film to root for or that's the least bit likable (with maybe a few minor exceptions). The movie is competently directed by Bousman and the acting is all adequate but it doesn't add up to much. There is some decent character development but it all results in characters doing the ugliest of things, resorting to their self centered 'survival of the fittest' instincts (no one is courageous or strong willed in the least). A horror movie should be disturbing and this is definitely disturbing but I still like to have some heroes to root for. If not there should at least be some other driving purpose behind the film. This film has no real purpose other than to shock and disturb, which I will give it some credit for. There are some good things to it (De Mornay is great, Flueger turns in a decent villainous performance as well and Evigan is once again stunningly hot) but there's not that much more to it (and it's filled with some pretty unbearable flaws).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ld28EwmjL8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sadistic members of a villainous family return to their childhood home to terrorize the new home owners and their guests. First the brothers show up, take the party go'ers hostage and then call their twisted but cool, calm and collected Mother to fix their dire situation along with a sister. Apparently the family has been sending cash to this house instead of hiding it under their mattresses like good trailer park families.Pickings must be slim for Rebecca DeMornay these days to have done this movie. Don't get me wrong, she did a good job for her part, the patriarch of a villainous dysfunctional family, but she was about the only one who did. This movie was just not good. It wasn't the worst movie in the world by far, there was an interest scene or two, but overall it is a forgettable one and you may not want to waste your time.Like my reviews, hate em? Comments, or have a DVD you want reviewed before you waste your time and money? shoot me an e-mail at: subliminal.lithium@gmail.comThere was some good gore, a few morbidly comical things but overall, this movie wasn't worth the rating it is getting on this site( which at the time of this review is a 6.2). The story and the turns it takes are somewhat ridiculous for anyone that has half a brain. Most of the acting was bad, but in this case I think it may have just been a bad script and direction. The people who are taken hostage are all adults but together, if this were a believable real world situaution, you would probably think that most of them were in special ed classrooms most of their childhood because none seem to have a brain, even when presented with escapable situations.At a few points it seems to take sort of a "Saw" approach of when presented with a survival situation people will do what it takes and even turn on their fellow captives to survive, but then it waffles back to a "For the best of the group situation," and back again. This just makes everything even more bizarre and unbelievable.I am all about giving some low budget horror a chance, but this one was weak at best. If you are in the mood to see a movie like this do yourself a favor and pick up another movie like "The Loved Ones," "Eden Lake," or the remake of ,"I Spit on Your Grave." Trust me those movies will provide your horror fix much more than this one will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The excessive brutality and gore cover over a weary, ponderous story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A group of young friends are at the house warming party for two of their number, when they suddenly find themselves ambushed by a group of homicidal bank robbers who used to live there, and have reason to think the house has been taken right from under their noses. With the youngest of their number critically hurt from a gunshot wound, the gang become increasingly desperate to see that their young charge is saved. And when their domineering mother turns up, things become even more savage.There's so many remakes coming out these days, it's hard to even tell them any more. Especially when I haven't heard of, much less seen, the originals. And Hollywood, already bogged down in this safe playing strategy with the recession waging on, usually highlights it's own shameful laziness and lack of originality by re-making foreign, art house type films that, as anyone will testify, are often infinitesimally better. Mother's Day is a re-make of a Japanese 'troma B' film in which a group of people were terrorised in the woods, but here the action is re-located to the confines of someone's home.Japanese films also have a reputation for their heavy blood lust, and with this also a disturbing modern trend in mainstream Hollywood films, MD doesn't hold back on this, with an excessive amount of brutal, savage blood letting through out that is pretty gratuitous and not really necessary to tell the story in any way, but makes it stand out (if only for the wrong reasons.) That's not to mention the sick, twisted mind fu*k tone of the film that is extremely bleak and nasty.The film seems to revolve around the theme of sacrifice, with characters routinely being put in situations where they have to choose someone else's life or their own, or characters being tortured for the mistakes of others in front of them. In a subtle way, there seems to be some stabbing at materialistic modern Americans and their ability to empathise and put the welfare of others before themselves.Rebecca DeMornay was memorably convincing in a psychopathic role in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, so is a reliable presence in the lead role here. To balance all the gore and bloodshed out, the film tries to be clever at the end by throwing in some novelty twists to make you go 'aaah.' Sadly, Mother's Day has no real teeth as a story and just leaves a really hollow, empty feeling. And that just really balances any other stuff out. Mother won't be too unhappy with you if you forget this Mother's Day. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Home invasion heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You must please remember that my score of 9/10 is coming from a person who has a passion for horror films, and particularly enjoys home invasion and slasher sub genres, and as "Mother's Day" goes, it is probably not only one of the best home invasion films I've ever seen, but one of the best remakes and horror films I have ever seen. "Mother's Day" was a huge surprise for me, I was expecting just a bit of fun really like the "Saw" films which I very much enjoy, and "Repo!" which I also liked a lot. I suppose what I was expecting was a fun seen-it-all-before slasher, and in a sense I did get that, but "Mother's Day" is definitely a cut above the rest in the way it is executed. There is also a lot more to it than that anyway.My first pleasant surprise was the set-up. At almost 1hr 50mins long I would expect there to be 20-30 minutes of breaking the audience in gently, have a bit of character building and generally get a build up of what is going to happen. This is usually the case in slasher films isn't it? Wrong. "Mother's Day" delves straight into the action straight away and doesn't stop throughout the film, it is just 100 percent thrilling and intense horror which never gets boring. You'd expect their to be a bit of a lull now and then as well, but that doesn't really happen either, the writers do the right thing by building the characters up throughout the film instead of doing most of it at the start, and we actually get to learn a lot about them as the story progresses, putting the audience more in the villains shoes than the heroes."Mother's Day" has also confirmed Darren Lynn Bousmen to be one of the best modern horror directors because he simply knows his stuff. It's obvious that he also has a passion for horror films and that certainly shines through in his directing. It's sharp and tense, and he manages to squeeze a lot of suspense that seems to withhold throughout the whole film! It's almost 1hr 50minutes of thrills and chills. Also, the gore used isn't just put their for the sake of it, it does serve a purpose to the story and characters. It also makes the whole thing really fun to watch.The characters are also quite brilliant. Rebecca De Mornay is absolutely superb as the psychotic and complicated "Mother" who actually is a really deep character to play. Rebecca is perfect and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing her. You also get to learn a lot about the other characters as the story progresses, and so you do actually feel sympathy (or not) when a character gets killed. Although it is quite obvious who's going to last until the end and who is not, but I suppose I'm just being a bit picky their, who cares it's brilliant! The film essentially all takes place in the house and so you feel enclosed, and their is a great relief when you actually do get to go outside. There is just so many thrills and intensity to watch, and because it lasts all the way through it feels like your watching an epic! "Mother's Day" never gets boring and it also isn't afraid to be sick and twisted. The acting is good, the story and characters are interesting and most importantly it is unforgettably compelling. Not many films grab you by the throat and never let go, and this is one of them. Don't be put off because it's an American remake. It is and it's a damn good one!</fullReview>

The whole audience were shaking their heads in dismay. It was cheap entertainment at its worst, and the people who produced this film obviously have no love for the film industry and care only about money. The only reason we saw it in the first place is because the film we went to see was fully booked, and it seemed to be the case with the rest of audience. How do you get your money back for cinema tickets? Do you contact the studio or get in touch with trading standards? I have lost 2.5 hrs of irreplaceable life time. AVOID AT ALL COST.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie should not have been done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the meaning of a thriller or horror movie? Personally I think that the viewer should be afraid after watching the film. It is also very important with a clever story. "Mother's day" lacks both of these ingredients. The plot is about a dysfunctional family in crime that takes people as hostage. These people - a couple and their invited friends - live in the house that the criminal family had lived in before. The family is controlled by the mother and she has absolute power over her sons and daughter. The big problem for this movie that the mother is not at all credible; she seem to be a rather nice character. The other big problem is the hostage situation - without revealing anything the entire situation is not believable at all. I have hard to see how the over all rating is so high that it is. Do not let your self be fooled by the rating - as a genuine thriller fan I am telling you that you will be really disappointed if you watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun and Intense Thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What better time to have the Midwest Premiere of a worthy re-imagining of the 1980 Horror classic Mother's Day than shortly after midnight on Mother's Day? And what better venue than Chicago's historic Music Box Theatre? Hundreds of energetic moviegoers applauded as the red curtain rose, then cheered after a suspenseful, 80&#x2032;s-esque opening sequence was followed by "MOTHER'S DAY" splayed across the screen.Since I'm a sucker for a well-executed contained thriller, what struck me most about this film was how it successfully combined a modern-style contained thriller with 1980&#x2032;s horror DNA to create a unique and entertaining hybrid.One thing that seems to separate many of the modern-day horror films from their 1980&#x2032;s predecessors is the quality of acting. Of course, we expect professional-grade performances from the likes of Rebecca De Mornay, Shawn Ashmore, and Jaime King, but I can honestly say that the entire cast was excellent and provided a marvelous texture to the film. I loved Rebecca De Mornay's sprinkling of motherly advice and care at the most awkward and sometimes disturbing moments. If Nigel Tufnel were to review this film, he would say that these moments "bring the creep factor to 11."Fans of Darren Lynn Bousman and his contributions to the Saw franchise will also delight at what I'll call the "ATM Scene." It was a unique, fun and disturbing cinematic moment that had me at once laughing and cringing. Good stuff and itself worth the price of admission.At times my suspension of disbelief was stretched to its limit. But it actually seemed to add to the experience rather than detract because it was true to the genre and certainly to the flavor of 1980&#x2032;s horror ? any other film that takes itself too seriously would certainly have cracked under the pressure.The Ending:No spoilers here! I could talk about how the ending was a shocking twist and how it fulfilled the necessity in cinematic storytelling that the climax be an "inevitable surprise," but any words I could try to come up with would only pale in comparison to what the young guy in front of me blurted out in that infinite moment between the fading final scene and end credits..."Aaaw, hell no!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid screenplay,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could be much better done if the plot was better crafted. So many silly moments that only serve the idea of keeping the audience (kids 12-18 ears) tense . Each of the bad guys could be dead at least 5 times during the time of entire event unfolding, if the hostages were not extremely stupid (or perhaps the director and script writer). So the viewer must watch how they die one after one...Here are the most funny moments: - When the banker started wrestle with the guy with the shotgun, the black guy was just taking some break and let the poor man to get his head blown off. - Always when a gun is pointed to a bed guy, there are moments for speech and "thinking over", so the bed guy always escapes. - What was this stupid situation with both girls at the ATM: "You must kill each other or I will kill you both"... - There was a doctor, who appears to have some martial art training. So why he never fight with anybody? Why he had to die so miserably? ... I am just tired to write more, but there are at least dozen of w.t.f.-moments ...I am glad that I didn't pay a cent for watching this crap, and used the time also to work out (don't blame me that i didn't pay attention!!! this movie is a no-brainier ). I give 3 points instead of 1, just for the performance of Rebeca De Mornay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this last night purely on impulse and was rather pleasantly surprised. I haven't seen the original Troma flick, so can't compare them in regards to similarity, although I'm guessing the remake is more accomplished technically.Anyway, Mother's Day concerns a group of socialites partying in a newly bought house, who are suddenly home invaded by a trio of bank robbers on the run. It turns out that their mother and sister lived there previously. but were evicted without the gang's knowledge. When Mother arrives on the scene, she's none to happy with the new occupants. So begins a battle of wits between the captives and Mom's nutjob gang, as deceit, twists, and revelations abound...Mother's day is... surprisingly good actually. Usually I'm wary of remakes, as there have been more misses than hits in this regard, but Mother's Day is a well made, reasonably tense and pretty darn mean spirited horror thriller, with several twists and turns along the way, some predictable and some refreshingly left field.With a grim tone throughout, and some nasty and mean violence, it's well worth checking out and any horror fan could do a lot worse. But it's Rebecca De Mornay (who I had a bit of a crush on in the 90s) who shines here. Dressed in a sensible suit, she comes across as a psycho Martha Stewart, going effortlessly between convivial smiles and gracious demeanour, to ice cold ruthless matriarch psycho, whenever she wants her way. Putting in a nicely underplayed performance, she emerges all the more effective as a psycho.It could have been leaner, being a bit dragged out and things start to get a bit ludicrous towards the end, but overall, Mother's Day is a pleasant little surprise, and recommended actually. 7/10. Surprisingly better than average fare, and worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Darren Lynn Bousman is back, however not for the 67th Saw, but on a new tangent, 'Mother's Day'. A bank robbery turns for the worst as three brothers fail to make a swift escape, they take refuge in their old house which, to their surprise, has been sold to new owners (Jaime King and Frank Grillo). Therefore, conveniently the owners are having a party which fuels the boy's blood lust as they perform a couple of violent attacks on the innocent owners and their guests. But the real scare is the Mother (Rebecca De Mornay) of those three brothers.This remake from the 1980 original was in need but still, does not fulfil the potential this film could possess. The story line is not well thought of for example, 'Mother' is simply looking for money that was in her name and sent to this house and we are told it is only one grand (something like that, not a large sum), therefore why would the owners put their friends lives and theirs at risk for just that small amount of money?However the way that the circumstances of the situation show how friendships can be so easily broken down was intriguing, and begs the question 'how far will you go to survive'? This home invasion styled film is showing the survival instincts every person was born with but is not so important as they once were (or so we thought), not really original, but still fairly entertaining.Rebecca De Mornay portrayed the mother beautifully, she was truly haunting and probably the best thing about this film. However, if you're into pointless gore then this will probably be a worthy film for you. I feel that if Darren Lynn Bousman focused more on the psychological aspect of the movie for example develop the theme of friends turning against each other etc etc, it would of turned out more eerie than just gore here, there and everywhere but then again it wouldn't stay true to Darren Lynn Bousman style.</fullReview>

Being a huge fan of the 70's &amp; 80's horror genre I was a bit concerned when I learned of Last House On The Left, II Spit On Your Grave and then Mother's Day??? Much to my surprise all three of those titles impressed me way beyond what I could have ever imagined.

Over the next few hours, all hell breaks loose, as the hostages fight to be freed. Guns are shot, people are hit over the head, they shout, they scream. And are we to believe that none of the neighbours complained?? The killings are absolutely ridiculous. The ending is the biggest laugh.Acting is often poor, but, oddly, Rebecca De Mornay wins the award for the worst performance. The whole idea of a glamorous 50 year old mother dictating events, is just so stoopid for words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Briana Evigan, Shawn Ashmore, AJ Cook, Alexa Vega and Jaime King, some of my favourite actors made me instantly think 'I'VE GOTTA SEE THIS MOVIE.' As good as it is to see them, it's not enough! This FILM IS DIRE. ABSOLUTE TRASH and believe me, I LIKE TRASH. Sorority Row was great and compared to this, it's Oscar WINNING.And for a Darren Bousman film, WAY not enough gore, the characters are so generic and bland, specifically the villains. It's just all in all, TERRIBLE.I'm surprised I managed to last the whole 100 MINUTES tbh, so glad I didn't pay for this tripe.TAKE IT FROM ME as I like the worst of the worst, STAY AWAY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got myself a peek at the movie and it is by far my favorite movie i've seen this year. It went above and beyond my expectations. A ton of suspense, twists, and a pretty large body count. The acting was incredibly realistic. Rebbeca D. Morney plays the greatest mommy figure in any horror film i have ever seen. From beginning to end, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie lets you use your imagination instead of using extreme amounts of blood. It leaves you depressed and sad but incredibly satisfied with what you witness on the screen. One of the best horror movies i've seen in a long time. This movie needs a theatrical release. Its so dang good.10/10I WANT MORE. BRAVO!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Were the original Mother's Day (1980) took place in the woods, the story here is almost the same only it takes place at a home. Back then it was released by Troma and for the geeks they know what they could expect. But the so-called remake is a major Hollywood release and I won't compare them further.It took me a while to really get into this flick. I wasn't convinced with mother played by Rebecca De Mornay. In fact, I didn't like the whole story. It wasn't convincing but still I kept watching because some familiar faces did appear on screen. I recognized Deborah Ann Woll (Lydia Koffin) from True Blood and Kandyse McClure (Gina Jackson) from Battlestar Galactica. And still I thought to recognize Izaak Koffin, and yep, from 4400 Patrick John Flueger. And I can go on with others appearing in horrors. But after a while the story took a different turn and became from a normal flick something brutal. It's not that there are jump scene's in it or that suspense is built but some parts you couldn't see coming. And the red stuff do flows with here and there a bit gore added. And you really need to watch after 'Mother's Day' appeared at the end, something is explained. The director Darren Lynn Bousman also did ring a bell, he directed Saw 2,3 and 4. Don't think to see Saw here but as I stated, some things are brutal and the effects used were sublime. Sadly, one girl has to take of her bra but nothing is shown, not that it needs to but if you go nude then show it. Guess they chose for PG rated?Mother's Day started rather dull and I wasn't into the characters, it took me almost 45 minutes before I really started enjoying it. I have seen the uncut version, be sure to collect that one.Gore 2,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended the screening in Chicago at midnight. This film was very well put together from top to bottom. The cast put together a great performance that made me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Rebecca De Mornay was a excellent fit for the role of the mother. I hope to see this film in theaters very soon! People need to see how good this movie is. The makers of the film really put together a well organized movie. I'm not big on horror movies, but this one I would see again and again. I have already recommended many people to keep their eyes and ears open for Mothers Day. I think once a few people see it they will talk more and more about it, because it really is a great movie that people need to check out! I wish the cast and crew lots of luck on the process of releasing the movie. Director Darren Bousman has out done himself. I think this is one of his best films. Now people go out and see this movie!! You wont be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mothers Day has an awesome cast that helps bring this remake to life. The ending has a great climax with action all throughout.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plain and simple, the movie rocked! I felt the characters really breathed life I to this remake. Also each characters had something fun and interesting to offer as well as being diverse, I definitely chose sides in the confrontations. Between people getting shot, stabbed and beat up the psychological games played stir up emotion that most movies don't. The tension just continues to grow between the cast as the movie plays out but the right people gets theirs in the end; climactic mother on mother battle!!!! On top of that it's the perfect length and was totally worth it! If you like a little gore with your chaos Mothers Day is must see thriller!! Get a ticket, sit back and enjoy the mayhem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Movie in a long time (and i hate horror movies)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was straight bumpin! The entire time I watched I was in suspense. Let the haters hate, but I thought the surprises and secrets were unpredictable. Actors were great. Special effects were great. The story was great. I'll definitely see again. They need to get this flick into a theatre ASAP. I saw this at midnight on Mothers Day, which was more than appropriate. However, it was only a special screening. I don't know why it hasn't been on TV commercials or billboards around time. Mothers day does the original so much justice, and then some. It wasn't some cheesy PG-13 scary movie...it was a legit R film with the right amount of comedy, gore, &amp; action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother's Day - A true Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attempting to remake Mother's Day, a low budget and trashy Troma production form 1980 is certainly a daunting task. For while the film will never be considered anything other than cult it is so completely out there that once seen you can't help but love it. And love you will, but not because it's a great film in the traditional sense but rather because of just how fabulously trashy it is.When approaching the remake it's important not go in expecting a faithful update, the set up remains the same but Darren Lynn Bousman's remake is an entirely different beast and one which is all the better for it. By dispensing with the kitsch humour and feel of the original Bousman has crafted a film which is for want of a better word truly terrifying.The set up is simple, a married couple Daniel and Beth are celebrating Daniel's birthday in the basement of their new home with a group of friend, safely tucked away from an approaching tornado. Unbeknownst to Daniel and Beth their new home, obtained in a foreclosure auction was not so long ago home to the the Koffin Family, a force of nature far more terrifying than any tornado.After a bank robbery gone wrong the three Koffin boys return home expecting to find their mother and sister but instead stumble onto the new owners. The set up may sound somewhat ordinary but the plot is far more intricate and layered than one would expect. Allegiances are constantly changing and evolving as friend turns against friend and as the night wears on and the body count mounts no one is leaf unscathed.Much like the Dawn of the Dead Remake, Bousman has peppered the film with knowing nods to the original. Numerous lines of dialogue pay homage to Charles Kaufman film and Lloyd Kaufman even gets to cameo on the TV, in the background of one scene. It's obvious that Bousman loves the original and that he has poured his heart into creating not just a great remake but a truly superb film in it's own right.The film is shocking violent at times and while this was to be expected the most surprising aspect of Mother's Day is just how well the psychological horror is implemented. This is not some watered down, run of the mill genre picture but one where the most unsettling moments are not the scenes of visceral violence, (of which there are much) but rather the reflective moments where our hostages are forced to look themselves in the eye and consider just what it is they have done. These are not two dimensional characters but fully formed people we come to care about and this doesn't just apply to the hostage but also to the entire Koffin family. That none of our characters ever does anything stupid or unrealistic in a bid to escape keeps us constant involved and on edge.The cast here are at the top of their game but it is Rebecca De Mornay and Jamie King who truly shine. De Mornay as the matriarch of the Koffin family is one of the most unsettling screen villains in a long time. That she never resorts to any form of grandstanding makes her truly realistic and all the more frightening as a result. She is also the only character in the film to have any form of moral system, while our hostages quickly turn on one another she truly values the family system and would do anything top preserve it, making her a somewhat sympathetic villain whose actions are not as straight forward as they initially appear. King as her main adversary turns in a grounded and strong performance becoming every bit De Mornays equal.Special mention has to also go to Patrick John Flueger, Warren Kole, and Deborah Ann Woll who are simply astonishing as the Koffin kids. That said there is not a single weak performances in the entire film, everyone from villain to victim is at the top of the game and it must be said that it is refreshing to find a genre picture starring adults playing adults.Mother's Day is easily the best remake in recent memory, it sits up there with John Carpenter's The Thing as a remake which not only betters the original film but is also superior to most other films. It's a sin that Mother's Day has yet to receive a wide theatrical release as it is easily one of the most terrifying, nail biting films of the past decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh me so Mornay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca De Mornay (the hand that rocks the cradle) stars as the sadistic mother of the vicious Koffin clan who will go to any lengths to get her boys out of a jam that they find themselves in after breaking into the family's childhood home after a botched robbery, not realizing that new owners reside their now. Said owners and a small group of their friends have to contemplate the unthinkable if they hope to survive the night in this remake of a low-budget film from Troma.This is a very sleek film that has pretty good acting, I found it to be very tense, and apart from a few lapse in judgment on a few characters parts (stupid characters are commonplace in horror films) I really liked the film.My Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts Off Good But Quickly Goes Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mother's Day (2010) * 1/2 (out of 4)Really bad remake of the horrendous 1980 film features Rebecca DeMornay playing a demented mom who leads her three boys and girl into their former home, which is now owned by new people. The people were throwing a party so the demented family has eight hostages and they must try and find a way out of the country. MOTHER'S DAY was the first horror film I've seen in a very long time that started off so well only to quickly run out of gas and then crumble into something really, really bad. Since I'm not a fan of the original movie the entire attacking the film for being a remake won't apply to me. In fact, those expecting anything like the original will be disappointed because this just takes the basic idea of the demented family and does something completely different and in fact this has much more in common with THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK more than the original film. With that said, the film starts off pretty good as we get a couple intense situations but then it quickly falls apart for a number of reasons. One is that it runs way too long. At 112-minutes the film runs out of gas before the half hour mark and it's rather painful trying to get through the rest of it. The film should have been cut by at least thirty-minutes and for the life of me I can't understand why the director would have the film drag on for so long. The other problem is that there are so many stupid thing done by the "victims" that you quickly start to hate them and not care what happens to any of them. Yes, every horror film has to have people do dumb stuff but the dumb things here were just one after another and after a while I just got really angry at the film. In fact, it's been quite a while since any film got me so fumed. The one good thing going for the film are the performances. Jaime King, Patrick John Flueger, Deborah Ann Wolf, Briana Evigan and Warren Kole are just some of the good performances to be found here. DeMornay was great to see in a film again and she does a terrific job with her performance. She can be that loving and caring mother but then switch into the psychopath without any trouble. In the end though, MOTHER'S DAY is a complete mess of a film. Yes there's some violence and gore but the film just left me angry and wishing I was doing something else instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family and Human Nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Stonewall, the couple Beth (Jaime King) and Daniel Sohapi (Frank Grillo) are celebrating in their recently bought house with their friends Gina (Kandyse McClure) and Treshawn 'Trey' Jackson (Lyriq Bent); Melissa McGuire (Jessie Rusu) and George Barnum (Shawn Ashmore); Annette Langston (Briana Evigan) and Dave Lowe (Tony Nappo); and Daniel's partner Julie Ross (Lisa Marcos). Beth and Daniel have lost their son in an accident, and Daniel has a secret affair with Julie. Meanwhile, the thieves and brothers Izaak 'Ike' Koffin (Patrick Flueger), Addley Koffin (Warren Kole ) and Jonathan 'Johnny' Koffin (Matt O'Leary) are fleeing to the house of their mother in Stonewall after a heist of the First Omaha Bank. Johnny is seriously wounded by a shot and the gang has been double-crossed by their partner Ethan Poe that robbed the stolen money.When the criminals arrive at home, they discover that their mother Natalie Koffin (Rebecca De Mornay) and their sister Lydia Koffin (Deborah Ann Woll) lost their house two months ago and now Beth and Daniel are the owners of the place. They violently dominate the nine adults and George, who is a doctor, is summoned to help Johnny. Ike calls his mother and sister to join them in the house.The deranged mother calms down the friends and tells them that they will leave the house early in the morning, after the tornado that is threatening the city. However, when she learns that Ike has been sending money for her for two months, she decides to know who has received the letters and kept the money, in the beginning of a night of horror and sadism for Beth, Daniel and their friends. "Mother's Day" is a violent thriller about family and human nature. The idea of grotesque behavior of people under pressure is not original, but is credible and works well in this film. The flawed story uses many clichés and stupid situations and attitudes, but it is not a bad film. Fans of films that use sadism might like this flick. Rebecca De Mornay has a great or maybe one of her best performances in the role of a deranged and scary woman with unpredictable behavior. I only do not understand the reason for so many fake reviews in IMDb since this procedure is usually adopted for awful movies only. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Dominados pelo Ódio" ("Dominated by Hate")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mother of all home invasion films?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've already forgiven Darren Lynn Bousman for his lousy Saw sequels, having since thoroughly enjoyed his inventive horror musical 'Repo: The Genetic Opera'; Bousman now rises even higher in my estimations thanks to Mother's Day, a gruelling home invasion horror film that goes that extra mile to make its audience squirm uncomfortably in their seat.Very loosely based on the early 80s Troma movie of the same name, Mother's Day sees a gang of ruthless criminals, the Koffin brothers, narrowly escape the clutches of law to the safety of their childhood home only to discover that their domineering mother has foreclosed on the property due to lack of funds, and that the house now belongs to a married couple, Daniel and Beth Sohapi (Frank Grillo and Jaime King).With Johnny Koffin slowly bleeding to death from a gunshot wound and a tornado on the way, the desperate brothers hold the current owners and their friends at gunpoint until they can get in touch with 'mother'. When their twisted matriarch (played with relish by Rebecca De Mornay) eventually arrives, she finds that that her 'good little boys' have regularly been sending her cash in the post?money that she has never received and that Daniel and his wife claim to know nothing about. Mother isn't convinced by their pleas of innocence, however, and so begins a night of unimaginable terror for the Sohapis and their unfortunate pals.The cast all give great performances, and the script delivers a few surprises along the way, but what I like best about this film is its unrelenting tension and no-holds-barred nastiness: as the captive couples in the basement gradually realise that survival is most unlikely, they become more and more desperate in their actions, resulting in some stomach churning bouts of violence, with any character?good or bad?a contender for some serious pain and misery. Lynn Bousman masterfully orchestrates this bloody mayhem with seeming ease, wringing every ounce of dread from his simple set-up, aided by some nauseatingly bloody effects (a shotgun blast to the face being the juiciest moment). It all goes to make for one hell of a disturbing, edge-of-the-seat experience.As far as modern-day horror remakes go, this is definitely one of the best!8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for Brianna Evigan in her undies, and great cameos from A.J. Cook and Alexa Vega.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst horror films this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the overall worst horror movies I've seen in ages. You know those crappy horror movies where the victim knocks down the killer, and instead of finishing him off, they just try to run away? The entire movie is made up of this! This movie gave me such a headache that I was yelling for the killers to just finish the job! All the characters were so annoying, I felt the only decent ending would have an atomic bomb laying them to waste and everything nearby.In addition, the ending is so ridiculously predictable, that I laughed my ass off. Just a total piece of garbage. This type of film has been done so much better with movies like Last House on the Left that there isn't any reason for its existence.</fullReview>
