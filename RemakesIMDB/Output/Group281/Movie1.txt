		<fullReview>This film is certainly not for everybody, but it is actually so refreshing to see a movie that is done in this way. It is exploitation at it's finest. It is comedy at it's most tragic! A simple plot mixed with darn good acting, and impressive makeup effects...you really can't go wrong.In my opinion, while still in the same vein as Last House on the Left and I Spit on your Grave, it is not as good. Spit being the best of the 3, but each of them has something to offer.If you're not sure you can watch it, let me give you this scene as an example...one deranged man rapes a woman while his brother takes Kodak Polaroids, and their mother instructs them and leads them on...sound bad, yeah, but take it for what it is. Silly, odd disturbing nonsense. But it was more a "mood" movie, based around the characters and settings vs. the horror of rape and disturbing shots. This kind of horror sound like your thing? Then you're in luck, it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average 80's exploitation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of hundreds of grade-b exploitation shockers cranked out during this period; falls under the sub-category of rape and revenge films after Last House on the Left. This one has better acting and character development, but it's the addition of the crazy Mom character to the typical depraved psycho routine that makes this movie creepy and disturbing. The two brothers are scary slapstick rapists; "Can she spend the night with us tonight, Mom?" Next morning Mom asks "Where's your friend?" The boys tell her "She don't feel so good..." and they all laugh like it's Leave it to Beaver! ("they raped her to death..." my date said when we watched it in the theater back in the 80's.) This movie is also pretty funny, which really helps give you the chills. Probably only of interest to fans of this particular sub-genre. About the Troma release; I understand this movie was edited when it was first released, this version contains all the scenes. The pan and scan job is not very good, I'm surprised they did not release the film in a letter-box edition. Nothing in the movie however is as offensive as the opening promotional spots for Troma. I wanted to give them credit for attitude but I felt sorry for every one involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mother's Day" is great. It works as a horror film, as an exploitation film, and as a satire. It's definitely one of those movies that doesn't seem to have the ability or care to decide on whether it's feminist or misogynistic, but it is a sleazy horror movie and that's where the fanbase for this cult favorite lies. Still, I'm part of this film's following, and that means I like sleazy horror movies that are done right. So many lump things together in these black-and-white perspectives. If it's a sleazy horror movie, it seems that nothing good can be said about it unless it's an overrated bandwagon movie like "TCM". In this, we do have killer rednecks, but that doesn't make it a rip-off of "TCM". These people seem to have more in common with the guys from "Deliverance" than the guys in "TCM", and that's just one of the many differences. As many people have already said, this is about some pretty women camping in the wrong woods before getting abducted by some psychos who are following the orders of their wacked-out mother. The two brothers are amoral rapists/killers who know only what their demented mom and TV have taught them. The mother is possessive and domineering, making sure that she manipulates her already screwed-up kids into never leaving her side. They live in a run-down house in the woods, where the mother teaches them the ways of a "respectable life", which, in her twisted mind, is rape, torture, and murder. This is a deceptive movie because there is some important social commentary going on here, no matter how gory and sleazy the excesses that eclipse such commentaries are. TV serves as these people's window to the world. There is almost always a TV heard going in the background of an environment where a madwoman has been sheltering her children, who have been raised by her to her sick specifications. I was expecting to see plenty of reviews with people calling this a "TCM" rip-off/piece of trash, etc., etc., and my expectations were rightful ones. But what a sorry state things are in when people judge a movie by how little a budget could possibly be afforded by the filmmakers, the name of the production company on the box, or the very basic similarities it has to inferior and less thought-out moneymakers like "TCM". Even as derivative as movies like "House of 1,000 Corpses" are, that movie itself even had more brains than the original "TCM". I hate to burst a lot of people's bubbles, but Tobe Hooper's big, little movie was not the first movie (or even the first horror movie) about killer rednecks. Also, it has been said that "TCM 2" ripped off ideas from "Mother's Day"! "Mother's Day" has more going for it than any of the "Texas Chainsaw" movies I've seen. It may be trashy, but it's well-done trash. The acting is excellent, and it amazes me how many people will trash on good actors when the movie doesn't have a great reputation. I may sound pretty agitated, but that would be fitting because this kind of small-mindedness does agitate me. I understand that everyone should have their own tastes, but if you're going to trash on a movie's reputation, you might as well do it for the right reasons. I would give this no less than a 9 out of a scale of 1 to 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is slow at parts, but when you hit 'Exercise time boyyyys!' you'll be glad you got it.This is one of the funniest sequences i've ever seen. It shows the two brothers doing these completely ridiculous training drills, climaxing when Mother says to Ike - 'Get the big one!' and Ike then grabs a huge watermelon, hoists it over his head and in a fit of rage, smashes it. This is all to the tune of a B-movie horror rendition of the Rocky theme song.I give it a 7 out of 10 A classic for B grade horror lovers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early 80's cultural satire wrapped in a gory exploitative shell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie. When I was a teenager and I first saw it I loved it. Of course then I was enthralled with gore fests. This movie is definitely gory but when I was 13 the satirical vibe was somewhat lost on me. You see Mother moves her two "mama's boys" to the woods. Where she can take what is good from the city and leave the rest behind. What is "good" are all the things you see on TV from Fonzie to breakfest cereals. The house they live in is a marvel of production values. Two thirds of the budget alone had to have gone into decorating the house. It certainly didn't go into the Special effects. Such as the shoddy moment of blood spattering before decapitation occurs. As early 80's slice and dice goes this far outshines the typical camper in peril scenerio. We are introduced to the three main (victims) characters and we even get meaningful flashbacks in their lives. This makes it a little harder to take when they are brutalized. All in all Mother's Day ain't Life is Beautiful but why would you be that aisle of the video store unless you wanted to see some inbred choke on Drano.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique Horror Film; Very Overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Troma and Lloyd Kaufman, I must say that this film is excellent in the horror genre. When I first saw this, I was 15 and it was in June. I thought of it as a good, but "meh" film. Just recently, I picked up the DVD at Barnes &amp; Noble (the DVD has excellent transfer, by the way), I gave it another watch, and I totally LOVED IT!!! Firstly, I love the idea of not just one crazy psychotic killer, but a whole family of them. Ike and Addley (the two sons) are very underrated killers in horror, and should be recognized more. My favorite scene has got to be the opening scene where the man gets killed with a machete. It creates the mood for this film, and both the setup and execution are excellent. A great use of slow-mo for this scene.Second, the characters are wonderful. I feel bad for Jackie. All her life, she has been pushed over and used. I'm not gonna give anything away, but I feel bad for what happens to her.Finally, I love how we get to see how the killers spend their days. I love how Ike and Addley live and act like children. I can certainly feel something when Ike says "You killed my brother!" It sounds just like something a little boy would say, and the way he says it is child-like, too.Overall, this movie is wonderful. Definitely a movie I don't regret picking up at Barnes and Noble (unlike the Wayne's World 2-for-1 pack, which had no special features, whereas the separate DVDs had tons). But sadly, this is one of those movies where people like to look at it as an abomination of some sort to the world of film. I think people should learn to have fun with this film. Just go in to this film with a fun mood.And oh yeah, the remake. Well, I've heard bad reviews on this one (but that doesn't stop me from seeing a movie), and judging by the cover, it doesn't have the charm that the original one had. It looks like one of those horror movies where everything is serious, everyone is cranky, and there are cuss words up the butt. But then, I saw the special features on the Mother's Day (1980) DVD, and a majority of them feature the director of the remake. He seemed really passionate about the original and seemed like a guy who wouldn't want to screw up the original when it comes to a remake. I don't really plan on seeing this remake in the future, but I might for curiosity's sake, and the enthusiasm of the director. I must say, he is really energetic about the original film. He tried looking for the actors who played Ike and Addley (but couldn't find them, since the names of the actors were supposedly aliases), has interviewed the director, and has told his life story about his interest in the film. I like this guy.EDIT: The director of the remake was only in one special feature, the actual person I was referring to was Eli Roth, and the movie he wanted Ike and Addley in was Cabin Fever, not Cabin in the Woods. Sorry about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Words can hardly express how much I love this movie! This is a true 80's horror classic, with a little bit of camp thrown in for fun! I can't say enough about this under seen little gem! For it's time and genre, the gore and killings are just fantastic. I really dig the script as well. I won't say much about the plot, as it is described in other reviews. I will say that in my opinion, the acting is absolutely fantastic(contrary to other reviews).The three actresses (Nancy Hendrickson, Deborah Luce, Tiana Pierce)that star in this movie seem to have a great chemistry amongst themselves. Their laughing and playing comes off smoothly and they are quite convincing as old college pals. Their scenes together flow naturally throughout the film and do not come off as contrived in the slightest bit.The brothers Ike (Holden McGuire) and Addley (Michael McCleery) are SUPERB in their roles!! They truly give off the creepiest vibe with such ease that it's hard to tell that they are acting. Lastly, Rose Ross is fantastic in her role as Momma. She can be sweet, demanding, scary, demented, and creepy without batting an eyelash. People have criticized this film for years but it is a film that really entertains the serious horror fan. I have been watching these movies for 25 years and this is definitely one in my top 5! Mother's Day achieves what it sets out to do!! It scares its audience first, and then successfully makes you care about its characters before terrifying you all over again!! Do you root for killers, do you root for the victims, or do you root for Queeenie?? ;-) Hell .. I root for them ALL every time I watch it!! I am thrilled that Troma released this on DVD! Good job guys!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother's Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three friends(..the rat pack), old college buddies who now live in different cities coming together once a year for a gathering to get away from their lives, decide to camp in the woods and find themselves in the belly of the beast where a deranged mother and her two equally repulsive sons(..who she's training to be perfect serial rapist-murderers)wish to abuse them in every way possible. Like a lot of other rape-revenge films, the girls strike back at their captors when one of the three dies from her wounds. Mother(Beatrice Pons, the mother of director Charlie Kaufman and producer Lloyd)has her boys enacting staged encounters they might use later to innocents on Jackie(Deborah Luce), the vulnerable one of the group, eventually sodomizing and beating her senseless. The other girls, Abbey(Nancy Hendrickson)and Trina(Tiana Pierce), are spared this humiliation and agony, for over night at least, while spending their time tied up to exercise equipment knowing that god knows what was happening to their pal, Jackie, in the next room. Freeing themselves from the room, and eventually finding their friend nearly beaten to death, crammed in a dresser drawer, Abbey &amp; Trina try to flee the residence with a battered Jackie in tow. Into the woods, Ike(Frederick Coffin), the more filthy son, with decaying teeth and dead left eye, is sent out to catch the girls. The film follows the remaining two girls and their return to Mother's den, with a sadistic brand of justice to wield against the scum that wronged them.Troma release which at points is wacky, sad, vile, and violent. The film gleefully pokes fun at the two brothers, Ike, &amp; Addley(Michael McCleery)who are always willing to please, in regards to brutalizing women, their mother in any way possible. They have the manners of pigs and live like them(..Ike even eats out of a slop-bucket).Beatrice Pons lets it hang out as the mother who soldiers her kids in the arts of masochism and proper attack techniques. The ultra-violence is at times cheap(..such as a beheading which couldn't look more staged;a television set is used and one can tell that the innards of the thing were removed), other times effective such as when an ax stabs into a crotch and Drano is forced down a throat. Even an electric carving knife is used(..not shown penetrating flesh, though)to do damage. The girls are given a little development, with each's lives shown before departing for the camping trip. Their camaraderie is pleasant and fun, which makes the inflicted trauma by mother and her boys rather tragic for such a Troma release. Still despite what transpires, the tone rather ever darkens too much for the filmmakers always try to lighten the movie with twisted humor. Still, this is a legit Troma release, and therefore not for all tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trashy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes this was a trashy, sadistic, brainless, backwoods/horror flick but one of the good ones. This was such a wacky flick that it will make you laugh at one point of the nonsense going on and on the edge of your seat with fear the next and it was like an odd cross between The Last House On The Left, American Gothic, Psycho, Just Before Dawn and Deliverance with a little of The Final Terror. The Acting wasn't the best at all but at the same time decent for a trashy b-movie and I was definitely rooting for the three leading ladies which I didn't expect any characters to be likable and worth rooting for. This was a wild, weird and crazy ride from start to finish and it just had me glue to the chaos that was going on and to me this was a pretty memorable horror movie especially one that had no class. It's going to be very interesting what the remake has instore for us and what Rebecca De Mornay will do with the mother role, hopefully it will be way better than this but just as crazy. This was bloody a brutal at times but you could tell from frame one that it had a very limited budget which made most of the kills not that effective and loses some of its shock value but they sure did try and make it inventive. Overall this was mostly entertaining, not that scary or suspenseful but there were some moments here and there but it didn't have a good backstory to it all and that made most of it senseless but it was rewarding in the end but man this was one strange, fuc!ked up movie and I liked it, an undiscovered horror gem in a way. Can't wait for the remake! See it if you are fans of backwoods/horror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant black comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror comedy that pulled it off.Three college chums, all ladies, head to the woods for a reunion and step into a low-budget, female version of 'Deliverance.' A young Fred Coffin and 'Billy Ray McQuade' (he was one of Dudley Smith's sycophants in L.A. Confidential too) play a couple of backwoods cretins that torture, humiliate, and kill for their mama.The title was nothing more than an attempt to cash in on all the holiday based slasher flicks that were all the rage at the time.Did anyone notice the subversiveness? The anti-consumerism message that sneaked in there years before the late great Bill Hicks was doing it.This movie won't go away. That's a good thing. It deserves to be as famous as Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. If you find it, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie left me feeling dirty. It's not "scary" exactly, nor is it suspenseful...nor, for that matter, does it really have a plot to speak of. It's basically a home video of rednecks raping city girls (who later get revenge, but that doesn't seem to be the real point of the movie). It's not sexy enough to be porn and not scary enough to be horror; instead, when it's not boring, it's just sick. My score: 3/10. Watchable perhaps for students of feminism, cultural studies, or for die-hard horror fans. Perhaps also doable at 4am when nothing else is on. Otherwise, too exploitive to register. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mother of all-time bad Troma horror movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone had some mommy issues when making this turd. Honestly, this movie was pretty bad, even for a produced movie from Troma Entertainment. It was just ridiculous. Director Charles Kauffman, the brother of Troma founder, Lloyd Kauffman, really make a movie that most mothers wouldn't like, nor even want to see it. While the violent, rape, and murder might be disturbing, it's not entertaining. The film is gritty, had awful humor wherever it was, and the effects weren't wonderful. At least Lloyd's films you could get a kick out of it. Charles's films are just lame. The story is about three girls go into the forest for vacation and discover that two men are willing to do anything order by Mother (Beatrice Pons AKA Rose Ross). Mother like watching her sons commit acts of rape and murder, why? He don't know why. She's just evil. A good back story would be interesting. Kinda unbelievable character without explaining what reason she does this to the women. Anyways these women are now prisoners tortured by these two redneck idiots and their insane mother. Can any of them escape, alive or will they become another victim? Honestly, I don't care. Those three women are the most annoying creatures in the film. The opening of the film is just three girls talking, talking over photos, then talking on the phone, talking during the trip, and talking? talking? Yes, it's just three bothersome girls schmoozing, not knowing how to shut up. They are not even likable, as in one scene, they wear paper bags over their head and destroy a grocery store for no reason. So when they seek revenge on the two idiots, it's over the way campy. Who knew you can suffocating somebody with a plastic boob? The death scenes are just dumb. A television slamming on somebody head when it's not plug in, yet it's makes weird electronic sounds is stupid. The continuity are just as bad. In the opening decapitation scene, blood is spatters across the car before the decapitation. There are a lot of continuities issues in the film, to the point, it would take a whole page to show every detail. There were a few plot holes too like in the scene where a girl is lowered out of the window in a sleeping bag by her friend, yet comes back upstairs straight after to free her friend, and does not even have to unlock the door. If the door was unlocked, she could have just walked out rather than going out of the window. There a lot of stupid filler scenes. Example are the training montage with a rip-off Rocky theme, the debate of disco over punk music, and a guy stripping to 'I Think We're Alone Now' by 1960s bubblegum pop band Tommy James &amp; the Shondells. I doubt that was the only music star feature in this film. It's just funny that the first victim in the movie, looks like Lady Gaga. That alone sold me. The movie soundtrack is just not scary, it's more a goofy tone. Another problem in the film is the boom mic visible and stupid mistakes like remembering what state they are in. The city scene opens with a caption that reads "Chicago" yet the doorman states that they are in New York. Who does that? You got a downtown with the NYC landscape with a singing cookie woman and with the bum yelling "Rockafeller makes a million dollars a day." Who knew that Chicago looks so similar to New York City? By the way, I know many Troma films contain social commentary, but what is the point of showing them if it's not relatable to anything else in the film. The ending is a bit of a disappointing. The movie talk throughout the film about the mother having an evil sister named Queeny that roaming the woods who eat people? It would be awesome if they have, show that. I think the movie isn't scary at all, but what I heard about the production is, a bit scary. Prior to filming, a dead body was found in the house used in the film. The house used in the film was an actual house in the woods of Newton, New Jersey. No one had lived there for 15 years prior to filming. The previous owner of the home was murdered there. Also at the same area where they were filming. Shot across the lake at the same time was the original Friday the 13th (1980) was being filmed. Why couldn't I be watching that? Nevertheless, this movie was remake in 2010's with the same name. Everything about that 2010 remake is different besides the title. So I wouldn't call it a remake. Still, this movie will always be that vile mean-spirited turd gift that would ruins mother's day if given to anybody to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appreciable skewering of maternal love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This memorably wild movie is a good little combination of horror and exploitation, focusing on three old college girl friends who go on a camping trip and end up at the mercy of a demented old crone and her two sons / henchmen, who put the girls through some real hell, acting out some cruel and elaborate fantasies. All the while, the crone encourages the two sons, who are just as devoted to mom as they are mostly lacking in the brains department.It's easy to take this one at face value and see a rollicking revenge saga with a general air of depravity, some brilliant gags (Drano &amp; electric carving knife, anyone?), and a priceless &amp; creepy ending. But director / co-writer Charles Kaufman (brother of Troma boss Lloyd Kaufman) and co-writer Warren Leight have got more on their mind than just titillation, as the amusing and interesting touches and moments they add throughout definitely add to the experience. Just for one example, what this nasty family truly takes exception to is being called "backwoods", when they consider themselves properly "city-fied", possessing what they see as all of the amenities required for comfortable living by city folk.This was a true family affair for the Kaufman family, as Lloyd takes an associate producer credit, sister Susan Kaufman was production designer, and father Stanley Kaufman appears on screen as the old man at the pool party. Susan and the art department really need to take a bow here what with the look they give the antagonists' house.And what wonderful antagonists these people are; all three performers (Frederick Coffin as Ike, Michael McCleery as Addley, and Beatrice Pons as the mother, acting under pseudonyms) give this material everything they've got. And the three ladies playing the victims (Nancy Hendrickson as Abbey, Deborah Luce as Jackie, and Tiana Pierce as Trina) are quite likable and sympathetic, and the first half hour, which largely is devoted to character as the girls get introduced, is both funny and sweet. Of course, this does come after a hilarious opening bit where the mother &amp; sons turn the tables on two lowlifes.The gore isn't as impressive as other elements in the movie, but in its way it does create some chuckles, such as the way the camera lingers too long on an obviously fake head.This is entertaining stuff; at the least, it's certainly not boring, and genre fans are sure to consider it a hoot. The climactic action makes it all worthwhile, and one has to like any movie where instead of fades to black, we get fades to yellow!Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm no prude, but this is pretty wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we see the Troma brand attached to a film, it's safe to guess that we're in store for a low budget affair where bad taste isn't just probable, it's practically mandatory. Despite being one of the earliest efforts from Troma's principal players (it may even be their first; I haven't looked it up), their tested formula is firmly in place for Mother's Day, and the aesthetic on display here isn't much different than you'll find in their relatively more polished later offerings.I'll confess that I outgrew Troma's particular brand of sophomoric macabre humor by the time I was 12, so I haven't stumbled across too many of the company's films that have engaged me enough to consider them entertaining, and I consider the bulk of their catalog downright unwatchable. I don't say this to insult any of the thousands of fans who have made the Troma name a profitable and noteworthy entity in the exploitation film canon, nor am I trying to profess to be somehow more sophisticated than those who enjoy Troma movies. I just think its fair to preface this review by saying where I stand so that Troma enthusiasts will have the luxury of taking anything I say about Mother's Day with a grain of salt.For me, Mother's Day stands apart from the Troma legacy, since I first saw this film years before The Toxic Avenger put the company on the map (my original VHS copy of Mother's Day didn't even mention the Troma name anywhere on it). While this movie certainly resembles the later work that would show up touting Troma's stamp of approval, since it arrived in 1980 its lineage for me is more closely tied to the golden age of splatter. Thus, I found myself comparing Mother's Day more frequently to the crop of classic slasher films which arrived in the early 80's, instead of the work that these film-makers would make down the road.No matter what your reference point for Mother's Day is, it's ultimately a pretty lousy movie that sets an early benchmark for sleazy cheapness and relies so heavily on sexually charged violence that it would probably come across as misogynistic if there was anything here that indicated we should take any part of the film seriously. Fans of this movie tout it as a black comedy, but since it isn't the least bit funny (one of the girls, get this... steps in poo! LOL!), the lame attempts at juvenile humor only serve to make the more vicious material here feel far too excessive to fit into a film that spends such a significant portion of its running time striving to be light-hearted. (The extended flashback of the prank the girls play on "Dobber" belongs in one of the era's raunchy teen comedies, not here).As a true horror film, Mother's Day might have been disturbing and, well, horrifying. As a quasi-comedy, this movie instead becomes awkward viewing, especially when our two knuckle-dragging sadists start up their mirthful games of degradation. Watching these backwoods yokels rape one of the unfortunate women who stumble into their nexus while their adoring mother gleefully cheers them on isn't really shocking or unsettling, it's just sort of gross.Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to deny Mother's Day any positive attributes. The second half of the film is much stronger than the first, and when the action shifts to the girls' struggle for escape and survival, we get something much closer to a horror film. The vengeance meted out to Ike and Adley is savage and fitting, and since it's what the movie seems to be promising all along, the payoff is at least satisfying. While the Ma and her boys ensemble seems content to portray caricatures of psychopaths, all three leading ladies take the material far more seriously than I do, and their performances are uniformly impressive. There are even a few truly harrowing scenes, most notably the cringe-inducing sequence during the girls' escape where Abbey is forced to allow her hands to become sickeningly mangled to spare Trina from literally falling back into the clutches of their tormentors.However, while this isn't a film you're likely to forget, Mother's Day is nowhere near as fun or clever as it thinks it is. And as far as actual horror goes, the bulk of the film lands with a resounding thud, which should be impossible when the plot calls for such brutal sequences of torture, rape, and murder. The disjointed tone simply isn't conducive to a stirring experience, and Troma logo or no Troma logo, what we end up with here is largely too crass and trashy to have any serious impact.Rumor has it that Friday The 13th was being filmed at the exact same time across the lake from the locale used in Mother's Day. Maybe the future Troma squad should have rowed on over to take some notes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but makes for an okay time passer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this early 80's horror item from TROMA, a mother &amp; her two vicious odd ball sons capture, rape &amp; torture three females, former college friends, who are camping in the woods over the weekend. However one can only take so much abuse &amp; soon the girls turn the tables on their attackers to show them what fear really tastes like. MOTHER'S DAY is a film I have wanted to see for years now. I always remembered the video box art staring back at me when I was a kid, but never did get a round to seeing it. Recently I was able to find an old VHS copy &amp; sat down to watch it &amp; while the film is definitely not great, it actually manages to be a brutal ride of gory horror mayhem. The films acting is pretty terrible, but CHARLES KAUFMAN (Whatever became of this guy anyways?) does fairly well at directing &amp; doesn't get to overly silly with the story. The film has a tight pace to it &amp; plenty of edge of your seat suspense. Despite the overly familiarity of the story (Backwoods maniacs abducting, terrorizing &amp; killing their victims) the film was sort of a hampered experience for me, but given this was made in 1980 when the plot wasn't used all that much, I can well imagine it was a pretty inventive plot at the time &amp; I really liked the twist ending the film had, that in reality with it's newest villain, would have made for a truly terrifying sequel. Despite the title, the film doesn't appear to be set on "Mother's Day" (at least not that I'm aware of) it just appears to be a clever title used by the film-makers. All in all MOTHER'S DAY isn't a great film, it actually borders on good to mediocre, but at least the production tries &amp; the film is miles better than most of the stuff their churning out these days. Recommended to fans of the genre only, not highly recommended mind you, but worth a look if you can find a copy. Supposedly remade in 2011 with the same name.**1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Troma Ushering in the '80s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Produced in 1979 and distributed by Troma Entertainment, Mother's Day was directed by Charles Kaufman (brother to the famous Lloyd Kaufman who founded Troma Studios in the mid '70s). On a small budget of about $115,000 this cult classic is still recognized by the horror community in recent times. It's a known fact that the majority of film was shot in Newton, NJ, right across the lake from the cast and crew of Friday the 13th. Yes, that's right! Friday the 13th and Mother's Day were filmed at the same time, in the same relative location. The release of Friday the 13th several months before Mother's Day stifled the intended shock value of the latter but audiences worldwide would soon familiarize themselves with this overlooked gem.The film gets us acquainted with 3 women who were close friends and dorm buddies in college in 1970. Flash forward ten years to the present, with each individual living separate lives. They keep in correspondence with each other and by way of a telegram, set up another one of their annual weekend excursions. They've agreed to go on a camping trip to a remote location in New Jersey called the "Deep Barrens." After a restful day or two, the women are assaulted and kidnapped by two backwoods rednecks; Ike and Addley. These mentally unstable guys drag the girls back to their shack in the woods and present their trophies to Mother ? a psychotic and delusional elderly woman. The girls, who referred to themselves as The Rat Pack in their college days, must find a way to escape the clutches of Mother and her retarded offspring.This movie is nicely polished. Troma is widely accepted as a company that not only produces crap, but promotes it by acting as a distribution company. Whether you're of this mindset or not, Mother's Day can be looked at as a very inspirational Slasher early on in sub-genre ? it's vastly different than its cousin, Friday the 13th. The acting is great. One of the most disturbing scenes out of the movie is a ruthless sexual act performed on one of the girls and in addition to some of the other gory bits, may still disturb the viewers of today. The special effects aren't the best that you'll ever see but they work well enough, considering what's implied. Mother's Day can be classified as a girl- gets-revenge Slasher. It's more intelligent than that, however, because there's a bit of commentary and a black comedy feel to it that's difficult to describe.In a recent interview conducted with Nancy Hendrickson (the actress who portrayed Abbey), she confirmed the rumor that a dead body was found in the house they used before shooting began. The previous homeowner was murdered and sat vacant for 15 years ? a seemingly tall tale to put one over on the audiences but 'tis no tale my friends! It's true! It's this eerie fact that heightens the experience of Mother's Day even more.Darren Lynn Bousman of Saw II, III, and IV and Repo! The Genetic Opera fame directed a remake of Mother's Day that is slated for an April release in 2011. What's my take on that? I think it's infuriating ? we don't need a remake of Mother's Day with a re-vamped premise, Darren. If the younger audiences of today want to see Mother's Day they can sit down and watch the original from 30 years ago. If the tears start flowing out of boredom, guess what? Not everything centers on Grand Theft Auto, smart phones, and Justin Bieber. The film wasn't made for the teenagers of 2010 that can't appreciate older filming techniques and outdated effects; believe it or not, there was a world before the mid- 1990s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept looking at the back seat of the car when the two scumbags prepared to off the old lady. Why is that plastic there? We soon found out that all little old ladies are not to be messed with.The initial excitement wore off as the film meandered around until three girls (Tiana Pierce, Deborah Luce, and Nancy Hendrickson) all headed to the woods for their annual get together. After a while, the action starts as Mother's (Beatrice Pons) two backwoods boys, Addley (Michael McCleery) and Ike (Frederick Coffin) capture the girls and use them as props for Mother's enjoyment. Of course, their little plays feature rape and torture. Only the first girl dies, and the other two manage to escape to get revenge.Unfortunately the camera was not a friend as most of the money shots were taken from a distance. Hopefully this will be corrected in the planned remake.The last 10 minutes made it all worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous and Revolting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SIX OUT OF TEN STARSTroma Productions defies conventional film making by doing everything and anything the producers want, seemingly disregarding potential audience disapproval. I'm sure many many film goers decided to view this movie without investigating the true nature of the film. I wonder how many people walked out on this movie? Me personally, I loved it. Since renting it from Netflix, I've chosen to watch it multiple times, finally devoting this review to it.The first thing people need to understand about this film, is that Troma Productions wasn't exactly trying to bring home an Oscar with "Mother's Day", and it never tries to pass itself off as more than a "B" movie. "Mother's Day" let's you know within the first five minutes that all will not go according to the "Hollywood" plan; and that's what I like about it. "Mothers Day" is essentially giving the conventional film making process the finger with it's over the top demented characters and brutal sexual violence.The story is centered upon three female college friends that get together for a reunion by camping in the woods. It would just so happen that the friends end up camping by a family of deranged and violent sexual deviants. The group consists of a mother and her two sons; the mother is an overbearing control freak that has raised her sons to be backwoods killers. In one outrageous scene, the mother coaches her two sons in the art of rape on a live specimen. The specimen is one of three college friends that's been kidnapped, meanwhile the other two women are confined to the deranged family's house.One way or another this movie will find a way to disgust you; but for me this type of film is an important part of film making. It addresses issues that most in Hollywood are still afraid to address: Random issues such as classicism, racism, and rape are brought to light. I'm surprised the conservative d-bags at the MPAA even let this one by with an R rating."Mother's Day" is a ridiculously filmed production, but is effective when it needs to be. In one scene "Mother's Day" lulls us into believing that it's a harmless schlock movie and then in one second we get ambushed by the Troma Brother's nasty and offensive sexual violence."Mother's Day" is good where it needs to be; and the rest of the time, well it's a cheesy "B" movie. There are some quality jump scare moments and the producer's do an excellent job creating the backwoods horror and hopelessness that is so important to this type of film. To me,a horror connoisseur, this film is a landmark in the realms of crudity, realism, and offensiveness within of film making. I recommend this film highly to fans of the horror genre that are prepared to rationally assess the importance of films, regarded by many, as offensive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you go into the woods today, you're in for a big surprise. When you go into the woods today you're not going to believe your eyes. But it ain't no "teddy bear picnic". Three girls discover that two men are willing to do anything to impress Mother and what impresses Mother is watching her son commit acts of rape and murder. Now these women are prisoners and lowered to pawns in the game of checkers between two dim wits and their Maniac Mommy and the question becomes, can any of them escape, alive? A poorly made slasher lacks the storyline having it make not a sense. Not to mention a rotten script which could be barely keep up. Although the kills are a bit better than usual. I can only say this. It's better than Prom Night, it's worse than Basket Case.Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity, Profanity and Rape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool film, though not as strong as one might expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really see why this one got banned as a video nasty. It has some mildly nasty sequences while the girls are in the retards house, but nothing like as nasty as any other rape revenge themed movies. There are also only a small number of kills and the gore is pretty crude. Fun, but crude and at one stage the way the effect works is amusingly obvious. Although I was mildly disappointed at the lack of any really strong stuff in this one I still found it plentifully entertaining. The acting and dialogue of the leads is mostly risible and I had fun chuckling at it. The brothers Ike and Adley and their mother however I thought were excellent. I also thought their house was well designed and atmospheric. I found these villains to be a wonderfully demented and darkly humorous examination of how people can get if they are totally isolated from the outside world and have television as their only reference point and a scary old crone as their only authority figure. The way their kidnap of the girls is like a grisly Mother's Day celebration and the way they seem to always want to please their mother makes for a brilliantly subversive attack on family ties and customs. The film suffers from a dragging midsection, though I still found it fairly diverting as I knew it was just a holding pattern before the finale so anticipation kept me interested. The finale definitely redeems the midsection, finishing things in suitably trashy and even kinda creepy fashion. I would recommend this to all sleazy trash fans its milder than one might expect but still nicely scuzzy with flashes of unexpected wit and flair. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than most in its genre, if memory serves...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have been 13 years old when I saw this. Home video allowed multiple viewings of the more entertaining (read "bloody &amp; violent") scenes, though all of my friends were in agreement that this film had, if nothing else, provided the perfect set-up for "Mother's Day 2: The Legend of Queenie", a film still waiting to be made.Something set this film apart for me. Again, I was only 13, and easily entertained by anything involving sharp objects and body parts, but from the jarring reveal of 'Mom' as murderous twisto to her inflatable titted demise, and all the 'Kodak' moments in between that made me chuckle if not bark at the screen, I found my mood jerking from high to low more often than I was accustomed to with this genre of film. I can't remember if the protagonists were well acted or not. I do recall an unusual investment in their back story, making it more difficult for me to root for the baddies. And yet despite the horrors they suffered, the absurdity of their captors made for many laughs, bringing much needed levity to the proceedings (in that sick and twisted manner which only adolescence permits), which would then evaporate in the wake of yet another violent act from the brothers.That a psychotic nightmare could dress so comfortably in the guise of their mother added an extra twist to this already skewed backwoods reality. However, as demented and dangerous as Mom was, there was something else out there in the woods so terrifying as to give her pause. We never saw Queenie (last three seconds of the movie excluded), only heard about her from the rest of the family. Like the shark in Jaws we were forced to imagine the monster (though the invisibility of Spielberg's monster was due to mechanical failings rather than clever direction), and I spent a bit of time trying to envision the thing that could frighten those three.I've read some comments harping on acting skill, particularly that of the three women, which is ridiculous given it's a 1980s horror film we're talking about. The movie plunged from normalcy &amp; safety into a violent mad-hatter existence, and had me laughing intermittently throughout. I found that quietly disturbing. It did its job then, yes? Within its genre I score the film 8 out of 10.I don't expect I'd enjoy it so much today - having watched so many "quality" films since then I'd probably be more sensitive to the poor quality control brought to low-budget movies like Mother's Day. But it remains a fond memory. Now if someone would just dedicate a feature production to the life and times of Queenie...</fullReview>

I have been telling people about this movie for the past 20 years but I have never seen it at my local video store. It is a classic. It mixes horror with comedy. It's sleazy, scary, and humorous all at the same time. Some people would probably think this movie is sick because some of the scenes can be a bit disturbing such as the rape scene but the true horror fan will love it. It really deserves a lot more credit than it has received. I am glad to finally see it come out on DVD. I will be certain to pick this one up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's Day starts with a seemingly nice little old lady (Beatrice Pons as Rose Ross) giving a lift to a young man named Charlie (Stanley Knapp) &amp; his girlfriend, while driving through some backwoods the car stops with mechanical problems that the old lady gets out to try &amp; fix. Suddenly her two psychotic sons Ike (Holden McGuire) &amp; Addley (Michael McCleery as Billy Ray McQuade) kill Charlie, beat &amp; sexually molest his girlfriend before their Mom finishes her off... It's the time of year when three old college friends meet up for a reunion, Trina (Tiana Pierce) from Beverly Hills, Abbey (Nancy Hendrickson) from Chicago &amp; Jackie who now lives in New York City all receive a telegram informing them of the details. They all meet up &amp; head off for an area of forest known as 'Deep Baron' where they set up camp &amp; have a good time reminiscing about the past. However one night they are ambushed by Ike &amp; Addley who overpower them &amp; take them back to their run down house. From this point the three friends are subjected to beatings, rape &amp; humiliation at the hands of the psycho Brother's &amp; their Mum. They quickly decide they have to fight back if they want to escape with their lives...Co-written, co-produced &amp; directed by Charles Kaufman Mother's Day is a sleaze classic that I am surprised isn't more widely known or mentioned. The script by Kaufman &amp; Warren Leight could best be described as a cross between The Last House on the Left (1972), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), I Spit on Your Grave (1978) &amp; Friday the 13th (1980) which coincidently was filmed at the same time some 15 miles away across the lake featured in the film. It has the strong rape/revenge theme together with the usual 80's slasher clichs, it's quite a potent mix which works very well &amp; the final product is a genuinely nasty, unpleasant &amp; exploitative horror film that should probably be avoided by the easily offended. But it's not just the unsavoury elements of Mother's Day that make it such a great film, for instance the character's are far better than I would expect from a film such as this with not a single annoying teenager in sight, hooray! The three female leads are surprisingly well developed &amp; when the nastiness starts to happen I found myself feeling for them. The film moves along at a nice pace &amp; is never boring &amp; there are even a few clever bits 'n' pieces here like the party where the guests discuss Hollywood in a scathing fashion. On the negative side I didn't like the very abrupt ending or that no reason or motive is given for these backwoods killers to rape &amp; kill people beyond the fact that they live in the middle of some isolated woods.When I discovered that the people behind Troma were responsible for Mother's Day I feared the worst, I'm not positive but maybe this was their first film before they began making crap that they are renowned for now. Unlike any other film I've seen produced by Troma Mother's Day is a very competently made film &amp; director Kaufman manages to create a sleazy, grimy &amp; exploitative atmosphere that is absolutely perfect. Amazingly he even manages to build a fair bit of tension &amp; suspense during a few scenes as well &amp; I have to mention the gore &amp; rape of which there is a fair amount of both, a guy has his head chopped off with a machete, someone has their hands cut open, someone has an axe stuck between their legs with blood splattering results (ouch, most blokes will winch at this scene), a pin is pushed through someones throat &amp; someone is killed with an electric carving knife while there are also a few graphic sexual assault's against women.With a supposed budget of about $150,000 Mother's Day is generally quite well made &amp; compared to Troma's later films this is Oscar worthy stuff! Shot entirely on location which helps the photography is fine as is the music while the special effects are also suitably nasty. The acting is also pretty good &amp; the three leads put in decent performances while the two psycho sibling's are suitably menacing if a little cartoonish.Don't let the Troma connection put you off, this is a nasty, sleazy, exploitative straight horror film that fans of extreme cinema should enjoy, I certainly did. A must for hardened horror fans &amp; besides where else are you going to see a woman suffocated with a novelty see-thru pillow shaped as a pair of breasts?!</fullReview>

Three friends go camping in the woods and are captured by a sadistic woman who lives in the woods with her 2 psychotic children.They like to kidnap people and torture them like in the movies. there is a quite graphic torture/rape scene but the movie gets really gruesome when one of the friends dies and the two that are left exact their terrify revenge. I wont give the plot away but any men watching might want to cross their legs in one of the scenes.I will just say it involves a hammer but be warned it is the most gruesome part of the movie. There is also an unintentionally hilarious scene when one of the brothers falls down a slope.however it did give relief before the gore and bloodletting that was to follow. This is a nifty low budget horror film that keeps the shocks going throughout the whole movie. The twist in the tale right at the end is expected but still made me jump about 3 foot off my chair. If you ever get a chance then watch this movie but be ready to never want to camp in the woods again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's Day (1980) was Charles Kaufman's foray into horror film making. The story is about three girls who grew up and went to school together. They decide to go out on a camping trip in upstate New York. But they pick the wrong day yo go up because they run into a crazy mother and her two retarded children. The mother is training her two boys to fight against an entity named Queenie. Whilst the three women are reminiscing about old times, the two goons spoil their fun and drag the ladies off to their compound. What will happen next? Will the ladies survive their meeting with Mama and her boys? Who or what is Queenie and does she even exist? Is this movie all it's cracked up to be? To find out these answers you'll just have to watch Mother's Day.Lloyd Kaufman gave his brother the necessary funds to try and make an exploitive horror film. Charles said that if this movie didn't make any money then he would quit making movies. The brothers were surprised by how financially successful they were with this film that Charles decided to stay with Troma and make several more films. He also worked on a few scripts for Lloyd before retiring from the film business. If you enjoy Troma films then you'll like this one. I was surprised by how different this film was from the other ones that were being made around this time. Instead of glorifying the sexual aspects of rape, the film makers made it dirty, brutal and sleazy. Like it should be (check out I Spit on Your Grave for a similar movie).Revenge is sweet....Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Once one of the girls die and the other two escape, they plan bloody revenge against the mother and her two sons. "Mother's Day" works well as a horror movie, satire, gore-fest, movie with some T&amp;A and a film clouded with interesting characters.

The 2 sons are verry scarey aswell you would be lucky to get away from them, but if your really smart you might have a chance. this movie is not that gross or sick when compared to i spit on youre grave or last house on the left, wich I think are 2 of the worst hooror films ever!

		<shortDescription>Low budget Horror owes to Last House On The Left</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While released in 1980 on the heels of Halloween's success, thisfilm owes more to Last House on the Left, or I Spit On Your Grave,as it follows the plight of three college friends who are kidnaped,raped and tortured in the woods, then fight back when all hopeseems lost. This also marks a very early release for Troma, thecomedy-horror production group. But Mother's Day only contains asmall amount of comedy, and the only "cheeze" factor it hascomes from it being dated (a bad music score for example)compared to the camp that Troma would later make. Mother's Daycomes across as a low-budget horror film like many others fromthat era. The rape scenes are ugly, as they should be, and the filmis far more brutal than what we could come to expect from Troma,but the film often seems long in the tooth, and lacking of acompelling story to keep it moving. Would I recommend it? That'shard to say, if you are doing a search for all 1980's Horror, and thatwas indeed a time for low-budget Horror, then you should checkMother's Day out, with a strong stomach. But if you aren't sure ifyou'd like this or not, it would probably be better to skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Kaufman's "Mother's Day" is an undisputed masterpiece. Despite the lack of "budget," "production value," or "cinematic quality," the film is a wonderful delight for all. Watch 10 minutes into the film, just after the opening credits end. There is a sequence at a party that takes place in Beverly Hills, in 1980. Then watch the scene where Dirk Diggler goes to Burt Reynolds' house for the first time in "Boogie Nights." The scenes are almost identical. P.T. Anderson clearly stole this scene, from the shots, the costumes, the dialogue, the music, the editing style, right down to a girl on rollerskates skating around the pool. Mock this movie all you want, it has influenced pop culture in more ways than you may realize. Charles Kaufman is a genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie up to the last 5 minutes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has some fine acting (quite realistic). Considering its dark view of the world, it remains true to form. (everybody is a monster, and after one thing. What you got.) However. The ending is a dissapointment. It is understood, that in this type of movie, there is no happy ending, but not to give away the ending, it apears that the makers of this film just wanted to end it (and dictated the ending). To sum it up. It's a slap in the face, a cold shower, hard hit in the gut. A good antidote to those 'feel good' movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is wrong with you people giving this movie negative comments? Could you do any better? I THINK NOT! Now, I must admit that it is low budget but IT'S FROM 1980 and the TROMA people produced it, Come on! This just happens to be one of the best movies that I have ever saw! It has everything! Good acting, great writing, production, music, and it's awesome. I suggest that everyone go out and rent this movie because it is great. Some comments that people have written are so cheap, like, I can't believe I spent $1.50 to see this movie or I can't believe I actually rented this. Well, they just didn't give it a chance! It's an independent film but it does have plenty of chills, thrills, and some of the best scenes that I have ever saw in a horror movie. My whole family has seen this more than once and it only gets better each time! So go and buy or rent this, because it's worth your $1.50 YOU CHEAP PEOPLE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's Day's badness doesn't come from it's shock value but just from the fact that the acting is terrible, the plot, villains and everything in it is so preposterous that you'd think someone made it up as they went along. It's a ripoff of everything from the great Texas Chainsaw Massacre to the horrid I Spit on Your Grave and Last House on the Left. Basically three grown college women meet up every year and this year they stumble in the woods and are the victims of two rednecks and their mother. The sons perform stupid sex acts on the girls and beat them for the pleasure of their mother. It's one of those awful horror movies where the "action" takes place in the beginning and nothing happens afterwards. You are suppossed to feel sorry for these women but you wound up feeling sorry for yourself that you spend $1.50 on this rental. I wouldnt even recommend this as a joke to a friend who likes cheesey horror. Zero stars</fullReview>

The cinematography was ahead of its time, and I think it's safe to say that without "Mother's Day" there would have been no "Saving Private Ryan"-- witness the gritty, hand-held camera angles.

		<shortDescription>Very well done for its kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MORD39 RATING: *** out of ****Let's get something straight: This movie is offensive. It features an old mom urging her two misfit sons to brutally rape, torture, abuse, and murder young women for her entertainment. BUT IT'S BRILLIANT, AND WELL DONE FOR ITS TYPE.With a shlocky piece of exploitation like this, we rarely if ever get a story and character development in the mix. The story of a group of young women planning a weekend getaway for their reunion celebration first provides us with background history detailing their personalities and personal problems. We get to know these girls...and once they get "caught" by the family of crazies, we share their dilemma. I might also say that the surprise beginning really grabbed me (I first saw the movie in a theatre in 1980 and had no clue what was going to happen), and the ending is also pretty good.As gruesome as these killers are in the film, you almost feel for them too. You sense that the imbecile sons are victims of their overbearring mother, and have had no proper upbringing to keep them from being such animals. Even mother is pathetic in a pitiful way.MOTHER'S DAY will probably never be respected, and it is not for everybody. But I respect it and feel it stands out far in front of zillions of other exploitation/slasher knock-off's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awkward movie to watch with Mom and Dad, INDEED!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This happened to be the first film I viewed on a VCR, whilst visiting relatives in Arkansas in the very early eighties. Mayhap I was six or seven...After making our choices at the video store, the entire fmaily retired to my uncle's living room to enjoy the splendors of the VCR. We reclined on the floor with snacks and Cokes and began the night of films with "Mother's Day." Many times I was made to cover my eyes during gruesome scenes, as was my (also young) male cousin. Finally my parents gave up this futile effort at "protecting" me from this film and just let it roll on. I recollect little, except a dismembered hand, a trail o' beer cans, a freaky old woman crying, "SLAP! SLAP!" and a few other disjointed fragments. The strained looks on the pale and drawn faces of my parents are imprinted strongly upon me, though, as was the uneasy laughter of my uncle, who kept "reassuring" my cousin and I that it was not real. Of course I knew it was not real... I was young, but not an imbecile.... but it was obvious to me that this was NOT a family movie. The rape scenes left me agitated, the craziness of the family disturbed me, and the torture was gruesome enough to make me wince, but what has made the biggest impression upon me was the sheer AWKWARDNESS of the situation. Whatever else... try to avoid watching is film with your parents and other assorted family members. That much I know. Perhaps I should rent this movie now and watch it again, because I DO recall some funny, cheesy scenes that I had dared not laugh at then! Oh, lament! If only I had remembered to watch it during sleepovers with my friend Abbie along with "VICTIMS!" and "THE PIT" during high school... 'twould have been funny, I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Randomly surfing through channels on Mother's Day, we caught what appeared to be a comedy about city college girls on a weekend retreat. Just as we commented that things needed to get more exciting, the plot turned the corner into the dark and disturbing. Not for the faint of heart. Our favorite line is when the co-ed calls Ike a "backward, inbred, psychotic", and he retorts, "We're not backwards, we citified, look around for yourself!" The film is an odd mix of punk rock ethos, trenchant comments on consumer culture, and flat out twistedness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not pure garbage, but certainly not everyday viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard many people put down this film, then put down "Last House on the Left", then put down "I Spit on Your Grave". All three depict graphic rape, then graphic revenge afterwards. Of the three, this is the least memorable. Despite earlier reviews, the acting in this film is excellent. I always wonder what people consider bad acting? All three rape/revenge movies have excellent acting, then are said to have bad acting. Just because a movie disturbs you doesn't make it bad, it just means you're upset because you didn't want to be disturbed or didn't like to be disturbed. You should read IMDB reviews before you watch your next horror movie.But I've lost track of myself, on to the movie. The three main characters, former college roommates, are all basically solid characters. A lot of time is spent developing their personalities, which makes it hard to watch what happens to them. Kidnapped by two sick backwoods brothers and brought home to their sadistic mother, one particular woman goes through appalling torture and rape, while the other two are tied and bound on exercise machines. When one of them dies, the remaining women band together and exact a graphic revenge. The gore effects in this movie are more extreme than in the other two rape/revenge movies, but that doesn't necessarily make it a tougher watch. The two sickest effects are the Drano-down-the-throat and the sawed hands of one of the women. And while the other two controversial films end on a somewhat triumphant note, this one has a surprise ending (that one reviewer gave away, unfortunately).Overall, though, this isn't a movie that can be watched repeatedly and still stand up, unless you're a gore hound and eat up every minute of the revenge. That's not me at all. But this should be watched at least once. Troma Video has come out with a Director's Cut with intact scenes. I bought it and it proudly adorns my video shelf, but I can tell you, it won't be leaving it as often as "I Spit" or "Last House".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There I was sitting in the movie theatre,a good looking blonde precocious 5-year old watching the carnage envelop the massive UA ASTORIA #3 screen.This carnage would play a role in my life through the years. While my mom was in another theatre watching Herbie Goes Bananas here was her little blonde boy Satan , watching a semi-toothed redneck slam a sleeping-bagged clad rape victim into sudden unconsciousness against a tree trunk. Mothers Day was just one of many classic horror films to come out in the heyday of the genre. The Shining, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and this Mothers Day are just a few examples of the carniverous masterpieces that came out in the glorious 1980's. The next generation of horror lacked the gratuitous use of blood-gurgling violence that the 70's -80's brand of this genre presented if not perfected.As Scream 3 approaches for an overpriced Thanksgiving release, we as true horror conoseurs must really asked ourselves if this new brand of MTV horror really measures up to the stuff that had you sleeping with the lights on as a little kid...Sleep Tight.

		<shortDescription>80's flick might not make your day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another one of these horrors, where 3, 4 girls go out vacationing in the woods, oblivious to the terror and horror they'll encounter. The film opens with an interesting scene. This hillbilly old gran, who's the best actor in the film, is just graduating with her fellow members at one of these positive power of the mind seminars. A hippie couple with bad intentions hitch a ride with her, and we know it can get awful lonely in the woods. Thank god she's got her two backward sons to look after her. Her car purposely breaks down in the woods. She goes out to check the front. The female hippie in the backseat, leans over the front to turn the ignition. Already ready to turn the ignition, she declines, switching the radio on instead. The boyfriend mouths his disapproval. What follows is a great machete head chopping scene as the male buys it. Yes, her boys are there to save the day, one you might recognize as the much older cop in ROADKILL. They then proceed to rape the girl. A great tagline at the end of the this, with the old hicky, saying with delight "Boys, you have made your mother, very pro-uuud", before it's red dripping title takes up the black screen. We are then introduced to the 3 future victims, through sideshow slides of earlier fun jaunts and frolicking times. I like this method used. One girl, the mother hen of this threesome who call themselves the rat pack, where holidaying once a year is tradition, is giving a lavish party, a close up of one guy stoned, I liked too. The next girl, Jackie, is a sucker type, who's boyfriend, in the arts, is sponging off of her. And the third girl, ironically enough is a abused ear of her sick mother's constant nagging and yelling. So moving on, avoiding warnings from country folk, they head on to their chosen destination. While sitting around the campfire, tales are told, memories are recalled, one a killer, through flashback of our younger Jackie taking revenge on her jock boyfriend, getting him naked in middle of a football stadium. Then the bright lights come on, and a booming voice, some classic dialogue attached, comes over a speaker, and our stud, takes off like a bat out of hell, in the buff of course. From here, unpleasantries follow, where the girls are kidnapped by these repulsive freaks and taken back to their old hicky mothers, a face sketched in classic evil just like her other son, not the ROADKILL actor. Even though this isn't a good movie, with any other actress in this part, this movie would flop. Mother's Day has disturbing moments but some sad ones as well, the sad music fits those scenes like a tee. This is another flick I watched with my Dad in back in 84, the same day we saw Children Of The Corn. The movie is effective, but it's trashy. But remember it's Troma, this one being nearly the best one, and it's not saying much. These retard sons, live like pigs, their demented mother accepting of this, including a girls ripe head in a bird cage. Their breakfast routine consists of cheese sauce from a tube, and they have a great wake me up voice on their alarm clock. I thought the scene where one of the sons, performs a little private show for her mother, with him walking the dog, the dog incidentally is Jackie, chain and lead attached, was boring and stupid. That's what doesn't work about this film, there's too many stupid and pointless moments, as if this is just to fill in it's 91 minutes. But there are some surprising moments too. The violence is nasty, but not excessive, and it's final with the surviving hick woman, springing down on the surviving two, from over a bush, in a couple of short zooms towards us, is just so ridiculous, it's instantly forgettable. What I did like is one of the avenging friends, snapping in an intense moment (the one with the nagging mother) is smothering the old hick with a pillow, I think, draws comparisons to her real mother, repeating the same line. Mother's Day is strictly for horror and Troma fans I guess, but it's trashy, and I mean in a tasteless way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently watching and reviewing the remake, only lately I actually got round to watching this version. And what I found is that this one is almost completely different movie, one of the only things that this one has in common is that some of the names are the same and the general psycho mother themes.The plot = Three best friends Abbie, Jackie and Trina who are former college students gets together every year for a surprise getaway. This year they decide to go camping in the woods. But unfortunately for them they come across a psycho mother and her just as psychotic sons who have designs on the three girls who decide to kidnap and attack the three friends during the middle of the night for some really silly torture, rape, and murder, can the girls survive this ordeal and fight back or end up dead.After I heard that this movie was made by the company Troma, to be honest I wasn't really excited about watching this, but when I did I was quite pleasantly surprised, the acting was really strong and okay some of the effects were kinda sloppy, but other than that this was a pretty good movie. To be honest I can't really see why this movie isn't more well known as it's one of the better 80's slashers.I liked the change of setting compared to the remake, set in a backwoods America instead of a suburban household and what's odd is that the serious themes of this movie like the rape, torture and murder are played for laughs, which is twisted but fun and gets away with it in a way."Mother's Day" also does something that most Troma films don't really showcase - decent character development. It's not great screen writing when it comes to developing the protagonists, but it's more than you would expect out of a film like this. For the first half of the film, we get to see the three female leads travel together, camp together, and even reminisce about the good old days, and then In the last half we get down to the real gritty uneasy stuff.The acting like I said before is really strong, Rosey Ross who plays the mother is a delight and a real highlight of the movie and steals every scene she's in, she's funny, crazy, loving, sadistic, and touching all in one. The character is a monster, enabling her children to entertain her by raping and torturing people, but Ross makes her charming at the same time - giving us the knowledge that this Mother really loves her children. Nancy Hendrickson who plays Abbey was definitely the strongest out of the three female leads, she really comes into her own towards the end and Deborah Luce and Tiana Pierce also gave credible performances and were really likable at the same time, I really rooted for all the female leads and didn't want any of them to die. Holden McGuire was very good as the dimwitted and demented Ike, who was vicious but at the same time sensitive to his mother's needs. And Billy Ray McQuade was the more twisted and pervy one of the group, which he played well.All in all Mother's Day is a really quirky gem of a movie, twisted and humorous at the same time, a definite must see for all slasher movie fans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's Day is not only one of the earliest productions from Troma Studios, but it is also one of their more accomplished efforts (which, to be honest, isn't difficult given some of the absolute tripe they have made since they began). Although the film at first appears to be your typical Kaufmann/Herz trash, with amateurish acting, cartoonish characters, and an occasional attempt at puerile humour (the scene with the gormless stud left naked in the baseball field is a good example of this), it gradually develops into an irresistible combination of dark satire and straight-up, nasty exploitation.Part Texas Chainsaw Massacre, part Last House on the Left, and part Friday the 13th, with just a little bit of Deliverance thrown in for good measure, Mother's Day is a gleefully twisted take on the popular backwoods horror sub-genre. Deep in the wilderness, 'mother' can enjoy all that she considers good about the city (popular culture via TV, and cheap consumer goods) without actually having to live there; the only drawback is that she lives in constant fear of attack from her savage sister Queenie, who lives wild in the woods. Fortunately she is protected by her two devoted and demented homicidal sons, Ike (Holden McGuire) and Addley (Billy Ray McQuade).In order to keep her boys in tip-top fighting condition, she has trained them in the art of combat, using abducted hitch-hikers and back-packers to practise their techniques on. The terrible twosome bite off more than they can chew, however, when they kidnap three young women who are spending their weekend camping in the area: after one of the girls is raped and murdered by the sicko siblings, the remaining pair plan their escape and wreak bloody vengeance on their captors (attacking them with a variety of objects, including an axe, a TV set, and some Drano!).With its wicked parody of consumerism (the hideous family greedily devour junk food and collect mass-produced merchandising), wry swipes at new-age thinking and motherhood, and a fun 'surprise' ending, this film manages to be smarter than your average Troma tat, whilst still delivering the raw violence and sleaze that fans demand.What a shame Troma didn't continue in this vein, rather than resorting to churning out countless Z-grade B-movies designed to appeal to undiscerning adolescents.</fullReview>

This film is boring and lame. People tell me it is great if you look at it as a comedy, well I did that and it still sucks, lol. So, if you like this type of movie, I guess check it out. If not, don't bother, it is not one of the better horror/comedies I have seen. If you want a good Troma movie watch THE TOXIC AVENGER or CLASS OF NUKE EM HIGH. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ending is Worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical slasher / horror film that takes place in the woods where nobody can hear you scream from help. A group of somewhat sexy. half naked woman get lost and fall pray to a family of psychos. A nice storyline for a B-Movie spectacular. The ending is a surprise and the best part of the movie. Although the first scene has its moments, the ending comes out of nowhere and makes most of its audience jump out of their seats. The sound effects mixed in with the endings direction is pure horror. Too bad the rest of the movie didn't have the same feel to it. The director of the film may be Lloyd Kaufman even though its not his name under the credit. Kaufman probably didn't want to pay the union dues and shot the film in a make believe name or something. Either way, a nice Troma like movie with no "ifs" "ands" or "buts" about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very unique ending. Its worth your money!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They start off, confusing you a little, which is okay because it all pieces together in the ending. Then it goes right into the plot of these 3 girls camping. I know, it sounds like everyother 80's horror flick, but its not. This movie is full of so many twists and has the most unique and ironic ending. Definatly worth a gander. Just goes to show you what you can buy for a buck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd. . . and interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is quiet interesting, to me anyway. Of course it has it's obvious similarities to other films it's deffinately a combination of " Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Last House on the Left" but it brought something else to it. I never routed for the characters in Last house, but I did in this film. I really think this film is smarter than it looks.Yes it's extremely low-budget. And yes it comes with the Troma tag on it, which almost instantly means low-brow, low-budget and probably bad. But I think this film is interesting. It is relentless in it's attacks , yes, but thats something horror fans always say they miss. When they get it they never want it cause it's too far---I think horror fans need to make up thier minds. It had developed characters. Now we are talking about a horror film, so don't expect a lot of depth but you have to admit they have charaterzation. The script takes the time to show you about them, and have us understand why they ( the girls) are friends.What I do think is sad is that the horror film has a label of being mysoginistic. So the instant rape occurs in these films---alarms go off. Smut, explotation, evil evil devil. But that doesn't nesscarily mean that's so. This film has obvious sexual overtones but those are merely there to understand the perversions of the attackers. All those everyone screams this is just like " I spit on your grave" because it features a rape. Lets examine. Grave has a forty minute rape scene that is so brutal rapists would get sick. While Mother's day features a rather brief rape scene, where the girl is seen in a bra, the man's butt is exposed and it is intercut with other shots. There is deffinately a direct effort to keep the rape scene from being to gratuitous. When people watch that scene they always say how revolting it is. But if you rewatch, the really bizzare things come prior to the rape building a disgusting tension, and the rape it self is I think under 30 seconds. Of course there is the scene where the three girls play in the lake and you can see through there shirts, that no one can defend that is obvious "lets get some boobs in here", but then again it was 1980. If I recall right, weren't the only movies without nudity Disney movies.This film is really easy to right off as garbage, and you may be right, after all everyone is intitled to their opinon. I myself like this film, all though it is very hard to take and is not good for rewind value. This is not the kind of movie you rent, watch, then watch again the next day. It's too strong for that. PS But I have to say ( this is the film maker/ horror fan in me talking) the pre title sequence is probably the best out of any horror film I have ever seen. Not for it's content, but that it accurately sets up the entire res t of the film. You pretty much know what your watching before "mother's day" ever comes across the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not for people that feel moral panics coming over them as soon as movies, music, books e.t.c. doesn't follow the main stream. It's very easy to just block your senses when you're getting disturbed, but that is what art is supposed to do. And don't tell me that movies like this is not art...independent and with low budget still gathering after 23 years after all of these reviews, something was done right.Or else nobody would raise this film to the skyes. If you don't like films like this, then you're stars (or the lack of them) for them is insignificant. If I'm getting appauled by "The Blue Lagoon" or similar sleaze I know that I can't review it properly. Well. I bought this film in USA just to get a glance of what Troma was all about (in Sweden it was just rumors at that time in the 80's) and first i was stunned...seen Fulci, Craven, Argento...this was different. Rape, torture, with humor? these film makers just didn't beat around the bush. Satire is very difficult to make and sometimes discover even.I recommend. ****of*****But caution</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an interesting piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film appears to be saying that in this primitive and backwoods place, these women are seen as evil and deserving of what they get because they are not submissive and lady like. The mother is allowed to act in ways that are not lady like as she holds a position of power that is almost god like, she is above the laws of others and above reproach. At the beginning of the films, the girl stop half way to the backwoods area and are given a chance to behave like "proper" women should, they ignore this opportunity and continue to be themselves and are thus accused of being lesbians and deserving of what they will get. At this half way point between civilisation and the backwoods, they are given a second chance. Once they reach the backwoods there is no second chance. In civilisation their behaviour would have been accepted and ignored. Thus the film is not so much a chauvinistic or feminist film as it is a film clearly showing the rift between the values of our society and how the trappings of such a society (tv, rock and roll, pop culture icons) do not automatically generate a more open and civilised life style. It also works as an interesting companion piece to bowling for columbine. the aim of bowling for columbine was to find some reason behind the endless violence that racks the American way of living, the most likely reason given is that it is mainly because of fear. Everyday the news brings it home to the American viewer that unless they are wary and protect themselves they will be destroyed. It is this same outlook on life that creates the vicious killers in mother's day. Their mother has had a constant fear of her supposedly dead sister for all her life, which leads her to bring her boys up like killer dogs, trained to protect her from the monstrous sister queenie who stalks the woods. These boys are a product of fear, fear of home invasion, fear of attack on the streets/woods. While obviously not written to totally convey all these ideas and many more, the film seems to accidently stumble upon them, thus giving the proceedings a rather twisted feel as the film veers between interesting concepts and good old exploitation. Certainly not a film for the squeamish, nonetheless this film should be written off so easily and as typically as many of the twitchy and narrow minded people here have. Not a classic, but well worth a look if one is interested in sociology and psychohistory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of clear division on this film from the previous reviewers. Either they think this film is celluloid slime or its an "awesome" picture! For me it is neither, although if I had to lean toward one side of the fence, I would definitely lean more on the side that liked it. "Liked" really is a bit strong, but the film presented me with a dilemma. It is a morally repulsive, sick, twisted story about how a mother in the backwoods of New York(I think) raised her two boys to be murderers, thieves, and rapists. The characterization of these degenerates is sickening, and the delight with which they revel in their crimes horrifying. Yet, on the other hand, the film is a story of courage, friendship, and the lengths to which people can be pushed. In some ways it reminded me of Last House on the Left, another repulsive film that strangely was very interesting in a sick, twisted way. Three grown women who vacation once a year together to relive their old college glory days camp near the estranged family in the woods. You know what is going to happen before it does, because the opening of the film presents an unexpected jolt of horror that is unconnected to the plot of the camping girls. You also know things are bad when the girls are driving to the campsite and two guys are playing what sounds a bit like dueling banjoes with banjoes at a store. To get back to the girls though, their friendship is not some superficial plot contrivance, and much time is devoted to draw out each of their characters. We feel for these girls in this film, and that is one of the biggest differences between this film and the so many "slasher" films of the same era. The family..well, what can I say..they are in the same vein as what you would encounter in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The two boys dressed in old pilot outfits and masks are truly frightening, freaky, and funny in a strange way. They are oafish, stupid clods controlled by their mother. The acting by a virtual cast of still unknowns is very solid. The girls all put in nice performances(and look attractive as well) and the dysfunctional hillbilly family is portrayed with gusto by the two boys and particularly Rose Ross playing mom. Her saying, "I'm so proud of my boys," still is in my head. I guess this is a favorable review, but it is a conditional one. Be prepared for some pretty gruesome stuff when viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Described as a cult film by my Sky TV guide, it's not difficult to see why. Three old college girlfriends get together for a little camping expedition to the woods. Unfortunately, they don't pay attention to the sign that says NO TRESPASSING, and so happen across a patch of land owned by a deranged old woman and her grown-up, but very childlike, sons who have stayed at home since birth. After the usual bonding round the campfire and skinny-dipping scenes, the lovely ladies get abducted at night in their sleeping bags by the two psychotic brothers, and taken to a ramshackle old dump of a house where they are at their captors mercy. Once there, they discover that they're not the first to visit..First things first, the set design of this little B movie is a marvel, check out all the old toys in the background, the graffiti on the walls, the dirt encrusted floors.. this is trailer trash heaven. You keep expecting Jerry Springer to pop up and interview these people, so authentic is the detail. The guys starring as the sons are great too, with their dirty teeth and extremely low IQs, they make a hilarious couple of idiots as they stumble around, doing their mother's bidding. However, the same cannot be said for the girls, who are played by terrible actresses who cannot really perform on camera at all. Of course, it doesn't help they make as many stupid mistakes as other heroines in countless slasher movies. Let me ask you this: If you were in the middle of nowhere with a mad killer after you, wouldn't you get a bit suspicious if a police car just so happened to show up that exact moment when you hadn't called anybody? Exactly..The Horror Channel in the UK is full of this sort of stuff, probably because it hasn't got the budget to buy more popular, mainstream films. I don't mind though, I doubt I'd get to see weird movies like this any other way. Featuring Big Bird alarm clocks, vasectomies by hatchet, Dollies beheaded in a training regime and a nasty, white-haired twist at the end, this is a must for all lovers of bizarre schlock. A 4/10 from me..</fullReview>

Every year they get together and do something "wild." This time they drop everything they are doing from their busy lives and go camping.They encounter a family of psychotics on the trip. It is a pretty decent horror movie. It has some gory moments which are interesting.Will they all survive this adventure? Will they all die? Are there good death scenes? These are all good questions to ask going in to this movie. It is definitely worth the watch when nothing great is available.</fullReview>

The acting and script are superb for such a low-budget movie. The violence, gore and humor sweeten the overall Mother's Day experience, and if you're offended by any of the scenes, then you probably shouldn't be watching movies, let alone horror movies.

		<fullReview>Banned in some states of Australia and with good reason. Whether you subscribe to the "Classic horror/comedy" set or the "Toss out every copy of this degenerate flick" set, the fact is, absolutely no benefit can be derived by a solitary human being on this planet by watching it.You can kid yourself "Isn't it a hoot watching those two retards slap themselves around and keeping mum happy!" or "What a cack-fest watching them rape that tied-up girl on the front lawn while mum looks on proudly." In reality though, this is one sicko movie from Charles Kaufman and to whichever party you subscribe (and there appear to be plenty of supporters for both) there can be no denying that the torture, rape and murder of young girls by a family of redneck illiterates is hardly the basis for a decent movie - however you twist the facts to suit your own voyeuristic taste.The acting, contrary to public opinion here, is nothing to write home about, the direction unimpressive and the antics of the retarded brothers some way short of fall-down-dead hysteria. Togther with Wes Craven's LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, a benchmark for tasteless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie of all time. I've probably watched it more than 100 times and it just keeps getting better. The more you watch it the more the humor comes out. Here are some of my favorite parts:- The hardware store guy cutting off the tip of his finger while trimming his finger nails with hedge trimmers after being startled by the girls.- Ike &amp; Adley "Bagging" girls.- Ma's wardrobe.- Ike &amp; Adley eating breakfast (Trix) out of a galvanized steel bucket with a huge ladle.- The whole "Disco Sucks/ Punk's Stupid Debate.- The whole girls tied to excercise equipment sequence especially this exchange:TRINA to IKE: You backwards perverted piece if s**t. ANGRY IKE: Don't you ever call me backwards again. Look around. Were citified.- Ma yelling at the boys (and making them start over) for allowing Abbey to get one of her hands free while being raped.- The parody of the self improvement seminar Ma is in at the start of the movie.- Ma's description of her sister Queenie:She snapped my neck while I was still in the crib...she was born with a full head of white hair...I've seen her chase down wolves and rip their throats out just to watch them bleed.- All the grafitti spray painted throughout the house.- Abbey suffocating MA with a huge set of inflatable transparent tits.- Ike and Adley get up in the morning. Big Bird Alarm Clock: "Wake up sleepy heads Bigbird says it's time to get up". Ike proceeds to brush his teeth with beer, pick at his messy hair with a switchblade, and spray deoderant on thru his shirt.Absolutely great film.</fullReview>

The performances of the 2 psychos are totally over the top. I'm surprised the actors were not in other films after this one. The film will be very offensive to those who find The Omega Code entertaining. It is Very mean spirited and shocking. The weakest thing about the movie are the very cheap looking gore effects. Note how cheap the decapitation at the start of the film looks. It's nice to see the victims get revenge on the back woods psychos that abduct them! I really felt for the victims in this film.

I couldn't believe the extent of the abuse and could only believe that the actress was a true masochist to let herself be subjected to this trash. It bordered on true pornography.

		<fullReview>"Mother's Day" is sick, silly and inane and yet it definitely is the greatest thing Troma Productions ever brought forward! There's quite a big crowd of fans that consider "Mother's Day" to be a pure genre classic, and even though I'm not that enthusiast about it, I really think it's an amusing mixture of grotesque splatter, eerie suspense and effective social satire. For their annual university reunion weekend, three girl friends go camping near the lake of Deep Baron's; just a couple of hours outside New Jersey. The area is deserted, apart from one cabin where a totally deranged elderly lady raised her middle-aged two sons to be perverted maniacs, skilled in torturing people and protecting their mommy from possible intruders. The girls are captured and serve as sleaze-toys for the two sickos. Poor Jackie doesn't survive the first night and when the other two manage to escape, they swear to avenge their departed college sister. The cool thing about "Mother's Day" is that it successfully blends two very popular contemporary horror sub genres at once! Two thirds of the film are like a typical hillbilly backwoods slasher in the trend of "Deliverance" and "Just Before Dawn" whereas the finale is genuine revenge/vigilante exploitation, like "Last House on the Left" and "I spit on your Grave". This is most likely the only Troma film that pays attention to atmosphere and set pieces! Even some of the violence is kept off screen to increase the disturbance factor, and that surely isn't producer's Lloyd Kaufman's usual style. Still, most of the dialogues are extremely poor and some of the gags and references towards other cinema classic are painfully lame. The end-sequence, on the other hand, is terrific and left room for a sequel that unfortunately never came.. If you only watch ONE Troma movie in your life, make sure it's either this one or "Bloodsucking Freaks".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is brilliant terror film-making with a big dose of pitch black humour. It is very well written, snappily directed, imaginatively photographed and nicely acted.It also has balls. It was originally released unrated because it features graphic rape mixed with humour and ugly, bloody violence.Three old high school chums meet up once a year to get away from abusive boyfriends and screaming mothers. This year they choose the New Jersey woods, the home of two brain-damaged brothers and their wacko mother.What separates MOTHER'S DAY from other terror flicks is invention and pace. There's no fat on this movie, no filler. Director Charles Kaufman (brother of Troma's Lloyd) spends a little time sketching the backgrounds of our heroines before plunging them into the worst weekend of their lives. These girls are flesh and blood, not the usual fodder for a killer like Jason Voorhees.The film arcs up beautifully once the girls are trapped and imprisoned by the retarded brothers Ike and Addley. Put your political correctness on the table before embracing this glorious trash because it has no business here.Nope, this is what terror ought to be. Mean and nasty and directed with gleeful showmanship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Er...what can i say about Mother's Day. I just watched it last night after being desperate to see it for ages. I had the DVD imported from the US to the UK and was it worth it. Certainly not, but on the brighter side at least now my mind is put at rest and i can forget about this movie. What we have here is just what i expected from a Troma movie, lots of wacky bad humour, over the top gore scenes and alot of time wasting to make up the 90 minutes. Can someone tell me what happened in the final scene just as it goes to the credits. It was stupid and i still don't know what happened. I want to say at least one nice thing so here it is, there is a scene early in the movie where the blonde takes off her shoes to walk barefoot through a dirtroad and steps right on a big piece of dung. That scene was funny and i had a good laugh, the only time i laughed through the whole movie. Because of this one good scene i will be generous and rate Mother's Day 2/10. You will get the impression this movie is a comedic version of Last house on the left, so if that sounds good to you, give it a go but i think Troma movies were made to be bad.</fullReview>

I watch the movie about once every 6 months and find something new to like about it every time. Politically incorrect for todays standards but that only increases my love of the film. Original plot with sick developments and a fantastic retribution ending. Macabre to say the least but in all honesty, with the budget they had for that picture they worked miracles. I would be extreamley proud to have worked on that production. I rank it only one step below halloween as a horror film. Obviously a once in a life time only achievement unfortunately though for the Kauffman's. I with they would have re-made movie magic but they stooped to low points with their following films. That would explain why Chuck now runs a restaurant and no longer directs pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really do love this movie. It has all the blood, sex and insanity that a good 80's horror film needs. The two brothers in this film are just great charecters. In my opinion, they did their roles very well, and the depiction of the insane family values is just some great stuff. You have an old mother who could barely walk telling her sons to make a game out of rape. Where else do you get a story like that except from slasher films? I will always love this movie. Very creative film. The only reason these films are bashed is do to their budget and poor acting. What do you expect from a film like this. It's not about the acting or poor effects, its all about having a fun time and getting a kick out of the film. Don't expect Citizen Kane for crying out loud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be praised as a work of B 80's Horror genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was definitely ones of the finest horror exploration films to come out of the early 80's. It was made with a budget of about 150,000 and went on to influence many a horror film after. I had waited around 2 years to get my hands on this movie and am very excited i can now put it in my horror collection. The theme of the movie is extremely dark from the beginning. There's a lot of very dark humor through-out that you cant help chuckle at at least once. I think all the actors did a terrific job. The two hillbilly pervert rapist ex-Semper Fi sons play there parts extremely well. The mother is just crazy and creepy to watch but you cant help laugh at some of the dialogue they gave that women. All three of the girls do an excellent job showing sheer terror and are believable when they decide to fight back against the mother and her sons at the end. All and all definity worth a watch to any true fan of the horror and a great addition to your horror collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Kaufman's "Mother's Day" of 1980 is a demented and hilarious sick little Troma flick of a cult status among many Troma fans. The movie is (intentionally) extremely silly in many parts, but director Charles Kaufman (the brother of Troma founder Lloyd Kaufman) has a great talent for bizarre, demented humor, making the silliness a quality instead of a flaw. "Mother's Day" does, of course, feature a lot of violence and gore, but although certainly not for the squeamish, this is nowhere even nearly as brutal as "Blood Sucking Freaks". Lloyd Kaufman has described this movie as a "social satire", and all in all, "Mother's Day" is very sarcastic and satirical Horror, and, in many parts, a very dark and demented comedy more than a horror flick.Abbey, Jackie and Trina have been inseparable friends since their time in college together. When the three young women go on a trip to the woods, they are not aware that the area is home to two psychotic freaks and their even more demented old mother (Beatrice Pons), who just loves to watch her two boys have a good time - raping, murdering and mutilating innocent people..."Mother's Day" is a very weird little film from the very beginning, and it stays wonderfully demented throughout the whole film. Beatrice Pons is great as the psycho family's bizarre mother, most of the other performances are extremely over the top, and would maybe seem terrible in a non-Troma movie, but greatly fit in here. Bloody, macabre, silly and sarcastic, "Mother's Day" is certainly not everybody's type of film, but lovers of exploitation, especially my fellow Troma fans will have a great time watching this. A highly amusing and demented little film, "Mother's Day" is trashy Cult that I highly recommend to lovers of exploitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I think is ever so exhausting about films like these are that they are way over done. Yes, I will say that I enjoyed the heroines and the wacky mother, but what really got on my nerves (like horror movies today) is that I have already seen all this done before. I guilt myself on the fact that I enjoyed this but I still believe movies like this thrive on giving their audience regurgitated material and even dialogue. After viewing this film a part of me felt cheap, and a part of me felt like I could watch it again (which is maybe why I felt so cheap). Then I remembered I had (in my pathetically huge collection of horror flicks) Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the overrated yet classic slasher Halloween. Both were movies that I knew I could watch over again because both were entertaining and were MADE to be viewed continuously. With movies like "Mothers Day" (another good example is the horrible film "I spit on your Grave") I felt like they were just PURE TRAIN WRECKS, you had to finish watching them because you were hoping the stories may get better. So, in conclusion did I like this movie and would I recommend this flick to other horror freaks such as myself?? Well, I would say "yes",because that way people can realize how much they appreciate the originals that started them all (ex: Black Christmas (truly started the whole slasher/killer genre), Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween etc. ) In response to a IMDb.com viewer...."Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a hit for a reason, it stands amongst garbage, it was followed by horrible sequels, but that doesn't make the original a bust, and it is a landmark amongst all the other repetitive slasher films SUCH AS "MOTHERS DAY", whatever grudge you have against Tobe Hooper's classic is quite petty and I hope someday you can learn to get over the fact that Texas Chainsaw was and will always be a landmark while "Mothers Day" will remain amongst the scraps...oh well"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MOTHER'S DAY is a ridiculously cheesy piece of exploitation trash. After the first awesome death scene i expected it to be great and full of gore but as it turns out there is only a couple gory scenes. While this is most unfortunate the movie is still funny enough to justify a viewing, especially for fans of 80's exploitation horror garbage like myself. All other's should probably avoid this along with most other Troma movies. There's also a little bit of nudity but only the sleazy rapist kind. Basically if you're into the whole deranged family thing with a major dose of cheese then it's worth a look; especially for the totally hilarious ending. For this type of movie it ranks above REDNECK ZOMBIES and probably a little below Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Troma Films, the anarchic and hedonistic Production and Distribution team here, have excelled themselves in involving their time and name, amongst others, with this movie. Even by a technicality, as director, writer and producer Charlie Kaufman is brother to Lloyd Kaufman, co-founder of Troma Entertainment. Troma's reputation is one for the shock-horror-sex-underground movie genre, in the blackest of black comedy sense and style.Mother's Day is all of the above, minus the comedy, gruesome, debasing, haunting and horrific, horrific in the sense of three female friends alone in the woods, camping out on their annual get-together, and their abduction, rape and eventual death by two puerile and simple-minded brothers, which are controlled and immorally educated by their elderly mother. However, in the similar vain as the 1978 revenge movie I Spit on Your Grave, aka Day Of The Woman, these vile and unsophisticated childlike monsters are driven not by their own will, but are controlled and dominated by a mothers love. As I Spit on Your Grave is an underground cult movie of stark revenge, Mother's Day, too, goes far deeper underground for far longer. This (s)mother love has given birth to an evil legacy of hate, destruction and death; there is nothing that escapes this whirlwind of twisted and bitter sadistic devotion.This is pure Saturday night drive-in popcorn fodder. Mother's Day has an excellent character development that before any nightmare scenarios begin, it is at least half an hour into Mother's Day before we are propelled into madness and hysteria, we are getting to know and understand our unfortunate heroines and their differing social backgrounds. We are bonding with them as they already have connected with each other, we are slowly becoming drawn into their lives and soon we are ready to share in their grief.This, for its efforts, and considering its background, is a very well made movie; don't be fooled by its low budget roughness, which actually gives this movie a greater feel of realism. With its underground texture and charm, Mother's Day is a high-octane movie of stamina and strength. The three actresses here, all grown up and independent women in their own right, bring out a very desponding, terrifying and gut wrenching believability to this new world of sick and violent domination. Their experiences are projected through the turmoil, we are feeling helpless that all we can do is watch, and we are as defenceless as they.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than real-life Mother's Days...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got to admit to not being overly familiar with the majority of Troma's output, but if they were all as good as Mothers' Day, I surely would be. The film firmly fits into the 'trash' category of films, as there's a focus on sleaze and violence and the production values leave a lot to be desired, but this is good old-fashioned style horror and for what it is, the plot plays out surprisingly well and the central cast are well developed. I was surprised at how director Charles Kaufman set up his characters, as rather than the usual set of young kids that go into the woods despite the good advice of the surrounding locals; here we have three former college buddies on their yearly camping trip into the mountains. Of course, the other side of the plot (namely, campers bump into maniacs) is the same as usual - but the film gets slightly more credibility than some similar films for having a bit of background information on the characters, which helps the film massively when it comes to them being raped, beaten and tortured later on. This film actually made me want the murderers to get what was coming to them.The central trio of backwoods and backwards inhabitants is another delightful character combination, and features an elderly mother living with her two sons - whom she continually trains to be more adept at hunting down and killing people. The film opens up with a sequence that sees two people brutally killed, and it really provides a good set-up for the movie as it takes in the themes of black comedy and shows you that the film isn't going to hold much back on the gore front. The laughs in the movie are all of a very sick nature, and people that don't enjoy this sort of movie aren't likely to find it very funny. I do have to say, however, that all in all; this film isn't as brutal as some of its counterparts, and the fact that director Kaufman has given his film a streak of black humour lessens the impact somewhat. It does have to be said that the acting isn't very good, but the low rent stars all fit into their roles well - especially Rose Ross, as the central matriarchal figure. Overall, Mothers' Day is a very decent film for what it is, and while I'm not a part of its cult - I can highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nasty Little Cult Horror Flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mother's Day" is a sick, twisted little horror movie with hints of macabre humor. While I don't think it's a pure genre classic (like many die-hard fans claim), I think it's a worthy effort. "Mother's Day" follows three now-adult women who were formerly part of the "rat pack", a name for their little college clique. The girls have an annual weekend get-together every year, and this year they go on a camping trip out in the woods of New Jersey, near lake Deep Baron's. After having a strange encounter with a quirky store owner, the girls head out into the forest and camp out a couple of nights. But one night all hell breaks loose, and they are kidnapped by two backwoods brothers who live to please their old Ma, who treats them as if they are young little kids. After the brothers rape and beat one of the girls to their mother's pleasure, the two others make an escape the next morning, dragging their unconscious, badly injured friend with them. Unfortunately she dies, and the two survivors plan on getting bloody revenge for their friend's undeserved murder.Fairly reminiscent of Wes Craven's "Last House On The Left", "Mother's Day" is just as brutal and maybe even more morbid. The rape scene was disgusting, and the extent of abuse that the girls suffer is quite extreme. The opening scene of the film, with the two hippies who unfortunately get a ride from mother, had me already knowing what I was in for - a gory little B-movie. And that it was, but it's better than I expected it to be. The two backwoods brothers in the film are grotesque, and the way they so willingly follow through with their domineering mother's orders is disturbing, she controls them like her little puppets, having them exercise, put on little morbid plays for her, etc. The two surviving girls are strong willed and the audience is rooting for them when they get their bloody and well-justified revenge.The mother, who the film mostly revolves around, is a cackling, mad old granny type, and while she's a vile character, she manages to be somewhat funny with the things she says, in a sick and twisted sort of way. The kills in the movie were actually kind of creative too, and the last one was actually funny. I also found it interesting that this movie was being filmed right across the lake from "Friday the 13th" and the same time, and that they had found a dead body in the abandoned backwoods home that housed the family. Kind of creepy if you ask me, things like that I always find to be interesting.Overall, "Mother's Day" is a brutal, gross-out little horror movie that is succeeds well for the type of movie it is. Despite what you may have heard, this film isn't scary on any levels, it mainly gives a few chuckles amidst the brutality that's taking place, which is a strange thing for a movie like this to do. While it may not be completely great, it's a decent B-horror movie. Check it out if you like this kind of stuff. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great and original movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you say about a terrible movie? that you love. How do you defend a movie that you love? for all the wrong reasons. "Mother's Day" is one of those films that I would love to have these answers for.It is filled with all the horror film clichs that we have come to expect and would be disappointed if they weren't present. The old man in the small town warning the heroes to "stay away." The fake scare before the killing starts. An arm out of bushes that ends up being one of the girls. One girl stabbed in the back? surprise she was just kidding.Apart from all the clichs and creative kills, including "DRAINO" and a boob shaped inflatable pillow, there are well thought out characters and a cohesive script. Now I say well thought out characters, because of the diversity of them. Granted they are stock characters, but they work so well together.The premise is, of course, girls in the forest? psycho killers hunt and torture the girls? girls seek revenge on bad guys. But this time the two psychos are not alone. They are provoked by there sadistic, innocent looking mother. Played with comical righteousness by Beatrice Pons, she is the one with the real mental problems.While the script does a great job using foreshadowing and creating believable deep characters, the real strength of the film lies in the performances. The three girls are well developed and by the time the madness starts we know the kind of people they are and are rooting for them more then we would the typical drinking, pot smoking, fornicating teens, that are usually hunted in theses films. Instead we want the girls to get the bad guys. We want them to win.Then we have Ike and Addley the two twisted "Backwoods Freaks." The vicious and precise way these two carry out the disgusting orders of their mother has sent chills through me since I was young. It really doesn't feel like they are faking it. The opening scene, in which they relentlessly beat a girl close to death, goes on just a bit too long to be comfortable.In the end, of course our heroes, at least the ones that make it out alive, get the best of the bad guys with a little vigilante justice. But I was left with a bad taste in my mouth because of the motives of all the characters. One girl pretends she is killing her own mother in her attempt to free herself from the grips of the family.Other than a pointless "surprise" ending, that really only achieves to cheapen the movie, "Mother's Day" will stay in your mind for a while. Well written and directed by Charles Kaufman, brother of Troma Films founder Lloyd Kaufman, this 80's horror classic is a must see for all movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three lovely girls who are friends decide to take a camping vacation together as later it turns into a nightmare when two hillbilly cretins kidnap them and take them to their house occupied by their vicious psychotic mother then hell begins to start for them as they must escape.One of the most underrated horror movies of the early 80's and is one of my favorite horror movies! Charles Kaufman ( the director) with Troma films released this movie in 1980 it was a hit in theaters and became a cult favorite even on the video market. The movie blends gruesome violence with humor in it, there is a couple of rape scenes and some sleazy stuff but this is a terrific fun horror comedy gem from the people who brought you "The Toxic Avenger".Also recommended: "The Hills Have Eyes ( 1978 and 2006)", " The Last House on The Left", "I Spit on Your Grave", "Maniac ( 1980)", " House of 1000 Corpses", "The Devil's Rejects", " Hostel", " Friday The 13th series", "Nightmare on Elm Street Series", " Halloween 1 &amp; 2", " Silent Night Deadly Night", "Blood Sucking Freaks", "High Tension", " Scream", " Bloody Birthday", " The Toxic Avenger", " Terror Train", " Happy Birthday to Me", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", " Terror Firmer", " Caligula", " Blue Velvet", " Lost Highway", " Texas Chainsaw Massacre series including 2003 remake", "Sleepaway Camp"," Just Before Dawn", " Psycho (1960)", "Driller Killer", " The Toolbox Murder", "Street Trash", and "Wrong Turn".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, those midnight Fridays on USA NETWORK. Movies like "Mother's Day", "Bloodmoon", "Dead Dudes In The House", "Girls School Screamers", the "Friday the 13th series", and many Troma movies were played frequently."Mother's Day" is an ultra low budget violent slasher flick that seems to be inspired from the 70's exploitation horror movies. Feels like a mix of "Friday the 13th part 2" and "I Spit On Your Grave".***SPOILERS!!!*** Three young women go to the woods for fun and relax (like in almost every 80's horror movie set in the woods). While being on their sleeping bags they are kidnapped by two moronic (retarded) men that torture them in many ways. The demented men take their victims to their home where , in front of their demented old mother, rape and almost kill the three of them. The "mother" enjoys her sons' acts and pushes them to generate more violence.Actually one of them is killed in a brutal way. The other two decide to take revenge on their victimizers on this bloody "Mother's Day".Violence is not always necessary to "shock" or scare the audience but sometimes it helps to set an atmosphere on horror movies. The acting, and poor direction make the violent scenes laughable. There's a decap, a crotch whacked by a hatchet and a t.v. smashed in a head. So there are a few worth moments from the movie but cannot save it from the large amount of nasty horror movies from the 80's.This flick doesn't feels like a Troma movie but still deserves a watch only by die hard fans of the genre.5/10. High amounts of violence. Your typical slasher flick from the early 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three women go out on their annual trip to the woods where they fish, talk, smoke and enjoy themselves. They are kidnapped by two moronic hillbilly men who bring them home for their mother. They rape, torture and beat one of the woman to death while the mother watches. The other two escape and plot their revenge.This movie isn't as bad as it sounds. The violence and gore here is strong and disturbing but I found this a lot less offensive than "Last House on the Left" and "I Spit on Your Grave". Those two seemed to find some sort of pleasure out of showing innocent women being tortured, raped and beaten. This movie doesn't come off that way. We identify with the women from the very beginning and are rooting for them all the way through. The mother and her sons are shown as sick, repellent people from the beginning. The violence is, as I said, strong but this movie has very little nudity like the other two do. And the finale is certainly a rouser (in a sick sort of way).The acting is surprisingly not bad. No one is fantastic, but no one is horrible either. The actress playing the mother is especially good. Also for a low budget picture this looks incredibly good--bright vivid colors and professionally shot. Good music score too which perfectly fits the mood of the picture.It isn't perfect-it has its dull spots, the comedy is terrible and the ending was just lousy. Still, if you have a strong stomach and want a taste of good old graphic 80s horror, this is for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MOTHER'S DAY is the sort of movie you should have to go to a cave to see. It's not a horror movie so much as a filmed torture session, with no one tortured as much as the viewer. The plot has three former roommates from college making the worst choice of vacation location of all time--the middle of the woods near the house of a psychotic woman and her "boys." It's not a badly made movie (or at least not stupidly made), but its feeble attempts at satire are outweighed by its blatant misogyny. Early in the movie the boyfriend of one of the main women characters playfully pretends to be rapist, and the movie plays along with gotcha! music. That's a pretty good indication of where this movie's head is at. Completely objectionable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrific little horror gem and a family film in every sense of the phrase. Not only does this film concern a sick and depraved family of back-woods murderers but the film itself is made by the Kaufman family. Charles Kaufman is director, writer, and producer(he also has a brief cameo as a cocaine snorter in the beginning of the film). There is also a cameo appearance in the film by Stanley Kaufman. The film would later be distributed by Troma, a company own and ran by the infamous Lloyd Kaufman (Lloyd would also serve as the film's assistant producer). Even Susan Kaufman was involved as the Production Designer. All of this serves the film well because Mother's Day is a different kind of horror flick. Yes there is a murder in the opening sequence, but after that, the film takes it's time letting you get to know the three main characters and their relationship with one another. This makes the horrific events that happen to them later in the film that much more shocking and horrifying. The acting is surprisingly good for a B-grade horror flick...especially Beatrice Pons aka Rose Ross who plays "Mother". Highly recommended viewing for horror fans.</fullReview>

That doesn't even make sense. I'm sorry but watching women get raped is not scary to me, it's just sick and sick is not scary. Plus, she calls herself a woman, allowing her sons to rape women.

Eventually the victims turn tables on their captors. What a wonderful Mother's Day present! Disgusting and sick. This film is an embarrassment to the industry! What message is such a women-hating film sending to adolescent males (who likely comprise almost the entire target audience). Is rape cool? Do women ask for it? Is violence fun? These are the images shown in this so called piece of "entertainment". And we wonder why we are such a violent society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mother's Day (1980) BOMB (out of 4) A mother is raising her two retarded, redneck sons deep in the woods where she teaches them how to rape and murder women. Just by chance three women go to the woods to spend the weekend when they are kidnapped and taken back to the house of torture. Although this came out in the Halloween and Friday the 13th era it's basically just another rip of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring, which of course was turned into Craven's notorious shocker The Last House on the Left. I must admit that I hated this movie with a very strong passion because this is without a doubt one of the worst movies to come out of the decade and I might be kind by just keeping it to this one decade. This is from the team who would eventually form Troma but this thing isn't even up to their standards. This movie is so incredibly bad with the acting, directing and screenplay that I must admit to being speechless when I read reviews about how depraved and deranged this movie is. It is. It's just downright stupid with one dumb scene right after another. I honestly couldn't tell if the film was trying to be a spoof of horror movies because of the humor or if it was actually trying to be scary but failed. Either way the thing doesn't work but I have to wonder what was up with some of the comedy including a sequence where two of the women, with bags on their heads, walk into a grocery store and make a mess. Was this suppose to make us laugh? Does anyone really think adults would do such a dumb thing? The acting by the three women are downright bad but the worst has to be Beatrice Pons (working under Rose Ross) as mother. She is so incredibly bad in the opening sequence that the twist that follows is ruined before it can even get started. The guys playing her sons aren't any better and come off rather embarrassing. Again, how anyone could find this thing disturbing is beyond me but perhaps I've just seen too many crazy moves in my lifetime. I'm really not sure how anyone could take anything here serious but perhaps some might enjoy laughing at the movie. I couldn't find anything to laugh at either so needless to say the movie was very useless to me. If you want some better rape/review films then there are plenty out there better than this thing.</fullReview>

Everyone who has commented that this is a masterpiece or a comedic gem should seriously sit down and consider their general attitudes towards women. I like the horror genre and will put up with the oft seen unnecessary nudity (mainly female) for the sake of some interesting ideas or a bit of true horror - but this film just went way too far.Troma's so called feminism is something that has always made me wonder - but this thing should be used merely as a indication of how low and disgusting film makers will go to make a buck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to agree with another commenter. "Mother's Day" is nothing but garbage. It's neither scary nor funny. Three college friends thought their idea of a reunion was a camping trip in the woods. Their vacation is ruined by an old lady and her two perverted sons. They torture and rape the three women. One dies, but the other two seek revenge and strike back in disgusting detail. I'm glad that I used my Blockbuster coupon for this crap. My evaluation: (no stars).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen...I've seen movies that have sucked but never to this extent! I thought "oh boy, I'm in for a ride" when the hillbillies came up and chopped off the guy's head and his headless corpse fell to the ground (I noticed that the girlfriend of that dude screamed but her head wasn't even turned towards the side of the car so how could she have seen the hillbillies coming?) You'll notice a lot of product placement in here (Draino, Sprite, and Trix just to name a few.) They watched a lot of TV too.This one just sucked so much...I was in Blockbuster and was disappointed to see their crappy selection of horror movies so I picked out this one, knowing it'd suck but figuring that I'd have a good laugh at a cheap 80's horror flick but I was so bored during this. I just watched the whole thing to see how it'd turn out.God...I just can't believe I wasted time out of my life on this!Since when are there hillbillies in New Jersey?! It's awful towards the end too when they tied up their shirts into sports bras and put headbands on to go back and fight them...oh my God. WTF! Just run! (The blonde chick should've just stolen that cop car from earler!) And they also had their dead friend's corpse laying there so she could see them fighting back! Then when they were fighting back they shoved Draino down the hillbilly's throat and he's still walking and then slam a "TV" on him (you can easily see the fake plastic screen on it) and then you think he's dead but he's STILL alive (he should've been dead after they forced the Draino down his throat.)The ending got a laugh out of me. A stupid ending to a stupid movie.I though I'd have some fun watching an obviously campy 80's horror flick but oh man, was I wrong! DO NOT waste your time on this piece of crap! Just a random thought, but is the director of this gay? They showed a dude's ass and you can see a Muslce magazine is the hillbillies' room and they didn't show any bare boobs at all (in a movie that you'd think would show them.) 1/10 (I wish I could give it a 0!)</fullReview>
