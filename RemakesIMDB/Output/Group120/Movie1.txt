		<shortDescription>A perfect example of a movie being so bad it's good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that is very difficult to give a star rating because its high entertainment value is due to the fact that it's almost completely terrible.A remake of the 1955 Humphry Bogart-Fredric March potboiler, DESPERATE HOURS is an unrelentingly bizarre piece of exploitation trash. There's virtually nothing "good" about it. The screenplay ranges from scattershot to just plain off-the-wall weird, the performances are some of the most over-the-top ever committed to film and the direction is borderline psychotic. Director Michael Cimino and producer Dino De Laurentiis once again prove that they are more capable than anyone else in the film industry of taking a potentially good idea and drowning it in excessiveness.Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins are both excellent actors. They are also actors who go from mannered to berserk very quickly. Both chew the scenery as if their lives depend on it. Mimi Rodgers is wooden even during emotionally intense scenes, Shawnee Smith is distraught before the home invaders show up and Lindsay Crouse is both wooden and over-the-top at the same time.Kelly Lynch is the only actor who turns in even an appropriate performance, evoking a sense of hopelessness and panic from the start that makes you feel for her character, even if she has dug her own grave. This doesn't help a bewildering early scene in which her blouse spontaneously pops open to reveal her bare breasts make any more sense, however.There are a lot of interesting plot and characterization ideas floating around the proceedings but none of them are ever fully developed. It reminds me of Cimino's HEAVEN'S GATE and De Laurentiis's DUNE, two similarly flawed but occasionally brilliant disasters which have grown better with age. Maybe with time, viewers will begin to see the tight, complex thriller struggling to break through the mess that is DESPERATE HOURS.But all this analysis begs the question, would the movie have been more entertaining had it been put together more coherently? The answer is: probably not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A peculiar piece of entertainment, Michael Cimino's Desperate Hours feels rather odd for a number of reasons. Not the least of which is the off kilter performance of Lindsay Crouse as the FBI agent from another galaxy. Was that lady weird or what? I couldn't understand 50% of what she said throughout this very watchable mess of a movie. Not surprisingly, Cimino's pacing is somehow frustrating and gripping at the same time. This aspect of his films seem to linger in my memory for awhile. Fans of Kelly Lynch should realize that she's topless for much of her screen time. Finally, I found the score to be very unique in flavor. Most movies of this type have a dark, menacing soundtrack. The music here is often lush,ethereal sentimental even. Not much tension sustained, but this alternates nicely with the over the top performances of Rourke, Rogers and Hopkins. All in all I think this an enjoyable flick for those looking for something slightly different in their suspense movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bosworth is on trial and clearly not a nice man in the courtroom. When he goes to another room to talk with his beautiful lawyer Nancy, he steals a gun she has hidden under her skirt (how anything can be hidden under THAT skirt is a mystery) and escapes, joining his brother and another man.Meanwhile, Tim Cornell, a lawyer whose family lives in a nice house, is trying to make peace with his wife Nora after an affair, but she is convinced the marriage is over and she is in the process of selling the house, as the sign out front makes clear. Bosworth and his associates show up and take the family hostage, and they use whatever information they can find for their benefit.There are several exciting scenes in the beautiful wilderness of what is said to be Utah. Nancy is chased because she is suspected of helping Bosworth, though exactly what happened with that chase is not clear. We only see what happened later. And the process of finding out what happened to Bosworth is fasscinating.Mickey Rourke does a good job, thoroughly evil in court but calm and almost kind with the family most of the time. Anthony Hopkins also delivers, keeping his cool throughout most of the ordeal and coming across as intelligent and even caring. Mimi Rogers did a great job as well playing Nora. Despite their problems, it was clear this was a loving family and they all cared about each other. This is not a particularly violent movie, though at least one person does die. This is more of a psychological thriller than a Schwarzenegger action movie, though at one point a comparison to an action movie would make sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cimino: high on style. low on logic. form=content. go figure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think on a certain level this film works quite well. First, throw out everything you know about the 1955 version. Next, abandon paying too much attention to how the plot progresses (gee, Kelly Lynch's character seems to disappear for extended periods of time, and it's amazing that the FBI ever found following her to be worth it. And she is supposed to be one of the smarter characters, but then again, you took what Lindsay Crouse's character said about her too seriously.) The film has a most curious tone, and just when you think it's going to turn into an art film, we get a shoot-em-up or some other plot contrivance to bring it back to earth. The soundtrack is a moody pastiche of 50's style orchestrations (no rock music!) and recalls moody post-noir thrillers of the late 50's-early 60's.And what a fascinating line-up of players, performances, and characters. Kelly Lynch's acting directions must have been "look snappy, especially topless, act like you just ingested a gram of cocaine, and all will go well." One of these first years Cimino will put together all the pieces and come up with a really good, coherent film. For a really good obtuse film, reference Walter Hill's "The Driver" with Ryan O'Neal. Oh, and if you ever thought you could mess with Lindsay Crouse, this film should dispel that notion. She's much badder than Mickey Rourke - and that's the biggest surprise of the whole picture! And with a lot less screen time, too. And by golly I guess Mickey Rourke's character is just an obsessive lover of the enigmatic Lynch. That explains a lot. Coolest line in the film: FBI agent says to Crouse (after she got shot in the leg) : "Where are you hit?" Answer: "In the ego."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperate Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the financial disaster that was HEAVEN'S GATE, Michael Cimino was on a warpath to prove he was still a legitimate filmmaker. He subsequently made the overwrought YEAR OF THE DRAGON, THE SICILIAN and a remake of DESPERATE HOURS in the 1980s. All of those films bombed at the B.O. and his credibility never really recovered. Of all three films he directed in the 80s, DESPERATE HOURS is, by far, the worst. The movie is bad, bad, bad. The movie actually reflects its title. It's truly desperate.Like the director, the film wants to be taken seriously and yet it's woefully misguided with overwrought acting, leaden direction that rarely makes any sense and a script that's totally outdated and is divorced from logic. As I've said, the movie wants to be taken seriously but every attempt of seriousness is quickly shot down with remarkably ludicrous details. For instance, when David Morse is alone in the wilderness and he's running away from the police, the whole moment is (oddly) directed with reverence but then, as Morse is heading towards a gas station, he meets two buxom bimbos who are dressed in such ridiculous clothes (they look like they just stepped out of a Playboy spread) that the director's attempt at reverence is destroyed by the unexpected sight of those two women who just didn't belong in the movie. I'm sure someone got laid from hiring those two women. Arf!And then there's the whole way Kelly Lynch is treated in the movie. What an embarrassing role. She didn't deserve to be treated like that. I love Leonard Maltin's description of what is done to her character: kamikaze disrobing. But topping everything, even the dreadful music or scenery chewing from Mickey Rourke or Anthony Hopkins, is Lindsay Crouse's performance, which can only be described as being out of this world. The way she talks, enunciates her dialogue, the way her character is directed, well, the whole thing is totally perplexing. I've tried to come up with a way to describe her acting/role but I can't. Remember Dolores Fuller's acting in GLEN OR GLENDA? Well, Lindsay Crouse must have taken some lessons from Dolores because her acting is identical. Personally speaking, Lindsay Crouse's acting in DH ranks up there as one of the weirdest performances ever put on screen.I haven't seen the original version of DESPERATE HOURS but I can't imagine it's remotely close to being as dreadful as Michael Cimino's version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>micheal cimino is a talented and (to many) an infuriating film maker but along with this and his prior 'the sicilian' he really comes a cropper. the premise is promising; a strong cast and an engaging idea to update and alternate the original story about an escaped group of felons who are held up with a well to do american family soon becomes a botched, disappointing misfire. most of the scenes are poorly handled and are unintentionally funny particularly involving anthony hopkins giving a pretty confusing performance. **** me, he starts off at the beginning as a yank ("hi honey, i'm home!") and then halfway through ends up sounding like his captain bligh incarnation from 'the bounty'! throughout the movie he spends alot of time being hauled around and generally manhandled by mickey rourke who gives the best performance and is about the only redeeming feature of this sorry mess. mimi rogers supplys a typically bland, squeky clean supporting role as hopkin's long sufferring spouse though kelly lynch isen't too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins - winning combination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big Mickey Rourke fan from his string of hits in the 80's. I kind of fell off the bandwagon during the 90's, finding his choice of films to be somewhat uninspiring. Still a great actor, just seemed to be having some trouble picking quality projects. Seeing 'Sin City' brought me back (great role, great acting, great film!), so I picked up 'Desperate Hours' and watched it last night. While the supporting characters could have been better written (Kelly Lynch &amp; Mimi Rogers' characters fell flat), the scenes between Rourke &amp; Anthony Hopkins were wonderful! Elias Koteas as Rourke's brother was forgettable, but David Morse's character of Albert was very interesting. Somewhat like a big dumb 'Lenny' to Rourke's 'George'. Like another reviewer I was reminded of Humphrey Bogart's 'Duke Mantee' in the 1936 film 'Petrified Forest', but Rourke's 'Michael Bosworth' was a little more homicidal and more of a loose cannon. If you like Rourke &amp; Hopkins, you will enjoy watching 'Desperate Hours.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Desperate" one "Hour" and forty-five minutes....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once, Michael Cimino was a great director. Now, he's just a Hollywood joke. Why?Here's a good example."Desperate Hours" is a remake of a similar movie which starred Humphrey Bogart. I've never seen the original. Wish I could say the same about the remake.Rourke plays the mad dog killer this time out, who is on the lam with his attorney (Lynch, who should probably sue Cimino for defamation of character) and holes up with his cronies in the house of a distant man (Hopkins) and his equally distant family. Screams, fights, violence and blood all share equal screen time.Then Crouse shows up to head the manhunt for Rourke and every last shred of belief jumps out the window to escape her. Are FBI agents really this stupid? Don't they have entrance exams? Isn't it against the law to endanger innocent peoiple just to capture an escaped convict? Isn't it? Didn't Cimino and his writers suspect as much?Wait, I forget: this is the same man who made "Heaven's Gate".This is, without a doubt, one of the most blatantly stupid, tasteless, egomaniacal trips through Idiot-Land I've even seen since "Dumb and Dumber". But at least THAT one was supposed to be funny.No stars. Not a one. Watching "Desperate Hours" is like witnessing a car accident, only more painful and with more victims.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cimino is a hack.There, I said it. Deal with it.So he gets lucky with one film, The Deer Hunter - having great actors like De Niro, Steep and Walken doesn't hurt. But Desperate Hours is like a High School film project - only worse.It is terribly put together with jump cuts, poor camera angles and perspective, terrible continuity, poor story, time-frame mismanagement, unbelievable plot holes and poor characters.The action sequences are a joke too. For example, one minute you have squads of highly trained and armed professionals who literally can't shoot the bad guys right in front of them with automatic weapons. Then a couple of scenes later said professionals now all have red-dot sights all over bad guys and can shoot with pinpoint accuracy - all in the very same location as the scene before. Stupefying.I could go on and on with the problems in many scenes but I have better things to do. Like count the number of piles in my living room carpet.Bottom line: Desperate Hours is one of those movies that's so bad it becomes an unintentional comedy.</fullReview>

And then I found out why.This is just pure Hollywood, formulaic, intelligence-insulting crap. Don't engage your brain. But even then you'll be suffering through it.

		<fullReview>Why is it that Hollywood believes that taking an old movie and putting a modern spin on it,is going to make it "even better than the original?"I've seen and reviewed the original Humphry Bogart movie and now that I've seen this version on the "THIS" network last night,it only makes me like Bogie's even more. The original slowly built up it's story and every bit of the action was well timed and gave you that sense of urgency and fear for the family in question. In this one,it's was quite obvious that they were going for more focus on action and a slick look,than they were for acting. Even a great actor like Anthony Hopkins,has his performance diluted by all of this mayhem. His role is okay but really doesn't get interesting until the last 30 minutes or so. The rest of the family pales in comparison to the 1950's version. In that one,they all took a shot at out-witting the bad guys. Nora,the mom/wife,when first confronted by the gang of three is told by one of them,"I found someone's bikini by the pool." She stupidly tells them,"That's my daughter's". Good mom,tell these desperate criminals you have a daughter. The little boy only cries for his mom or dad and only defies Rourke by saying"I'm going to bed". The son in Bogart's,hit,kicked and screamed at them.Their daughter,while crying and emotional over the situation,is otherwise not a very interesting character. Her boyfriend,unlike in the original where he gets clued in, seems to somehow know she needs to be rescued,when really,he knows nothing of what's happening in the house. Rourke's acting does not evoke a sense of fear and urgency like Bogart's did. I realize two different actors,two different styles but Rourke's doesn't even have a "style". All he does is act a little smug,or very angry and even his anger made me laugh. The female lawyer he supposedly "loves" is a pretty thin character but even thinner and worse than that is the female FBI agent. Her performance is without a doubt the worst acting from a female I've ever seen. She spouts her lines like a female auditioning to be The Terminator or maybe making it obvious she's a member of the Jack Webb fan club! ...but ,her lines are so hollow and virtually emotionless ,she'd make Webb sound like Sir Laurence Olivier. The only thing that kept me watching this film was to see the differences between the two films and to get to the anticipated climax. I knew how it would end but I had to see it through.3 stars (and I'm being kind here) for a few good scenes of action and the ending. The end of 2 desperate hours. (END)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great remake of a Humphrey Bogart psycho drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Desperate Hours" is a 1990 remake of William Wyler's psycho drama of the same name from 1955 featuring Humphrey Bogart and Fredric March as original cast. Michael Cimino directed this story of a blood-thirsty gang raiding an upper class suburb house on their run from the police after a series of ambitious big projects like "Heaven's Gate", "Year of the Dragon" and "The Sicilian" in the eighties.In this remake, it is Mickey Rourke's turn to play Bogart's leading role, and he turned Bogart's coolness into a portrait of a psychopathic gentleman gangster whose violent dominance is about to erupt like a volcano every second. His counterpart is lawyer Anthony Hopkins, an upper-class citizen and head of a broken family. Both men are fighting against each other in every possible way, starting with psycho duels and witty conversations to hard fights and pure wars of nerves.Most of the plot takes place in Hopkins' house, and as soon as the story is settled out of this apparent suburb paradise hell breaks out, starting from Rourke's violent escape from a courthouse prison in the beginning of the film to the final showdown when the police arrives.Cimino's direction works well with his whole ensemble often placed in the living room like actors on a static theater stage, and the camera views the psychological warfare often from a very distant ankle like in a documentary. The great cast of all actors featuring Mimi Rodgers, Kelly Lynch, Elias Koteas and David Morse and the minimal and seducing sound track score by David Mansfield add much tension to this well-dome remake of a great fifties crime drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible remake of a Humphrey Bogart film. Mickey Rourke plays a criminal who escapes from jail with help from his lawyer (Kelly Lynch). He decides to hide out in the house of a heavily dysfunctional family (played by Mimi Rogers, Anthony Hopkins and Shawnee Smith). Lindsay Crouse pops up as a police chief trying to capture him.I caught this in a theatre back in 1990 and, try as I might, I can't forget how TERRIBLE this film was! Director Michael Cimino frankly can't direct. "The Deer Hunter" was a fluke. After that he did "Heaven's Gate", "Year of the Dragon, "The Sicilian" and this--all box office bombs. The direction in this is beyond belief. Badly lit, terribly staged and weird camera angles. He single-handedly destroys any visual quality the film might have had. The plot is bad--full of loopholes and bad dialogue. The acting couldn't be worse. You have talented actors like Lynch, Rogers and especially Hopkins giving their all time worst performances. Rourke and Crouse never could act so their bad acting is expected. Worst of all was Smith. She is so incredibly annoying you'll be rooting for Rourke to shoot her dead! This was quickly forgotten and (thankfully) has stayed that way. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Cimino - Ed Wood Reincarnated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Cimino was heralded for "The Deer Hunter", which was an inspired, powerful film, the complete opposite of the disastrous "Heaven's Gate". Now, Cimino breaks new ground with "The Desperate Hours". The whole movie is a mess. I'll list just a few examples:The head of the FBI unit was, of course, a woman. She had the most ridiculous 80's blonde, curly "big hair" imaginable. It was always blowing in her face. She spoke with the most phony southern accent I ever heard. She always was yelling and giving orders. We get it; she's in charge.The scene where one of the criminals, covered in blood, came across two college girls who were standing by their truck at a gas station. These girls had bodies so hot that they were x-rated. One of them had the most outlandish denim shorts on. No woman could ever have worn them in public. 99% of her buttocks poured out of them.In another scene, the girlfriend of one of the criminals was being fitted with a hidden microphone. So there she is, in a room full of people, completely topless, as a man tapes a microphone between her breasts. She was talking to the woman FBI leader like this was an everyday occurrence as the FBI man carefully taped the mike on her skin. I'm not making this up. And her breasts were the most perky money could buy.The scene where the fugitive is walking through the picturesque wilderness. The theme from "Red River Valley" is playing. The cops tell him to drop his gun from 100 yards away. He holds the pistol in the air and they shoot him at least 100 times with automatic weapons.Mickey Rourke runs out of bullets, so Anthony Hopkins, who is 20 years older than Rourke, out of shape, and covered in blood from a chest wound, holds a pistol in one hand and drags and tosses Rourke around like a rag doll. Not once did Rourke think of grabbing the gun from Hopkins' hand. As Hopkins throws Rourke down the stairs with one hand, the entire banister rail, which runs the length of the stairs, breaks off. Now this is a grand staircase in an upper class mansion. So much for craftsmanship.That's just the tip of the iceberg. This movie is just as bad as anything Ed Wood put out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Cast Wasted on Bad Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Cimino delivers another unfocused, meandering "epic."Like Cimino's "The Sicilian," this movie is an adaptation of a novel. And like that earlier film, this one is dragged down by elliptical and illogical story points.Cimino's weakness as a director is his inability to distinguish between cleanly complex story lines and unnecessarily complicated story machinations. Like "The Sicilian" this film sputters forward in stuttering starts and maddening stalls.How so many fine actors came to agree to be in this movie is a mystery. The script is so illogical at times that it stops you cold with wonder. Didn't anyone notice how inconsistent Mickey Rourke's character was? How unbelievable the characters' motivations and actions were in so many scenes?A few glaring examples: when the teenage boy shows up demanding to keep his date, it would have been simple to have the father tell him she was sick and asleep and couldn't be disturbed. Instead, the consummately cold-blooded and brilliantly devious villain sends the girl out on the date, trusting her not to run right to the police for help? Even worse, she complies.And when the boy does first arrive, he mentions not one word about the massive police barricades he just passed on his way to the house.The interaction between the law officers is just as nutty. Lindsey Crouse is a shrill feminazi barking orders, until her lamely contrived "character change."With three screenwriters on board, it would normally be hard to fathom exactly what went wrong. But checking the credits, we find that two of them had previously collaborated on several much better movies. The third is the original writer, who had a hand in the screenplay, as well as having penned the novel and a play based on it. My guess is that Cimino deserves the blame. Based on his earlier works, he seems to think long and rambling equates to epic. One telling scene set in a beautiful outdoor setting, with music ripped off from a John Ford western, testifies to Cimino's self-grandiose vision.This film wouldn't be nearly as painful to sit through if Cimino was less talented at handling actors and placing his camera. It's too bad he has such rotten story sense. Apparently he needs a stronger, more intelligent producer than DeLaurentiis and better story development executives to reel him in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is nothing special. It's your everyday hostage thriller. The lighting is not only mediocre, for most of the last half hour, it literally prevents you from seeing what the hell is going on. As usual, the hostage takers make all the typical mistakes, even though their leader is supposed to be exceptionally smart. The script is badly written, the character development is clumsy, and the acting is sub par. I've honestly seen school projects that were better. It also has it's share of clichés; every time the police shoots a criminal, it's a regular shooting spree. The police breaks the law, in order to uphold the law, and, most importantly, the police officer in control 'puts her ass on the line'. Ridiculous. Worst of all the ending was so bad, it seemed like the films writer had a good idea up to that point, and then he just decided to kill off the bad guy, so that the audience would cheer for the police, who probably had a fun time pumping him full of hot lead as he knelt down, unarmed, ready to be arrested. Terrible. Watch this only if you have a hard-on for hostage thrillers, and you have absolutely nothing better to do(which is pretty impossible, considering how bad it is). 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an embarrassment. It should never have been released. It should have been consigned to the stuporous netherworld of HBO reruns. Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins are redoubtable talents, but they require a firm directorial hand to deliver satisfying performances. That hand is absent here. Hopkin's accent varies all over the place, and his theatrical bellowing is in weird contrast to the serpentine hissing of Rourke. The relation between him and his brother is never fleshed out; this was the most emotionally satisfying aspect of the Humphrey Bogart- Dewey Martin relationship in the classic movie. Lindsay Crouse, as a dippy Southern accented FBI agent, conjures up outlandish ad hoc schemes which cannot be understood by the viewer and perhaps were not understood even by the scriptwriter. The struggles, the theatrics, the emotion-tinged outbursts seem improvised. The sole actor to escape unscathed is Philadelphia's own David Morse, although an unintended moment of high comedy is provided when, after disposing out of a body and drenched with his own and the other's blood, he stumbles out of a creek to encounter two nubile lasses loading merchandise into a pickup. "What college do you go to?" he asks brightly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does anyone remember Michael Cimino? Well, if you don't he was the director of The Deerhunter, a major success as well as a film regarded subsequently as a 70's classic by critics. What happened a few years later was, he made his second film, 'Heaven's Gate' which unfortunately, was a legendary flop. The film bankrupted United Artists studio and since the film was his idea, who else was going to get the blame? Cimino was persona non grata for a long time with the major Hollywood studios, then made a comeback in the 90's with a series of coolly received films, but was never again to achieve the pre-eminence he had gained with 'The Deerhunter'. This movie was one of his attempts at a directorial comeback, but unfortunately it was derided by critics and public and failed to make much of an impression. As a remake of an old Humphrey Bogart vehicle, the film started behind the eight ball (some re-makes alienate the fans of the first version and can have what I would call, an 'aversion' factor which has to be overcome to make any kind of impression.) This remake of 'The Desperate Hours' (1954) was frankly, just never good enough to overshadow the original, much less to make money or find a contemporary audience.A group of gangsters conduct a nasty home invasion so they can kidnap an entire family and hold them to ransom for a vast amount of money. Well, what is the verdict? The cast seems solid, we have Anthony Hopkins, Mickey Rourke,and Kelly Lynch. The only one arising out of the ashes with their credibility intact seems to be Lindsay Crouse, playing a police woman who figures out what is going on in the house across the street. 'The Desperate Hours' suffers from misconceived characters as well as credibility problems with the script. The so-called 'good' people are pinched and small minded. They bicker amongst each other and are unable to make any kind of plan as to how to escape from their kidnappers. The 'bad' people are two-dimensional cardboard cutouts. Mickey Rourke is insufferable in this and why the others follow his orders is the sole thing to keep the audience awake just long enough so they can scratch their heads and ponder about it; there is no one in the cast for the audience to identify with, even remotely. Lynch and Rourke have a romantic tryst up against a wall that caused some comment, most of it derisive, and the film died the death on its first release.There are some who would defend 'The Desperate Hours' but I'm not one of them. I thought it was a yawn from beginning to end and frankly not worth anybody's time. The exception to all this mediocrity is Lindsay Crouse who has to put up with such little screen time she must have wondered why she accepted the part at all. Unfortunately for all concerned, 'The Desperate Hours' leaves the audience with about one hundred minutes of dead time. There are plenty more interesting crime films out there and I would say that it's best to skip 'The Desperate Hours' for something more rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Below Par Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite on paper a very good cast this is a surprisingly weak film. You know you are in cliché-land when the opening shot is of a shapely leg stepping out from a car door taken from ground level. The cliché continues through the description of the main protagonist Rourke as being the ice cold killer with a genius level IQ. This does not play into the rest of the film as he shows an amazing lack of any cunning or even basic planning, based on his ineptitude he would fail to get away with a shoplifting. As for the story it is standard stuff, everyday man gets to prove his mettle to a disillusioned family by taking taking on the cardboard bad guys in a life or death situation. It is also amusing that by far the must brutal people in the movie are the police. Not that they are portrayed as corrupt but the writers opinion seems to be why use a taser when two clips from an automatic weapon get roughly the same result - suspect on floor. Not that bad, not that good. The reason I give it such a low mark is the performances of those who play law enforcement. I can only assume it was directors instructions as they all speak in this strange staccato style in a weird drawling accent, odd and really grating.All in all - don't bother,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rourke overacts his way through the role originated by Bogie in this standard thriller with no real punch or exciting moment. Crouse is horribly miscast as a ballsy cop. Lynch is useless, but then the character has no real focus. She should have been cut out. Hopkins' tortured father and husband is the best thing going here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you even screw this up? How do you screw up a script that was already a successful book and film? I don't know, but somehow Michael Cimino did it. This mediocre movie is a 100-minute snorefest about a bad dude (played by Mickey Rourke, who contributes nothing to the role), who kidnaps a upper-middle-class family. Most of the other actors do good to very good jobs, notably Michael Morse who plays one of Rourke's cronies, and Anthony Hopkins in a role which is far beneath him. But the plot is nothing but totally predictable filler and just when you think it has gone nowhere, it goes even more nowhere. Since we already know that the script can be done well, there is no one to blame here except Michael Cimino for the non-direction this movie took. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cimino and Rourke play the hostage game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Cimino's Desperate Hours, despite only really being a serviceable home invasion/hostage thriller, still has a lot of fun with it's two leads, brash sociopath Mickey Rourke and even brasher estranged family man Anthony Hopkins. Based on a creaky old Humphrey Bogart film, Cimino obviously vamps up the violence and eroticism that simmers beneath it quite a bit, and when you have Rourke as your antagonist you know it's not going to be anywhere near a relaxed affair. He plays Michael Bosworth, a dangerous felon on the run with two other goons, his volatile brother (Elias Koteas) and another creepy lowlife (David Morse). He crashes into the home life of Tim Cornell (Anthony Hopkins) a boorish father visiting his wife (Mimi Rogers) and children. The film mainly takes place inside the house, as the creep factor rises along with the threat of blaring violence which we know will come, made all the more likely by the growing police presence outdoors, and the tensions of everyone involved, threatening to snap at any moment. Rourke walks a tightrope between amiable and unstable, a man sure of himself, who always gets his way, and is capable of bad, bad things if he feels he won't. Hopkins plays Cornell as a man used to being in control, but his inability to hold his family together is made worse by the gang's arrival, rubbing salt in an already festering wound. Cimino has a brawny style to his violence, a trademark that's seemingly born of both De Palma and Peckinpah, rich bloody gun battles and accentuated slow motion death scenes. Most of the film is held back, but the flood gates do eventually open and action hounds will get what they came for. Watch for Lindsay Crouse, Kelly Lynch, Shawnee Smith, James Rebhorn and Dean Norris as well. Not groundbreaking in the least as far as thrillers are concerned, but still an entertaining little piece made memorable by Rourke and Cimino's ever interesting pairing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let yourself loose, for some enteraining hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Desperate Hours is a film that makes itself bigger than it is. Have I written that starting line in another review? I do like those movies, though. Just learning this is a remake, again I'm a bit embittered, as I thought this was a true blue original. I love this movie, every time, I see it, and yes there are some faults, and some real idiotic moments, really picking them out this time, but hey, that just adds a funny element to this movie, that didn't garner a cinematic release in Adelaide where instead, it played in a film festival showing at the State Theatre, Zandalee was also another. Following a court trial, convicted killer Michael Bosworth (Rourke, very good) absconds with two accomplices, one his ex con brother, Elias Koteas who doesn't have much to do in the film, and his childhood friend, ex con Albert, David Morse as we've never seen him before, a slow, fiesty, idiot of low intellect. His dying scene, is just another bombastic moment, but it's funny, tragic, and memorable. Part of this goes to the opening of the music score. The three crims, yeah for some reason, hold out, in the expensive confines of a well to do family. And it's not the really best time to be dropping in, or not? You'll find the real answer at the end of the film. The house is maintained by Nora (Mimi Rodgers, strong as always) and her teen daughter Shawnee Smith, really good and her little brother. She's separated from her much older ex, Hopkins, who's a real provider for the family, as well as being a responsible father, who, if you can believe, has been busy chasing young skirts half his age. Good for him. Then Rodger's family peace, is rudely and silkily invaded by Rourke, and company. Rourke plays such a smooth psychopath, who's very intelligent, and you don't know when he will lose it. He's made his character intriguing, though he has done better acting. How intelligent is he? Hey, he let Hopkins go by himself, to withdraw, a substantial amount of moolah, from the bank, while they stay holding court, risking the possibility of Hopkins, informing authorities, trusting him that much. I pondered that scene, when judging Rourke's manipulative, edgy, psychopathic character. That's exactly what you'd do, if you were dealing with that particular psychopath. You wouldn't tell authorities. And as for them crashing this family's home. Yeah wheels are turning, right? But think about how high profile, Bosworth is, and for him to escape, you pretty much would have to take shelter somewhere, a place, where the cops wouldn't automatically assume he's hiding. But we have another smart cookie, Crouse, the best performance in the film, as the defiant and bulldogged female FBI agent, heading her team of cops, sharpshooters, baiting Rourke by using his defence attorney/girlfriend, (Lynch, never looking hotter). The film relies on the interaction of characters, and I must say, I found this best, in the small exchange of hateful dialogue, between daughter (Smith) and Rourke. That worked much better than what transpired between him and Hopkins. There was no real chemistry at all, no real spark, which kind of annoyed me. Something you don't want happening between two leads. I really wish Koteas had a chance to do more, where he really bloodies it up in the end. DH may have it's share of faults, and is quite disfavored I see, but it's also bloody entertaining and to a point, unintentionally funny. Love film's opening score, and it's speeding car shots and masterfully breathtaking. Like a few of these hostage, mostly one set piece dramas, DH doesn't have the most tense atmosphere, as these others, but may'be I didn't feel like this, the first time I saw it. But I really understand the reasons for some of the character's actions, where other reviewers may think, "As if". May'be this could be the most misjudged thing about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, solid crime film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie since it came out. The cast is really good, and their performances are strong all around. Cimino is good director, and I don't think that he made a bad movie. He was given a bad reputation by the industry since "Heaven's Gate" incident, simply because he wouldn't readily adhere to production guidelines, and wanted too much to be an "auteur", in a European cinema sense of the word. He was mostly not allowed to present his movies, as he wanted them to be, and the flickers of his talent just sparkle through the studio assembled films he made, visible to those who look for them, understanding visual poetry preserved in exterior scenery, his director's trademark.I haven't seen the original, but "Desperate Hours" of 1990 is no worse than any far better rated crime or thriller movies that were hailed as a "box office hit". The plot is not weaker, and there aren't any goofs to report on this film, which means that it was done professionally or simply done well. It's aim to entertain, and involve it's audience in the plight of the family whose home is invaded by assortment of thugs, the main one being a truly disturbed individual, is fully served, helped by fantastic performances of Anthony Hopkins, whose gentlemanly grace in a desperate effort to protect his family is essential, along with Ann Archer, who is simultaneously strong and beautiful, as the mother caught in between the failing marriage and threat to her family. To understand Lindsay Crouse's performance, often labeled as overacting, it is essential to know what kind of a female would join police forces and be prepared to shoot, and be shot at. Not a femininely damsel for sure. So she is what she's supposed to be, hard talking, and behaving awkwardly in a sense that she is a military man's spirit, inhabiting female body, all to serve the story in each and every aspect that it has. It is hard to understand today, that Mickey Rourke was a unique kind of character actor back in the 80's, but we have filmed proof, one of which is Cimino's very own "Year of the dragon".This is a good solid film that didn't age at all, but preserved it's qualities, beautiful cinematography, fierce acting performances, intensity and atmosphere, 26 years on, looking and feeling as good today, as when I first saw it. Not many more films of the genre, with far better rating, reputation of their director, and income, could say that about themselves now. Worth revisiting. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badly conceived remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1955 movie "The Desperate Hours" is a pretty good movie. If it has one flaw, it's that it's now kind of dated in one aspect, that being that the bad guys come across as kind of tame by today's standards. I thought that problem would be fixed in this remake, but surprisingly it isn't. For the most part, Mickey Rourke's character and his two partners don't come across as that threatening. In fact, at times they are almost nice and considerate. Needless to say, it's pretty hard to be creeped out by these guys. Another reason why there's little tension also falls on the protagonists. Though they suffer abuse several times during the course of the movie, except maybe for the young boy Zack, they are not very sympathetic. They don't seem to be suffering that much, and they have attributes that kind of sour themselves towards us, like when it's revealed Hopkins' character had an affair.The characters are the main reason why the movie doesn't work. But there are other problems as well. They include an often inappropriate musical score, several sequences where linking footage seems to be missing, and inappropriate flamboyant directorial touches by the man at the movie's helm, Michael Cimino. The one positive thing I can say about the movie is that it's well photographed by Doug Milsome. Though to tell the truth, I think a more gritty look would have been appropriate for a hostage taking story. Anyway, in the end the only thing audiences will get out of the movie is some explanation as to why Michael Cimino's career never really recovered after "Heaven's Gate".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining &amp; Pacy But Lacks The Intensity &amp; Impact Of The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Cimino's remake of William Wyler's "The Desperate Hours" (1955) is given the 1990 treatment by increasing the amounts of violence, nudity and strong language and adding colour and a number of beautifully-shot outdoor sequences. The gang leader's character has been significantly changed and as a reflection of the period in which this movie was made, the husband and wife whose home is invaded, have become estranged because of the husband's infidelity. The action starts off impressively and its lively pace is maintained throughout the entire film.Michael Bosworth (Mickey Rourke) is a convict who escapes from a courthouse with the help of his defence lawyer and lover, Nancy Breyers (Kelly Lynch) who'd smuggled a gun into the building for him. After killing one of the guards whilst making his getaway, Bosworth is picked up by his brother Wally (Elias Koteas) and his friend Albert (David Morse) and together they drive off to a pre-arranged location to switch to a different car which had been left there by Nancy.Nancy's participation in the escape is made to look enforced and Bosworth and his gang decide to hide out in a rich suburban neighbourhood until she can join them. The house they pick is occupied by Nora Cornell (Mimi Rogers) and her two children, 15-year-old May (Shawnee Smith) and 8-year-old Zack (Danny Gerard). Bosworth conducts himself with a combination of politeness and threatening behaviour and when Nora's cheating husband Tim (Anthony Hopkins) calls by to attempt a reconciliation with his wife, he also becomes a hostage.FBI agent Brenda Chandler (Lindsay Crouse) who's in charge of the manhunt, doesn't buy Nancy's story for a minute and has her watched around the clock in the certain belief that she'll eventually lead them to Bosworth. At the Cornell's house, Albert becomes overwhelmed with anxiety and decides to leave but is soon found and killed by the FBI. When Nancy finally decides to co-operate with the FBI so that she can be given a reduced sentence, the authorities are quickly able to close in on Bosworth and bring their mission to its violent conclusion.The most disappointing feature of this movie for anyone who's seen the 1955 version is that the tension, claustrophobia and intensity of threat that the family are under in the original are all so heavily diluted in this version. Bosworth's character is also a problem because, as a man with an exceptionally high I.Q., he never does or says anything that's even remotely intelligent let alone brilliant.Mickey Rourke provides the movie's best performance as he conveys his character's unusual combination of charm and volatility so well and although it is generally entertaining, "Desperate Hours" never achieves the intensity or impact of the 1955 original.</fullReview>

Albert (David Morse) and his brother Wally Bosworth (Elias Koteas) drive the getaway. Brenda Chandler (Lindsay Crouse) releases Nancy to track down Bosworth. Tim (Anthony Hopkins) and Nora Cornell (Mimi Rogers) are splitting up their family with their children (Shawnee Smith, Danny Gerard). He's broken up with his girlfriend and looking to reunite but she insists on selling the house. Michael and his men take over the house and keep the Cornells hostage.

If he could dial some of it back, the movie could be an intense crime thriller. Micky Rourke can be an intense bad guy without any help but Cimino insists on pushing it. Everybody is overacting. The worst is probably Lindsay Crouse. Cimino is using every camera move and dramatic music. It's a little ridiculous to release Nancy but the call to her apartment is a little more ridiculous. The cops could easily be listening on the other end. It's not as if the message is in code. The movie could have been great but Cimino's relentlessness squanders the work of some great actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First major "so bad it's good' movie" of the 90s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reality, DESPERATE HOURS (1990), a remake of the classic Humphrey Bogart-Fredric March film of the 50s, is a BAD movie, but still watchable due to it's badness! It boasts a talented cast of actors (Anthony Hopkins, Mickey Rourke, Lindsay Crouse, Mimi Rogers, David Morse, Kelly Lynch, Elias Koteas), all of whom had either had been in,or were about to be in, acclaimed works.It came out a year before Hopkins would do "Silence of the Lambs (1991)", for which he would take home the Best Actor Oscar, and go on to do several more acclaimed films in the 90s, receiving Oscar noms for most of them. Rogers would star in "The Rapture (1991)", for which she may have robbed a nomination for Best Actress. Lynch had just done "Drugstore Cowboy (1989)", one of that year's most acclaimed films. Crouse was 3 years removed from starring in arguably David Mamet's best film "House of Games (1987)". Morse was on his way to having a very successful career in small roles most notably, "The Green Mile(1999)". Koteas gave a scene-stealing performance a few years earlier in "Some Kind of Wonderful(1987)" and was among the army of cast members in one of the 90s most acclaimed films "The Thin Red Line (1998)". Last but certainly not least, is arguably the most famous (or should I say infamous!) of this eclectic cast, Mickey Rourke, who had just come off a dynamic decade in the 80s with hit and acclaimed movies such as "Body Heat (1980, his film debut)", "Diner" (1982), "9 1/2 weeks (1986)", "Year of the Dragon (1985)", and "Barfly (1987)". And to top it all off, "Desperate Hours" was directed by an Oscar-winning director, Michael Cimino (of "The Deer Hunter" fame). So what went wrong? I think the main problem with "Desperate Hours" is that it takes itself too seriously. There is no character filter or décorum. EVERYTHING is over-the-top, starting with the very loud and abrasive opening courtroom scene that sets the odd tone of the film. The judge yells. The lawyers yell. The accused gets to yell (which makes no sense). The accused in question is dangerous, sociopathic criminal Michael Bosworth (essayed by Rourke), who is about to be sentenced. His hot lawyer and lover (Lynch) helps him escape, then he goes on the run with his younger brother (played by Elias Koteas) and his brother's very big and very slow best friend (Morse).The 3 fugitives seek refuge in an affluent suburban neighborhood in the home of the fractured Cornell family, who are taken hostage by Bosworth and his cronies. The husband-father Tim (Hopkins) is just visiting as he and wife Nora (Rogers, who I actually believe delivers the most convincing performance of the film) are estranged and about to be divorced due to Tim's affair. The Cornells have 2 children, the teen-aged May (played by then-unknown Shawnee Smith, now of "Becker" and "Saw" fame) and Zack (played by Danny Gerard). In hot pursuit of Bosworth is FBI agent Brenda Chandler (Crouse), who end up using the lawyer as bait to help entrap Bosworth.This movie is incredibly awkward yet somehow, I find it immensely enjoyable! Everything is so over-the-top to the point it's hard to look away: the acting, the zooming camera shots, the hyper score. This remake came out in 1990, a year where movies were in transition of moving away from the dated look of 80s movies, but not yet adopting the dated look of the 90s movies. By having it's own unique style and not conforming to either decade, it actually makes the movie look kind of fresh when one watches it over 20 years later, as the focus is more on the beautiful scenery and setting, especially that huge mansion, than anything else.I know that a kidnapping-hostage situation SHOULD BE intense, but the actors' performances seem more like histrionics and hyperventilating acting than natural reactions to events. Characters are overly emotional at even the most minor moments that might call for subtlety. Yet the unintentionally laughable acting adds to this movie's watchability! I know it's wrong to laugh in a movie like this, but it's hard to avoid when the dialog and characters are so odd and weird. As Bosworth, Rourke pontificates with painfully long and confusing monologues. Hopkins basically does this odd-looking squint throughout the movie, I guess because his character is stabbed early on and so he must act as if in pain, but it seems over-the-top (honestly, though, I thought he carried this over-the-topness into "Silence of the Lambs"! LOL). Koteas plays it way too nice to be believable as a bad guy. Crouse sports an incredibly odd accent that I can't tell where she's supposed to be from! I don't know whether Morse is supposed to be stupid or mentally disturbed (maybe both). Smith and the other kid are terrible (but can be forgiven being essentially child actors). Lynch is an emotional mess in EVERY scene she's in. Rogers is the ONLY actor that rise to the occasion with a genuinely believable performance of a mother afraid for her family, yet that makes her out-of-place since everyone else is so off-kilter! And it's really all of this bad acting that makes the movie work. It's simply so BAD that it's actually GOOD! It's a fun ride watching these actors basically out-awful each other. The self-importance of the movie adds to it's awfulness. In particular, watching Rourke go nuts on everyone and needlessly pontificate is a hoot! Unfortunately, this movie signaled the downfall of his career as he literally started making nothing but crap in the 90s and even late into the 00s before a career-resurgence with an Oscar-nominated performance in "The Wrestler" some almost-20 years after this dubious film. Still, I have to say, if you want to be entertained and have a good laugh with a group of friends at a riff-able movie, this is one is definitely a contender!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In his home, Anthony Hopkins fends off Mickey Rourke and his gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Desperate Hours" is two movies. The first one, which runs about 70-85 minutes is quite good, even above average. It's tense and believable. The underlying story is strong. It was strong when first filmed in 1955 and it's still strong. Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins are both excellent in the parts originally played by Humphrey Bogart and Frederic March.At about 68 minutes in, the movie deals with David Morse's character. He's the not too bright heavy, originally played by Robert Middleton. Morse is fine. However, the script and the direction start to fail at this point. They place Morse in a beautiful scenic place where he communes with nature before dying. It doesn't ring true, because nothing has happened before that to build up to this moment for this character. It's incongruous. Dealing with him also takes too long.From 85 minutes onward, especially when the police get into the act, the story-telling really declines. This movie segment is amateurish in all respects and well below par. The policewoman character of Lindsay Crouse is played very badly. Her southern accent is awful. Her lines are awful. Her acting is awful. The police swat teams are ludicrous. The hail of bullets that greets Rourke and Hopkins but hurts no one is ludicrous. The story's climactic moments are handled badly. It is hard to understand how one part of the movie can be done so well and another part so clumsily.The girl friend of Rourke is Kelly Lynch. Her part is too hysterical. Rourke's love for her doesn't ring true either. Hopkins' daughter has no more sense than a lamp post at times. All she does is make wisecracks that provoke Rourke.There are other logical lapses as well. If it were not for the first 70-85 minutes of the film, I'd rate it lower.So, those who like Rourke's and Hopkins's work will not be disappointed. They deliver the goods. David Morse is quite good. I like his work. Mimi Rogers handles her role as Hopkins's wife quite well. As for the rest, some of it is badly written toward the end, badly acted, and surely badly directed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing desperate here. Film-maker Michael Cimino would team up with Mickey Rourke again, after the crime epic "Year of the Dragon" five years earlier. But on this occasion we would see a lacklustre remake of the 1955 feature (which was originally adapted from a novel / stage play) with some nice scope (some beautifully scenic Utah backdrops with agile camera-work), but slightly leaden material and mechanical execution starves it of suspense and believability. Here's a glum siege movie (although its more like tedious house-sitting) that never feels all that threatening despite the best efforts by a smooth talking psycho Mickey Rourke and an neurotically edgy David Morse as some criminals that take a family hostage in their home. It lacks a pulse, tending to be limitedly forced and silly in its unreasonable actions. Where it only gets worse the further it goes along. Rocky relationships are put to the test and trust becomes the key factor for getting through this ordeal - for both sides. Mimi Rogers and Anthony Hopkins add some stalwart class. Kelly Lynch, Elias Koteas and Shawnee Smith are decent enough. Although I couldn't stand Lindsay Crouse's overbearing performance. David Mansfield's high-strung music score felt out of place. Glossy, but uninvolved dramatic thriller."You and I are going to be friends."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many rules in this house....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bosworth is a psychotic criminal who is about to go on trial however, he seduces his lawyer into helping him escape. But as they try to make their getaway, she's left behind. He decides to wait for her to come to him, so he decides to hide at the house of the Cornells. Now it appears that the Cornells have problems of their own. The husband and wife are separated. And there's an FBI agent after them who is using the lawyer to lead them to Bosworth....If this film were made today, it would have twice the budget and probably be more of a major release, even with the two leads intact.But twenty years ago, Rourke was a falling star, and it was a whole year before a country other than England thought Hopkins was a huge star.And not just that, the film is pretty mundane after a very exciting opening. Once we begin the second act with the house under siege, and the two alpha males at logger heads, it falls flat.Maybe it's the fact that there is no urgency at all in the film, or maybe it's to do with the fact that this has the worse editing I have ever seen in a major motion picture. It's so bad that a character doesn't even get to finish a sentence before we move to the next scene.And then the final fifteen minutes just throws all plausibility out of the window. I was expecting at least a fight from Rourke when he found out the gun was empty, but no, he lets Hopkins, someone older and smaller than him who is injured, drag him out of the house while he is sobbing.It ruins the film, and everything else about it.So all in all, the first fifteen minutes are great, and then it all goes downhill from there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very entertaining movie that delivers the goods from start to finish, and unlike other hostage movies, gives us some outdoor scenes, most notably a car (and plane) chase. It gives the film sone freshness. This is the first Mickey Rourke movie I've seen, and he makes an effective criminal. Also, the film does something with the cops (in the police car) I've never seen before: A 180 degree turn. And the finale is so over-the- top, it almost boggles the mind. It's a finale unlike anything I've ever seen. Lindsey Crouse, who plays one of the cops, goes over the top with her performance, that I couldn't tell if she was a mean cop, or one that took her job way too seriously.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great actors perform badly in a messy script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hostage dramas are getting really passé, but this one should remain on the bottom shelf in the video store gathering dust. Unbelievable characters in impossible settings create a third-grade movie. When desperate criminals hold a family hostage in their own home (yawn) there is at least the opportunity for some good characterization. Instead, this film wanders in too many directions, has to many points of conflict and loses the viewer. The big question is how did such a good cast get caught up in this? Not one performance stood out as worthy of comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Flint notes below, a waste. Some good scenes, but otherwise a messy, pointless affair with very little structure from what (on paper) is normally a pretty good cast. I'd love to know where the hell Lindsay Crouse got her accent. Skip this and see the Bogart/March original.A "3" out of "10".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had a lot of problems, such as not having Humphrey Bogart playing the lead. It had a few positives. Anthony Hopkins does every role well. Mickey Rourke carries that air of quiet menace as well as anyone. Mimi Rogers is as good as her part lets her be. But now the negatives. Lindsay Crouse pushes her tough-girl act way too far. Not believable. I hate to criticize Kelly Lynch. She is usually so good. But I just couldn't buy what she was selling in this role. I'm not sure why, but she detracted from the film. Well, except for her looks. She is great scenery anytime, but she usually comes across as a far better actress than she did here. The direction seemed lacking. I hated that little touch where David Morse was whistling "Red River Valley". Didn't work. Nice photography of Utah scenery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1/10Another idiot movie from Hollywood. Actor/actress are bads, image is bad, music is bad and more the story is idiot.This movie show that even if they are potentially good actor they can act bad when they are not directed correctly. And if also the story is stupid well we can't hope to watch something good.But at least I find something funny in this movie. To watch Kelly Lynch walk with high heels. Man she walk like me with that. :)Also to watch Mickey Rourke to play. In this movie he is not a "Martian" (like Michael Jackson) again! :)If you feel desesperate don't rent/buy this "movie".

		<shortDescription>Very brave daughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was humorous to watch the daughter come home to find her family being held hostage and then call the armed psychopaths "retards". I know different people act differently under the same circumstances, but I don't think anyone in that situation would act quite like that. Also, how would Lynch's character not notice the plane that keeps following her. I think if Rourke's character was that intelligent, he wouldn't have had the moron get rid of the body.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie did it better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>why do film makers have a desire to recreate the perfect movie with an inferior version? They did it with the Thomas Crown Affair (how can you even compare Brosnan to McQueen)and even the recent Oceans Eleven made us realize how much we miss the original Rat Pack. In this dismal remake we have the unfortunately untalented Mickey Rourke destroying the role made famous by Bogart. The nicest thing one can say about this movie is that it has nice color. One day film makers may understand that it might be o.k. to remake a classic but may like to call the movie by another name so the film going public will not compare the remake to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this movie set the career of Mickey Rouke back ten years. If I had shelled out $10 to see this desperately horrendous flick I would have demanded a refund on my way out. I literally had a stomach ache after desperately enduring this one. The point that really drove it home for me was the bravado "a false showing of bravery" at the end of this flick on the face of both Anthony Hopkins and that detective lady this movie has left a ill feeling in me that will no doubt last for day's to come. I suggest you stop buy the pharmacy and pick up a bottle of Maalox on your way back from Blockbuster with this one. Better yet skip the movie and just buy the Maalox........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action Movie that Delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Cimino sunk a studio with his turkey "Heaven's Gate", but he is still a masterful director of action movies when he's in top form (witness Deerhunter, Year of The Dragon and now, Desperate Hours). The famous synergy between Cimino and Rourke is in plentiful supply in this brilliant remake of the Bogart/March original. There isn't a wasted frame and everyone -- with the notable exception of Lindsay Crouse -- is perfectly cast. Cimino adds all the right touches in his update to the 50's original: Lynch's ice-queen trial lawyer, Hopkins-Rogers' marriage on the rocks, Smith's rebellious teen, Koteas' emotionally stunted younger brother. Don't pass this one up because of a handful of naysayers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrated at a wasted opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wasted effort. A story with real possibilities, and probably the perfect actor to portray the psychopathic lead in Mickey Rourke. He was probably the only thing that was able to keep this thing from completely sinking.Anthony Hopkins was simply the wrong choice for the role of the husband here. It's really hard to understand this; he simply didn't belong in the role. He may be one of the finest actors in the world, but that doesn't mean he is the right choice for any character. He was simply out of place. This was probably the biggest distraction, in a movie pretty much full of them. I can't even begin on Lindsay Crouse's FBI agent character. This has to be one of the most bizarre acting jobs in memory, and her accent is from a solar system we haven't visited yet. Shawnee Smith's leering, sneering teenager was laughably naive and idiotic.Was ANYBODY directing this?Some of the dialogue was bad, some of the acting was bad, and the pacing, atmospherics and camera cuts were choppy and jarring, and poorly thought out. There was, obviously, a real opportunity to make a very good suburban horror story, and this was completely scuttled by lazy, slap-dash film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Sin City starring Mickey Rourke, I decided to set out and see all of Mickey Rourke's films. I heard from people that most of his films are terrible, but this one was pretty good. I bought it from the bargain bin, so I wasn't expecting much, but it was okay for 6 bucks. It tells the story of 3 escaped convicts lead by Michael Bosworth (Rourke). They take a woman, her family, and her estranged husband (Anthony Hopkins) hostage in their house. A game of cat and mouse between the two men ensues.I have never seen the original with Humphrey Bogart, but this movie is alright. I really enjoyed the plot, and even though Mickey Rourke isn't the greatest actor around, he's certainly a compelling villain. Anthony Hopkins is pretty good as the husband desperate to save his family, but he's not at his best. I think the biggest mistake anyone can make about this movie is to assume that it's a serious attempt at a thriller. In reality, I think this movie is a fun popcorn movie.Like any cheap action thriller from the early 90's, there's a lot of flaws. Two of the flaws are in the acting. The one playing Bosworth's lawyer/girlfriend is probably one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. Her character is pointless as well. The other terrible acting job was the cop in charge of taking Bosworth down. That actress must've come straight off a soap opera. A really bad and noticeable flaw in the movie was the shoddy editing. The film cuts to a new scene before the previous scene even has a chance to end.Overall, the movie is pretty enjoyable. It was worth a 6 dollar buy.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man oh man what a piece of trash this is!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this claptrap a rating of one lowly star because INDB will not allow any score lower. Mickey Rourke in the Bogart role is laughable and deplorable all at once. Bogie is the greatest actor of all time and Rourke is kinda retired now isn't he! And Anthony Hopkins in the Fredrick March role could be the second biggest joke of the century. The above Bogie/Rourke casting would be the first. They could have remade this movie by digging up Bogart's and March's bones and propping them up and they would have done a better acting job that Rourke/Hopkins. As Hollywood has no fresh ideas in the can, they try (ha, ha, ha) to remake the classics. Oh by the way for the record my real rating of this film is burn all copies. Now I have to go another classic scene is starting, the great car chase in Bullitt!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tight thriller, sick of cimino hatred though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sick of all these elitist film school jerkazoids posing and preening for whatever opinion comes out of their professors next. This film is NOT the bogart picture - it's a tight little picture about a psychopath taking a family hostage amidst a brazen plan to break out of jail and hook up with his lover. That's IT. Hopkins, Morse, Koteas, Rogers all provide EXCELLENT support, but this is a Rourke show and Cimino's cinematography never fails to let us know it. Rourke is seductive, cool and violent. And speaking of Cimino's cinematography, it's quite beautiful in this film. Grab a widescreen print, turn the lights out, and enjoy.</fullReview>
