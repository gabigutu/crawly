		<shortDescription>Absorbing Mid-Fifties Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the last of the great film noirs came in 1955 in the shape of THE DESPERATE HOURS. Although it was filmed in Paramount's own widescreen process of Vista Vision it at once established itself and maintained its arresting noir look through its stylish use of black and white cinematography - courtesy of the great Lee Garmes - and masterful direction of William Wyler. Adapted by Joseph Hayes from his novel and play the picture also boasts a terrific cast headed by Humphrey Bogart, Fredric March and Arthur Kennedy. With a nod to his Duke Mantee in "The Petrified Forest" (1936) Bogart, in his next to last film, is superb in the kind of role he knew so well, that of the hard boiled criminal.Three escaped and armed convicts, led by notorious Glenn Griffin (Bogart), take over a house in middle class suburbia and hold the Hilliard family at gunpoint until the mail arrives the following day containing their getaway money. In the meantime the terrorized family must carry on with their everyday routine without arousing anyone's suspicions. With the police hotly on the gang's trail and closing in - the family little by little - begin to make attempts to outwit their unwelcome guests, gain the upper hand and thwart their plans. After two of the convicts are shot dead by the police the picture ends in a stunning sequence with the husband (March) confronting and fooling Griffin with an empty gun before the police marksmen, under huge arc lights, gun him down in a hail of gunfire in Hilliard's own front lawn.Thanks to Wyler's adroit direction, his genius for camera angles and set-ups, brilliant crisp cinematography and great performances THE DESPERATE HOURS is more than a neat little thriller. Suspense is maintained throughout at a very high level. Wyler's film proceeds with commendable energy and intensity. Mesmerizing is Bogart as the unshaven dishevelled sneering and dangerous leader of the three fugitives. His Glenn Griffin is one of his great and most underrated performances and should have at least earned him a nomination. Excellent too is the wonderful Fredric March as the beleaguered husband and father Dan Hilliard (Spencer Tracy was originally slated to play this part but neither he nor Bogart would accept second billing). Also good is Martha Scott (Judah Ben Hur's mother in Wyler's 1959 epic) as the wife and mother, the likable and ill-fated Gig Young as the boyfriend of Hilliard's daughter (played by pretty Mary Murphy). And there's an extraordinary performance from the rotund Robert Middleton as Kobish the violent, unscrupulous and giggling puerile convict.One disappointing aspect of the picture though is the sparse music score by composer Gail Kubik! There is an impressive raw pounding theme over the titles but no more music is heard then until towards the end of the picture. Kubik, a noted conductor, violinist and teacher was more akin to scoring shorts and documentaries and had scored only one other feature "C-Man" in 1949. It is quite extraordinary that Wyler didn't use a more established movie composer. He had always made great use of music in his films i.e. Max Steiner for "Jezebel" (1938), Alfred Newman for "Wuthering Heights" (1939), Hugo Friedhofer for "Best Years Of Our Lives" (1946) and of course later with Jerome Moross for "The Big Country" (1958) and Miklos Rozsa for "Ben Hur" (1959). THE DESPERATE HOURS must be Wyler's shortest and least involving score. However the minimalist score not withstanding his DESPERATE HOURS remains a stunning evocation of the best that ever there was in crime movies. Taking the picture's main premise Michael Comino remade the movie in 1990. It was a valiant effort spoiled by the excessive and over stylized performance by the irritating Mickey Rourke in the Bogart role - diminishing the fine portrayals of Anthony Hopkins as the husband and the excellent characterization by David Morse in the Kobish role. Ultimately though the picture, lacking the required tension and atmosphere, was little more than a pale imitation of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tightly-wound thriller, based on true events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DESPERATE HOURS Aspect ratio: 1.85:1 (VistaVision)Sound format: Mono(Black and white)The patriarch of a middle-class suburban family (Fredric March) is forced to take action when they're held hostage in their own home by three escaped convicts, one of whom (Humphrey Bogart) is an experienced lifer with nothing to lose...The first and only pairing of superstars Bogart and March is a tightly-wound thriller, written by Joseph Hayes (based on his novel and stageplay, inspired by actual events), and directed by Hollywood veteran William Wyler, distancing himself from the 'women's pictures' he had helped to popularize during the 1940's (THE LITTLE FOXES, MRS. MINIVER, THE HEIRESS etc.). Photographed in gleaming deep-focus VistaVision by Lee Garmes (SCARFACE, THE PARADINE CASE), the movie wrings incredible tension from the claustrophobic settings and frequent stand-offs between staunch family man March and embittered con Bogart. The movie's themes are fairly conservative and the outcome is never really in doubt, but this is a top-drawer thriller from Hollywood's 'golden age'. Also starring Arthur Kennedy, Martha Scott, Dewey Martin and Gig Young in crucial supporting roles. Unmissable.NB. Though nowhere near as dreadful as most critics would have you believe, Michael Cimino's remake DESPERATE HOURS (1990) isn't a patch on the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie's No Rourke and Yes That's a Good Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of loopy comments out there about this one. "Predictable" is a very over-used adjective that I've certainly been guilty of myself, but what exactly is supposed to happen in a hostage-taking, domestic thriller like this? Are aliens supposed to land in the Hilliards' back yard and vaporize everyone? Is Bogart's escaped con supposed to dress up in drag at some point and decide he wants to become a chorus girl? Would that satisfy those who find this movie predictable?"The Desperate Hours" keeps you on the edge of your seat; it more than passes the test as a thriller and it most certainly has not mellowed over time. The script is fine, intelligently examining how the respectably middle class but somewhat complacent father (Frederic March) draws strength and courage from the love of his wife and kids in handling the ordeal. Though each family member is formulating their own strategy for how best to resolve the crisis (their brains are always going "clickity-clickity-click" as Bogart mockingly keeps reminding them) they recognize March as the father and as such the captain of the ship. They look to him for leadership and he responds. It's telling that when the young son disobediently puts his ill-conceived plan into action, it undermines the father's nearly successful tactic. Though he had earlier suspected his dad of being cowardly for not taking a more aggressive stance, from this point on he begins to appreciate all the variables he must take into account and looks up to him once more. The idealized, but by no means wildly unrealistic domestic situation reflects the mood of the time. Why on earth would it possibly reflect cynically 90's attitudes and sensibilities, as some reviewers seem to desire?There are casting decisions pertaining to age differences which raise an eyebrow, but do not seriously detract from William Wyler's (as masterful and dependable a director as Hollywood has ever cranked out) otherwise polished production. At 42 of course, Gig Young seems a tad old for the family's 19 year old daughter (beautiful Mary Murphy) but he's still youthful enough looking and he puts an interesting spin on what is usually the thankless role of the boyfriend who stumbles into things. One of the beauties of B&amp;W photography is that it can always be used to make actors look as many as 5-15 years younger than they are. This comes into play with Bogart's character as well, as he's asked to be the older brother of 32 year old Dewey Martin, and it's something that I didn't have too hard a time buying. It's difficult to believe this was one of his last films, as he seems quite vigorous and robust in the part.Tense, exciting, well-acted and directed; this is indisputably far superior to Michael Cimino's bloody and botched 1990 Mickey Rourke "star" vehicle remake. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A finely honed narrative with exquisite twists that are all too believable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogie had done films like this one before: The Petrified Forest (1936), High Sierra (1941), Key Largo (1948) and We're No Angels (1955) ? all with Bogie as a gangster or victim of a gangster, in a desperate setting (although the last one is a comedic spoof). Desperate Hours, however, is different ? this time out, Bogie (as Glen Griffin) has a whole suburban family as hostage as he tries to complete his run for freedom from the law. Is this the first such home invasion type movie? Perhaps Suddenly (1954)?The story is simply superb. Every good narrative succeeds because of certain literary aspects: a believable story line, down-to-earth dialog that supports it, a good measure of irony at appropriate turning points, just the right amount of coincidence that can intrude on anybody's daily experience, a dogged police officer who just won't give up in the search for what he believes, and a family ? an ordinary family ? that finds within itself the courage, imagination, and strength to persevere in the face of the real threat of death.I saw this film long ago when just a lad, so I didn't recall much of the story at all. But, being a Bogie fan, I looked forward to seeing it again when I got a hold of a DVD recently. I don't recall what movies were in the running for the Oscars that year, but I think this should have been a contender (apparently, it wasn't).The cast was well chosen. Bogie, of course, was "made" for this part, having done so many like it in the past ? and that's not a side-swipe at typecasting; Robert Middleton almost steals the movie with his portrayal of the psychopathic Kobish -- a chilling portrayal; Dewey Martin as Bogie's brother, Hal, provides a sense of decency that the other two lack, the only jarring note for me: why should he? He's on the run, and drops all pretense of humanity when he decides to cut and run by himself. And, we know what happens to anybody who cuts and runs, right? Frederic March as Dan Hilliard ably shows what can happen to your principles and behavior when lives are at stake: most of life's niceties go out the window as he tries to save his family. Understandable, given the desperate situation. Martha Scott as his wife and Mary Murphy as his daughter (Cindy) are suitably frightened most of the time, but they also summon the courage to oppose the bad guys when possible. The guy who isn't used so much is Arthur Kennedy as deputy sheriff Bard, but his role is pivotal in bringing the story to a satisfactory ending. Pity, because Kennedy was as fine an actor as Bogie or March. Gig Young, as Cindy's suitor, rounds out the main cast ? he playing the puzzled hopeful who just won't go away when Cindy pleads with him to "stay away". It's just as well that he didn't...The setting in small town America is just right, the picture perfect home of the Hilliards standing for the American dream that is about to threatened and even destroyed. Which gives rise to one of the best lines in cinema history, spoken by March near the end: "Get out ? get out of my house!" he nearly screams at Bogie, thus cementing forever in film the idea of a man's home as his castle. Bogie visibly wilts before the stern and righteous wrath of March ? but not only because of that does Bogie give it all up. You'll have to see the film to understand why.Most of the action is within the confines of the Hilliard house (having been a stage play first, that makes sense) and the cinematography takes full advantage of all those nooks and crannies to enthrall the viewer and keep the suspense running. I liked particularly the reasonably long take of the camera behind the bad guys while they watch the old trash collector do his work and who seems to miss the presence of their stolen car in the garage. It's a priceless piece of work as the escapees faces keep looking at each other and then at the old man ? and the viewer stays on edge, all the time, wondering: will he react?The final showdown is simply a tour de force. It's fast and furious, ranging all through the ground floor, up the stairs and into the bedrooms, and then back again, as the protagonists fight it out for supremacy; I was reminded of Dustin Hoffman's running fight with the bad guys in Straw Dogs (1971). In the hands of an inept director, it would have been farcical but Wyler turns on the suspense and the irony as March overcomes his adversary ? Bogie ? in one of the coolest ways imaginable. No, I won't tell you, because that would spoil it for you.As the credits rolled by at the end, my immediate thought was that this type of story is so believable, it could happen to me, or you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original THE DESPERATE HOURS is one of the best true suspense films that were ever made. The incident happened in upstate New York in 1953, when three escaped convicts invaded a private home, and then terrorized the family until they were captured and killed by the police. In fact, the story became a successful Broadway play that this film is based on (the family in the original incident brought an unsuccessful lawsuit against the dramatist for invasion of privacy).Humphrey Bogart, his brother Dewey Martin, and that marvelous villain Robert Middleton play the three convicts, who having escaped prison take the Hilliard prisoners. Bogart is awaiting his girlfriend who is supposed to bring money and a car for their total getaway. In the meantime Bogart is doing his best to make the Hilliards as unhappy as possible. Not too difficult, as Martha Scott, Mary Murphy, and Richard Eyer are facing three thugs who are armed. And Fredric March is the family head, frightened at the most hideous prospect possible (his family being wiped out), but struggling to maintain his courage but also his head - he hates Bogart but must not do anything that will antagonize him. Bogart fully returns the dislike. A poor guy all his life, he turned to crime to make a living. When the younger and softer Martin tries to speak out for March/Hilliard, Bogart snarls out, "And what did the Hilliards ever do for you?" In truth not much, which is what this particular Hilliard is paying for now. After awhile, watching March's careful thinking of what to do, Bogart starts taunting him as though he's a machine he sees through - saying the line in the "Subject line" above.There are several problems that gradually increase the tensions: 1) Richard Eyer is brave as a little kid who does not understand that guns can kill. He thinks his father is the bravest man in the world, and cannot understand why he doesn't take on and destroy the bad guys.2) The family has to maintain the aura of normality - Bogart and Murphy have to go out to their jobs and act without stirring any notice. Hard in normal situations, it is driving Murphy to insanity because she can't talk to her boyfriend, Gig Young. And Young is beginning to wonder why.3) If the surface is to look normal, you have to keep anything unusual hidden. The original getaway car is in the Hilliard garage (now closed). But the local garbage man (Walter Baldwin) finds it accidentally - leading to an ugly tragedy.4) Bogart and Martin are brothers, but Martin is attracted to a normal life, not one of violence. He may eventually want not to stick to Bogart.5) Middleton came along, but he really is not trusted by Bogart - and he has a weapon of his own.6) Bogart's plans include killing the officer who sent him to prison, Arthur Kennedy. Kennedy and the state police are coordinating the entire search, and keeping a tight lid on top of the escaped prisoners (making their temporary safety more claustrophobic).All of these elements build the pressure up and up and up until the last twenty minutes. The results are quite explosive and impressive, and memorable. This was Bogart's last film as a bad guy, and he made the most of it. It was also his only film with Fredric March, and the tension in their scenes together grows until it shatters at the conclusion. Martha Scott, Gig Young (whose character's independent actions throws the convicts' plans out of wack), Middleton (quite chilling), and Kennedy give first rate performances. Martin's performance is also good, and ultimately tragic. No lover of suspense films will be disappointed by THE DESPERATE HOURS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogey's return to the Thirties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart got his first real notice on the silver screen in The Petrified Forest, repeating a role he did on Broadway. As Duke Mantee, criminal on the run, he held the occupants of a diner hostage for several hours.Here in The Desperate Hours, Bogey takes over a role that Paul Newman originated on Broadway. Bogart, Dewey Martin and Robert Middleton play three escaped convicts who drive to Indianapolis because Bogart wants to kill the officer that arrested him. Dewey Martin is Bogart's younger brother and Robert Middleton is their brutal partner in the escape.Given the age difference between Bogart and Paul Newman, I'm sure the role of Glenn Griffin was played quite differently by Newman on stage. Similarly Karl Malden played Dan Hilliard on stage and Fredric March plays him for the screen. March is no hero here, he's just an ordinary family man trapped with his family in a terrible situation.Rounding out the Hilliard family is wife Martha Scott, daughter Mary Murphy and son Richard Eyer. Martha Scott had appeared with March before as his wife in One Foot in Heaven. She does well here also, but I do wonder where the real Mrs. March was, Florence Eldridge. It seems like a good joint project for both of them.The Desperate Hours is a good suspenseful thriller that will keep you glued to your seat. These are real people here, not some Hollywood type situation comedy family. You will care about what the eventual outcome will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>home invasion 1955 style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The randomness of the home invasion portrayed in THE DESPERATE HOURS must have been a chilling experience for cinema goers in the mid fifties. This is a solid movie that unfolds well with each roll of the arbitrary dice. Bogart acquits himself nicely as the head heavy although he looks weary and shows signs of the illness that killed him a couple of years later. Fredric March is a shade too long in the tooth to be the father of that obnoxious little boy but he gives a sterling portrayal of a man protecting his home. Always amusing are the jurisdictional disputes that arise amongst competing police agencies. Stay away from the Mickey Rourke clone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another feather in the incomparable Bogart's cap. Terrific tension is generated in the hostage taking and the need to cover it up (I know it's wrong but I wanted the Griffin boys to succeed). The supporting cast is perfect in depicting a typical American family of the period. Kobish, the dimwitted but violent felon, was a great character and Dewey Martin, as the younger Griffin (he was also in another Bogart film, Knock on Any Door), probably had the most poignant line in the whole movie when he responds to his older brother, who said he "taught him everything," by replying "except how to live in a house like this." One thing I can't remember is whether or not we see Griffin's girlfriend onscreen at all. Well anyway, terrific movie, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film from William Wyler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frederic March, Martha Scott, Humphrey Bogart and Arthur Kennedy are just a few of the people who endure "The Desperate Hours," a 1955 film, based on the stage play and directed by William Wyler. On Broadway, the play was directed by Robert Montgomery and starred Karl Malden in the Bogart role and Paul Newman played his brother, here played by Dewey Martin. The film also stars Gig Young, Mary Murphy, Richard Eyer, and Robert Middleton.Having just seen Bogart in the 1936 "The Petrified Forest," it was interesting to see him still taking hostages 19 years later - and in fact, looking like he'd spent the last 19 years on the run from the law. He was clearly ill during the making of this film. Though Dewey Martin looked 30 years younger than Bogie, he was in fact only 20, making the fact that they were brothers a tiny bit more plausible.I also had recently seen "The Star Witness," a 1931 Warner Brothers film with a similar plot, which won an Oscar for best original screenplay. By 1955, it wasn't original any longer, but the execution of the story is compelling. Martha Scott is a housewife, Ellie Hilliard, alone in her suburban home when three escaped criminals (Bogart, Martin and Middleton) take over the place. Glenn Griffin (Bogart) wants to murder the Deputy Sheriff (Arthur Kennedy) who put him in prison, and he needs to wait for the delivery of some money to make good his escape. Dan Hilliard (March) and his daughter Cynthia (Murphy) walk into the situation, followed later by the Hilliard's little boy (Eyer). You'll be wondering why the son isn't knocked off - by his parents - given the trouble he causes.The money is delayed, and of course, the police have no idea where the gang is, as Griffin has put his car in the Hilliard garage. So the hours turn into overnight. Although March and Cynthia are allowed to leave the house for work, and Cynthia has to keep a date with her boyfriend (Young), they're too terrified to say anything for fear the mother and boy will be killed. Basically the gang as well and the family become prisoners as the hours drag on.Wyler gives us lots of frightening and suspenseful moments as the tension builds in the house, and he never lets the pace drag. Supposedly he made March and Scott do a goodbye scene for take after take because he thought March was "acting" and wanted to tire him out. An accomplished stage actor of the old school, March consistently had a great presence but didn't always emotionally connect with his characters - he does here. March and Bogart make powerful adversaries, March hitting just the right note as an angry father afraid for his family, but not afraid to talk back to Griffin. Bogart's Griffin is shrewd and admires brains and bravery in others; the family impresses him with their guts.Bogart is marvelous in the role - though tired out, his character is determined to keep the gang together and free; he's resentful of the middle classness of the family and how out of place he and his gang are in a nice home. Unlike his Duke Mantee in "The Petrified Forest", Bogart's Griffin doesn't seem to have a sense of the hopelessness of his situation until the very end; also unlike Duke Mantee, he has a vulnerability that he demonstrates at the end.Robert Middleton gives a scary performance as a witless member of the gang, and Martin, as Hal, displays Hal's disillusionment with the situation, his attraction to Cynthia, and the realization that he can never have someone like her if he continues down his brother's road. Gig Young is somewhat wasted as Cythia's boyfriend - it's unnecessary star casting. Martha Scott does a terrific job as the harried wife and mother. The wonderful Arthur Kennedy gives another good performance as the sheriff determined to catch Griffin.Highly recommended for its suspenseful story, fine direction, and top performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut and exciting crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noticed one reviewer say "Bogey does it again". While I would agree that Bogart did a great job in the picture, I really feel the outstanding role was actually played by Frederick March. Bogey was menacing and that's certainly nothing new. But March, playing a sort of "every man" role who unexpectedly rises to the occasion in the end really stood out for me. It was a sort of metaphor for the capacity within us all to stand up to injustice and look for our own inner strength.The plot is VERY simple. An evil gang takes a family hostage while hiding from the police. However, what makes the film stand out is the exquisite writing and acting that follows. This film really gives you a lot from such a simple plot.Be sure to watch the ending--it really delivers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay,okay. Couldn't resist that "Leave It To Beaver"joke!Joking aside now,my local library recently put this into it's collection and I watched it last night (7/30/06) and I have nothing but the utmost praise for this movie! I also have one question....why in my entire 38 year life have I never seen this on TV? No question that Bogart's best films of the 30's &amp; 40's are classics (as well as 1950's,"African Queen".) I cannot fathom just how it is this has gone under the radar for so long. Being that its from late in his career (his 2nd to last film),I was expecting a dud,again,since I'd never heard of it.Some folks can easily joke that since the exterior is the Cleaver house,the film is then unintentionally funny. Amazingly,it was this very aspect that made it all the more engrossing! I actually think it is an unintentionally brilliant idea! What this does for the film is demonstrate that,while in some ways the '50s were the "innocent" era,it also shows that like in any time in history,things are not "perfect". There was crime then as there's crime now. There's just (unfortunatley) more excuses for it today. It really was like watching on of those squeaky clean B &amp; W TV families get shaken up! Again,that really made it more exciting.Why? Because,instead of just letting these thugs hold complete sway over their home,they fight back and scheme,even though it could mean the worst! It really dis-spells what TV shows back then were saying about the American family. I've only seen Fredric March in one other film;"The Best Years Of Our Lives". Which he was also good in but here,he's one of the few actors that gets to defeat Bograt,when he's playing a bad guy. I knew Bogart and his motley crew would be defeated in the end but the exciting part was sitting through to see how this otherwise gentle but strong family would emerge unharmed (except for Bogart hitting March over the head.)I don't see how anyone can say Bogart and March's acting was less than great. Humphrey Bogat does what he does best when he's the villain and March is just electric in his role! (..and you rarely hear "that" about an actor from the old days. Each actor in this film,however big or small their role,does their fair share as well. Someone called this a '50s time capsule. Well,that's what some folks make time capsules for....to be opened and revisit another era. In the case of,"The Desperate Hours",I not only think it's worthy in that way,I think it's original print should grace the Library of Congress!(..and no,I do not exaggerate.) That's just my brain at work...clickety-click! (END)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Badges Of Madison County</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dan Hilliard and his family are perfect Americans, corresponding admirably to the bourgeois ideal. The two children are bright, good-looking and obedient. Cindy is about 20 and is going steady with an attorney who owns a sports car. Ralphy is eight or so, all plaid shirts, jeans and attitude. He has a baseball mitt and a bicycle. Ellie, Dan's wife, runs their spotless home with quiet efficiency. Everything is in its place. Trash collectors call at fixed times. Breakfast is a serene family ritual. The Hilliards' home life is as balanced, as regular and as dull as the barometer on the wall. As for Dan Hillier himself, he has attained that mythic status to which all 1950's bourgeois males aspired - he is an executive. The middle classes don't want adventure in their lives, they want predictability. And this is the perfect, dream-like state in which the Hilliards pass their anodyne existence, secure in their suburban womb - until the American Nightmare is unleashed upon them.  What if members of The Underclass, with their dirty, unshaven physicality and their sagging, torn clothes should irrupt into the suburbs? What if, by some catastrophic failure, the police and the prison service can't keep The Underclass in its designated containers? How will nice folks like the Hilliards cope if confronted by these alien beings?  There has been a jailbreak. The citizens of Indianapolis have been warned to watch out for three desperadoes - the two Griffin brothers and their accomplice Kobish. Little do the Hilliards realise as they go about their tranquil suburban lives, but the fugitives are about to choose the Hilliard home as a place to hole up ...  Like "Suddenly", made a year earlier, this is a 'bad guys invaded my home' movie. The downside of bourgeois affluence is the fear that the disenfranchised masses will come to take away your goodies.  Humphrey Bogart was in his late 50's and clearly ailing when he played the part of Glenn Griffin, the leader of the fugitive trio. He would make only two more films in the short time that was left to him. Dewey Martin, 26 years his junior, plays his kid brother Hal.  More than anything, "The Desperate Hours" is a film about social class. "You can't play ball with savages like that," opines a Madison County detective. Glenn holds his social superiors in equal contempt, calling them "smart-eyed respectable suckers". He warns Hal not to expect any favours from the class enemy: "Guys like Hilliard ever give you a fair shake?" Much play is made of linguistic markers which separate the educated from the rest ('whom' instead of 'who'), and contrasts in table manners between the refined Hilliards and their thuggish captors. Glenn lashes out against the tea tray, that emblem of middle-class gentility, and the virginal Cindy, whom he urges Hal to 'take'.  Dire though the Hilliards' predicament may be, they are not alone. They are exactly the kind of people the forces of law and order exist to protect and serve, and it is not long before Madison County's finest and the FBI are closing in on the fugitives. And the cops have science on their side. They can tap the phone of Glenn's girlfriend in Pittsburgh, and tail her across America as she heads for the rendezvous. In the police station, the humming wires never rest as technology narrows down the bad guys' options.  Middle-class sensibility is all-pervasive. Chuck and Cindy argue near the sports car, but break off abruptly when two people pass by. No matter how deeply the emotions may run, it isn't seemly to fight in front of the neighbours. Dan's secretary can tell, from nuances of his behaviour, that something is very wrong. Similarly, the trashman senses that things are amiss with Ellie by the quality of her chat. We see Cindy admiring her curves in front of the hallway mirror, because it is important that she be sexually desirable (so that the fugitives will regard her as a chattle). Chuck, however, has to remain sexually thwarted, because his behaviour is bound by rigid bourgeois restrictions. We see him raise the arm-rest in his sports car in the hope of a grappling session with Cindy, then lowering it dejectedly when he realises that his luck is out. Dan's wave to Chuck to cross the threshold is a symbolic acceptance of him as a son-in-law. He has made it into The Family.  Light represents goodness. Cindy comes home after another chaste date with Chuck and is bathed in bright light on the doorstep. Dan and Ellie declare their love for each other, their bodies lit intensely in an otherwise black bedroom. The searchlights of the police, and the bad guys' vain attempts to eradicate them, show us figuratively what we yearn to see - that good will always triumph over social disruption.  The overpowering of Ellie, the smashing of Ralphy's toy plane and the collapse of Cindy all happen on the same spot and are all filmed from the same low angle. These dramatic incidents show the Hilliards at bay, and the unusual vantage-point stresses the 'wrongness' of what is happening. Implausibilities abound throughout the movie. How likely is it that the front door would be left unlocked, that Chuck would reach the house ahead of the cops, or that Dan would insist on carrying a gun, then empty its clip? Why would he hesitate to call the police in, once he got the upper hand? Why would everyone leave the family unattended, moments after the conclusion of a violent and dramatic siege?  And yet it works. Glenn's love of his brother breaks through his tough-guy facade, and after he gives his guns away he undergoes a tragic 'King Lear' moment of self-realisation. These are powerful moments in a powerful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological thriller par excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novel begins "Out of the fog they came..". Indeed. I remember this movie as being just a terrifically suspenseful ride, from the opening POV shot canvassing the neighborhood for a suitable hideout to the final clash between the two family "heads" over the son's fear and trust. As with any good psychological tale there is a lot here for everyone. What struck me particularly was the mirroring of the two families - one normal with all the right balances (male-female especially) and one totally perverse. One can view the Bogart-March pair as the family patriarchs and the Kobish-Ralphie pair as their respective sons. In fact, Kobish is basically a future Ralphie, should his rebelliousness remain unchecked (read whatever Oedipal theme you wish here). Thus it is entirely consistent that the climactic struggle center around the two patriarchs' power over the son Ralphie. And that at the very center of the struggle should be a gun, well, it doesn't get more Freudian, does it? Plus all sorts of neat tensions and characters. How about the FBI/police as the Superego, trying to resolve the Id(Bogart)-Ego(March) clash it sees from afar? Like I said, there is something here for everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb film regarding Fred March, Martha Scott as a married couple who are held hostage by Humphrey Bogart and his motley crew along with the couple's children.The tension is so thick and is beautifully realized by director William Wyler.This is a story of inner-strength held by March and yet how his acts to protect his family could be seen as cowardice by his young son.Both March and Bogart are at the top of their game performance wise in this excellent film.The film is aided by a wonderful supporting cast including Arthur Kennedy as a detective, Dewey Martin as Bogart's younger brother and several others. Gig Young plays the suitor to March's daughter. He feels that March doesn't like him and of course this is added on by the hostage situation.We see how detrimental being held hostage can be by what it does to the normally mild-mannered March. Just view his hostile actions towards his secretary. (Helen Kleeb)While we may know how the film will turn out, we can still applaud and wait with great anticipation for its wonderful climax. This was Hollywood at its best in film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think Bogart would amaze me more than he did as Mad Dog Earle in High Sierra; well, he has almost done it, if that's possible. The story allows him -- and us -- to come back to the days of The Petrified Forest, and, what is even better, Bogie is in top form and all up to the task. Hours was his penultimate film, but Glenn Griffin is as tough a character as Duke Mantee was, to say the least. Bogart was a great actor and all you have to do is see him perform here to fully confirm it.And then, there is Fredric March. His is the other anthological role, an every-man character which very few actors would have fleshed out to the point March brilliantly does, letting the nobility in his persona coexist with his darker side, in a turn every inch worthy of that from Rouben Mamoulian's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; between him and Bogie certainly there is no room for doubt about the top-notch quality regarding the acting department.Of course, there is another core reason why Hours is a classic on its own right, and that reason is William Wyler. For a rather lesser-unusual story, it has the Wyler touch nonetheless. The distinctive cinematic theatricality of his mise-en-sc?ne helps to build the suspense up effectively, and this along with his finely attuned cast make it a memorable title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Methodical Drama with Stilted 50's Sensibilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>6 out of 10 Bogart and pals escape from prison and hide out in a suburban home. There they hold the parents and two children hostage. The father (March) quietly plots a plan and slowly takes control of the situation. The film certainly does have it's minuses. The plot is too general in nature and too sanitized. The crooks don't seem too smart or sophisticated. They never seem very menacing and seem completely out of control not only with the family, but even amongst themselves. Things seem to unravel for them at almost predictable intervals making the suspense rather minimal. They also make some glaring tactical errors. Having the family move around freely and talk amongst themselves upstairs while the bad guys 'stand guard' downstairs seems stupid. It's almost like asking them to come up with an escape plan. Bogie is one terrific actor who can be very adept at creating dark characters just catch his performance in TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE. Yet here, despite his best efforts, he comes across as being bland. This is mainly due to all the problems mentioned above. On the plus side is the fact that the film is very methodically paced and builds to a good climax. The interior of the house is well designed. The staging is excellent and allows for some good dramatic shots. The neighborhood exterior is also very detailed. March gives a powerhouse performance and his confrontations with Bogart are excellent. If you can get past the stilted 50's lingo and sensibilities then you may find that this film still has some impact. Little Ralphie is one the most endearing child characters you'll see. He is cute but very feisty and daring especially with the bad guys. If you look quickly you can also see Joe Flynn, in a very early role, as a driver of a hijacked car.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . or a polemic against America's militarized police? THE DESPERATE HOURS end thanks to Dan's revolver being registered when it's found near Hal. They also end because as far back as 1955 (when DESPERATE came out) American cops could ape the East German border guards at the Berlin Wall at the drop of a hat. Within minutes any neighborhood in the U.S. could be cordoned off and turned into a killing box, complete with Kleig lights, snipers, and machine guns. I just heard on the news today about a 95-year-old WWII hero being gunned down in his nursing home this week by a trigger-happy cop. Since HE wasn't safe, NONE of us are. One of the doomed men in THE DESPERATE HOURS is mentally retarded, and mostly wants to play with toys. Another just desires a girl; the third, a cigar. It's not hard to sympathize with this hapless have-not trio. I read that if the names of all the Americans rubbed out by the police who "protect and serve" us were inscribed somewhere, that memorial would have to be nearly SIX times as big as the Vietnam War Wall, and the needed size expands daily. Many of these snuffed names would be those of "surviving" Vietnam War heroes. So it goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doubtless a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's one of the last films of Humphrey Bogart... a true classic, directed by William Wyler in 1955. Bogey and two other prisoners escape from the Jailhouse and hide in a house. All the members of the family are their hostages. The story is simple, but the film is dramatic and the rythm never stops. Almost all the action takes place in the house, actor's faces really support the movie. We can imagine that this opus was made with a relatively small budget... Wonderfully photographed in black and white -it's the first movie made in "Vistavision"-, the film still keeps the tension 50 years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tension-Packed Hostage Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Desperate Hours" is a tense drama about the ordeal that an ordinary family goes through when their home is invaded by a group of convicts who have just escaped from prison. Their predicament and the desperation that they feel is immediately understood by audiences everywhere and this is what gives the movie so much power and potency. The family understandably feel indignant, violated and quite helpless but also recognise that they need to be resourceful and co-operative if they are to have any hope of survival.Joseph Hayes' well written screenplay was adapted from his own novel, which was in turn inspired by a real-life incident that received a great deal of press coverage in 1952. The knowledge that this type of hostage situation actually took place gives "The Desperate Hours" added credibility and despite the strict censorship standards that applied at the time, this movie undeniably still packs a powerful punch.When a group of three escaped convicts travel through a respectable suburban estate in their stolen car, their leader Glenn Griffin (Humphrey Bogart) notices one home with a child's bicycle outside its front door and decides that this is the ideal type of residence for the men to hide out in because, if the residents have children, they will obviously be easier to control. The gang members break into the house in which housewife Eleanor Hilliard (Martha Scott) is busy at work and park their car in the Hilliards' garage.Glenn, who's accompanied by his younger brother Hal (Dewey Martin) and Sam Kobish (Robert Middleton), is armed and orders Eleanor to disclose where her husband keeps his gun. Hal then takes charge of the husband's gun and Glenn forces Eleanor to make a telephone call to his girlfriend Helen Miller, to arrange for her to deliver some money to the house later that night. When Dan Hilliard (Fredric March) and his grown up daughter Cindy (Mary Murphy) return from work and ten-year-old Ralphie (Richard Eyer) returns from school, they walk into a horrific situation and all immediately become hostages.Glenn and local Deputy Sheriff Jesse Bard (Arthur Kennedy) had crossed swords in the past and because of this, Jesse is put in charge of the manhunt. Glenn tells Dan that the gang will leave as soon as his girlfriend arrives with the money. Police checks identify where Helen is and Jesse arranges for her to be followed, so that she can lead them to the convicts. These arrangements go wrong when Helen gets stopped for committing a traffic violation and the Hilliards' plight from that point on, gets progressively worse.Humphrey Bogart and Fredric March both give strong performances as two men who are polar opposites and regard each other with nothing but contempt. Bogart, as the vicious criminal, shows the level of strain he's under as he tries to evade the attentions of the police whilst also having to control not only his hostages but also his other gang members who both become unpredictable and dangerous at times. March is very believable as the conventional department store executive who's frightened by the predicament he's in and determined to protect his family at all costs. The quality of the acting by the supporting cast is also extremely good and contributes greatly to the success of this very intense and claustrophobic thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terror comes to suburbia. Never a dull moment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart's final take on a crook's role is his finest as such and in a way closes the circle that opened almost twenty years earlier as Duke Mantee in 'The Petrified Forest'. A rare opportunity for an actor to show his gathered experience and professionalism so vividly and a treat for viewers. Some doubts have always been made about him to be maybe too old for the role but I don't think so. All I see is great acting and a believable bad guy. He is smart and ruthless in his wheeling and dealing. He provokes and observes, loves to control the situations and the family. While trying to fix himself money to resume the escape his time of hiding starts to seem like a twisted analysis of what makes an ordinary family tick. A kind of family he has obviously never had and feels betrayed and angered about it. He does have a younger brother and a half-witted partner with him, but they do not connect except on the means of escaping the law. In the end I got a feeling that during the time spent in the house in his own way he has already got a small portion of the sort of freedom he always wished for. With that point of view the final fast close shot of his face is thought provoking. A flashing example on effects of Bogart's expressive face and little gestures of his that were able to make grand suggestions to the scenes.March is almost equally impressive in his ways as a man running his family gently but firmly, a total opposite to Bogart's Griffin. He can also be equally menacing in defending his home specially in the last scenes. But his urge to use violence and brutality are strictly controlled by his care for his family. That love becomes his power as well as his weakness at handling the desperate incident. During the growing tension his role becomes something like a family man version of Jekyll and Hyde, of him being forced to adapt himself some aspects of his worst enemy to overcome the situation. Just watch March's and Bogart's expressions changing to and fro as they exchange threats. One can sense signs that in other circumstances the places could in fact change rather easily in their battle of wills. Although it's the acting that most impresses me in this movie, the director's work must also be very much appreciated. Wyler has used the house and its two floors with setups, camera angles and lighting effectively to stage and express the power play and threat. The tension keeps growing up by building situation upon situation and it never lets go, even when we're elsewhere out of the house or seeing what the law enforcement is up to at the same time.An excellent crime and hostage drama that hasn't lost none of its power in 52 years. A family unit as a representative of normal society colliding with outside terror is, after all, still a very active and contemporary subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The adaptation to the screen of Joseph Hayes' play by Mr. Hayes, himself, is given an excellent treatment by William Wyler, one of the great film directors of all times. The play was claustrophobic; there is little to be done in opening it and at times it feels as though we are in the theater watching the drama unfolds. Instead of detracting from it, this atmosphere contributes to the drama we are watching.This film juxtaposes good and evil. We have the Hilliard household, which could be the set from anyone of the sitcoms of late 50s TV. There is the father figure, the decent Dan who is happily married to Eleonor and they have two children that seem to be their pride and joy.Into this house a trio of escaped convicts arrive; they are ruthless. Led by Glenn Griffin, these desperate men bring panic to the Hilliards, who become paralyzed by the harm they might encounter at the hands of the criminals.This film is a tribute to the great acting of Humphrey Bogart and Frederick March. Their characters are well defined and both actors play extremely well together. Mr. March was an accomplished actor of both the theater and the screen. Mr. Bogart holds his own against his co-star in a show of wills, unrivaled in any of the films of the 50s.The cast assembled was first rate. Under Wyler's direction they give detailed performances. Martha Scott, Arthur Kennedy, Gig Young, Dewey Martin, among others, shine in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I thought that it was a very interesting concept.....and I still do. I especially like the part where the police/FBI are observing the house in question from the attic of the neighbor's home. And, the look on Humphrey Bogart's face when his brother, Hal, expresses his discontent at where life has brought him so far.....is a 'look' only Bogie can muster. In short, this is a daring, exciting movie. It all takes place in Anywhere, U.S.A. (actually, Indianapolis) and life in suburbia would never be the same for the Hilliard crew. I highly recommend this movie. This is not the usual film that is mentioned when talking about Humphrey Bogart, but it's one of his best. It's a worthy addition to anyone's home movie collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Get out of my house!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One is left to wonder whether Harrison Ford's line in "Air Force One" was inspired by the line Fredric March gives Humphrey Bogart in their first and only pairing on the big-screen. All-though "house" is not nearly the same setting as Ford's "plane" and three escaped convicts wouldn't be a match for Gary Oldman and a dozen terrorists, that is, unless the three are headed by Bogey himself. "The Desperate Hours" was the screen icon's second to last film, his last as a tough-guy, and he still could pack quite a wallop."The Desperate Hours" (re-made in a disappointing 1990-version that was all style and no substance) is a taut and brutal thriller that still manages to leave you on the edge of your seat, half a century later. Bogart plays the bad-guy who thinks he is on top of things, until he takes the perfect middle-class suburban family for hostage and finds his plans going haywire and his world slowly unraveling. Fredric March is terrific as his nemesis, the mild-mannered father of the house who is about to get in touch with his darker sides. In the end you can't help feeling sorry for Bogey's character, yet at the same time cheering on justice. Veteran director William Wyler (Dodsworth, Mrs. Miniver, Ben-Hur) deserves all the credit in the world for his work, as does the powerhouse cast that includes the wonderful Arthur Kennedy and the talented likes of Gig Young and Martha Scott. Lesser known Robert Middleton also turns in a performance you will love to hate, as the big brutal oaf 'Kobish'. To top it all of, despite it's age, "The Desperate Hours" is surprisingly cunning and daring when it comes to it's display of violence.A definitive must-see for any film-buff and, in these CGI times, a great reminder of the fantastic experience it can be to re-discover the classics.</fullReview>

Both combine to give excellent performances in this thriller that explores three desperate men invading an upper middle class home after escaping from prison.

You feel empathy for Bogarts character and for that of his brother but ,even so, you will be rooting for the family to survive. An excellent cast adds a lot to this film. There are a few overly dramatic moments, however, they are brief.Desperate Hours will entertain you and keep you guessing. Try and see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gee, Wally, should we make a run for it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a taught noirish drama expertly directed by the master, William Wyler. Humphrey Bogart plays an escaped convict who randomly selects the home of a "typical American family" in which to hide out for a few days. Fredric March is the head of the household. The action is tense as Bogart and his two fellow escapees match wits with the family they're holding hostage. There is an atmosphere of impending doom typical of the film noir style popular at the time. The odds should be on Bogart's side - he has the guns and no one in the family can take a chance because they'd be risking the lives of the others. But Bogart's younger brother, played by Dewey Martin, senses they're not going to make it. He's right - he gets gunned down outside a diner and dies under the wheels of a truck.Frederic March gives his usual rock-solid performance as the father desperate to keep his family together. He's a business executive who's the exact opposite of Bogart's rough character, but he outwits the criminals in the end. Humphrey Bogart was dying of lung cancer at the time and looks worn out and tired throughout the film, which goes with the noirish theme. Still, he plays the part of a bad guy trying to make it out alive with great style.Martha Scott, Mary Murphy and Richard Eyer play the other members of March's family. The able cast is filled out by Arthur Kennedy. Gig Young, Whit Bissell, and Ray Collins.BTW, they filmed the movie using the same backlot house used in the "Leave it to Beaver" series. Odd to think that the ghost of Humphrey Bogart was lingering during the filming of that classic '50's sit-com. ¦^?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film puts one in mind of the kind of parts Bogey played before "The Maltese Falcon". In fact, the Glen Griffin character reminds me of Duke Mantee in "The Petrified Forest" (1936).Although a little long in the tooth at the time for the parts they played, both Bogey and Fredric March carried them off superbly. Bogey's escaped convict and March as the everyman whose family is held hostage played off of each other as only these two wily veteran actors could.Most of the other characters paled in comparison to the two leads, however, Robert Middleton as the slimy psychopathic convict and Richard Eyer as March's young son stand out. Arthur Kennedy has little to do as the cop trying to catch Bogey and Gig Young was miscast as Mary Murphy's boyfriend (too old). The obvious age difference between Bogey and Dewey Martin made it difficult to accept them as brothers.The reason Bogey came to Indianapolis in the first place was to exact revenge against the Arthur Kennedy character. This aspect was never really developed.My criticisms of this movie are minor. The film contains suspense, good direction by William Wyler and excellent performances from its two stars.

		<fullReview>THE DESPERATE HOURS is a tense, shifting melodrama concerning something terrifyingly common these days: Home Invasion. Bogart..playing the leader of a small, desperate band of fugitives, gives a performance of his customary relish and fire. Frederic March - as the father of the put upon family - matches him well, managing to project a believable mixture of fear, anger, desperation and pride. William Wylers direction is taut and moody, using the confined and limited sets to create a powerful sense of claustrophobia, and handling the few action setpieces ( most notably, the finale ), with surprisingly modern grit and pace. Beyond that, tho, HOURS is rather wan. The screenplay by J. Haynes is glib and highly predictable. With the exceptions of the two leads, the characters are cardboard and just as predictable. In fact, to modern audiences, the spoiled rotten children and the weak, inneffectual wife ( who one imagines is constantly in search of a Valium )are almost comic. Perhaps Wellman intended this as a parody of "normal american families" of the time. It's quite possible, since one begins to find oneself rooting for Bogart to escape as the film moves towards a disappointing climax. All in all..an enjoyable thriller. well made, but with a very dated and probably never existent social mileue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how movie goers in the Fifties reacted to this film, but viewing it today makes the events in the story seem pretty preposterous. Not that it didn't have it's moments of psychological drama and tense confrontation, but it seems to me that Dan Hilliard (Fredric March) and daughter Cindy (Mary Murphy) had way too much freedom to go about their normal routines without attempting to reach out for help. Granted there was the element of danger to the remaining family members, but the do nothing approach of playing along with gangster Glenn Griffin (Humphrey Bogart) and his cohorts wore thin on me as the story unfolded. Back that up with all of the unsupervised time that Ellie (Martha Scott) and son Ralph seemed to have, it just left me wondering why they didn't take advantage of all the windows and doors in their large suburban home.As an experienced con, Griffin didn't seem to have that much control over brother Hal (Dewey Martin) and the big lug Kobish (Robert Middleton). That was most evident in the back to back scenarios where each refused to give up his gun to the boss. Allowing Hal to leave was another tactical mistake, at least he could have left his weapon. For all his macho bravado, Griffin wasn't thinking very clearly.Even boyfriend Chuck managed to bother me; why take the hard line stance with the Feds when they're about to break the case? Getting to the Hilliard home before even one police car arrived also seemed to defy credibility.Credit Fredric March for rising above the source material to provide a reasonably compelling performance as the put upon Ward Cleaver stand in. Now there's a thought - with the film shot using the same exterior set as the one used in "Leave It To Beaver", wouldn't it have been great to see the Beav put one over on the Griffin's and Kobish? OK, I seem to be getting unduly harsh on "The Desperate Hours". I guess the best way to view the film is to tuck away the criticism and get caught up in the flow of the story. In his last gangster turn, Bogey's still credible as a movie tough guy, and wired about as hair trigger as Duke Mantee, Baby Face Martin and Mad Dog Earle. This was the only time he and March appeared in a film with each other, and their scenes together are stand out.</fullReview>

The title to this film says it all as we experience the pain, humiliation and desperation of a family under siege. Especially effective in the film are Bogie as the vengeance-obsessed villain and Frederic March as Dan C. Hilliard (father of the family under siege) who engage in a battle of wits.

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the stars, Bogart and March</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Desperate Hours" is a favorite of mine for two reasons, it stars Humphrey Bogart and it's set in Indianapolis, about the only film I can think of set in my home town, other than "The Magnificent Ambersons". The film has some interesting scenes but it hasn't held up as well as most of Bogart's films. The son of Daniel Hillard (Fredrick March) was irritating in the extreme and I wish the hulking con played by Robert Middleton had managed to get ahold of him. The best part of the film is the byplay between the stars, Bogart and March, two old pros.Although this production took place in California, someone did their homework because the police cars and uniforms of the Indianapolis Police Department portrayed in the film are authentic in appearance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply outstanding, genuinely suspenseful thriller about a group of escaped convicts terrorizing a suburban family as they hole up in their home. It's a game of cat-and-mouse as Dan Hilliard(Fredric March, just terrific)must find a way to keep his family safe against gruff louse Glenn(Humphrey Bogart, unshaven carrying a scowl and sneer most of the film's duration),his mild brother Hal(Dewey Martin, clearly portraying a brother whose life suffered because of the influence of his hood brother)and unhinged, unpleasant, child-like Kobish(Robert Middleton, playing him with quite a few screws loose)while they await money at Midnight from the lead hood's dame. That dame is being tailed by Deputy Sheriff Bard(Arthur Kennedy)who has a history with Glenn. Bard receives cooperation from the FBI through agent Carson(Whit Bissell). Glenn warns Dan that if he even sees coppers near the house the family gets it. Soon, though, Glenn's plans on receiving the cash from his dame at Midnight doesn't go according to plan meaning an extended amount of terror towards Dan and his family. Through it all, Dan must match wits with his captors somehow contacting the police without Glenn and his cronies knowing.The tension in this film is so thick you could cut it with a knife..gripping from the very moment Bogie begins his takeover of the home until the end when he must face the music, this film caused me to bite my nails to the quick. With a masterful director like William Wyler calling the shots behind the camera and the caliber of March as the heroic father and Bogie as the chief hood, you just can't go wrong. Gig Young has a crucial role as lawyer Chuck, Dan's daughter's boyfriend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm somewhat bemused by the amount of praise lavished on this movie by previous posters. Maybe in 1955 it came off better than it does in 2006. There's not much actually WRONG with it but when you see a name like Wyler on the credits you expect a little something extra. For me Freddie March has always been mannered, a graduate of the Paul Muni School Of Mannered Acting so I didn't expect too much from him and he didn't let me down. Bogie was excellent but then when wasn't he but even so he's just reprising his Duke Mantee, Mad Dog Earle, etc and offering nothing new and/or original to his portrayal of a hardened criminal with nothing to lose. There's a nice roster of Hollywood character actors embracing Ray Teal, Ray Collins, Whit Bissell, etc who turn up, say their lines and don't bump into the furniture. Despite a few 'outdoor' scenes this is very much an adaptation of a stage play where the intention - I didn't see the play so I can only speculate - would have been to highlight the claustrophobia and the 'opening out' has the adverse effect of diluting and neutralising the 'tension' of a family trapped in their own home by three ruthless convicts. Watchable, sure, but not more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful, entertaining thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Desperate Hours", we have Humphrey Bogart in his second-to-last film as hardened criminal Glenn Griffith, who has escaped from prison with his brother and a brute named Kobish. They happen upon the typical American family, the Hilliards, and invade their home with great brutality for a 1955 film."Man must protect his family" has become a very long-lived genre to this very day, and this movie is a fine entry in it. Fredric March's Dan Hilliard is realistic and even inspiring, in an early scene he explains to his son that he is afraid, and he's not ashamed of it. Through his dialogue and thoughtful acting, we are able to believe in Dan Hilliard as an honest everyman doing the best he can in a difficult situation, which keeps these sorts of movies from become unrealistic flights of fantasy. The pacing is very good, with nary a dull moment as the desperate hours tick by. Bogart's tremendous acting kill any chance of audience boredom, as you see his character's interesting clash between the desperate honest man and the desperate criminal. The soundtrack is almost nonexistent, rare for Hollywood in this era, but it's quite welcome, as it adds to the gritty, desperate feel of the film.This is really a very fine thriller that has stood the test of time. It may not have explosions or death-defying stunts, but the emotional conflict is what these movies are based on, and this movie has it in spades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were all rooting for Mr Hilliard and his family. A group of friends in 2014 crowded round a TV hoping 'desperately' that Mr Hilliard in 1953 could save himself and his family from the filthy and murderous criminals who had invaded their lovely sanctuary of a home. What made this such a fantastically gripping and emotional tale? The cast, the story, the cinematography? Or our modern, 'desperate' need for decency to prevail ? Yes, as we are nightly beleaguered by tales of international atrocities we must believe that the ordinary, decent (American and by extension 'civilised') family can always prevail against the forces of evil criminality. A fabulous film, totally gripping. A glimpse into awfulness redeemed by decency and courage. We love Mr. Hilliard!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Duke Mantee 20 Years Later!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Desperate Hours" is about a randomly chosen family held hostage by three escaped criminals. The Hilliard family is an upscale "Typical American Family" whose home is suddenly taken over by Glenn Griffin (Humphrey Bogart), his brother Hal (Dewey Martin) and the brutish Sam Kobish (Robert Middleton).The father Dan Hilliard (Fredric March), mother Ellie (Martha Scott), daughter Cindy (Mary Murphy) and son Ralphie (Richard Eyer) are living in fear for their lives at the hands of the convicts. It seems that Glenn Griffin is out for revenge against the cop who arrested him years earlier (Arthur Kennedy).Producer William Wyler creates a suspenseful couple of days within the Hilliard household. The family is allowed to function normally with Dan and Cindy going to work and Ralphie to school while Ellie remains at home the prisoner of the men. Cindy's boyfriend Chuck Wright (Gig Young) suspects that something is wrong. Dan is forced to comply with Griffin's demands in order to protect his family.This film is arguably the best of Bogart's later films. His character of Glenn Griffin is not unlike his portrayal of "Duke" Mantee in "The Petrified Forest" (1936) where he holds a group of people hostage in a remote diner. I believe that Spencer Tracy was originally supposed to play the March role but withdrew due to illness.Although both March and Bogart were a little too old for their respective roles the scenes between them are electric as each tries to outsmart the other. The character of the daughter Cindy is supposed to be 19 years old so you might say that Gig Young in his forties at the time, was also too old to be her boyfriend. Minor faults as the actors convincingly carry off their respective parts.Others in the cast include Alan Reed, Ray Teal, Ray Collins and Whit Bissell as various cops and Beverly Garland, Joe Flynn and Burt Mustin in smaller roles.An excellent thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Desperate Hours is directed by William Wyler and adapted by Joseph Hayes from his own novel. Loosely based on real events, it had previously been a Broadway production. It stars Humphrey Bogart, Fredric March, Martha Scott, Dewey Martin, Gig Young, Arthur Kennedy, Mary Murphy, Richard Eyer and Robert Middleton. Out of Paramount Pictures, it is the first black and white picture filmed in VistaVision with photography by Lee Garmes and music by Gail Kubik.Three escaped convicts take refuge at the suburban home of the Hilliard's, holding the family captive at gunpoint. But as the hours tick past, the three men start to come apart just as the Hilliard father begins to gain in confidence.An excellent, if a touch too long, siege drama tinted with film noir traits, The Desperate Hours asks us to feel the fear of home invasion at the hands of someone sick or desperate. To which Wyler and company achieve their aims. Most of the action operates out of one claustrophobic location, giving the picture a sweaty edge, which when coupled with the exterior shots that paint a harmonious picket fence Americana, dials us into some 1950s paranoia. The three criminals dynamic, the conflict within, is what puts the picture into the film noir arc, particularly with the leader Glenn Griffin (Bogart), who is losing his grip on all in the house by the hour. The rest is pure melodrama, but riveting and capable of having one perched on the edge of the seat.With two Best Actor Oscar winners in the cast, it's perhaps no surprise that the acting is high quality, with both Bogart (intense and moody) and March (two-fold characterisation of the father with a great transitional shift late on) reason enough to watch the film. Wyler, who also produces, has good sense for a stifling mood, and his action construction is high energised and thrilling, while to round things off the production value is mostly high. Some passages could have (and should have) been trimmed to cut the running time down to maybe an hour and half, and it does come close to being too stagy at times. However, film remains compelling throughout and it's very much a must see for fans of great classical acting and siege based dramas. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the novel, nor watched the play(I suppose for that, I might need a time-machine; I can see how this would work well at that kind of theater, though), and this is the only thing by Hayes(R.I.P.) that I've watched, so I can draw no comparisons. As far as Wyler(R.I.P.) goes, I have, of course, been taken aback by his thundering epic, Ben-Hur. This man knew how to turn a great story a grand film. And that's exactly what happens here, as well. It all starts an ordinary day, in Safe Suburbia. Suddenly, however, three men enter the house of the Hilliards, and take them hostage. They've escaped from prison, you see. And they need to stay out of sight. Not for long. Just until midnight. Then they'll never see the trio of ex-cons again. The conflict between Bogie(the last time we saw him portray bad guy), who plays tough so well you can hardly believe he took on, and accomplished, charming roles after this, and March positively lights the screen on fire. This is tense from beginning to end. It holds you in a tight grip all the way. The dialog is great, fast, clever, at times funny, and always impeccably delivered, with numerous unforgettable lines. Every character is credible, even if it is clear that the sympathy is extended to the middle-class ones, and no lower. The relationships are completely convincing, with sibling rivalry and a family where, in spite of the censorship of the time, they are individuals and don't do everything perfect or as demanded. Every performance is spot-on, including the kid. There is some sexism in this, but the women also help and aren't talked down to all the time. Early on, there is a little bit of awkward exposition, and while this is mostly rather realistic, there is a lapse or two. Very easy to forgive. There is a lot of disturbing content and occasional violence in this. I recommend this to any fan of thrillers and any of the actors. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Psychological Study of Law and Order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1950s, Hollywood was bound by the Hayes Code and the iron-clad rule that Crime Does Not Pay. There was very little wriggle room, however much the audience might want it and movie executives might want to cater to that desire. So, in pretty much every gangster film, you know who is going to win in the end. That isn't giving anything away.But that didn't keep Hollywood from giving nods to what many people wanted to see - a movie in which the audience is given some affirmation about the dangers of criminals - or of the police. It's subtle, but "The Desperate Hours" is full of those nuances.The plot is very simple - three escaped convicts, led by Humphrey Bogart, have escaped from prison, killing a guard and taking his gun in the process, and the manhunt is on. The killers need somewhere to crash for a while until they tie up some loose ends. They choose the most normal-looking suburban house they can find and take the family hostage.Given the rules of the game, we know how the film has to end. What makes a film like this stand out are the performances and the complications along the way. The performances are superb, especially Bogart and Fredric March as the hostages' family patriarch. Overall, everything is done in a very civilized manner, and the gang's fate is determined largely by their own choices.The interesting part to me, though, is the attitude displayed toward the police. They in many ways are portrayed as being as dangerous to the family as the criminals, in fact, in some ways more so. March and family have many opportunities to contact the police and get them involved, but it seems so obvious to everybody that this is a bad idea that Bogart practically dares the hostages to do so. But nobody does. Why not? There's where the film's interesting psychology comes into play - the police apparently are viewed by everybody, criminals and hostages alike, as dangerous intruders into the situation. This is displayed most pointedly toward the end, where March has to fight to maintain control of the situation to protect his family after the police get involved and, just as Bogart has warned, have set up machine guns across the street and seem insufficiently concerned about the family's fate. It is almost as if the cops are just another gang to avoid if at all possible.Things get very dicey for the hostages only because of the police involvement, because their priorities differed. The police wanted the criminals captured - the hostages simply wanted the criminals to leave. One could argue that the police were necessary to resolve the situation - but maybe not. An interesting situation, of the kind that kept gangster films interesting.Bogart displays such cool intelligence and leadership that it is easy to wonder why he wound up a criminal in the first place. If he has a weakness, it is over-confidence. Staying in the same house for so long seems like a strange choice, especially given the claustrophobic portrayal of this "normal" 1950s neighborhood, with its intrusive neighbors and nosy family friends. But traveling on the open road with everybody watching didn't seem that appealing an option, either.Crime doesn't pay! Bogart's final decision, suicide by cop, seems to sum that up. A fine film that gives an interesting look into 1950s psychology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dont be mistaken from the reviews here that this is merely a mediocre movie with fairly good acting. Or that the family in the setting is too ideal and therefore not entirely believable. Then you'd miss out on the greatness of this film. One look at the interactions between March and Bogie would dispel all of that instantly. Frederic March's acting in this film is genius - the way he conveys, just through facial expressions alone, fear for his life and family mixed with determination and an utter loathing of Bogies character is amazing. The tension is kept high throughout, and leaves you on the edge of your seat. Bogarts character is effective as he mocks the family's attempts to get out of the situation while at the same time trying to keep control of his own 'family' of disjointed crooks. Kobish is great at being at once goofish, yet still violent and smart when needed. Overall a very enjoyable flick with good performances. Not entirely surprising, however, that the ridiculously jaded attitudes of people today might look back and accuse the script of being "bland" - no doubt they'd applaud if the family's seemingly idyllic closet contained more skeletons, or perhaps have a few more violent interactions tossed in for good measure. Sorry to disappoint, but that movie, this ain't. If, however, you're looking for great story and an edge of your seat thriller starring two of the best actors of the time, see this movie instead.</fullReview>

Some criminals take over a house with an annoying family for hostage and from there it goes nowhere at all. You couldn't add any spoilers for this film because there's nothing to spoil. Because nothing actually happens!! The acting is fairly good but it's all wasted really as the poor actors have nothing to work with and just go round and around repeating themselves. So this little 'classic' just spins its wheels for nearly two aptly named desperate hours. Its worth three stars simply because it's a period piece but you spend most of your time looking at the cool cars and the clothes, your mind wandering. Humphrey Bogart does Humphrey Bogart with no surprises at all and although he's enjoyable to watch you just get bored because he's the same in just about every movie you've ever seen him in.

		<fullReview>The Desperate Hours is an early example of a 'home invasion' thriller and has clearly proved influential on more recent examples of the genre (such as Panic Room). Whilst it is a 'reasonable' film there are some quite severe flaws to this film which are difficult to overlook....The premise for this film suggests that it's going to be a tense affair between some escaped convicts and an unsuspecting family. Whilst this film does offer some tension and some menace I found that it didn't do this consistently enough. It lost points immediately for me when I started to learn that the captors were allowing family members to leave the home for varying reasons. In what world would captors allow their hostages to roam the streets willy-nilly? OK the father was on errands for Griffin so I could buy him being allowed to venture outside (just about), but the daughter seemed to disappear off out with her boyfriend and served no real benefit to the captors by being out and about. These are quite severe flaws and Bogey muttering such lines as "He won't go to the police, he's not that stupid" are all well and good at attempting to create tension and menace, but make absolutely no logical sense. Sure he always has one member of the family there as an incentive for the family not to go to the police, but why take the risk??? Home Invasion films generally have rather thin plots which don't usually necessitate a long-running time and this shows here. At around the 105 minute mark, this film is far too long and the strain starts to show towards the end - it does become repetitive and tedious at times. It's around the 90 minute mark before the police are able to track the gang down and seem to make very little effort to find them at any other time during the feature - the two strands of the film don't seem to mesh well and only really come together in the final few minutes (the finale is both silly and exciting resulting in a mixed reaction from this viewer).I also felt that the direction could have done with being a bit tighter; a more claustrophobic feel to the film would have certainly made it a little bit more intense.As far as performances go then I'm afraid it's not a great story on that front; Bogey fares the best here, but many of his co-stars and rather weak and made very little impression on the picture. His co-conspirators fall into the usual clichés; a large overbearing, clumsy oaf who challenges for leadership and a weak-willed convict who is never sure whose side he wants to be on.As an early example of the genre then this is definitely watchable and is certainly worth watching. However, the scripting issues and far-fetched plot elements do drag it down somewhat making it an OK film, but not the brilliant film that many are suggesting it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart, well established as a protagonist by the mid '50s, took a different role for "The Desperate Hours". He plays the calm but vicious leader of some thugs who hold a suburban family hostage in their house. William Wyler's drama is one film that truly knows how to make you feel as if you're one of the hostages. Moreover, Bogart's character convinces the family members who have to leave not to say anything about events in the house.As I understand it, Bogie played villains in some of his early movies while under contract to Warner Bros. It certainly comes out really well here. I should say that there is one thing that is probably going to give the movie a slightly less intense feel nowadays: it co-stars Alan Reed, who provided the voice of Fred Flintstone. But that's just a side note. Overall, this is definitely a movie that I recommend.Also starring Fredric March, Arthur Kennedy, Martha Scott, Dewey Martin, Gig Young, Mary Murphy, Richard Eyer and Robert Middleton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rude awakening for suburbia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Desperate Hours is an intelligent film that has brought fourth cerebral comments on IMDb. Moreover, it is a turning point in character study contextualised within suburbia that became a blue print for film adaptations such as A Clockwork Orange (1971) in which gang culture ravages suburban life and its automated, docile acceptance of routine.Therefore, whilst being a prism for highlighting the conservative lifestyle of suburban America, The Desperate Hours is a rude awakening of the human condition. In other words, Glenn Griffin (an adeptly accomplished role by the great Bogart) and his criminal gang on the lam rudely awaken the consciousness, and as such re-install the human which was lost to the clockwork robots of suburban families as in the example of the Hilliards.As in The Stepford Wives (1975), the suburban woman submit to being chattels, as portrayed via home-maker and wife Eleanor Hilliard (Martha Scott). Indeed Eleanor's subordinate position is highlighted when her husband Dan Hilliard (the brilliant Fredric March) informs Griffin that his wife is not Griffin's servant. Note, Hilliard doesn't say "a servant" and thusly implies that his wife is actually HIS servant. This also implies the 'ownership' of women by men, in a patriarchal family.Another commentator has suggested that Griffin is regretting his criminal lifestyle and envying the suburban secure,lifestyle of the Hilliards. Conversly, why would Griffin want Hillard's humdrum suburban lifestyle? Indeed, it is Hilliard that envies Griffin's courage to be insubordinate, albeit perhaps not the apparent immoral methods he utilises in this process. Indeed, the lacking of opportunity has culminated in a rebelliousness within the context of felony by Griffin and his cohorts, which has usurped Hilliard's perceptions and pre-conditioned comprehension of criminals propagated by the media.Perhaps Hilliard views Griffin's none-conformity to the suburban ways of the middle classes as a punishment, as opposed to any criminal act the latter has committed. Accordingly, Hilliard should be thankful for awakening his consciousness. Can this family ever be the same again? At least they should be less conformist, and at most rebellious.The Desperate Hours is a showcase of lamented talent as in Wyler for his outstanding direction, and Bogart and March for their equally brilliant leads. There is also some resplendent turns by the supporting cast with particular mention to Walter Baldwin (the refuse collector) for his convincing portrayal of the frightened 'everyday man' of suburbia. Special mention should also go to Robert Middleton in the part of psychopathic murderer,Sam Kobish.The Desperate Hours is deeply intense, and intelligently realised and brought to fruition by all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Desperate Hours (1955) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good "home invasion" film with Humphrey Bogart as one of a group of escaped convicts hiding out in the home of respectable family man Fredric March and terrorizing his family. The greatest asset has to be the strong performances and interaction from the leading men; March and Bogie bubble up some great chemistry together as they match wits and lock horns throughout the course of the picture.Also features fine direction from William Wyler as well (who blessed us with what I consider to be one of the best-directed films ever, 1959's BEN-HUR).***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and thrilling film, but not a Bogart classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart as a villain. A very convincing one, too. But his character's complexity, depth, and unpredictability, that is synonymous with Bogart's classic hero (c.f. The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca) is absolutely lacking in this film. Glenn Griffin (Bogart) suffers no personal crisis; he has no arch, and that is what the audience was expecting. Instead, we see a flat character who is even more simple and one-track-minded than Roy "Mad Dog" Earle of High Sierra, and resembles one of Bogart's earlier villainous roles he played in the 30's.Dan Hilliard (Fredric March) is compelling and, at times, brave, He evokes sympathy, in desperately trying to protect his family: a wife, a daughter, and a son. They are, respectively, predictable, dull, and annoying. Even though "the guns are loaded with real bullets," as Hilliard explains to his son, and even though they only have several "desperate hours" to go, they all try hard to enrage the criminals and endanger their own lives.Of course, this film has a message, which is very similar to the one often expressed in Dragnet. And just as the latter, it is unrealistic, propagandist, and wholly unsupported by the general viewer: just because the main character is a criminal who has invaded home of a peaceful family, we will not automatically distant ourself from him and identify with the police. In fact, I wonder if ANYONE AT ALL found himself/herself having any positive regard for the police. If it were not for superb acting (Bogart, March) the film would have been lost in time. The two drag the script behind them as they strive to escape their limited heroes, as well as the boring, predictable, and highly didactic plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart overacts, March underplays, rest of cast succeeds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a definite 50's time-capsule. A cross between the Cleavers meet Capt. Quegg. Bogart is TOO old for the part and overacts in places that makes you unintentionally laugh! March just underplays and it's never explained what his relationship to Bogart was once. The rest of the cast succeeds especially the actress playing the daughter and Arthur Kennedy as the cop Bogart wants dead. I would have enjoyed the climax focusing on Bogart and Kennedy's relationship, but March had to be the hero.This film rates higher just for the climax on the front lawn. I found myself rewinding the tape three times just to take in the powerful image of the flood lights and low angle of the camera. Bogart definitely makes up for overacting in those last two minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Desperate Hours" first introduces a typical 1950s nuclear family before their home is invaded by three gangsters hiding from the police. From there the film chronicles the tensions in the invaded home and the police search to find the gangsters.Humphrey Bogart reprises his role as "tough guy" with his usual skill as the leader of the gangsters. Federic March's talents aren't on display as often as the father of the family, but his performance near the end talking to the sheriff and entering the house was excellent. Robert Middleton developed an interesting character in the feebleminded and boorish Sam Kobish and the supporting performances are fine as well.This film does have some moments of tension and it is effective in developing a sense of paranoia amongst the gangsters near the end. The story on the whole is nothing profound, though, and makes this a less than interesting crime thriller. However, the ending is very well-developed with tension and the final moments with Bogart and March were gripping. Personally I found "The Petrified Forest" (1936) to be a much more interesting iteration of the "hostage situation" style of film with Bogart as a gangster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many coincidences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too many coincidences and too many nosy and suspicious people in this pot boiler. It gets so ridiculous that the viewer can expect anything to happen. Good performances by the cast. The ending is just as incongruous as the rest of the picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Desperate Hours: a title and a film suggesting a condition quintessential to existence. This film is essentially about class distinctions and the burdens that accompany each social stratum. Wyler belatedly begins his interest in the common man in this noir-ish thriller, The Desperate Hours. However, Wyler does not completely renounce his previous bourgeois subject; rather, The Desperate Hours interestingly merges both white and blue collar characters in a psychological battle of wills. The two main characters Dan C. Hillard played by Fredric March and Glenn Griffin played by Humphrey Bogart are the presiding representatives of their class. Whereas the characters are introduced as strict representations of good and evil, their interaction with each other creates enough friction to shatter conventional character molds. The hours of desperation begin when Griffin takes refuge at Hillard's house and forces his family under house arrest after escaping from prison. While Griffin and his two other inmate fugitives have found a haven from the police, they provide little refuge only duress for Hillard and his family. However, Griffin's primary goal is not misogyny, rather money for escape. Anxiety begins for the Hillard family when Griffin trespasses upon their house, and thereafter only accentuates for everyone when the money sent by Griffin's girlfriend is impeded. Interestingly Wyler reveals that this kidnapping was not a product of mere fate. Hillard and Griffin acknowledge a past, personal relationship, yet Wyler withholds revealing their history and or the specific crimes committed by Griffin. These omissions of plot details suggest that the film is ultimately about the character struggle between Hillard and Griffin. The environment of desperation first debilitates the father and then the escapee, Griffin. While the father is reduced to submission in his own house, Griffin loses his will to dictate arbitration when his options are limited by an encroaching police force. The Desperate Hours differs from most thrillers by giving the leading man only one scene to demonstrate his emotion strength as protagonist and patriarch. While previous films have blurred emotional desperation with righteousness, few films have expressed the similarities between the good and bad pathos. Each character perceives the other as invasive and proceeds to out-smart the other. While this battle could potentially end peacefully as Bogart first promise, Wyler early on indicates that this battle will only result in tragedy. The threat of capture for Griffin and the desire for escape for March without an obvious end in sight strangles compromise and composure of these characters. Both characters despise each other, yet they reach that conclusion from using differing paths of rationale.Hillard's lucid articulation of hate towards Griffin only further confuses the role of the protagonist. Even without Hillard's misanthropic actions, Griffin seems less villainous than a typical Anthony G. Robinson character. While Griffin kidnapped and threatened the Hillard family, he never physically abused or stole from them. His reasons (albeit which are not expressly stated in the film) for using Hillard's home for a safe house seem justified as if Hillard had unduly betrayed Griffin in the past. Furthermore, Griffin refuses money Hillard attempts to give him as if he considered it bribery. Even when Griffin accepts some money he chivalrously bequeaths it to his fellow inmate brother (Dewey Martin) attempting to make a break-for-it. Unlike the tough-guy roles Bogart played in the past, Griffin is demanding, yet also weak and fearful. Despite these weak character traits, Griffin proudly states the rules of the house and the requisite punishments for violations. Griffin only on one occasion reneges on his word, yet he defends his dishonesty by citing the fallacies and lapses of integrity of his counterpart, the upper-class. Finally, The Desperate Hours uses Humphrey Bogart's star power to confuse the viewer's own moral obligation. The viewer almost has an intuitive response to support Bogart's interest. Besides the later Treasure of Sierra Madre, Bogart had only previous appeared as the tough guy protagonist instead of the antagonist. Bogart's screen familiarity and the lesser-known Fredric March progresses this film into a film-noir direction with the viewer siding with villain, yet Griffin never reaches the anti-hero status of Wilder's Walter Neff in Double Indemnity. In fact, Wyler deviates from typical film-noir tendencies by focusing on the protagonist (family) narrative rather than the prison-escape narrative. The film begins and concludes with the family narrative, while additionally exploring a few more family subplots. Moreover, the film does not glorify or sympathize with the criminal. As previously stated, this film is essentially about class distinction with the criminal representing the lower-class and the family man representing the upper class. However, Wyler does not forward any more insight into the nature of class beyond this simple categorization. The film is littered with remarks about economic subjugation, yet the film does not explore or reveal the past grievances of discrimination against Bogart's character; therefore, one is left without a historical foundation for warranting his exoneration. Without a record of harmful societal discretions against Griffin's class, one is unable to drawl a more present or significant meaning from the conclusion of the movie. Moreover, the film does not deviate from Hollywood interpretations of society- i.e. good versus evil with good prevailing in the end. Without a prior narrative to support the characters' motivations, the actors compensate the truthfulness with their performance. The film ultimately proves to be a classic story about family values and the role of the patriarch. Nevertheless, whereas the film fails to provide the audience with a more connotative meaning, the film does deliver good performances. The Desperate Hours through Wyler's direction may be perceived as a film concerned with more than just patriarchal society. Since the film revolves mostly around the characters, the film eventually becomes about the solidification of family ties not class distinctions. Ultimately the film chronicles the two main characters' ability to cope within a stressful environment. Eventually, this controlled experiment ends and yields to the pressures of the outside environment.</fullReview>
