		<shortDescription>Gleefully Over-the-Top and Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review In One Breath: A man who can control people's minds (as long as they are within his line of vision) encounters a person who is immune to his powers. After an unfortunate death, they square off against each other. Within the opening 15 minutes you'll know that this one is gonna be crazy. Realism is not a priority, which means that this roller-coaster ride aims simply and solely to entertain. The premise allows for some very unique sequences that are refreshingly different, shocking, and damn exciting. The psychic's victims move in a slow, methodical, creepy manner that creates an ominous mood.I'm quickly becoming a fan of Dong-won Gang, who starred in "Woochi", "M", "Secret Reunion" and a few other films. Here he plays the villain with panache and charisma. The scriptwriting in "Haunters" could have added more character development, but it's still a lot of fun to watch. My favorite scenes are the car chase and the office balcony sequences. The premise itself is fascinating and the film did a good job in terms of executing some thrilling interaction between the protagonist and antagonist, which does get over-the-top at times but is charming so.Some have complained that the origins of the characters' special abilities were not explained, but what kind of ridiculous explanation should we expect? Another generic biological mutation that we see in superhero movies? Sometimes it's better just to leave the exposition alone because any attempt at a scientific explanation would be flat out preposterous anyways. I think it's best to approach this film like one would approach those old school Hong Kong action flicks that throw logic into the wind while focusing on pure entertainment. Sit back with a cappuccino and relax. You'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of superhero movie- but a riveting watch nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superheroes don't always need to come in the form of Marvel or DC Comics characters; rather, they can just be everyday individuals with special powers living regular lives. Perhaps one of the best films to expound on this was M.Night Shyamalan's "Unbreakable", a story of two individuals coming to terms with who and what they are, as well as their place in the world relative to each other.Kim Min-suk's feature debut owes more to Shyamalan's "Unbreakable" than it does to the superhero Marvel or DC Comics blockbusters. It grounds its two characters- one the hero, and the other the villain- in commonplace circumstances, and thereby injecting a healthy dose of realism into the movie. On one end is Kyu Nam (Ko Soo), a former scrapyard worker turned pawnshop manager; and on the other, Cho (Kang Dong Won), a disturbed young man with a troubled childhood and innate mind control abilities.The alternative English title for this movie is "Psychic" and it is Cho that this title is referring to. In the film's opening scene, a young Cho is seen blindfolded while his father berates his mother for letting their child live- until the blindfold slips and his father kills himself by snapping his own neck backwards. His mother tries to kill him upon witnessing his terrifying powers, but fails. Twenty years later, Cho gets by through robbing pawnshops while making everyone else around 'freeze' as if time had stopped.Kyu Nam however turns out to be immune to Cho's psychic abilities, and when he tries to stop Cho from robbing his boss' pawnshop, Cho responds by killing his boss in a particularly gruesome manner. Just like that, Min-suk sets up the feud between Kyu Nam and Cho at the centre of the movie. It is their conflict that drives the rest of the narrative, as both of them are pushed to understand their place opposite each other.Through Kyu Nam, Cho discovers a newfound fallibility to his apparent invincibility; while through Cho, Kyu Nam discovers a greater sense of purpose as the counterbalance to Cho's heinous ways. The showdowns between the two are inevitable, and Min-suk stages a few thrilling exchanges- in particular, one of them that takes place in a crowded subway station is especially gripping to watch.Cho's blatant disregard for human life however may be disturbing to some, especially since some of his victims tend to meet their deadly fates a little too casually for comfort. The only levity the film provides is in the form of Kyu Nam's buddies- one from Ghana, and the other from Turkey, both of whom can speak perfect Korean. Their banter with the simple Kyu Nam provides some much-needed comic relief in a movie that can turn deadly serious very quickly.Both Ko Soo and Kang Dong Won turn in compelling performances, even though one may naturally prefer Ko Soo's more empathetic one. He makes his character's apprehension felt keenly, especially when Min-suk clearly sets him up as being mismatched against Cho's superpowers. On the other hand, Dong Won cuts a chilling presence as the villain, giving his character an intensity that you can't quite help but be enraptured by.Those expecting some form of answers as to the origin of Cho's abilities, or Kyu Nam's, should however be prepared to be disappointed. Min-suk offers none, preferring that his audience accept it as part of the nature of mankind and the inherent differences between individuals. This is only Min-suk's second movie, the first as a co-writer on Kim Jee-woon's kimchi western, The Good the Bad the Weird, and it proves his strengths as a helmer. Gripping and never for one second less than interesting, "Haunters" is one unique Korean movie you shouldn't miss.- www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The description of this movie alone convinced me to watch it, and the cover said it was better than any superhero film, and I'd say they weren't far off.It reflects a very Korean style; kind of unsure about what genre it wants to be, switching between drama and comedy, but having just enough character development to have you care about the important characters but not explaining anything you don't need to know, held up by great actors.There's some very memorable scenes in this film, and some very memorable performances, along side a great story, similar in some ways to American films like Unbreakable and Chronicle. The score to the film was also good, and quite fitting, while not necessarily memorable.Overall I give the movie 8/10 and recommend it to anyone wanting to see a semi-dramatic movie with many entertaining, exciting, superheroesque themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your usual super-hero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HAUNTERS is an original take on the superhero movie. No capes, daft aerials, or superman latex costumes (why do superheroes always look and sound a bit gay?) Instead we have two young kids from the streets of South Korea. Both have a limp and both have the strange power to control other people's minds on sight. Cho-in is the bad guy, polishing his powers to live a comfortable lifestyle. Kyu-nam is the good guy, championing honesty and friendship in the face of Cho-in's merciless killing and avarice. From this simple idea, writer-director Min-suk Kim builds an intelligent, fast-paced thriller that keeps the audience wondering where it will go next. Although I wasn't entirely won over, I enjoyed it much more than the high budget but rather predicable niche into which Marvel comic super-heroes have fallen. With its fine South Korean pedigree, Haunters makes sure than people suffer realistically when they die and that blood never looks like strawberry jam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Korean Sort-of Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cho-In (Gang Dong-won) has a remarkable ability: he can control the actions of anybody that he can see, up to and including large crowds. He has no friends, or family for that matter ? in fact, as a child he forced his father to kill himself and almost killed his mother too ? but he doesn't need people, except to have them do his bidding such as giving him all the money at a place of business. He has no fear, because nobody ever remembers him or what happened when he had control over them. Kyu-nam (Ko Soo), on the other hand, has supernatural powers of healing, which he needs as he seems to get into physical jeopardy fairly often. He and his two friends Bubba and Al, from Ghana and Turkey respectively, live life joyously although they are poor and work in a junkyard. After an accident, Kyu-nam is fired, but finds himself a new job in a family-run pawn shop, a place he very much likes. That is, until Cho-In comes along to take money from the old man who runs the place; and Cho-In is himself in for a shock when he discovers Kyu-nam, who turns out to be the one person Cho-In cannot control with his mind. As these two characters interact, the deadly body count starts rising, and it seems there's no way to stop more carnage, for Cho-In is determined to erase Kyu-nam from existence, seeing him as a threat, and Kyu-nam is damn near indestructible....This is one of those wonderful Korean movies that has a bit of everything: it's really funny, really sad, full of horrific deaths and full of loving exchanges. Oh, and it tells a really good anti-superhero tale, too. One thing I've rarely if ever seen in Korean films is non-Korean (or non-Asian) actors, so it was a special treat to see a Black man from Ghana and a Caucasian from Turkey ? unfortunately, I couldn't discover the actors' names, but they were both excellent sidekicks. But the show belongs to Ko Soo and Gang Dong-won, as two men with inexplicable abilities doomed to be enemies to the death; recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark yin-yan superhero story ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HAUNTERS is vaguely reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's UNBREAKABLE insofar as we have an unlikely blue-collar superhero fighting a sociopathic arch-nemesis. After that the comparisons begin to break down. But like me, there may be some who will find themselves constantly reminded of UNBREAKABLE as they watch this excellent South Korean film. Cho-in (Dong-won Kang) is a reclusive man born with a powerful telepathy that allows him to control the actions of anyone within his field of vision. Parental rejection and a lonely life of petty theft has left him sociopathic. This is bad news for the one man who can stop him. Following a serious accident, Gyoo-nam (Ko Soo) discovers he has regenerative powers and soon thereafter learns that he is the only person not susceptible to Cho-in's dark telepathy. The game of cat-and-mouse that ensues results in a macabre body count of innocent bystanders possibly unlike any superhero film you've yet seen. South Korean films often contain an inherently maudlin quality (referred to as "han") that Western audiences sometimes find icy and distancing, but it reflects the sensibilities of a country whose national identity is one of constant heart-ache and profound loss. This is certainly true of HAUNTERS as Ko Soo's character, Gyoo-nam finds somewhere within himself the strength and will to get up and keep going after being traumatised and knocked down time and again. Watch this with an open mind and it will stay with you long after the end credits have rolled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not what one expects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haunters is a film for people who love offbeat characters and stories. One part M. Nights Unbreakable, a dash of Zebraman, yet unique enough to be its own take on the superhero genre.Look elsewhere for a summery of story and characters, but know that nothing can prepare you for the cerebral conveyance of mood and style. Its goofy, tragic, meaningful, and absurd.Haunters stacks several memorable scenes together, and while characters backgrounds are not fully developed, I could not help but care for them, their motives and fates. All but the antagonist reminded me of friends. The villain's motives are not without merit, but his crimes can not be rationalized or redeemed.A couple themes revolve over and over - Why does one chase fate (?), and are others responsible for our own actions? Do we convince ourselves that others make us act and feel a certain way?Advice I got long ago when painting is always make the corners interesting, and acknowledge the outside edges. Haunters' opening and closing are both memorable, and bookend nicely (something about emergence from restraint?). Presentation, design, look, and feel - this film is well considered with emotional and sensory depth.Way above average 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique Take on the Super Hero Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best original super hero movies I have ever seen. Excellent from start to finish. This was made like a Origin story, and the two main roles played their parts to perfection. First you get a bit of a origin on the nemesis of the film. Then you meet Kyu-Nam, the quirky but lovable hero of the film. Kyu-Nam is backed up by his two best friends, and their relationship is incredibly memorable and cute. To me, this felt a bit like the American film Unbreakable. The film had a few minor issues, but they couldn't take away from the charm. Fans of superhero films will love this. Also, other reviews speak of the two main roles having the same powers, but their powers aren't even close to similar. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>kind of like a different version of that Bruce Willis movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unbreakable - that was the movie. Kind of like that understated, more realistic view of how people with super powers deals with their 'gift'.The thing I find about Korean movies is, each is so focus on what each one wants to be, wants to tell, in such specific ways. You can say, the confidence is never an issue. It's overflowing in fact. And never murky who is good, who is bad. It's almost always entertainment. Unlike too many Hollywood these days, either over the top action, or too thought provokingly murky. No middle ground, no thriller any more.This is no exception. 2 guys, one can control minds, the other basically heals himself endlessly. One good, one bad. And there are at least 3 memorable scenes. One at the money shop, one at the subway, one during the end game.The comic relief is just a tad too obvious and see it coming. There are a few transitions moments with some information left out .. as in how did the plot get from here to there. Otherwise, I'm good with the way it holds up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly waste of effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great start, good concept, good ideas, good looks, good production values, some nice scenes... All totally wasted because of a deeply stupid plot and a very bad script. Haunters looks very pale and small compared to its clear reference, Shyamalan's Unbreakable.Here we have a similar powerful and unaware hero whose main strategy seems to be getting mad and yelling at the bad guy for him to stop being a bad ass at once. Really. Moreover, he doesn't seem to quite understand that the bad guy can control other people and make them do whatever he wants. So our smart hero keeps confronting him openly and always around many people, never armed and never with the slightest shadow of a plan.The bad guy, in turn, doesn't seem to understand that he can kill the hero very easily at any moment if he calms down for a moment and thinks a little bit. Or just leave to another country, for god sake. He has the power to control everybody and he can get all the money and anything he wants.It would take some time to go through all the plot holes, inconsistencies and silly moments of this wreck but is not worth my time or yours.Watch it at your own risk and with some warnings: don't expect any of the characters (much less the main ones) to make any sense on their actions. Also, be aware that the plot is thin as paper and just keeps repeating itself for most part of the movie.Could have been good, but is not. And no, "the special korean way of film-making" is not an excuse. If you want solid, top notch korean cinema, try Oldeuboi for instance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst, but that's about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haunters is an action-movie with a weak plot, which tries to profit from his unusual story. It's all about two men, from which one (Kyu-nam) is frequently brought to the brink of death and for no reason always recovers. You never get an explanation for his ability to survive bullet shots, broken heads and falling from tower buildings. Apparently Kyu-nam has no supernatural powers to make him almost invincible, but no one seemed to care about such "details". Cho-in on the other side is a weakling, who's only ability consists of being capable to control other people. At one point, he starts seeing things in a blur and seems confused and weakened. Again, we get no explanation for this. So, apart from such action scenes and many dead people that movie hasn't much to offer. I wouldn't call it a total waste of time, but it's not even average entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are these two characters in conflict and why should we care?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of the film has a young man with the power to manipulate people as if they were puppets with his eyes coming into conflict with another young man with miraculous healing properties that some how makes him immune from control. The conflict starts when an attempt by the villain to get money from the pawn shop where our hero works goes wrong. The remaining 90 minutes of screen time is a chase that really doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.With plot holes you could drop a planet through, illogical moves that defy rational thought and lack of excitement that is amazing, this film is a well made stinker.Yes it looks good...Yes it has a few sequences that are great (The 1991 opening for example)......but there is no real reason for the conflict. Worse we have a hero who's almost every move causes some one to die or get hurt.I can't think of a reason for any of it to happen...especially as it goes down here.I like the look, I like the ideas, I hate the script.I'm really torn about whether to rip this film apart or not- hence the lack of plot details... but I don't have the time to truly rip this films logic and get to bed at a reasonable hour.Besides I don't think you'll be foolish like me and buy a 30 buck import of the film- odds are you'll pay say 10 bucks and see it in a theater and maybe walk out... I stupidly stayed to the bitter end.</fullReview>
